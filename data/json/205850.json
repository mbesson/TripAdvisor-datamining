Before I travelled to Rome I had contacted the hotel by email for advice on transport from the airport and also restaurant recommendations and was pleasantly surprised that the replies were very prompt. Incidentally the hotel arranged a prestige taxi costing 55 euro and you are met at the airport by the driver. As our flight didn't arrive until 1900 we didn't want to use slower public transport so we used this facility. Our room was a deluxe double and was very nice and very clean. It faced onto the street, which at first concerned me because of potential noise issues,but was very quiet. In fact the area around the hotel is very quiet which is a definite bonus. The only negative thing about the room and this is very picky was that the mattress on the bed was hard and the shower is in the bath and was just adequate. However they are only minor issues and didn't put me of the hotel. Staff at the hotel were very pleasant especially the concierge who was most helpful with any questions we had. As other people have mentioned the location was excellent for accessing Rome by foot and really enjoyed the area the Dei Mellini is in.

Some have reviewed that it's location is not so great. I don't actually know where they have got this from. I walked everywhere from the hotel only using the metro once when I went to Termini on my way back to the airport. The Vatican is about a 15 minute walk at a leisurely pace and the Colloseum being the furthest attraction, but even then it only took about 40 minutes and as Rome is such a lovely place to walk around with it's old architecture cobbled streets, it was nice. When visiting the Colloseum you could even plan it so that you take in other sights along the way. I started at the Pantheon, then Piazzo Navona and then Campo de foiri before heading onto the Colloseum and apparently the Colloseum is better visited in the afternoon as there is less queuing then (I was informed by some brits who lived and worked in Rome). STAFF: Staff were very good. Service was always with a smile. Reception very helpful and always done what they could should you need to ask for anything. No negatives whatsoever. ROOM/HOTEL: Unfortunately this is where the few drawbacks are. First off the rooms were kept very clean so this was not an issue. I paid for a superior double which turned out to be a very small room with a bad view (a brick wall) and just a single shower, no bath. because of the location of the room, i had to have lights on at all times of the day when in the room, there really was no sunlight. The bed was very large and also very firm so if that's your thing, happy days but i found it a little too firm. The hotel does have a roof terrace but no bar there which I assumed from what I read in the hotel write up and it doesn't exactly look like it does in the photos. FOOD: The breakfast was of a continental affair with the addition of some bacon and scrambled eggs. As i knew it was mainly continental when I booked, it wasn't a problem for me but for those that wish to have the type of breakfast you would find at resorts, this could possibly be a drawback. Saying that, the food that was on offer was always stocked up and the breakfast room always very well attended. It really is unfortunate about the few drawbacks and because of those that I mentioned, I'm sorry to say that I'd have to say it was a good 3 star hotel and not the four that it currently holds. Really is a shame because all in all, it is a very nice hotel but I just think it lacks that little extra to make it a solid four star.

Situated in a fairly quiet location just on the Vatican City side of the River this is an excellent base to explore the many must see sights around Rome. The welcome on arrival was very friendly and we were immediately given a map with key locations marked including Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain & Piazza Navona. We had opted for a junior suite, which was on the 5th floor just below the rooftop terrace & gym. Spacious & comfortable throughout, the little touches made this hotel stand out from others we have stayed in, including turning the bed down each evening, excellent housekeeping and even more of a surprise was the complimentary bottle of Prosecco provided on my birthday.

We would recommend that you cover Rome on foot as there is so much to see everywhere you go. From the hotel its only a 15 - 30 minute walk to most of the major sights, including the exceptional Vatican City, Spanish Steps (beware of the Indian men offering the women a rose - it isn't free, instead they follow this up with quite an intimidating hard sell to get money from you), Trevi Fountain, Pantheon & Colosseum. Also make sure you get away from the hustle & bustle for the afternoon & make your way to Villa Borghese, a beautiful & tranquil park which includes a zoo. There are restaurants close to the hotel.

I had been dreading my dental problem spoiling our holiday but by lunchtime it was as if nothing had happened. Dei Mellini is just a stroll away from St Peter's Square and across the river all the major attractions are within walking distance, although some may prefer to catch the 87 bus to go as far as the Colloseum. The hotel is in a quiet area but in all the surounding streets are cafes, restaurants and shops. Having the Carabinieri office on the same street is reassuring, not that we ever felt threatened in Rome. The room was cool, clean, well decorated and the bed large and firm. The bathroom had bath, shower over, wash basin, loo and bidet...not much else needed. A regular supply of clean, soft towels and soaps etc meant we never had to \"chase\" for anything.

On the whole we found the hotel to be excellent value for money and should we return to Rome (my coins are in the Trevi Fountain so here's hoping) we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel with comfortable room!\u201d", "Author": "Lockemup1", "ReviewID": "UR102684190", "Content": "The Dei Mellini Hotel is certainly one of the more comfortable hotels that we have stayed in.

Breakfast is sufficient to get the day started, but do not expect bacon and eggs. The only thing missing was tea/coffee making facilities, which is a 'nice to have'. The hotel is well positioned, with the Vatican within walking distance and the other attractions not too far away. If you are spending at least 3 days in Rome, a travel card for the metro and buses is well worth the price. The metro has 2 main lines so will not be confusing. If you are flying to Rome Caimpino airport, do not use the Terravision bus service. It maybe cheap, but they are so dis-organised. The queues were so long that by the time we got to our hotel we were totally exhausted. Going back was even worse. Pick up a white taxi. their fares are around 35 euro to Rome hotels - but ask before you get in their cabs. There are some 'sharks' about.

Firstly a quick hint. The Hotel is just 5 minutes (if that) walk from the Piazza Cavour. Why is this important you may ask. well the Airport 'Skybus' has a stop in the Piazza Cavour and is Eight Euro's for a dingle to & from the airport. This is much closer than the Airport Express Train & Metro Combo if you are using public transport and nearly half the price (15 Euros for Train Metro & a longer walk at the end). So onto the hotel. Check staff were very friendly and helpful with Map's and local bus routes for the popular tourist attractions. Room was great, nice & clean with a good shower. Wardrobe / Drawer space was fine for the weekend, there was a hairdryer and safe and a well stocked, if slightly costly minibar). Breakfast was continental or you could pay for cooked. We stuck with the continental and there were plenty of options including cereal, yoghurt, fruit, rolls with ham/cheese and also some yummy pastries. All well stocked and looked after by a team of 3 or 4 table staff. Location. We didn't know much about Rome before we left. In a nut shell you've got the Tiber River running North South slightly to the left of centre. To the West of the Tiber is The Vatican with St Peters square etc and to the south you have Colloseum and 'Old Rome' is pretty much between the two. The Dei Mellini is closer to The Vatican, just west of the river - about 20 minutes walk to St Peters / Vatican Museum and is within 25 minutes of the Spanish Steps. So, if you know Rome this should give you a good idea. For us it was just fine as we bought a Roma Pass and could jump on the bus to the further away places then walk back to hotel stopping at places of interest on the way back. All in all a great stay in a great hotel. The team at the Dei Mellini also let us print our boarding cards for the return flight and arranged a late check-out on our room.

Upon arrival we were checked in by a very friendly and helpful young gentleman and had our bags carried up to our rooms. Both suites were very spacious and we even had a complimentary bottle of champagne and bowl of different fruits in each room which we found to be a really nice addition. The breakfast was ok but nothing exciting. Just your average continental italian breakfast. The hotel recommended eating at a lovely restaurant called 'Vitos' just down the road from the hotel. However quite expensive, the food is really good and we ended up going back on the second night of our stay due to the food been so wonderful so would recommend this restaurant if you go to Rome. Room service and the hotel bar are expensive however most of the bars or restaurants in Rome are expensive so this is just typical for Italy. Our rooms at the hotel were cleaned every day and our bed sheets changed every day which again was a nice addition. The hotel rooms we had even had a minibar which had a wide variety of alcoholic and not alcoholic beverages which are kept chilled and refreshing after a long day sightseeing! The hotel is situated about a 15 minute walk to the Vatican and about 15 minute walk to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain however if your wanting to visit the Colosseum i suggest you do what we did and buy 24 hour tickets for the 'City Sightseeing Buses' where you can get off and on as you please all day. Overall, if your thinking about booking to stay at this hotel i would highly recommend it!

The only person that did a little more than the absolte minimum of service was the technician rebooting my internet connection since it did not work in the first place.

To ad injury to insult, when ordering a taxi via the hotel one has to be aware that the hotel is cashing in as well on the fare. I was aware of this, but if you have luggage and you need a taxi early in the morning, that`s the opportunity you are left with. Before i checked out i made sure to call a taxi by myself. While i was in the bathroom for a minute, the concierge was already trying to make a deal with the taxi driver hoping to get some extra cash. That`s what the taxi driver told me when we drove of.

I just want to qualify this review by saying that we travel for business over 90 nights a year and spend a lot of time in hotels. We usually don't take the time to write reviews unless its \"outstanding\" one way or another. The Dei Mellini hotel was a truly wonderful experience for us! From the street, the Dei Mellini is a quite little boutique hotel in the Prati district of Rome that you have to be looking for to find. What a bonus this turned out to be! While just slightly off of the very busy and noisy main streets this sophisticated little hotel is perfectly located in between the Vatican area and the touristy area of the Spanish Steps, Borghese Gardens, Piazza Nuovono. About a fifteen minute walk in any direction will land you at one of these sites. We had been forewarned that room sizes in Europe were significantly smaller than those in the US so we were prepared for tiny. When we walked into our room we were surprised at the spacious (not huge) and well appointed room with a huge bathroom all decked out in marble. The bed was super comfortable and the bedding was luxurious. The little touches in the room like slippers, a refrigerator and a welcome fruit plate were very appreciated. Nightly turn down service was a nice touch! More importantly, the staff of the Dei Mellini was friendly, went out of their way to be helpful and recognized us by name after only one day. A very special Thank You to Marco the bartender who continually took time to answer all our questions about Rome and was happy to recommend local restaurants and gelato places that were amazing and frequented by the locals. There were just two small things that could be considered negative. The air conditioning for the building was shut down on October 1st and Rome happened to be quite warm while we were there. Our window faced an inside courtyard that was used by all of the hotels smokers. Our choice was a warm room or a smoky room. Fortunately, evenings cooled off and the smokers went to bed early so it didn't impact us too terribly. Second, we felt that the breakfast (which was not included in our rate) was a little pricey at 20 EU per person. We opted to frequent the little coffee/pastry shop across the street for about 4 EU a person. I can't say enough about the location! We were all over the city and took several prearranged tours where we were able to chat about our accommodations with fellow travelers. While not convenient to Termini Train Station (and most of our trip was by rail through Italy) it was worth the cab fare to stay at the Dei Mellini. The area was safe, with a police station just down the block and well lit. The area was busy but not chaotic. There were many wonderful restaurants and a grocery store within a four block radius. We have no problem highly recommending this hotel to future travelers! On a side note, two other recommendations not related to the Dei Mellini. First, We used romecab.com to transfer from the airport. OUTSTANDING and reasonable! We were met by a driver with our name on a sign and escorted to his Mercedes Benz cab. He had us at our hotel in just 40 minutes and it only cost 45 EU. Well worth it after an overnight flight! Second, The best time to visit the Vatican is early Sunday Morning. We arrived in Saint Marks Square at 8:00 a.m. and it was us and literally a handful of people. We attended mass at one of the side altars in English and then roamed the church without crowds. The day before, we were standing 20 deep in front of Michaelangelos Pieata. What a gift to see it on Sunday morning with no one else there.

It was a bit soul-less and maybe a few picture or two on the wall would've helped, it was just very plain for a 4 star hotel. We also found that sometimes we were treated like we were being a bit of an inconvenience (however this was only by the one member of staff on the reception desk and whilst we know it was nothing personal, it can be a bit off-putting to be served by someone with a bit of a \"I'm way too cool to be doing this job\" attitude).

All of the the Rome attractions are within walking distance, but overall we didn't like the location -- it was too quiet and residental, which may appeal to some people.

We booked the Mellini for our party of 14. As a family we traveled to Rome for three nights and then took a 12 day cruise to various ports in the Med. I spent much time researching hotels for this trip and wanted an upscale stay at a resoanble price point. For many of my family it was their first trip to Europe so I wanted to insure a comfortable stay. The Mellini did not disapoint any of us! In fact we liked it so much we cancelled our hotel near the airport for our last night in Rome and retuned to stay at the Mellini. The hotel itself is just as the hotel's website pictures portray it! The lobby is sone in various kinds of Italian Marble and offers a small bar area on one side and a sitting area on the other. The breakfast room is located off the front desk and open s into the courtyard should you wish to dine outside. Each morning the included breakfast conasited of fresh rolls, croissants, great sugar donuts, hams, chesses and fruit. Various juices and sparkling water were served as well as coffe, tea and capuccinos at no charge. The rooms themselves were spacious compared to European standards. We had six rooms in total so I feel we were able to get a relatvely good feel of the different layouts. Each room had a marble entrance way where a double doored closet held a suffucient amount of clothes. There was a programable safe in the closet too. A mini bar area wa also in the entrance way. The bathrooms were done in white marble with a marble countertop. Though the bath tub was narrow the shower inside was fine. Each bathroom also had a bidet. The sleeping area was rather spacious offering the bed, a desk with desk chair and an arm chair near the window. The only issue was the effeciency of the air conditioning. Some of our rooms had better cooling than others. As for location it is within walking distance of all the sites. Keep in mind the heat is rather hot in July but we still were able to walk to all sites except the Collosseum which was only a 6-7 Euro cab ride. Take Ponte Cavour across the river and walk about four blocks. It will take you to the hear of the Via Condotti and Piazza di Spangna! The staff was very helpful in mapping out sites and locations as well as calling cabs. Overall the Mellini was an excellent choice located in a quite neigborhoon just off the Tiber.

The breakfasts are only continental but with a wide choice. The rooms are quite spacious and very clean. The 6th floor front rooms have little balconies but I would actually recommend an inner room with just a tiny courtyard view - quieter and cooler I think. The roof terrace is spacious but could do with a bar! It is worth asking the reception to organise your transfer back to the airport - it saved us 25 euro! I recommend the Piazza Navona for evenings - numerous restaurents, pretty fountains and quaint street entertainment late into the evening. The metro is cheap but hot and does not really run to the places you want to be. I recommend the red open top tour bus 110 which is 13 euro for a day ticket and you can hop on and off. There were four of us - I would describe as middle-aged and we quite happily wandered the cobbled streets late into the evening with no fears whatsoever.

The desk lamp wasn't working (with the shattered bulb still in the socket) and the toilet really needs to be cleaned properly. The whole room only had one bedside lamp for lighting , which meant the room was impossibly dark. We got our proper room the next day and boy was the difference in quality HUGE. It is nice, clean and quite spacious. Everything worked properly in this room. The location is great, very quiet and safe. On the same street there is a Carabineri (sp?) station and there's a nice grocer shop run by a nice elderly couple. This made it easy for us to get supplies for our day trips. The Vatican is a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. The staff were friendly and when asked for suggestions for restaurants, pointed us to some really good places. Unfortunately for us, one of their staff members failed to notify us of a taxi strike the next day we were due to leave when asked if we should make a taxi booking. Having only found out too late on the day of checkout we had to rush with luggage in hand by foot to the nearest Metro station to catch our train. That's the only issue I had with them, which in all honesty could have been avoided. However the staff in the morning did try to get us a driver but to no avail. The breakfast is good for an Italian hotel. They have a full range of Twinnings teas that you can select, and have cereal, bread and some meat slices. Not much when compared to a typical English breakfast, but by Italian standards, this is quite good.

The breakfast served was outstanding, and the quality of service was fabulous. The hotel is situated near the Tibor River, along which I ran each morning. I always felt safe and \"at home\" at the Hotel Dei Melilini. A local resaturant ~700 Cafe ~ is great and inexpensive. A local market (on the same street as the hotel) offers fruit, vegetables, water, and beverages at a great value.

It is truly located between the Vatican and Colosseum, but be advised, the location is as good as it gets for walking but it's still a fair hike to each major attraction. There are several small grocery stores in the neighborhood for bottled water and snacks. We had dinner at several neighborhood restaraunts with mixed results - the Clock was the best, but in the end we wished we had taken a taxi to Via Vanetto for at least one evenining out. We drove to Rome as first timers and were it not for a borrowed GPS gizmo, we'd still be searching for the hotel - but my poor sense of direction is not Rome's fault and we appreciated the 10 euro/night valet parking - best price we experienced in Florence, Venice, Rome or Sicily. The hotel was very nice - about what you'd expect from a 4 star - with a few minor dissapointments. The lobby is large, comfortable and elegant (lots of marble) with 'round the clock internet access. The bar is pleasant - small and open to the lobby with a healthy selection and healthier prices. Breakfast (included) was good but not spectacular. Good fresh fruit, quality breads, cerials, cold meats and yoghurts - no hot servings. The room was beautifull, very large and elegantly appointed in English style. We stayed in a 'double deluxe' room at about 275 euro/night and at first blush, it was really impressive - large entry way, closets, fabulous and comfortable bed, desk and arm chairs as comfortable as some hotel beds I've endured. Nothing in the way of a view, but I think all the rooms at this hotel suffer the same limitation. The bath was large and very well appointed, (now for the minor dissapointments) but there were small mold deposits in the corner tiles of the tub (not OK anywhere - particularly in a 4 star hotel) that prevented my wife from taking a well desrved soak. The toilet and facial tissue was airport quality, if that - again, not something I would expect at this price. The bath condition certainly didn't ruin our stay at this nice hotel, but it was a dissapointment. There's an attractive sun deck on the top floor that we enjoyed the first night, but it was closed for the remainder of our stay no announcement or explanation - another dissapointment / irritation. On our last night in Rome, we attempted to rent a movie and found our video system malfunctioning - no problem with removing the charge from our bill, but another irritation nonetheless. Desk service was efficient and polite - even warm depending upon who was helping us and I have no complaints there. The breakfast servers were very nice and pleasant. Would we stay there again? Probably not at these prices - the small things that prevent the Dei Mellini from being a fabulous hotel are important to me.

We spent out first two days in Rome at the Sofitel and then stayed at the Dei Mellini for two separate 2-day stays (4 days total). Although it cost almost exactly the same amount (roughly $400/night in May 2006), it was night and day from the Sofitel. First, the entire hotel is run-down. The carpet is worn, the hallways smell bad, the upholstery on the seating downstairs is falling apart and generally the hotel is not being cared for properly. Even more importantly, the air conditioning is very weak and even if you put it on the lowest temperature possible, it doesn't cool the room very much. The rooms don't have enough lighting. When you walk through the door of the hotel, you are immediately confronted with 6 or 7 stairs - kind of an unpleasant surprise when you have just arrived with all of your luggage! During our first stay, they gave us a room with an open sleeper sofa as one of the \"beds\" - the sofa was broken, which we didn't realize until the next day after waking up with severe back pain. When we complained the next day, they gave us a rollaway, but the entire experience was quite unpleasant. (We called the front desk, they promised to call us back, and never did - while we stayed up later than we wanted to waiting for them to call and finally gave up and went to bed on a mattress on the floor.) To their credit, when we complained at checkout the next day, they did upgrade us to a larger suite for our second stay - but it didn't make up for 2 days of back pain during an expensive trip. The location was less than ideal - it's across the river, by the Vatican, but you have to cross the river and do some walking to get to any of the other tourist sites. Since Rome is a fairly large city, we did do some considerable walking to visit all the usual sites (Collosseum, Pantheon, Museo Borghese, etc.) The breakfast buffet is somewhat limited in selection, but the items were pretty good. (The bread was hard as a rock, but that was pretty typical of everywhere we ate in Italy.) On the positive side, their suites are huge -- they literally have two bathrooms! And the staff is courteous. They let us leave luggage with them during the time between our two stays.

We spent six nights at the Dei Mellini and despite several major problems with their service, we loved the hotel and would stay there again. We paid 260. euros a night for a beautiful non-smoking suite on the fourth floor. It was quiet, clean and well-appointed. It had a small bedroom, separate living room, grand foyer and large marble bathroom. Value for our money was far exceeded! Breakfast and taxes were included in the rate. I searched high and low and the Dei Mellini had the best rooms at the best rates in Rome! I would have loved to have had tea-making facilities in the room, but other than that, it was a great room. That being said, we had major problems with their service. If you need help with tours, supper reservations, airport transfers, etc., then you may want to consider another hotel. For example, we arrived in Rome on Christmas Day. We knew taxis at the airport would be scarce or very expensive, so we arranged for an airport transfer with the hotel via email. We reconfirmed by telephone the day before we left. No car and driver waiting on us when we arrived! We called the hotel and they denied having received the email OR the telephone call. We took the train into the city center and caught a taxi at the train station. Could have been worse, but I was fuming by the time I got to the hotel! No apologies, shrugged it off when I showed them a copy of THEIR email to me confirming the transfer. Our taxi driver had to help us with our luggage because the bell person was standing at the desk chatting and laughing on the telephone and couldn't be bothered. We dealt with three different desk clerks during our stay and their attitudes ranged from indifferent to aloof. Service in the breakfast room ranged from completely ignoring us to bringing us ice cold \"hot\" tea as we were getting ready to leave. We didn't visit the little bar area, but the barmen went out of their way to say good evening each night. The room service menu had a wide selection, was well-priced and quite good. Breakfast was excellent with cold meats and cheese, fresh fruit, cold cereal and lots of breads and pastries. Despite the total lack of service and no on-site restaurant, we were elated with the room, the location and the price!

Wandering through Rome is, of course, why you go there. But a lot of walking means a lot of exercise \u2013 and this hotel is certainly not in the heart of things. It IS very close. Nevertheless, within 2 blocks you\u2019ll find a farmacia (drug store/apothecary), an ATM, good coffee and pastries, great authentic roman cuisine, the bus and train, and a small bit of shopping (cool stuff, too). You\u2019ll also find Vito\u2019s, a caf\u00e9/pub/grill just down the street that stays open late and is quite a bit of fun \u2013 the food is very good but a bit overpriced compared to what you can get from a 5 minute walk elsewhere. Good for drinks and meeting people from all over the world. As far as safety goes, there\u2019s a Cabrinieri station (a kind of military/police) 2 or 3 doors down\u2026so there is always a strong police presence in the neighborhood. In fact, we found a strong police presence nearly everywhere we went. Granted, we were there just a month after the London subway attack so this might have been a high-alert measure.

Even though we arrived about 1130am, he made no issue about being too early to check in. The bellboys were summoned, and 2 staff appeared to assist us with our luggage. They spoke excellent English probably due to their contact with the many American guests who use this hotel. The deluxe double room we were allocated was very spacious, with high ceilings, furnished in a classical style. The bed was one of the biggest kings I have ever seen and very very comfy. A second temporary bed for our child was easily accommodated. It had a digital safe, mini bar, and TV that appeared to only offer 9 local Italian channels. The aircon was effective and near silent.

Yes it is in a quiet residential side street, and there are few restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Whilst some describe it as \u2018perfectly located\u2019 between the Vatican and the historical centre etc, that depends on how much walking you are prepared for. You are in between the two --- and not that close to either, as they are both a 15 minute walk away. However, this hotel has rather unique qualities not easily found elsewhere, and despite the location, there is an easy solution for those who don\u2019t like to walk. Reception can order a taxi. Five euros will take you to the main tourist traps - Piazza Navona or the Spanish Steps, ten euros take you to the Termini or the Colloseum. Otherwise it is a very pleasant stroll along and over the river with no hills to negotiate. There is also the Rome Metro (nearest station 10mins walk north west of the hotel) where you can cross the city avoiding heavy traffic. A day pass for the metro is only four euros.

The hotel was of a very high standard, rooms very clean and well kept, nice bar area and breakfast room. The staff were very helpful. The only drawbacks were the lack of restaurant in the hotel and the location. LOCATION The hotel is situated down a quiet side street but is about a 30 - 40 minute walk to the main attractions of St Peters and in the opposite direction the same distance to the Colleseum. It is a nice area and you can be assured of a good nights sleep however there are only a handful of moderate restaurants in the immediate vicinity - the best being Clock restaurant , just 5 minutes down the end of the road. The majority of the main attractions are situated over the other side of the bridge. RESTAURANT We will a little disappointed at the hotel's lack of restaurant and had there been one available, this would have undoubtedly have pushed our rating to 5*. The hotel does cater for breakfast and provides an adequate buffet style breakfast. Due to the location , we found that we would have to venture out in the evening to look for somewhere to eat. This was not always ideal as we spent all out days sightseeing and therefore would have enjoyed relaxing in the hotel in the evening. One of the nicest restaurants that we found was near Piazza Venetiza (over the bridge) and it was called the Jazz Cafe. This was a chic restaurant catering in pizza, pasta etc and a large selection of cocktails. We would also recommend Pizza 8 which was a family run, traditional Italian restaurant. This was very near the hotel and on the way to St Peters. All in all, a very enjoyable stay but if we did ever return to Rome, we would stay closer to the main attractions as that would help to get a sense of traditional Italy. The hotel was lovely but situated in the very quiet business district and a bit 'out of the way' from everything. SIGHTSEEING We would recommend a visit to the beautiful St Peter's Bascillica. We were lucky as when we arrived there was a free tour taking place of the history of the building/art work. This was excellent and lasted approx 1 hour. Keep a look out for the American guide near the main entrance as they wer handing leaflets out when we arrived. We also would recommend the Colleseum guide and also the Vatican Museums - though don't go early in the morning as it is a complete nightmare!!!! No room to move with the hoards of people!!!!!!

There are plenty of places to eat close by, from a bar just over the road which was basic but excellent, to the tourist traps around the Piazza Navona.

We booked the Hotel direct on their winter rate of 150 inc breakfast for a deluxe double. We arrived an hour before our scheduled check-in yet this was not a problem, even better was that we we're upgraded to a Junior Suite at no extra cost. We had room 405 which had small vestibule containing a large built in wardrobe, mirror and the mini bar. There was also a small safe that was free of charge. We also had a lounge area with a sofa and easy chair, TV and a desk with chair. The bedroom had a large comfortable bed, a large set of draws, a chair and another TV. The bathroom was marble, with his and hers basins, a bath with shower over and two huge white fluffy bathrobes. Everything in the room was immaculate as in fact was every area within the Hotel. A couple of reviews had mentioned the breakfast being poor. Too us it was what you'd expect from a continental breakfast. Everything was fresh and there was plenty of choice. If you're idea of breakfast is 'full English' then you will be disappointed. There is a small bar and two lounge areas downstairs along with the breakfast room. They don't serve dinner (although there is a small room service menu) but we didn't find a problem as Rome obviously has plenty of good restaurants. There are at least four within a couple of minutes walk. We only tried one nearby (on the same street in fact) called CLOK, which was pretty good. The hotel staff are very friendly and they have some nice touches too. There is a turn down service each night where they leave you a pair of slippers and a small vanity sheet on each side of the bed. On our last night we were in our room from about 5pm until we went out for dinner at 9.15pm, yet when we came back they had again turned down the bed. The hotel is in a quite area of the city yet is only a 20 minute walk to the Vatican or the sites of Northern Rome. If you want a view out of your window don't come here, but if you want peace and quite away from the incessant traffic noise and car horns of the center of the city, you won't be disappointed. When we come back to Rome, which we will, we will be booking the Dei Mellini Just a point on the traffic.

There is no lane discipline and cars and scooters just cut each other up all the time. No one uses the indicators or stops at zebra crossings. You need a strong nerve just to sit in the back of a taxi. If you're a London Motorcycle courier you may just about survive on a scooter, anyone else, you'll have no chance. One final tip. Before you go or even better while you're there, read Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. Not only is it a great book, but it's all set in Rome and you can visit the locations as you read about them.", "Date": "January 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerset, UK", "Title": "\u201cRoman Holiday\u201d", "Author": "laura1", "ReviewID": "UR3084790", "Content": "Thoroughly enjoyed this lovely hotel. We stayed for 3 nights over New Year and I can't wait to go back! After many weeks of reading everything I could find about hotels in Rome I'd just about reached review overload, but decided on the dei Mellini. I have to say slightly with fingers crossed, as reviews are subjective aren't they. And something I consider important might not even feature on another person's agenda. However, I was most definetly not disappointed. The hotel was lovely, the staff very welcoming (including a good suggestion for a dinner venue on our first night - Cesari, which was excellent), a good spread for the breakfast buffet which goes on all morning, a 6ft wide bed (yes, to a Brit that's worth commenting on!) in our very comfortable, clean, tasteful, quiet (yes, no street noise!) room. We walked everywhere from the hotel, though they told us buses stopped close by if we wanted. But we were happy to walk and for our forays to take us down roads buses couldn't travel along. The Spanish Steps one way and the Vatican the other took about 15 minutes, and I don't walk fast. The Colosseum took a bit longer, but we did have a detour for lunch on route! We returned via the Bocca de Veritas in true Roman Holiday style.", "Date": "January 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tarrytown, New York", "Title": "\u201cNew Years 2005 in an EXCELLENT CITY AND EXCELLENT HOTEL!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2993316", "Content": "My husband Joe and I just got back from our 6 day stay in Rome (Dec 28th-Jan 2nd). Hotel Dei Mellini is a fabulous hotel. The room was immaculate, with cleaning service twice daily, the staff was friendly and courteous, and the decor was lovely. The buffet breakfast (included with the room fee) was excellent, with a nice spread of breads, cakes, meats, cheeses, yogurts, cereal and your choice of coffee, tea, cappucino or hot cocoa! The hotel is located in a quieter residential nighborhood, on the western side of the River. Remember that most of the attractions are on the eastern side (except the Vatican) so you will have to make the short walk over the bridge towards Piazza Cavour daily. However, Public Transportation (bus and subway) is available from everywhere, so at night when you are tired from all the walking, the bus will drop you off right near the hotel! Although the majority of great restaurants are near the Spanish Steps, we really loved the ultra contemporary Cloc, located right near the hotel!! New Years in Rome was amazing and I think this is the best time of year to visit. There are many tourists, but not as busy as summer months and the weather is perfect for sight seeing. You definitely need a coat and maybe some gloves at nite! A short trip to ancient Ostia Antica is also a must. Overall, Rome is a wonderful city, with lots to see, everyone should plan to take a Roman Holiday!!", "Date": "January 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clifton, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGem of a Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2985567", "Content": "Just returned from 6 nights at the Hotel Mellini over New Year's.

Breakfast was great, as were the restaurant suggestions from the staff. This was our 8th or 9th trip to Rome and we wish we learned of this hotel earlier.

Location 15mins from Vatican and 30mins from centre but neither walk a chore. Our taxi from the airport cost 87euro the return 50euro....we were had....next time I would get the hotel to organise the transfer both ways as they got us the fixed price return car which for 4 people I would say was fine.
