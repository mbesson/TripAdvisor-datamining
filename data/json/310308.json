{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great location - but pricey and very small rooms After 10 days of travel in Japan we decided on the station hotel in Tokyo for its convenience so we wouldn't be humping our big cases around a busy city or trying to sort out a taxi. We also had to catch an early train to Narita on departure and convenience was the key again. From that point of view the hotel was absolutely ideal - just outside the Maranouchi exit (between central and south) and there it was. Its an old hotel (circa 1915) and there's no lift to the 3rd floor. We didn't bother eating at the hotel as there are so many better options nearby. It has two small but atmospheric bars with average prices. Rooms are very small by western standards - we really struggled with two big cases in our double. On the plus front - there was free broadband internet access, the room was clean and quiet and certainly the location was hard to beat. Just watch out for those prices - we booked direct via their website (google it) and it cost about \u62e2125/night/room only.", "Date": "May 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR766969024", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "DML"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066443-d310308-r3429330-Tokyo_Station_Hotel-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "310308", "Price": "$283"}}
