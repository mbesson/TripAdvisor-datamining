There is nothing else in the area. The breakfast was so-so (the eggs were cold) although they did have quite a variety and the coffee is good. I think the beds are too hard, but I've had worse. There was plenty of hot water but the tub is really slippery and they have no tub mat. The indoor-outdoor carpet in the room is torn at the seam. The only chair to sit on is a kitchen dinette type of chair. The wi-fi is free but the system is ancient -- every device has to have a new password every day. On day one it was ok because they had a stack of passwords that you could just pick up but on day two we had to stand in line while the staff checked people in. When one person asked nicely if the stack of passwords was available the clerk gruffly told her to get back in line. When we finally got to the counter 10+ minutes later all the clerk did was pull out the stack of pre-printed passwords!! He was busy and grumpy, but really? The other staff person who got me extra pillows was very nice and helpful, though. We are on the 9th floor and can hear some street musician trumpeter at 10:50 at night. It will probably be hard to sleep if Spain wins the soccer game that the whole country appears to be watching. The rooms are very spacious. I usually stay at smaller, old hotels with character near the center of town but am on an all-inclusive student trip with my daughter. I expected the hotels to be worse and was pleasantly surprised by this and the one in Barcelona.

But, I actually quite enjoyed it in the end, and it was an interesting 3 night stay. The hotel building is very ugly from the outside and it is the worst of the 70ties architecture. This hotel was (partially) renovated, but they have kept many REALLY retro things - I found it great fun to see a crank to wind the window blinds, or a shoeshine machine on every floor, just like in my childhood. The blow dryer in the bathroom was an amazing huge contraption, and there was a \"control panel\" next to the bed with large dials for two preset radio stations :) However, the rooms are very spatious and clean, as is the bathroom which does have outdated installations. The breakfast was surprisingly good on all days- many warm dishes, cereals, cold cuts and cheeses, fruit juices and fresh (and some awful canned) fruit. There was a group of school children staying on my floor one night, but the staff did their best to reign them in. I was staying there during the week, so I do not know about the noise from the disco club many were complaining about. Internet access is free, but you have to enter the new code every 24 hours (so pick up sufficient vouchers when checking in). I felt safe in the area, and have used the metro and the train stations, but the area itself does look like a dystopia that was hit by a meteorite recently.

Its sold as a modern 4 star hotel, I booked it myself through lastminute.com... At a very affordable price of 60 euro/night, I thought I found a bargain. That impression lasted until the moment i stepped into the room... I might have been modern one day, but i believe that was in the end of the 80\u00b4s or possibly in the beginning of the 90\u00b4s, which was the last time it was renovated... I would like to point out that im a fairy seasoned traveller with more than 1000 nights in hotels worldwide, and yes, i have have stayed in worst places than this, however that was in the 90\u00b4s when i was bagpacking in Asia... The room was good sized, but the decoration was as outdated as I have ever seen, a mixture of peeling repainted wood furniture and, and horrible taste. The television reminded me of what i used to have in my bedroom in my youth, only the basic Spanish channels. The beds was OK, however the smallest pillows i have ever seen I tried to call the reception to see if there was possible to get a few extra, but was told that this service was not available, ended up folding the two available ones double and got through the night that way... If you as myself like shacking up in bed with your laptop working, forget it assuming you dont carry two batteries, since there was only one place to connect the cable, -On the opposite side of the room. Bathroom can probably best be described as beige, and have most likely missed the last renovation in the 90\u00b4s... A warning would also be for everyone to flush the pipes for at least a couple of minutes before you step into the shower, since the water coming out initially was absolutely brown, i was assured by the receptionist that this was an isolated case, however a quick survey conducted at breakfast concluded that this \"isolated case\" happened on at least 3 more floors, and according to a cleaner it has gone on for years... This was not a case of just some corrusion coming out initially, it went on for a long time... For those of you needing decent WIFI I would recommend McDonald\u00b4s 10 min walk away, since it was really weak and kept cutting.

I am usually good at following Tripadvisor ratings, but this was such an affordable one-night I thought it wouldn't but help our budget. Truly, how bad could it be? The hotel is attached to the train and metro stations. Going in, you feel that no one has done a single thing to the building since the 70's. After, you realize that it is not a feeling, it is a fact. The indifferent and cold staff at reception will also make you believe that the last time any customer service standard was followed in this establishment was several decades ago. When it is your turn to be helped they don't ask, they just stare. Don't be surprised either at how forceful they are to receive full payment in advance. I'm sure they must have many guests who'd like to run away before paying. Once at the room, the bathroom light flickers for a minute before it turns on. More authentic than a motel in a horror movie - the bathroom has no toiletries but a shampoo dispenser worthy of a gas station. The rooms are so dated they carry a strange smell. So old that beside the bed you can still find the switches for elevator music and one-switch-AC. You can even find those switches used to call room service, I honestly wouldn't believe to see that again. The TV, we must admit was a bit more modern, perhaps the 80's? It should come with an attached VCR. The beds sheets wil remind you of those used in the ER and full of strange dark spots. The beds are also hard as a rock.

I am not even the type to write these kinds of reviews, but I feel strongly about how bad this place was. I will start with what is the only good point, but this has a massive downfall too; that is location. Without question in terms of accessability to Madrid in its entirety this hotel scores marks; how can it not when it is literally on top of one of Madrids biggest transport hubs. However the area around Chamartin station is shocking, delapedated, old, and left me feeling uneasy about my partners safety, it is like Kabul, and that is not being unkind. The hotle itself boasts fairly large rooms, but why do they totally reek of smoke; I know I am not the first to mention this. I do not think it is because people are smoking (Which they are) but I think it is because the smell of smoke has imbedded itself onto the decor and such. That is how old this place is, the electronic equipment is laughable; there was something in my bathroom that I was at a loss to identify, but my wife assured me it was a hairdryer? There was a car window handle to operate the window blinds, that is hilarious in a 4 star hotel. The general cleanliness cannot be critisised because it was fairly spotless, no stains or things like that. I had a really bad chest and cough in this place due to the smokey stench (I am not usually too affected by these things). This whole place really needs to be renovated ASAP. It was the most dissapointing hotel stay I have encountered, the reason being if you stay in a 2 star for example you expect and accept little gripes you may have; but in a 4 star? You at least expect to be comfortable and satisfied. One more personal problem, please put power point near the bed!!

It would have been nice to have been at least greeted or made to feel welcome, but it seems that this is the the Spanish way, as I noticed this trend in other hotels in Spain as well. Spaniards, perhaps, feel a strong need to protect a traveler's privacy boundaries. My sense is that if you need that personal warmth, you will probably have to go the five star route. But just having a decent hotel room and ready access to the train station, accompanying mall area, and an easy ability to begin to get an on-foot orientation to the beautiful city of Madrid overcame my hurt pride about feeling \"invisible\".

Do they even have any idea what a 4* hotel is like? According to any hotel rating system this place falls at least to a 2.5* for me. The rooms were a tacky 40s or 50s style with these old box which was used to put on the air conditioning, call for room service, turn on the light, etc. The box looked from those old movies when electric devices first came out. It had these massive buttons and turn pegs, very strange indeed, but not anything close to what anyone would consider to be a 4*. The air conditioning also couldn't be controlled beyond 1 and 2, so that we couldn't actually choose to the temperature, and that made it extremely uncomfortable. 2 selections for air conditioning is pretty poor. I Think. The other hotel in Spain I stayed at that was a 3* had each room with a private temperature control, and other 'luxuries' that Husa just didnt live up to. To begin with, they didn't even provide the normal essentials that I normally would get in a 2.5* hotel. No bar soap to wash my hands, no shampoo or conditioner, etc. The pillows were as thin as my arm (say max 2-3 inches) and as hard as a rock. The curtains didnt even cover the whole window, so you had to choose between having the middle covered or the outsides. The place was quite dusty and I was afraid to put my things down until I'd done a wipe down first. Also, though they are a non-smoking hotel, our room stuck horribly of smoke and there was an ashtray in the room!! When I asked about this I was told that people still end up smoking in the rooms even though it is not allowed, and they provide the ashtray so that these people will not ash on to the floor. There is apparently some kind of censor in the vent that alerts the front desk that someone in that room is smoking, and they call them and tell them to put out the cigarette. Not sure how well this system works since our room stunk, but nonetheless the hotel is meant to be non-smoking. All I can say is that my asthma and allergies were horrible there at night and I can only attribute this to the smoking in the rooms. I booked through a well known online website where you cannot see the actual name of the hotel you are purchasing until after the purchase is make, thus giving a better price. The website seemed to imply that the hotel was in they city centre zone, or 'El Centro-Old Madrid' as they called. it, I guess it was in Old Madrid alright, old as in the 40s, as the hotel looked as well. I was expecting an actual European city centre where you are at the actual architectural spots of the city, but alas I was fooled. So, the location is extremely far. Took about 30-40 minutes on the metro, not really what we were looking for. The metro station is not the nicest, but i guess it works. It is pretty dodgy at night so beware. (a side note, if you purchase the tourist metro ticket for Zone A you can take the \"renfe\" train which is much faster as it only stops in one other location before arriving at the Sol stop, the real city centre. This way takes only 15 minutes, so I definitely suggest this route). Anyhow, if you know which online website I am referring to, beware that 'El-Centro\" for Madrid could be anywhere in Madrid, expect perhaps the suburbs. Breakfast, if not included is a pricey 13 euros, so don't waste your money and head to the city center where there are loads of great places, one being La Catedral, just a few blocks from the Sol metro. Also, internet is 2euros for 15 minutes! you can get one hour in a cafe for 1 euro... It is also so noisy! Sounds like you are sleeping on the side of a major highway/motorway with massive trucks flying by, honking their horns, etc... The windows didn't have any sound proofing at all, so that also kept us up at night. I would think one thing a 4* hotel that happens to be in a loud location could do is have windows that keep that noise out. Hope someone finds this helpful. There are plenty of nicer places to stay, with more helpful staff and staff that will help you find what you are looking for, not forcing you to use their things so they can make money (example: we were trying to make a call with our mobile and went to ask the front desk how to call out, (i.e. what the calling codes were) and they said it would only work if you called from our room, which of course would be a charge to us!!) so don't waste your money, you will get better service at a less * place.", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBlech\u201d", "Author": "TheCanuckTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR13814603", "Content": "It is located right inside the train station - which is why we chose this hotel.

Next to the breakfast room is a bar, in the evenings when we were there they had a guy playing the piano, it was a nice setting, although I got the impression they would have preferred you to dress up a little to use it, as I had a funny look when I walked in wearing jeans and a rugby shirt, I should point out that just outside the second level enterance by the reception desk there is a nice little bar, serving beer and I found it more comfortable to relax in, as it had the feel of a real British pub, also complimentary bar snacks when you order a few beers. Onto the room itself, we had ours on the seventh floor, all floors are serviced by four elevators which were clean and worked well. The room was of a reasonable size, had air con, TV, mini bar fridge and the ever important safe. The beds were comfortable, although only one pillow each, and no spares in the wardrobe, I'm sure they would have sent more if we had asked for them, but we didn't. They had blinds outside the room, operated by a small handle under the window, and these really made a difference, the room was very dark when the blinds were closed, perfect for sleeping, the noise level from outside was also at a minimum with good soundproofed windows.

Overall, Hotel Chamartin is okay, but I would not recommend it as a tourist hotel or for more than one or two nights.", "Date": "November 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location for Overnight train\u201d", "Author": "lilnation", "ReviewID": "UR3542612", "Content": "I stayed in Hotel Husa Chamartin for 4 days in May. I had to take the overnight train to Lisbon which left at 22:45 , so it was perfect for me. The rooms were very clean and larger than most other hotel rooms. The staff was helpful and friendly. Trips to City Centre was approximately 15-20 minutes by Metro. The hotel would be suitable for family vacationers b/c it is situated on a huge complex. Most of facilities were closed when I was there but I believe around June, July and August they should be open. There is a bowling alley, a disco, and other facilities for a vacationing family.", "Date": "June 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cHusa Chamartin was great!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3210550", "Content": "Nothing really fancy, but excellent service and clean, comfortable rooms.
