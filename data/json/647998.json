Minimal noise from the street, thanks to the coated glass door. Air conditioning stood up well to the hot July weather. Bathroom was clean, stocked with thick towels, soap, shampoo, lotion, toothbrush/paste, and other amenities. Kitchenette area had a big fridge, double hot plates, frying pan, pot, plates, spoons, forks, knives, dish towel -- convenient when we wanted to eat in. Room rate included breakfast with buffet of fruit, cheese, ham, sausage, omelet, yogurt, pastries, plus orange juice, coffee (espresso, cappuccino, latte) or tea or chocolate, and a large toast with various topping options (cheese, pate, sobresada, tomato puree, etc.) -- filling! Location was perfect for us first-time visitors, close to many sights, restaurants, and we could easily go back to the hotel to rest between activities. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Special kudos to the waitress at breakfast -- so efficient, pleasant. One downside -- one has to climb a flight of stairs to get to the lift which stops between floors (so one has to climb a flight of stairs to get to one's floor) ... hard for those with bad knees.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cVery well centered, but ugly room, and poor breakfast\u201d", "Author": "travellAround8", "ReviewID": "UR123787995", "Content": "I went to Madrid to celebrate a special event with my wife and I decided for this hotel as it is exactly in the center!! I confirm the position is perfect!! Close to everything! The courtesy of hotel assistant also very cosy. The only sadness is the room! They have few rooms with front view and all the little rest is on back side (better for not having noisy) but the window open against a wall!!! there is no view, but the worst there is no light!!!! For the rest the room is quite big!! lot's of space!! nice bathroom!! no window!! The second and the last bad point is the breakfast. Hotel invite you to take breakfast in the bar/cantina below. It's nice atmosphere but there is no buffet, or fresh food for breakfast!!! I recommend to go to this restaurant fo lunch or dinner!! much better!!!", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLots of character and a great location\u201d", "Author": "lucieharris", "ReviewID": "UR108603212", "Content": "This hotel is slap bang in the middle of loads of great restaurants, in a really lively area. It feels rustic but quite newly renovated, and our room was spacious with a lovely beamed ceiling. The bed was comfortable and we had no street noise. It was so easy to get around and it made our short trip even better to be able to pop back to the hotel without going out of our way (it is hard to spot though - black door to the right of the En Busca del Tiempo restaurant). Only two small complaints - the bathroom was an obstacle course as they had squeezed in a bidet, so getting in and out of shower was difficult. Also, the walls are thin so you can hear people going into and out of their rooms, and Saturday was laundry day so that woke us up early - not great after a late Madrid night! Staff are lovely though and the restaurant of the same name where you eat breakfast is pleasant with good food.

The location is excellent next to Plaza de la Puerta del Sol in the middle of Madrid. The hotel is a bit difficult to find. The entrance is a black door to the right of the restaurant En Busca del Tiempo. There is only one narrow staircase with many steps which might give problems in case of a fire. There is a small lift. The room was clean with comfortable beds and the necessary facilities with the exception of a hairdryer. A nice little kitchen with a big refrigerator gives extra value, although the equipment\u2019s in the kitchen are modest. It consists of a small pot, a small frying pan, water glasses, spoons, forks and plates. There is free wireless internet access. The staff is young service minded persons. Most of them don\u2019t speak fluent English, but unless you have very complicated questions it works okay. A sufficient breakfast with a big toast as the main ingredient was included.

And, most importantly, we had a room that faced the back of the hotel. The hotel is located just a block from the always hopping Puerta del Sol, and there are numerous bars and restaurants on the same street and in the vicinity. Amazingly, we never heard any outside noise once we were in the hotel, especially when we were in our room. The room was a bit small, as was the bathroom, but both were entirely adequate. We had a small kitchen, that we didn't use, but it was a nice addition. The bed was very comfortable, and we slept with the window opened, which added to our enjoyment of the place. The personnel were very helpful and always available. The breakfast was very good and filling, and free. On offer were coffee, tea, quiche, some fruit, pastries and bread, with your choice of amazing toast with cheese and/or some additional toppings. Very good. The hotel does not have the amenities that a larger place might have, but we enjoyed everything that the hotel offered. The location is absolutely perfect, because it is so close to Puerta del Sol, which is the heart of the city.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cFavorite place in Europe!!!\u201d", "Author": "christie584", "ReviewID": "UR55667779", "Content": "We found this hotel by chance on a weekend when everyone else was sold out.

Most staff didn't speak good English, but we didn't have any trouble communicating and they were very helpful in providing everything we needed (extra pillows, a hair dryer, etc). The complimentary breakfast was also very satisfying. The hotel was steps away from the Puerta del Sol and about a 5 min walk to the Plaza Mayor. There were tons of cafes and restaurants everywhere you look and we felt like we were in the best location possible! To top it all off it was a great value.

They are located on a pedestrian street within walking distance to two Irish bars, 'The Dubliner' & 'O'Connell St.' and other local bars & restaurants. There are several flights of stairs but there is also a lift available after the first flight. We checked in and were shown straight to our rooms on the top floor. Our room had Air Con, TV, Kitchenette with a fridge, sink & crockery & a separate bathroom. The room was clean but basic, clean towels, shower gel & soap were provided. We were given one set of keys for each room & one for the front door. Breakfast is provided from 7.30 until 10.30am. A voucher is provided at reception to eat in the bar next door but we didn't use them as we found the staff there unfriendly to a group of 11 ladies so we ate breakfast in 'O Connell St Pub' which was good apart from being served hot milk to drink with tea even though we asked for cold milk twice, it kept coming back warm. The rooms cost \u20ac54 per person for 2 nights & we also got a 10% discount. We stayed there for a hen party and were noisy coming home the first night. The staff were not tolerant of any noise. We had to check out by 12 on sunday and they were kind enough to keep our luggage for the day as our flight wasn't until later.
