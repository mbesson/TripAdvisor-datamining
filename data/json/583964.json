Check in was friendly and smooth, room simple but well cleaned. Although the room was overlooking a rather large road it was all quiet and good to sleep. We had dinner at the restaurant which was basic but of good quality with a bit of unexperienced, but very polite and friendly service. I felt that the hotel staff was extremely young, friendly and helpful - thanks again for sending my BB cable to Frankfurt. The hotel location is of no specific tourist interest, but I can recommend this place.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisle, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cinexpensive when pre booked and surprinsingly quiet\u201d", "Author": "raiPh3ah", "ReviewID": "UR123138054", "Content": "Using the online early booking 1 month in advance I got a very reasonable rate. The hotel is located on a busy road with tram and bus traffic. My third floor room was on the backside of the building away from the road and there was no noticeable noise from the traffic. The room was clean and the staff friendly. Except for one afternoon coffee break (which was ok) I did not eat at the hotel restaurant. The location is near various buildings of the Humboldt university which was the reason for me choosing the hotel but one should be aware that it is rather far from the city center and the usual tourist attractions. Using public transport to go near Alexanderplatz will take about 30 minutes. Taxis are waiting across the street. There are bus and tram stops directly outside the hotel.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cA good surprise\u201d", "Author": "Paul_Hamelin", "ReviewID": "UR118943286", "Content": "Due to a mistake in our booking for another hotel made by the travel agent, we (a group of 10 friends) have been relocated in Dorint Hotel Adlershof. As tourists for a 4 days stay, the remote location of the hotel, 40 to 60 minutes to City center, depending on the time of the day or night, wasn't really the best, and we didn't fly from Sch\u00f6nefeld airport but from Tegel, exactly on the opposite side. Bad luck. But I have to say honestly that this hotel has been a good surprise which counterbalanced our bad luck. The hotel is quite new, modern, very clean; rooms and bathrooms are of a reasonable size and comfortable; there is an excellent buffet breakfast and staff was very friendly and helpful. Minor minus point: Wi-Fi is available in the rooms but not for free (there's only one free access on a PC in the lobby).", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than expected\u201d", "Author": "toddles1984", "ReviewID": "UR115320906", "Content": "We booked this hotel as part of a 'hotel + concert' package and didn't expect much, but we were really pleasantly surprised.
