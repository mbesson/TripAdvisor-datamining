We chose St Jaques based on the TA reviews and were very pleased with our choice. We arrived round 10:30 a.m. and were delighted to find our rooms ready. I was in room 34 and my friend in 28. My room was lovely. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bath was very contemporary with a shower that provided fast hot plentiful water. The thermostat in the room worked well. The rooms use old fashioned (by American standards) skeleton keys. It took a bit to learn how to use them, but we soon got the hang of it. Guests must turn them in when leaving and pick them up when returning. Some may not like this but I found it kind of reassurring. That and I am drawn to things that have both function and beauty. The staff were wonderful! Every one of them. Special thanks to the blonde woman who was so friendly and genuine and provided us with a wealth of information on where to shop based on our tastes and preferences! The downsides of the hotel are as follows. The room is next to the elevator and there was much rumbling and the walls do seem thin as you can hear conversations in the hallway and ajoining rooms quite well. This is the only reason St Jaques did not get 5 stars. Oddly enough despite the noise I slept very well. We were not able to use the outlet in the bath for our curling irons. But I was able to use the outlet by the bed and stretch enough to use it and view the bath mirror \"long distance\". There limited storage for belongings, however I am not fussy and leaving most things in my suitcase was not a problem for me. As others have mentioned there is a nice market down the street and the Italian restaurant right across the street is indeed wonderful!

We were a family of 4 with 2 kids (8&10) and we'd definitely stay at the St.Jacques again! ROOMS: Tasteful and romantic. Bathrooms were modern and clean but could use some hooks and shelves. Small compared to American standards but larger than other Paris hotels we've stayed at. Beds were comfortable - no waking up with stiff backs and necks! The doors were heavy and a bit loud and we could hear our neighbors' TV and voices, but earplugs solved that. Good air conditioning. Rooms #18 & 24 had a Queen and Twin, enough for 3 people. SERVICE: Excellent. Helpful and friendly. They arranged tickets for the double decker bus as well as the shuttle bus to the airport. BREAKFAST: Lovely presentation of croissants, pain au chocolat, baguettes, jams, cold cuts, cheese, smoked salmon, cereal and juice in a beautiful room. Very good coffee too (which unfortunately was not the case in most cafes). A bit expensive at EUR13/person but well worth the ambience. LOCATION: We initially thought of staying near the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees or Louvre, but were so glad we picked the Latin Quarter. It is packed with restaurants and cafes. Notre Dame and the Pantheon are a 10-minute walk away. Metro stop was 2 blocks away. RESTAURANTS: The front desk recommended a fantastic place, \"Le Petit Prince\", around the corner, but be prepared to spend at least 2 hours there. There were only 2 waiters serving a packed crowd. \"Brasserie Balzar\", a few blocks west was also wonderful. Airy interior with seasoned waiters. Scallops were excellent. There are also tons of moderately priced, ethnically diverse restaurants on the little sidestreets. FOR KIDS: If you ask our kids (8 & 10) what they loved about Paris, they will say the playground at the Jardin du Luxembourg! They absolutely loved the zipline and climbing the Eiffel tower made of rope. There's a section for toddlers and younger kids too. Be warned that some of the contraptions are quite dangerous. We saw several children get thrown off the spinning equipment. The beautiful Jardin is a 15 minute walk from the hotel. The playground is at the south west corner.

We arrived at the hotel early in the morning from London and knew we could not check in until later that afternoon, but wanted to drop our bags off. The hotel has a locked luggage room that we were able to leave our stuff in for the day. It was great to drop it off and not worry about it while we started exploring the city. Our room was one of their least expensive in the hotel and on the top floor. I thought the room was nicely put together including wall paintings and the furniture. The room was a decent size, especially by European standards. While our room would seem tiny to anyone from the US who stays at our typical chain hotels, Europe doesn't operate that way. To get a room as big as you would find in the States, you need to go 4 or 5 star. So if that is what you are looking for and can afford, then I wouldn't recommend this. However, if you understand that European hotel rooms are much smaller, then you will be pleased with the Saint Jacques. Our room also had a lovely balcony looking over the street. Had no problem with noise from the street or from other rooms. Is the type of hotel where you leave your key at the front desk when you leave, which I really like because its one less thing to carry and worry about. The bathroom was large, a tiny shower with wonderful water pressure...better than mine at home. The room and bathroom were clean when we arrived and maid service each day to replace towels and make up the bed and empty trash cans. Just what we needed. They don't vacuum evert day if that's something that you care about. A very tiny tv, with mostly french speaking channels except for BBC news. But who cares....you are in Paris...you shouldnt be watching tv. The front lobby of the hotel is small, but beautifully decorated. The front desk staff, especially the female receptionist were great. All bi-lingual and helpful. Gave two great dinner recommendations and answered any and all questions we had about our trip. They also provide a laptop to be used in the lobby which was so helpful as neither of us had brought a computer! Never had any meals at the hotel, always ate out so can't comment on this aspect. The location was ideal. A 5 minute walk to the subway and 10 minutes to Notre Dame and 20 to the Lourve. Safe street, never felt unsafe walking back to the hotel at night.

The metro is really close for the short trip to the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe.

There is also a very nice food market on some days at the bottom of the street towards the Seine. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Wi-fi is free and fast. Breakfast was good. Our bathroom was clean and a reasonable size, with hair dryer and toiletries. The street has a few good, very casual bars. The Uni is close by so there are lots of earnest students filling the bars. The concierge directed us to two very good close restaurants. Go out the front door, turn left, then turn left again and walk up the side of the hotel towards the Pantheon. Cross the street at the first intersection and go down the side street beside the bar. Halfway down are the two restaurants, on either side of the street. The service and food at the one on the right is best - we went in at 7pm and got the only unreserved table. By 8pm it was full of Parisians. Beautiful meal - moderately priced but worth it. The restaurant opposite has good food too, but the service is not as good. We have stayed in lots of hotels in different cities, with very varied rates, and we'd class the Hotel St Jacques as small, medium cost with great service. This is not a hotel for people who only like 5 star. But if you are flexible in your expectations, you will be very happy.

If I travel to Paris again, I would definitely return to St. Jacques. This hotel exceeded all of our expectations in charm and location. This was my first trip to Paris and I will be back! In my opinion, this is really the place to be to feel all of the young energy from students at the nearby Sorbonne and excellent, affordable bistros and dinner spots all within walking distance of St. Jacques. Right down the street, we caught the Metro to shuttle us to all of the Parisian sights. What a treat it was to step out on our balcony and see Notre Dame down one street view, and then the gloriously lit Pantheon in the other direction. I would highly recommend reserving a room with the balcony, it just adds so much to the experience. Additionally, this hotel is quite close to the Rue Mouffetard, which is a quaint little street lined with shops. Also dined at Cafe Delmas and had gelato at Amorino on the square Place de la Contrescarpe. My boyfriend and I were very pleased with our room, although it was on the smaller side (this is Europe after all). It had all of the charming Parisian touches that made it a great homebase after a day of sightseeing. We loved our balcony! We stayed in a corner standard room which was at the very top floor (ride the elevator up, and then walk up one more flight). Only downside of staying at the very top was that the roof starts to angle in throughout the bathroom. This room did not have a stand-up shower, tub and handheld head only. Only complaint there would be that while I was in the bath, the water would turn from ice cold to scalding hot in a second (no exaggeration). Had good pressure, nonetheless. There are several boulangeries within walking distance on Rue des Ecoles, as well as a breakfast spot, where we ate every morning, right down the street on Rue des Carnes, on your way to the Maubert-Mutualite Metro stop. Some mentioned the antique market, which was very fun to browse. St. Jacques is also, very close to some affordable women's clothing & accessories shopping down Blvd Saint-Michel, to the west. I stopped at NafNaf & Promod. We were very pleased with the friendly service we experienced at St. Jacques, given our limited French. We arranged an airport shuttle (which i would not recommend) and the front desk was very prompt in relaying the message of when they would be arriving to pick us up. They also helped us secure dinner reservations, which again was very appreciated.

Bathrooms range from normal sized to tiny but are very clean and same are the rooms. Unfortunately the hotel does not have a policy of banning smoking or at least to do that for some floors and the smell of smoke passes anytime from one room to another through the air conditioning ducts . About the size of rooms, all are not the same layout hence if one draws a better one the situation gets to be much better.

About Paris: we have visited it many times over four decades and in spite of greedy real state developers it still keeps its beauty and charm , however the once safe New Year's Eve celebration at Champs Elysees has turned somewhat ugly because groups of people arriving from wherever gave it at times a poor atmosphere.

The whole experience in this hotel was great even if it was only a place to rest our tired feet. The only negative was the breakfast- very expensive for what you got so we only ate in the hotel once. If you are looking for a huge selection of food then don't bother- cereal was in one of those small packets you get in the variety packs from the supermarket and the yoghurt was simply a pot which we could have bought ourselves at a supermarket and eaten much more cheaply in our room! Much better to breakfast in the many brasseries near by.

The location was also really great, in the heart of the Latin Quarter with the metro just down the street and the Luxembourg Gardens a few blocks away.

Located on the corner of Rue des Ecoles and Carmes in the Latin quarter, there are plenty of restaurants, bars and markets within a three block radius. The Seine, Notre Dame and the Isle de la Cit\u00e9 are a mere half-mile walk. There is a small bar in the lobby and often a cute, impeccably dressed old man at the desk, straight out of central casting. An almost impossibly tiny (for more than two) elevator never fails to thrill when it jumps about upon reaching your floor (I wouldn't change it). Our room, a double with a queen-sized bed (the largest I saw in Europe) was very comfortable, with hand-painted frescoes on the ceiling and one wall. The bathroom was large and beautifully appointed in marble. The only thing I don't get is the European fixation on these stupid hand-held shower heads - impossibly awkward and messy. There was a flat-screen TV but we never actually turned it on. The Rue des Ecoles can be a bit noisy. The first two days we were there, they were repaving the street! That should not be a problem for a long time in the future, but I would ask for a room on the back side of the hotel if possible. Another thing I would like to mention. We discovered through some friends that live there, that there is more than one menu, and more than one price in the bars and restaurants. You will pay more for food and drinks sitting down outside, often less inside, less if you sit a the bar and even less if you belly-up and stand for your drink. I paid 9 Euros for a large beer at a sidewalk cafe - less than half that sitting at the bar. We agree with another reviewer about the Twickenham restaurant on nearby Rue St. Germain. Try the Croque Twickenham or the Dejuner Anglais. The service was always friendly. They supplied us with a bucket of ice on a couple of occasions - the first I'd seen in three weeks in Europe. When we checked out, they allowed us to store our bags for the day as we were not leaving until evening. To top it off, we discovered after arriving home, that we'd left our adapter, camera battery charger and extra battery there. I wrote them, they found it and are mailing it to us. Above and beyond.

Close by is the Sorbonne,a police station, and two laundromats/laveries. A short walk to patisseries, corner stores, etc, can't complain about location. Though it is a slight walk to a \"major\" metro station, there's nothing wrong with a leisurely walk through Paris! This hotel advertised as being part of the movie \"Charade\" and had photos of Audrey Hepburn, but little of that charm remained. The lift was tiny but we still used it since the stairs up were uneven. The shower was tiny. In Europe I expect small showers, but this took the cake. The drainage of the sink and shower were very bad. The shower filled with water and flooded if you used it too long! But since it was so small we didn't want to stay there for long anyway, but that's no excuse for such poor drainage. The beds were very low and rather uncomfortable (rather ragged, too). The breakfast was not included in the rate, which was appalling since even if you get it (we tried it once) it was 9-10 euro for a really weak breakfast. Save your money as we did and just go to a nearby bakery. For the price, the management could have done the same and delivered superb pastries, etc and still made money. We paid 130 euro per night, which wasn't bad for the location, but there must be better hotels in the area. Rue des Ecoles is a lovely street, with many other options to stay.

Our first room, number 35, was on two levels, making it unique and fun. The bathroom is near the room's entrance, and then you climb a flight of stairs up to a sort of loft bedroom. It has been recently decorated, and elegantly refurbished. If you don't like to climb up and down stairs, or if you can't, then don't stay in this room. The stairs in this room are shiny wood and can be slippery in socks - go barefoot or wear shoes. Next we had a triple - number 18 - and it was spacious and attractive, with a nice shower. Our final room was number 23, on the fifth floor to the front, and it had a large bed, and a newly done bathroom with a great soaking tub. Although two of our rooms were facing the Rue des Ecoles, the double glazed windows made them nearly soundproof. The intricate plasterwork of the ceilings and moldings provided the icing on the cake to complete the charming ambiance. This hotel has a fabulous location. It is one block from the Maubert Mabillon Metro stop, and just around the corner from the Sorbonne. It is on the corner of Rue de Carmes, and if you stand on this corner and look up the hill you are awed by the sight of the dome of the Pantheon, just two blocks away.

We very much enjoyed our six day stay in Paris and at the St. Jacques. The hotel is in a great location in the Latin Quarter of Paris, which is the oldest part of the city just up from the Seine and built over the ancient Roman ruins. It was easy to get from the Charles De Gaulle Airport to the St. Jacques via the RER B commuter train directly into the Latin Quarter. From the reading I did, I think the train is the most inexpensive (8.5 Euros), and perhaps the fastest, way to get into Paris from the Airport. We did miss the closest stop (St Michel \u2013 Notre Dame station) to the St Jacques when we failed to realize that the train doors did not open automatically, but required the press of a button. Still, it took us only about ten minutes to walk to the hotel from the very next stop (Luxembourg station). Two other words of caution. First, if you plan to return to the Airport from the hotel by train, buy your return ticket when you first fly into Paris, as the ticket machines in downtown Paris did not take currency or our credit cards, and so we had to find a live ticket seller (which we eventually did). Second, when planning our Paris trip, I did not immediately realize that there were two Paris hotels both with \u201cSt Jacques\u201d in the name and both in the Latin Quarter. Make sure when doing your research, including booking and locating, that you focus on the Hotel St Jacques located at 35 Rue de Ecoles! From the hotel it is only about a 400 meter walk downhill (through some twisty streets) to the Seine and the \u201cIsle de La Cite\u201d with the Notre Dame Cathedral. The Pantheon is only about a 300 meter walk uphill from the hotel in the opposite direction. The Cluny museum of mediaeval art is also only about a 300 meter walk from the hotel. Additionally, the hotel is only one block (maybe 100 meters) from the Maubert-Mutualite metro stop -- and the Metro can take you virtually anywhere else in Paris you might want to go for very little money. As mentioned in other reviews, the St. Jacques has a very decorative motif with paintings, heavy wall hangings and curtains, and a few sculptured busts. My wife and I stayed in Room 15, a deluxe double (the highest of St Jacques\u2019 three classifications for its double rooms) located toward the back of the Hotel on the 3d floor. Our kids stayed in room 18, a triple located on the 4th floor. Our double room was rectangular and measured about 23 feet by 10 feet, which makes it maybe average size for a US hotel room but big I think for a Paris hotel room. We had plenty of room for our luggage, and a nice sitting area with a daybed/couch. The bed was nice and firm, the way I like it. We had a nice flat screen TV and an in-room safe, and the Wi-Fi worked very well. The room had two very nice large and bright windows. Of course, it was winter time, and I had heard that some apartments in Paris are not well insulated. While it got down to about freezing during the night during our stay, the thermostat in our room worked fine and we were plenty warm. The bathroom had obviously been refurbished recently, and it was very nicely done in marble and tile. It wasn\u2019t very big, but wasn\u2019t impossibly small either. It had a bathtub in it, and the only complaint we had about the bathroom was that the faucet, which was placed at the end of a six foot long flexible hose, had only one wall attachment and that was placed at about knee level. There was no corresponding wall attachment at a higher level, so that you couldn\u2019t really set up the faucet as a shower head. That sort of attachment would have been nice for those of us who prefer showers. This was a very minor inconvenience, however. The kids room (the triple) was about the same size, but their bathroom was smaller with a tiny shower. One thing I should mention was that although other reviews of the St. Jacques have mentioned views of the Pantheon or Notre Dame, if you want any view you have to ask for the top floor, that is, the fifth floor. Our rooms, on the third and fourth floors, respectively, had nice windows but no view. The maids did a good job making up the room, including cleaning up the crumbs from our \u201cpicnics\u201d (see below). Do make sure you put out the \u201cplease service\u201d card on your doorknob in the morning when you want the room made up. On most days, we had good room service. One day when we forgot to put out the \u201cplease service\u201d card our room was not made up. We ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of mornings and it was OK, with the continental breakfast (coffee, orange juice, and various pastries) going for 10 Euros and, with the addition of some cold cheese and ham, going for 11.5 Euros. But we discovered that you could get a slightly better breakfast for cheaper at other nearby restaurants. For example, we had a great English style breakfast at the Le Twickenham (just one block down to St Germaine Blvd and then one block over to the left ) that included fried eggs and ham, bread, coffee, and juice, all for only 8 Euros. We generally ate lunch near whatever sightseeing were doing. After two significant meals for breakfast and lunch each day, we then usually had a light picnic for dinner in our room. You can buy fresh fruit, crackers, cheese, and wine from one of several small grocery stores within a two block radius of the hotel. One grocery store, called \u201cProxi,\u201d just down towards St. Germaine Blvd, was open late just about every day, until at least 9 PM. There are loads of cafes and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. We ate dinner one night at Ristorante Il Pescatore, an Italian restaurant right across the street, and it was good. We had lunch one day at the Caf\u00e9 just down the street on the corner of Rue St. Genevieve, and it was good. We also had dinner one night at a vegetarian restaurant, Le Grenier de Notre Dame, almost right across the river from the cathedral at 18 rue B\u00fbcherie. We found the Le Grenier from a website called Tom\u2019s guide (google \u201cTom\u201d and \u201cguide\u201d and \u201cParis\u201d). On his website, Tom reviews quite a few restaurants, many within a five minute walk of St. Jacques. The St. Jacques is in the middle of the Parisian University district just a block or so from part of the Sorbonne campus. Other reviewers on Trip Advisor have mentioned student-related noise from the street late at night. We did not hear anything much in our Room 15, located on the back side of the hotel, but our children, in Room 18 located on the front side of the hotel, did hear some student noise but they said it didn\u2019t bother them. Of course, this may be more of a problem in warmer months when the windows are open. Interestingly, while we were out walking two evenings we did see police in riot gear and long lines of parked police vehicles immediately adjacent to the Sorbonne, but they all seemed to be just waiting around. Then, one afternoon, as we were walking near the Cluny museum, we saw an active student protest blocking an intersection in all four directions. My wife was worried about this, but as the Parisians around us just calmly went about their business I said let\u2019s stay and watch. After a few minutes some mortorcycle policemen arrived and the demonstration broke up peacefully. The St. Jacques desk staff was efficient and friendly, and the three of them we interacted with spoke English. The only thing we really needed from them during our stay was a 220 adapter prong for our laptop computer, and they quickly came up with one of those. OK, this review was kind of long, but if you are still reading, then let me sum it up by stating that we very much enjoyed the St. Jacques and if we come back to Paris will likely stay there again.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lyndonville, Vermont, USA", "Title": "\u201cTerrific location; pleasant front desk service; worth a repeat visit.\u201d", "Author": "wpdame3", "ReviewID": "UR25621937", "Content": "This was our second visit to the St. Jacques and it will not be our last.

My experience was very, very different. Upon arrival, I staggered in with my bags late in the evening. It was clear I was beyond exhausted. The rude, rude man at the desk told me the lift was broken but should be fixed in an hour. I of course, would not expect conceirge service at a 2-star hotel in Paris, but none of the staff standing around lifted a finger to help me haul my bags up 4 flights of stairs, as I could not stand in the lobby for an hour waiting for the lift, as I was nearly ready to pass out from exhaustion. My room was a joke. I was told I would have a full bath on my email confirmation, but got a shower instead, and was too tired to argue. The \"room\" consisted of a tiny, (6x4 foot - I'm not kidding) lower level and an up-to-date renovated shower room (about 3x5), but the bed was in a loft area, up another 14 stairs. There was a chair jammed in the lower level, but no real room to even sit down for a minute, except for the bed up the stairs. If two people were sharing this room, one would have to stay upstairs while you are on the lower level. There is no way two people could occupy or dress on the lower level. This was during down season and most of the hotel was empty. I was given a room facing the alley, which provided a lovely view of rats scurrying about and vagrants using the alley as a toilet. I ended up storing my clothes on the stairway, which was a bit dangerous when trying to get down the narrow 14 stairs to use the bathroom at night. I was given no introduction to Paris, or a map or directions to the metro. Every other hotel I stayed at in Paris, from 2-4 stars provide at least some welcome and orientation. The deskman yelled at me (I'm not kidding) for not turning in my key before heading out for the day. I did not know that is what they wanted, as no one explained it and none of the other hotels I had booked in Paris expected this. I very politely explained this to him and said I was sorry (he speaks fluent English) and he treated me like I was a total idiot. The chamber maids did a very poor job cleaning my room. Toilet paper was not replaced, neither was soap or shampoo and yes, I did leave a tip out every morning, which they took. I was provided with two towels, and that's it. Carpet was not vacuumed once in 3 days. When I arrived the two micro glasses in the shower area were dirty with a previous guests toothpaste. The next day, these glasses were still not changed. I took them down to the rude owner and asked if I could have clean glasses, as these were still dirty from the previous occupant. He said he \"didn't have any other ones\". Finally, and very grudgingly, he got me two glasses from the bar and acted like I was the world's biggest aggravation. These glasses were never changed either and I finally bought some dish soap and washed them myself. The elevator worked once during the three days I was there. They claim room service is available for breakfast, but only if you order the petit dejeurner, which consists or a rock hard chunk of baguette, a decent croissant coffee, juice and fruit salad for 15 euro, which is about $28 Canadian. I ordered coffee the first morning and it did not arrive after 45 mintues. I phone the angry front desk man and asked if my coffee was coming or should I just head to a cafe. He rudely said \"the girl must have forgotten\" like it was my fault. No apology provided. When the \"girl\" arrived, even she didn't know where we could find space to set down the coffee tray. I finally took my suitcase upstairs and put it on the bed and we used the luggage rack for the coffee tray. One morning I tried the breakfast room. The young lady working there did not speak English. I heard her go upstairs and ask what I meant by omlette (which they have on the menu in English and French and which I pointed to and then mimed) and heard the rude man screaming at her for 15 minutes about my breakfast. Very pleasant for me to sit through. My French is good enough to know he was being abusive to her. After waiting for coffee for 30 minutes and still no omlette, I was ready to go cook it myself. When it finally arrived, the girl looked ready to cry. I can only imagine what it must be like to work for such an angry boss or owner. Yes, the hotel has frescos and looks very charming and has been renovated, is located near the tourist area and the bathroom was new. But the treatment I received would have made a tent in a field seem more inviting. There are literally 100 other 2 star hotels in this district and I suggest you book one of them. I paid 110 Euros a night for this debacle. I truly recommend springing for the extra 60 Euros and moving up to a three star hotel, where in my experience you will be treated like an honoured guest. You don't want to walk for 8 hours at the museums and cringe when you think of having to head back to your hotel. I stayed at the Hotel Aramis, another 2 star hotel for only $98 euro a night, also in a central district, and was treated like a guest by all staff, so there are other options, I really suggest you look for them and avoid this place. I left as soon as possible for another hotel and enjoyed my stay elsewhere.

We had room #16 and although, I have to admit, it was smaller than I was expecting (we did not have a balcony or a view of Pantheon/Notre Dame as some rooms seem to), it was very clean and we loved the murals on the walls and Queen size bed. The bathroom was a good size, very updated, with good water pressure. My only complaint in this area is the hair dryer cannot be used very long before your hand gets too hot holding it.

I noticed several reviews mentioning the remodelling noise. We did see the remodelling going on when we were there but were never woken up by it - any noise (and it was minimal near our room) seemed to start after our wake-up call. There was evidence of the remodelling in the hallways but it didn't bother us. I do agree with the other reviewers, however, that maybe it would be appropriate for them to make mention of the remodelling when reservations are made (or maybe give an incentive like a discounted or free breakfast during the remodelling stage). I think I read on their website that they are adding air conditioning so I think it is a positive feature of the hotel that they are remodelling the rooms and adding a/c. We were especially impressed with the staff and found that all of them were extremely helpful, courteous and friendly to us.

My personal preference is for older, \"belle epoque\" era hotels in France, as chrome and glass does little for my sensibilities when travelling in Europe. The St Jacques fit the description well. It is much underrated as a Parisian 2 star, properly deserving at least a 3 and perhaps even a 3+. It is not new, does not need to be, and carries its age with grace and dignity befitting its location and style. The St Jacques was well situated for my presentation at an environmental law conference just down the street at the Sorbonne, which was why I initialy chose it. The online reviews were fairly consistent and complimentary, so I took a chance. I was not disappointed. A quaint and charming hotel run by a superbly knowledgable and helpful staff, I enjoyed every moment of my 6 day stay. Little details like recommending taking an umbrella from the hotel stand due to an unfriendly weather forecast, or recommending good restaurants appropriately suited to my mood and requests, both close by as well as in other arrondissements, directing me to the various Metro lines, exchanges, shopping, restaurants, etc, and locating phone numbers in the directory, not to mention fielding phone calls from Air France tracking my lost luggage for two days, all while patiently putting up with my badly fractured French and gently assisting with pronunciation and vocabulary, are simply a few examples of the kind and gracious hospitality that Joe, Brigitte, Alexski and a few others extended. Even the housecleaning staff was smiling, friendly and warm. Breakfast in the hotel's antique-filled Toulouse-Lautrec dining room was no less well prepared and served than that at Cafe AuxTours de Notre Dame where I stopped one morning. Ask for my room, number 10, a superior double room displayed on the hotel website replete with a fresco wall mural and plasma TV. I recommend this hotel for those who have an image of a small, friendly hotel in the Latin Quarter. You won't forget it. I am hopefully planning a return trip to the St Jacques with my family of 4 later this year if we can finalize schedules before the larger rooms are booked.

This was a superior room booked directly with the hotel. There are 3 grades of room (standard, superior and deluxe). The standard rooms are small (I peered into a room which was being redecorated), our superior room in the corner of the building was large with 2 windows; we didn\u2019t get to see the deluxe rooms. Leaning out of our window we could see both the Pantheon and Notre Dame. The links with the Audrey Hepburn movie Charade made an interesting talking point with friends/colleagues. The hotel staff were fairly helpful. I think I met the grumpy receptionist mentioned by the previous reviewer but he wasn\u2019t that bad - for example, he was gruff but arranged for me to check in early and he really put himself out to help with a dodgy remote control (which turned to be my fault). We had an issue about the receipt as did the last reviewer, but the receptionist who was working on that day was in fact very helpful indeed when we explained what we needed. Overall, the hotel does everything within its control to provide a good experience. We liked the complementary umbrellas available at reception (v rainy when we were there) and the boiled sweets. There\u2019s a laptop in the reception for internet access (you have to ask for the computer) and there\u2019s wireless internet access in reception and on the second floor. However, the issue for us was noise. Rue des Ecoles is busy day and night. Outside the hotel is a set of traffic lights, so there is traffic accelerating and decelerating outside the window (which are double glazed but didn\u2019t block out noise sufficiently). Noisy motorcycles buzz by with annoying frequency. People singing and shouting in the street were perhaps not expected at 3am\u2026 (they weren\u2019t British!). Most of the rooms look over the main road \u2013 apparently only the deluxe rooms face away from the road (so we were told by Mr Grumpy). I don\u2019t know how much quieter the rooms at the back were \u2013 the alley out the back seemed quite noisy. I guess it depends on your tolerance of noise. A few other hotels in the Latin quarter are situated down side streets (and are quieter as a result). Interestingly, we couldn\u2019t hear noise from the other rooms \u2013 many old buildings converted into hotels have flimsy walls. This place was an exception \u2013 noise insulation from other rooms was good, although guests chatting in the corridor outside our room on their return at night seemed very loud and woke us up. The location of the hotel was good \u2013 only a medium/short walk to other attractions. By the way, don\u2019t confuse this hotel with the similarly named Hotel Relais St Jacques (also in the Latin quarter). We didn\u2019t pay for breakfast in the hotel - there were street markets and a boulangerie nearby which were fine for breakfast. Our non-hotel top tips were the next door Manga caf\u00e9 next door (wireless internet access with unlimited non-alcoholic drinks, comfy sofas etc) and restaurants around the Pantheon. On balance, price-wise this place was good value, with a reasonable location. The staff were good. However, we wouldn\u2019t stay there again because of the noise.

First of all I have to mention that the price was a bargain - winter promotion including breakfast - just 90 euros per night for 2 people for double room. I was suspicious so I called the reception to ask about the bed size (since my boyfriend is 190cm -maybe the price was low because it was a single bed or something). But I kind receptionist explained that the room was smaller than others, but the size of bed is normal (double). When we arrived - the room was perfectly CLEAN, we had even a hair-drier in the bathroom plus we got the best view - Notre Dame on our right and Pantheon on our left (from our small french balcony). I was lucky! The room was on the 5th floor (so you have to climb one more floor because the last stop for the elevator is 4th floor). The elevator is not for people who weight too much because it is rather small! So be aware of that. The best thing is that you have a free safe in the room so we left our passports there. But the very best thing was the breakfast (mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm) and the people who were working there and were very very kind (all of them!).

I think that most Americans are used to having their butts kissed at most hotels they stay at in the States. The service industry at home is completely different than it is in Europe, particularly France. The people of Paris, are actually some of the kindest and most polite people I have come across. Their attitude is different, as their culture is different. They are doing you a service, and the way they see it, there is no reason they should have to take any crap from customers. They don't smile a whole lot, and they always seems to be in a hurry. Its just the nature of the city. But they say PLEASE and THANK YOU, and expect you to do the same. If you give them any kind of grief in a rude manner, they will likely not respond well. (At one hotel I stayed at, I saw an American man yelling at the front desk attendant, and after she tried to solve the problem, albeit not to his liking, she just walked away as he continued to yell.) In the States, if you yell, someone will likely help you faster. But here, if you are rude, they will walk away. And I say God Bless it.

When we arrived, we were greeted by a polite but not really friendly receptionist who handed us a key to our room and pointed ot the lift. The room itself must have been nice once, but not anymore. The carpeting was old and mildewed, the paint was in bad need of redoing and the view of the street was not what we had hoped for. The bathroom was small but modern enough, unfortunately, the shower leaked so badly, the carpet outside was rotted. The other problem was there were no free outlets in the room. In order to plug in chargers for cell phone or camera battery, we had to unplug one of the lamps and there were only two of them. The TV was the size of a box of kleenex. We had purchased a breakfast option, thinking it would be a timesaver. Unfortunately, the breakfasts were really sparse as well and served by one poor overworked woman who had long ago lost any passion for her work. The biggest problem though was service. We had requested recommendations for restaurants and were referred to what must be two of the worst restaurants in Paris. When we asked the concierge to book a restaurant from a guide book, she seemed irritated and said she had never heard of the place (even though it has been reviewed in multiple guide books.) Two days before we left, we inquired about reserving a van to the airport. We were told it could be done the day before, which we asked them to do. The night before our departure, we were told the van was \"unavailable\" and we would have to take a taxi. We found another van service which we reserved ourselves. On another occasion, we asked them to call a taxi and none showed up. When we tried to hail one ourselves, we were told that was \"not allowed\" even though we had waited a half an hour for the one they called.

The hotel must pump some sort of perfume into the air handling system to cover up the smell of cigarette smoke and the combination of the two was nauseating. To try to get rid of the smell, we opened the windows, but the street noise of partying students was so loud and went so late into the night (3AM) that we had to close the windows (and yet could still hear the street noise) By about 6AM, the people in the room next to us started their day and the walls in this hotel are so paper thin that it sounded like they were in the room with us. We were supposed to stay 8 nights but checked out after two nights.

We caught a hop on-hop-off city tour bus (L'Open Tour) 5 minutes from the hotel with several routes to choose from (Notre Dame Stop or Petit Pont Stop).

However, it was a disappointment that the receptionist chose to continue speaking on the telephone as we booked in and we got a very cursory welcome.

The noise above us subsided until we again were awoken at 5:30am as the 'elephants' again began their march across our ceiling. I went down to reception to complain yet again and found the offending 'elephant' in reception. He couldn't have cared less and gave just a cursory apology with a shrug of the shoulders.

The room did not have a plug available for any curling iron (I brought a duel voltage one) or any other electrical appliance in the bathroom other than a small shaver- in either room.

Room was small by american standards, as was the shower (but there was BEAUCOUP hot water). The room had a small TV (mostly french), hair drier and electronic safe. The other couple with whom we were travelling stayed in room 25 above us, which was comparable. The staff was most attentive, and all the desk people spoke english. Housekeeping was very good. We ate breakfast in the new breakfast room twice (E8), and everything was fine - My wife loved the coffee, and I enjoyed the chocolat chaud. The cafe across the street (Peregoid???) served me the best potatoes I've ever eaten, mashed with cheese and who knows what else, with a good steak au poivre. We all enjoyed our meals there, and the service was quite good. There was street noise to contend with (we slept with the bathroom window open), and we occasionally heard the people next door and our friends above.

We arrived after an exhausting overnight bus ride from London, which we thought we'd be able to sleep on. But becuase of the lengthy Chunnel security checks, we were up the whole time. When we arrived in Paris at around 7am, we thought, 'oh, lets take a long shot and see if we can check in around noon or so'. We came in (and we don't speak a word of French) and the staff was incredibly friendly and understanding, and they let us check in at 7:30am!! It was a trip-saver, for otherwise we would have wasted the whole day catching up on sleep. The room was small but perfect - it was on the top floor I think - and even had somewhat of a balcony (really the roof) where you could turn one way and see the Pantheon, and turn the other and see Notre Dame! The room was very cute, with lots of touches to make it romantic (i.e. interesting paint choices, artistic headboard, etc). Even more stunningly good customer service came months later, after we returned home and realized we had lost a role of film. We searched everywhere for days, until finally I realized we might have left it in one of the rooms. I emailed several of the hotels we stayed at, and the only one to reply to me was Hotel St. Jacques! They found a role of film matching the description (we had happened to mark the film with an 'X') and said they'd be happy to send it out. I wrote them back and said I would send them a self-addressed stamped envelope, but they said 'don't worry about it' and a few days later, I received the film in the mail from them!! The role was full of treasured pictures of our trip, and for them to go out of their way to not only find it and keep it safe for months, and then send it to us for free, is just absolutely wonderful. To even call it 'great customer service' is not glowing enough of a compliment -- it was just an extremely kind and caring thing for one human being to do for another. It also struck me that during Feb. 2003 the American press and government were saying some nasty things about France; but this hotel staff took the utmost care in making this yankee feel welcome and wanted in Paris, even as giant protests against the US government were marching down the streets outside. The rooms in all hotels vary slightly in quality but in time you forget the differences, as they are, after all, just places to sleep. But I will truly never forget the thoughfulness of this hotel's staff, which shines far and above any other place I have stayed.", "Date": "March 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFirst Time to Paris\u201d", "Author": "Vancouver_Roary", "ReviewID": "UR2968862", "Content": "This was our very first visit to Paris. We had chosen this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews, and on recommendations from several travel guides. We stayed at this hotel for 8 days in December. There were a lot of positive things about our stay: 1) The staff were very friendly 2) Our room (#25) had great views of the Notre Dame, and Pantheon. 3) Given all the stories about small hotel rooms in Europe, the room was a bit bigger than we expected 4) The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance of several attractions 5) The hotel is relatively cheap 6) The hotel is clean and tidy 7) The hotel is very close to the metro station 8) The staff spoke English, which was helpful because our French is rather weak On the downside: 1) You can hear quite a bit of renovation noise (which I admit is outside of the hotel's control), and from adjacent rooms. A cheap set of earplugs would be a good idea. 2) It was difficult to get a hot shower. The water temperature fluctuated a lot. 3) The beds were small and weren't all that comfortable. But I guess this is expected given the price (again, this is our first visit to Paris, so I don't have a reliable frame of reference... only North American hotels). So overall, we were pleased with our decision to stay at the Hotel St. Jacques. It is a basic hotel that delivers everything that a budget traveler could want.

The good point is the location. The bad points are numerous. The walls are paper thin, and you hear EVERYTHING being said and done clearly. The toilet in the hall is used constantly during the night. They are repainting the second floor and the paint fumes permeate the whole building. This is not the restuarant construction. This is work being done IN the hotel. The shower stall wouldn't drain. We stood in dirty water up to our ankles to bathe. When the problem was reported, we were told the maid had just cleaned and would come check it. No one came so my husband removed the drain cover everytime we showered so we wouldn't flood the bathroom. The sheets were never changed in six nights. Towels were forgotten. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I asked Joe if he would call our shuttle to reconfirm pickup for the airport. He said no because he didn't do business with Blue Van(GREAT shuttle). I didn't ask him to make the reservation just reconfirm. Since he spoke French I thought it would be easier than if I did it. I know this is budget hotel (118euro) a night, but we have been to Paris 7times and 6times in budget hotels (i.e. College du France--SUPER). None were this bad. I would never stay here again.
