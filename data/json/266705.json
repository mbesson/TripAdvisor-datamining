Yes, the single rooms are not large, but for one person I found the room more than adequate. Before I discovered Infanta Mercedes I was in a hotel with a much larger room, but breakfast there was 18 euros, wifi was slow and the price was a third as much again. While Tetuan is not a posh area, it is a regular neighbourhood and I never felt unsafe. It's also only 10 mins walk to the metro. Everything was clean, there was a bath/shower with plenty of hot water. I like that they have soap dispensers rather than little toiletries - much more eco-friendly. I enjoyed free wifi 24 hrs a day which was very fast & reliable. The buffet breakfast is included in the price and the selection was wonderful. Fresh fruit, cereal, hot food, cold food, pastries, all nicely presented. A great way to start one's day. Reception staff always very helpful and courteous. Loved the bowl of sweets on the reception desk. There is a lift in the lobby. My only concern was that I could hear other guests through the walls/ceiling, but that didn't overly detract from what I found to be the best value for money in the area. Each guest will weigh up what is important to him/her - for me as a seasoned traveller, I would definitely return here when in Madrid again. Sometimes it's the little things that make a difference and for me Hotel Infanta Mercedes served all my needs and more. Thank you.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maidenhead, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "David R", "ReviewID": "UR136664611", "Content": "I was booked into this hotel for a couple of days cause we wanted a city brake.

Decent size with adequate bathroom, very clean and comfortable. Parking in the street and, as it was a Sunday, it was free until the following morning from 9.00 a.m., then payable. The hotel did not have its own car park so, if travelling by car, you would need to keep this in mind. However, it was fairly near the Metro system for travelling into the historic centre of Madrid. We didn't eat dinner there but there the breakfast was excellent - good choice of dishes with fresh fruit, eggs, pastries, etc. and excellent coffee (even though from a machine!).

The hotel is in a residential neighbourhood that has all necessary shops and other services (hairdressers, dry cleaner, etc.), and is a five-minute walk from the nearest Metro station, with fast and regular connections to all parts of the city. Rooms are not huge -- I had an attic double for single use and wouldn't have liked to have shared it with anybody due to space limitations. Having said that, the room is provided with all the usual amenities, as well as heating and a/c, the bathroom is fully equipped (includes bath and bidet, items often left out of tourist hotel bathrooms nowadays given space considerations), and the room was extremely quiet. In fact, waking up in the morning to the sound of sparrows cheeping and a neighbour's chickens clucking around made it seem like a countryside hotel. Although breakfast is provided in the hotel at an extra charge, guests can hop across the road to the large bar that is directly in front of the hotel's front door and have breakfast and other meals there at reasonable prices. There are another couple of restaurants on the same street, in the direction of the Metro station. This is not a luxury hotel where you'd stay if you're seeking a five-star experience or a special honeymoon, for example. What it does offer is excellent value for money, excellent service from reception (nothing was too much bother for the staff), and a very quiet, safe environment in a nice residential neighbourhood which provides a new and refreshing take on Madrid if you're weary of staying in the noisy, dirty tourist centre which is plagued by pickpockets.", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNear the Bernabou.\u201d", "Author": "Chimper123", "ReviewID": "UR15527062", "Content": "Nice hotel 10 mins from the Bernabou Stadium.

It's also right near some supermarkets which is handy if you want some snacks and bottles of water etc as convienience stores were few and far between in this area.All up I'd say it is worth staying there, I only chose it was it was part of a package tour, otherwise I may have chosen somewhere more central.
