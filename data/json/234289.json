The Foxa 25 is just a short walk away and the feel is much nicer than the four star hotel on top of Charmartin station. Several good restaurants nearby. At Chamartin you have the Ave to Valladolid and Barcelona; there are the Cercanias trains there so 3 stops to Atocha for the Ave to Seville. For the airport best is Cercanias to Nuevos Ministerios (one stop) and another ticket on the metro to the airport. Less changing with baggage, much quicker and just a Euro more.
