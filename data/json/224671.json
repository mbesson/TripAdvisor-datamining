I had stayed at this hotel on a prior occasion and had a horrible stay. Like some other people on this board I never received my wake-up call. Being an airport hotel I would think it would be one of the most important things they have to take care of. (I usually set my cell phone alarm but had a battery failure). Anyway - dedided to give these guys a try again. Checked in the evening of Nov 7th. A gentleman completed my check-in. He seemed quite distracted. He asked me on three seperate occasions if I wanted points or gift for my Platinum Arrival gift. He gave me the key to my room and I headed to the elevator. Unfortunately the room number he wrote on the key does not even exist (that floor does not even exist). So I headed back downstairs and went to the front desk. This time a nice woman served me. Apologized and wrote a different room number on the card packet. I headed back to the elevator. Got to the room and the key didn't work. As a frequent traveller who travels over 175 nights a year there is nothing that is more annoying then getting to your room and the key does not work. Especially when you are lugging around bags, etc. So I again go back downstairs and tell the woman the key does not work. She says \"Oh - looks like he didn't program the key right... sorry\". She gives me a new key and a maintenance person who was watching offered to come up to my room to make sure it worked this time. Very nice of him. Finally got into the room. Room quality is still not up to par with other Courtyward hotels. The beds are very hard, rooms are dated. Nice pro - They offer free parking for Marriott Platinum Elite Guests (I think this is a great gesture and unfortunately it's not common among very many Marriott hotels; however, the full service Toronto Airport Marriott also offers this) Looking at the reviews there are some people who have for sure had a great stay... unfortunately for me 2 strikes and I generally won't go back. The first incident of the wake-up call failure was bad. Then having to make 3 trips to try and get in my room late at night... they need to get some policies in place at the front desk to ensure these types of issues don't happen.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern CA", "Title": "\u201cclean and nice\u201d", "Author": "Lovetravelpskk", "ReviewID": "UR120547822", "Content": "stay here twice in the last few months. clean and nice hotel near the airport.

The one thing I will say about this property is they had FANTASTIC folks working there. From the maintenance man who adjusted the temperature right through to front desk, breakfast server & cleaning staff we were always greeted with smiles and helped quickly. Awesome people. As for the rooms there's good wireless. If you're a couple with 2 computers make sure you ask for a second password at check in. Not a big deal but the password you get only works for one computer. There is not a fridge in the room but otherwise it's equipped and comfortable ... although the beds aren't my favourite. They were fine but after spending many nights in Starwood hotels with their heavenly beds I kind of missed the cushioning and good sheets. The gym is decent - no free weights but some decent cardio machines and a big multi-weight machine. The pool was a popular place for the kids on the weekend. Breakfast is about $15 for the buffet with eggs made to order. Pretty good food. It's the only meal they serve here but there are lots of choices around with the big Marriott nearby (great lounge there if you're interested), Greek in the parking lot and a few other restaurants within a few minutes drive or 10 minute walk. We had a little issue the one night as a boys hockey team checked in and it got REALLY loud about 45 minutes after we'd gone to sleep. Security was on the scene minutes after I called but it took about 90 minutes before they moved them out of their rooms to new rooms. The staff handled the situation pretty well but we did lose 3 hours of sleep over the whole thing... not too fun for us!! But I really commend security for being on top of it. It wasn't an easy scene to control. Overall it's a pretty good place for the price and the staff are going to bend over backwards to do what they can to help you out - and that's a huge thing for me!! And if you're interested in having a meeting there - the meeting rooms was set up exactly as we asked and everything went well. Really great business hotel!!

We also requested an extra mattress pad and were told they don't have mattress pads. Why not? We were given another duvet to put down on the bed and that made the bed more comfortable than our stay the first night. The carpets in our room were so filthy that your white socks turned black as soon as you walked across it once. Were given the ya, ya, ya, we will take care of that right away when we checked out. Not sure if the employee actually made a note of the dirty carpets or not, we sat in the lobby for quite awhile waiting for the shuttle and know that the employee didn't talk to housekeeping on the phone or to the manager who was sitting in the back room.

The hotel is very close to the airport but nice and quiet. It was spotlessly clean. The staff at the front desk and at the restaurant were extremely polite, friendly and helpful. We booked through the CAA and got a very cheap price. The room was excellent value for what we paid. When we arrived, the person at check in said that for the rate we were paying, normally we would have to pay to leave our car for the week, but he said he would not charge us at all. Ask for a room away from the ice machine - it made noise all night. The (cold) breakfast buffet was ok, nothing special, but again, dining room was very clean and waiter very nice. The shuttle to the airport runs every 20 minutes from 4 a.m. to 2 a.m. and is only a 5 minute ride.

I have used this hotel a couple times. It seems to be a favorite of my employer's local sales force. When not co-ordinating with them I choose another (usually the Sheraton Four Points back behind the airport on Dixie Rd) due to shortcomings I mention below. On the positive side, the rooms and common areas are cleaner and more nicely appointed than is usual at this price point. The pool and breakfast buffet is nicer than most. The location relative to the airport is about as convenient as it gets. The parking lot is crowded, but that seems to be a problem with all the hotels near the airport. The lay of the grounds and the slope of the hill, however, make unloading the car here rather aggravating, especially when (as when I stayed here in Feb '07) it is -4 F and they didn't do a good job removing snow. More important to me is the incomplete equipment in weight room. I don't ask for much: All I really need is a bench press and a set of free weights, or equivalent Nautilus-style machines. But the tiny exercise room doesn't have any free weights at all. There is no way, for example, to do curls. The most glaring shortcoming, however, is poor compatibility of the internet connection. Linux/Mac/PDA users beware. The wired connection will not work with Linux (well, I got it to work with an artful hack, but I can't expect ordinary users to do what I did). The Wi-Fi won't work with a Palm TX PDA. This is unacceptable to me. I left feedback to the management about these two shortcomings. If they fix the internet & put in a rack of free weights, this would be my favorite hotel in the area. Until then, I shall avoid it. If those shortcomings matter to you, I recommend you avoid it also; otherwise, it is a good choice.", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Courtyard Toronto Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d224671-Reviews-Courtyard_Toronto_Airport-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$112 - $247*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">231 Carlingview Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M9W5E8</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "224671", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/e8/92/85/courtyard-by-marriott.jpg"}}
