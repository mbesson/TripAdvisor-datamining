The price looked great (about half the cost of staying at the nearby resort hotels) and the recent reviews (after the remodel) were quite good, so we took a chance. Aina Nalu ended up being a fantastic choice! Based on recommendations in the reviews, we reserved a 1 br and contacted the hotel by e-mail to request a room on the second floor (stairs were not an issue for us) away from the highway. Both of these requests were met when we arrived. We did not have much of a view from our balcony, but there were plenty of other opportunities for amazing views. The window AC units worked fine, although we were not there during very hot weather. The location was fantastic. Front Street is just a short 2 block walk away, but the hotel was quiet. The public bus stop is just one block away, which allowed us to make a trip to the Maui Ocean Center without renting a car. The kitchen was nicely stocked with necessary cooking utensils and a grocery store is just about a 5 minute walk (as another review noted, definitely sign up for the free savings card to take advantage of additional deals). Housekeeping did a good job in terms of cleaning, but was not as good about replenishing some items. We had to ask for additional shampoo at the desk and very nearly ran out of toilet paper the last day. We searched all over our room (A209 I believe), but never did find the advertised wired internet. We were close enough to the lobby that we were able to pick up the wifi signal (weakly). There was no charge for the wifi. We also encountered one front desk lady who was a bit inattentive, but other staff members we encountered were very nice and helpful. Overall, we were very happy with our stay at Aina Nalu. We would definitely stay there again and would love to find similar places on each of the islands.

This trip we were going for 11 days and thought we would like to see what living in Lahaina might be like. So, I did a read so many TripAdvisor reviews that you wouldn't believe. Then, I landed on the Aina Nalu Resort in downtown Lahaina and walking distance to all of the restaurants, stores, markets, etc. So, I booked our stay at the Aina Nalu. I was in a little quandary because of some of the negative reviews, but let the much larger number of positive reviews help to make my decision. We love it here. It is like living here rather being a tourist. All of the staff is very friendly. Unit K205 is warm, comfortable and cozy in a nice way. I phoned Aina Nalu ahead of time and made some requests all of which they met. I asked for a second floor unit away from the 2 lane highway going boy Lahaina. I also wanted the vaulted ceiling with skylights. I recommend that you always phone ahead and let the resort know your preferences. When ever possible they always seem willing to accommodate you. Our condo had airconditioning in all of the living areas as well as ceiling fans. However, by opening a few louvered windows, We were able to appreciate a lovely tropical breeze as well as listening to the sounds of the local birds in the morning. And, no, they were not roosters as one reviewer complained. This is an older, well maintained and updated resort. Come enjoy Maui as a resident rather than a tourist and enjoy your stay at the Ainu Nalu in downtown Lahaina. It is all a matter of your attitude when you travel anywhere. I also recommend that you travel to Hawaii between December 5th and depart no later than December 25th.

I have a hip replacement and i could easily walk it. There's complimentary wired internet access in the rooms and free wireless in the lobby and around the pools. Speaking of the pools, they're exquisite. The \"big\" pool as its referred to is surrounded by palms trees, the mountains in the background, and at night they have the garden flames burning and it creates such a tremendous atmosphere. It feels like how i imagined Hawaii to be. The rooms were well equipped. We stayed in a 1 bed unit which had a fully equipped kitchen, 2 flat screen TVs, a comfortable bed and an air conditioner and fan in both the TV room and bedroom. The concierge was very helpful and most of the front desk staff were friendly. We were able to get a late check out free of charge and the housekeeping service was quick and efficient. Being a condominium resort - there was no on site restaurant or room service, but there's a great little pasta place across the street. Parking is also available but costs $15 a night - you could try parking on the street but it looked very busy. The only thing i would recommend was to make sure you don't get a room near the pool room as it was a tad noisy. We had our air conditioning on for most of the time and didn't hear it, but it could be annoying with the air conditioner off.

The grounds are lush, well maintained, and offer two pools and several BBQ spots. You either can rent the one or two bedroom apartments over private owners (cheaper) at vrbo.com or the Outrigger Hotel. So far I only stayed within the private owner apartments and had nothing to complain about since all units are furnished the same and only \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if at all - differ in accessories. Unfortunately Outrigger started to get sloppy with the house rules over the years. The closer the weekend gets the louder your fellow vacationers and some of their kids are getting. If the worst comes to the worst you are facing overcrowded pools with high level screaming kids starting before the official pool hours or adults partying all night connecting several apartments with each other. This might be a huge issue if you are looking for a relaxing and quiet stay away from the crowds. In this case you should take a closer look into Kapalua further north from Lahaina, an upscale but very quiet and small community with rental apartments/homes along golf courses and high-class hotels. If you toy with the idea of staying in areas like Wailea, Kaanapali, Napili be aware of a gapless arrangement of overdone mega resorts and their guests. Nevertheless I still recommend my followers on travelin-mate.com to choose Aina Nalu over any other hotel or B&B on Maui. But I recommend selecting the apartment location well. Stay off the pool areas and only in the second floor, away from Wainee Street where the check-in and the street side parking is located. And finally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay the outrageous parking fees! Save the 15 bucks per night and look for free parking along Wainee Street instead. In the morning and evening after 6pm you should easily find a spot! Lahaina itself is a lovely small village with its center along Front Street and the ocean offering surf and souvenir shops, galleries, and in- and outdoor restaurants, most situated at the ocean with marvelous view towards Lanai. The only downside are the plenty \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvisitor informations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 offering cheap tours and luaus to pedestrians. Taking a closer look those kiosks turn out to be collecting pits for timeshare sales! Their offers come hours of sales meetings! Parallel to Front Street you will find two supermarkets (Foodland and Safeway) and several shopping centers with local and national designers and chains. Lahaina is only 30-40 minutes by car away from Kahului (airport), 1hr from Road to Hana and Haleakala volcano. It has much more charm than Wailea, Kanaapali, Napili and offers next to a great beginner surf-spot, the best snorkel spot on the island and several golf courses.

Parking is $15 per day and the front desk will not let you pay on a day-by-day basis. We paid to park on the complex grounds for the first week but parked on the street thereafter. There are parking spots on the street adjacent to the complex, there are 3 spots across the street in front of Snorkel Bob's and there's a $5 lot one block northwest on Wainee St. (the street that runs alongside the complex). Use caution when choosing a unit to rent. Some of the buildings are within spitting distance of the highway and non-stop traffic noise. Also, the State is currently building a concrete wall along the highway and they start work early in the morning. My biggest complaint abouy this stay was the company I used to rent the unit. I will never rent a condo through Maui Beachfront Rentals again! They quoted me one price when I initially comtacted them, then changed it to a higher price when it was time to sign the contract. After inquiring about the price change, they lowered it back to the original quote. Throughout my communications with MBR, I emphasized that I needed the unit for an additional half day due to a late flight. Even though I paid for the additional half day, and it was written into the contract, and during my stay I called MBR to remind them that I was checking out late, the cleaning crew arrived at noon on our last day. The cleaning crew wouldn't leave until I proved to them that I was entitled to the unit until midnight. Mary of MBR took a \"too bad for you\" attitude when I expressed my displeasure.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Aina Nalu Lahaina", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60634-d1167033-Reviews-Aina_Nalu_Lahaina-Lahaina_Maui_Hawaii.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">660 Wainee Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Lahaina</span>, Maui, <span property=\"v:region\">HI</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">96761</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1167033", "ImgURL": ""}}
