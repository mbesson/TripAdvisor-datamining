No issues. Great hotel for the grounds, the pool, the beach and all the amenities a large resort has to offer. Asked for a renovated room, got (421). It was fine, nice view looking NE. No fridge, so we asked for one, delivered in 30 minutes. Water was plenty clear for snorkling and there are fish to see and feed. Beach is especailly nice for kids. The grounds are well kept and the area around the Lemon Grass is full of animals and birds and fish. Nice place to relax in out of the sun. Ate at Lemon Grass and Morton's. Both were fine. Yes, expensive, but it's a resort. Many good resturants in Old San Juan and in the Condado area. Didn't have a bad meal anywhere. Cheaper than a taxi, take the M3 or 21 bus to Old San Juan. Bus stop is on Ponce de Leon. Go down the street past the Subway past the San Juan hotel. Look right and you'll see the stop going west. Stop on the way back is across the road. 75 cents per trip, need exact change. Catch the same bus back at the Old San Juan bus station, just down the road from where the bus lets you off.

Look for a Subway restaurant and turn to the right. There is diving instruction and snorkle rental at the hotel. Plenty of beach chairs and even hamocks. It is only about a mile to Old San Juan. It is usually easy to find someone who speaks English but remember Spanish is the common language. This was not a problem and I even got to try out my poor Spanish. As I would apoligize for my Spanish they would often apoligize for their English. Having said this let me assure you Spanish is not necessary in most cases. I would be happy to return to the Caribe Hilton and I think I would spend some more time on the property. One caution, if you are driving, these are the sweetest people on the planet until they get into a car. Defensive driving is not a pass time but a necessity.

This is an older hotel that is in a state of renovation, but once completed it will be world class once again. The staff was very professional and efficient. There is a great Subway around the corner that cooked fresh omlettes and french toast which is something you can't get from the Subways in Canada and it provided an economical alternative to eating at the hotel everyday even though the Hotel food was OK it was overpriced for what you recieved. The steakhouse restauraunt was the only exception and it was great. There is a small public beach next to the hotel which has \"Scuba Dogs\" who are one of the best and very well priced dive shops around. They have a small man made reef on site good for basic fish observation because the breakwater shelters both beaches. It can be crowded at times. They also give PADI courses and arrange dives at other great sites away from San Juan. This hotel is on the island of Old San Juan and you can get to the heart of Old or New San Juan on foot or with a very short cab ride. The location is the best and for anyone spending an extended stay rather than simply overnighting before or after a cruise, this is one of the best places to stay. They often have good deals on spare rooms for the cruise crowd as well and you can occasionally get a low rate even less than the budget chain hotels if you shop in advance online.

I read lots of great reviews here and was able to book a good price through discover card. Arrived by taxi from the airport. First impression was amazing.

No matter, only there for one day and really booked it for its location to the cruise pier. The hotel staff was very nice and professional. Upon first inspection both the hotel and room looked great. Then you look at the details and really see that the hotel is on need of an overhaul. Walls all over the resort were crumbling, the windows/window trim in our room looked like they had never been cleaned. Dirt, cobwebs, and \"black goo\" was all over them. Then I sat on the mattress. I thought for a minute that the cleaning staff had taken away the mattress and left just a boxspring behind. I seriously thought about sleeping on the sofa bed because it was more comfortable. Food was good, but I felt it was way overpriced. My wife and I split a pizza in the Italian restaurant because it was the only thing we felt was worth the money. We had breakfast the next morning at the little buffet in the Italian restaurant. Be warned, you only get ONE trip through the hot item line, so stock up. Fruit, pastries, cereal, etc are all bottomless. The outdoor facilities are amazing. Beautiful beach, great pool, with tons of chairs. They also had a cool little observation deck out in the water where you could watch fish on the reef. At night they turn a big light on at the deck. We saw some huge fish out there at night. Plenty of taxis on grounds the day of the cruise, and it looked like there were tons of other people headed for ships.

We arrived quite early and tried to get our room, which was not yet available, so we went to the PiNa Colada restauarnt for lunch to kill time.

The room, though spacious, clean and with nice, soft, Hilton beds, had the feel of a shabby beach shack. The showers in particular were cheap and old, and anything that was capable of rusting was totally corroded. We had a very nice ocean view from inside the room, but standing on the balcony itself made a bunch of trucks and equipment visible. Housekeeping service was very spotty -- one day we had to request that our room be done (the problem was taken care of going forward). And we had an episode at the end of the trip with the laundry service that showcased a real incompetence: a simple change of clothes that we had sent to have washed for each family member to wear on the plane ride home - we were told - would not be back in time despite our timely delivery to the service. What should have been a totally avoidable problem turned into a nail-biting episode of \"will we have to wear the hotel robes on the plane?\" (bags had been packed and taken by then).

It is also a good idea to get to the pool early if you want to get a choice place to lounge. 7:00 AM is best. During busy times the pool area fills up fast, but there are plenty of chairs around, just not if you want some shade. Those lounge charis go fast. If you plan to stay on their beach, an attendant will help you set up your lounge chairs and umbrella. Quite a nice service. So we are big \"foodies\". We love the Pina Colada Restaurant. The best things we have tried are the pulled pork sandwhich (the bread is so light and tasty) and for appetizers the cerveche served with fried plantain chips is totally incredible. Nelson was our server is such a great guy and he really sees to it that you are having a good time! He even remembered us from our trip two years ago. Another favorite onsite restaurant of ours is Morton's Steakhouse. If you go, ask for a table by the windows so you can look out onto the beach. Try the potatoes au gratin as a side dish -- pure heaven! My only complaint was the Olas Spa. We booked 4 massage appointments (over two different days). Our massages were supposed to be 50 minutes, but we both felt they were less time. Also, if you have ever had a great massage, you know that getting your head, hands and feet rubbed is one of the best parts of the experience. My masseuse did not do any of that. We had two other appoints booked later on during our stay. Due to my sunburn, I decided to cancel my second spa appointment. I called the spa at 8:00 AM to cancel my 4:00 PM appointment. I spoke to Glenda who told me that I was not giving them enough notice and I would get charged for the service. When I told her that I did not think this was fair considering how early in the day it was. Plus the hotel was almost fully booked so filling that spot was most likely not going to be a problem. She told me she would have to check with her manager and then hung up on me! I wanted closure on this so I walked over to speak with her in person. She still was unwilling to help so I went to the hotel manager. In the end I was not charged. If you are someone who knows what a great spa experience is, I would stay away from there. Another really fun thing to do at the Caribe Hilton is feed the fish! There's a basket by the towel stand. In it is leftover bread and bagels from the breakfast crowd. You are encouraged to take some over to the end of their pier and feed the fish. You would be surprised how many beautiful fish come around to grab that bread. Make sure you have your camera ready!

We were stuck a second time before a daily hike at El Yunque and visited the Il Giardino (family style restaurant) and were blessed with overpriced cafeteria style food. The rest of our $170 went towards drinks and Starbucks.

We stayed in the villas and our friends stayed in the main hotel. Our room in the villas was nice with a refrigerator and microwave and a nice balcony, but basically just a hotel room. Bath was nice with a walk-in shower. Temp in room was either too hot or too cold, never just right. Walk to main hotel was definately a turn-off and I would not reccomend staying in the villas for that reason. Our friends had a room in the main hotel which had been renovated but was still just a basic room. One of the elevators was broken which made it pretty miserable. The hotel is in need of desperate renovation in all public areas. Very shabby and worn. One of the biggest things to note is that there were tons of children around and they were not monitored by parents or hotel staff. The hot tub was useless because it was constantly filled with children all under the age of 10 and many with floaties on. The wall around the upper and lower pools has an infinity edge and children raced around it constantly. They also climbed to the top of several walls and then jumped into the pool from the walls. In our opinion, this is a major disaster waiting to happen. It had a major \"Disney World\" feel to it. Towels were located only by the beach so if you were going to the pool you were required to walk all the way over to the beach to get towels. Service was OK. Could have been much quicker, however, one of the waiters at the beach and pool really stood out. His name is Yuriy and he was excellent! All 4 of us are in our early 50's and like to have a good time. I teach first grade so I am clearly not opposed to children but the way they were monitored was ridiculous. We stayed at the Westin on St. John last spring and they managed a great Kid's Camp for the children! We will be in San Juan 2-3 times a year and I would not reccomend this hotel.

Part of it was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153little things\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that kind of irked me the whole time I was here. And sometimes it is the little things that can ruin a stay. First of all, although the employees are pleasant and nice people all around, this place is completely disorganized. Yesterday, for example, I had to send a fax to my office. I went to the business center, and the person in charge was on their lunch break. There is a phone there for the operator, and they said the front desk could do it. I went down there and there was ONE person checking people in and SEVENTEEN people in line. I walked up to see if there was an area I could fax something, and the woman said yes, but I had to wait in line. I walked over to the concierge and said that lunch time was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for that. Huh? Because people take lunch breaks during a time when a lot of people are naturally checking in? Took over an hour for me to send a fax. Yesterday morning when we were heading to the pool, I called housekeeping and asked them to make up room, but drop off shampoo and conditioner since we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any. Came back? No shampoo or conditioner. So I called and asked. Went to the pool, then dinner. Came back? None. Called. Went to bar and watched a basketball game. Came back. None. Called again (it was now 10:30 pm). Said they would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be right there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hour later? Nothing. I finally asked to talk to the manager of the hotel. Next thing you know? Woman shows up with a whole bag full of shampoo and conditioner. At 11:30 pm or so. Finally. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Went to the pool. No towels. Went to the concierge. No towels. Went to the front desk. They said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one moment, we will take care of it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 45 minutes later finally got towels to go to pool. And then there is the rooms. Bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 lock broken, no soap tray (broken off). Remote control on TV horrible. Numbers do not work on it, so you have to leaf channel by channel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and you had to squeeze it with all your strength and even then it did not work sometimes. (It would be nice if they put a channel guide in the room also\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 little things) Then this evening\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 my daughter and I had wrapped up some food and put in the mini-refrigerator that is in the room (We are in a villa). In the kitchen are cabinets, coffee maker, refrigerator, etc., but nothing else. No plates, no silverware, nothing. So we called for two plates and two forks from room service. They said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that will be $5\". ONE HOUR LATER\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 nothing. Call again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry sir.. be right there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 35 minutes later, my daughter says she is starving\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 So we go eat. We get back her after an hour or so? No plates or silverware. When I came in to the room on initial check in, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the lights to work on the desk or in corner of room. Everything was unplugged.

This place is a maze and. while there are signs throughout, they're not that easy to follow, especially if you've just arrived in town after a long flight and are a bit tired. If you do book a room, DO make sure that the front desk tells you which building you are in (villa 1, villa 2, etc.) and DO request of map if available because I'm a fairly decent navigator but I had to stop to ask a couple of the super nice staff to point us in the right direction. The rooms are nice and while not everyone gets a spectacular ocean view, you're not exactly overlooking the city dump either so you won't be stuck with a really bad view no matter where you are. Our room came with a mini fridge, a microwave, sink, and plates. For some reason, there was no dish detergent to wash the dishes we used so I felt like a bit of a rat leaving a couple of dirty plates for the maid (I could almost hear my mother now). Another nice touch is the Peter Thomas Roth shampoo, conditioner and lotion in the bathroom. Good stuff. The Caribe has several restaurants on the premises to suit different tastes and needs and there is a pricey but tasty breakfast buffet offered each morning (you can order a la carte too but it runs up to be nearly the same price, FYI). For coffee-a-holics like me, there is a Starbucks on site and few gift shops as well. If you chose to stray off of the hotel grounds, you are still in the city and can probably get a cab or even walk to nearby restaurants. That's the beauty of this place's location. Finally, the grounds. As I alluded to earlier, this place is pretty large. It has a couple of interconnecting pools, an outdoor bar (and plenty of places to get sloshed indoors as well), it's own private beach (that's mellow enough for the kids to splash about in; no massive waves, anyway) and a ton of places to lounge about in the sun. Though there are chairs and chaise lounges all over the place, one of the cool things that they had were these giant foam beds to sunbathe on up near the footpath that parallels the ocean. They were usually occupied by the early birds but that doesn't mean you should'nt try to nab one of these comfortable places to snooze/read/people-watch. As for the footpath, it's a nice place to stroll by the water and check out the modern city skyline as it contrasts with some of the amazing, much older ruins of the ancient forts that share space in close quarters. You are relatively near Old San Juan and you can either walk there (it's about a mile, plus or minus) or, again, hail a cab. I really liked this place and I can't say enough about the extremely friendly staff that works there; they made us feel very welcome.

We stayed 3 nights Feb/Mar 2012. Had modern King bed room high in the HH Tower.

Lobby, Spa, Restaurants are all very up to date and have a great feel. Spa was nice but you have to walk a couple of hundred yards to the front doors. Lots of room in lobby reception area to sit and relax. Pools were fantastic. There are hundreds of lounge chairs, hammocks and dozens of places to enjoy the breeze without being right on top of the next guy. The pool bar/restaurant is great. Poolside and swim up service were very good. It would be very easy to not leave the hotel compound. Having said that: get out of the compound and go to the Forts and the old town San Juan area. Bring your own sunscreen, it is VERY expensive (over double of the CVS in old town) at the hotel shop. Eat in the local restaurants, and enjoy the feel of the culture. The cab ride to/from the hotel-airport should be around $15 cash for two people and a couple of bags. The meters were mysteriously \"broken\" in EVERY cab we took so it appears the pre-trip negotiation is in order every time. We got screwed for an extra $13 on the initial ride to the hotel. The old town horse drawn carriage ride is \"ok\" but if you're tall you will never see anything unless you sit on the floor. If you weigh less than 230 you can take a Segway tour departing Pier 2 that takes you all over old town. Recommend this. Also recommend taking cab ($10) from hotel to old town (pier 2) and then utilizing the free trolley to move around. They run on a loose schedule but have roughly 30 stops and will cover all the area a casual tourist would want to see. Do yourself a favor and look up the schedule for arrival of the cruise ships at the pier. Old Town gets VERY congested when 3000 people disembark and fan out. Hit as much as you can early in the day, wear comfortable shoes to hike around and then enjoy people watching in the late afternoon. Get to old town restaurants late afternoon/early evening, or make a reservation. Cafe Puerto Rico in old town is excellent but busy after 6:00 P.M. Sit outside if you can.

I loved it and would definitely come back. I've stayed in the Marriott in Condado, and at El Convento in Old San Juan, but this was my favorite place as a place to stay for a whole trip to Puerto Rico. We spent this trip in the San Juan area (besides an excursion to El Yunque, booked through the hotel concierge for $77/person). The Caribe Hilton has it's own private beach, unlike the other hotels in Condado (one long public beach with private pool areas) or in Old San Juan (no beach). We could walk 40 minutes west to Old San Juan or 30 minutes east to Condado, or 15 minutes south to Miramar, or take a fast $12 cab ride from the hotel to Old San Juan (not sure how much to Condado, since we walked it. We didn't rent a car, but if you did, they have a parking lot. As for the hotel itself, it's clean and chic, and we stayed in one of their \"renovated rooms\". Not sure if the check-in woman just wanted to make us feel better that our floor still had a little dust from putting in the new carpeting, and they just finished putting up the artwork by the elevator on our floor the day after we checked in. But it was good to know everything was brand new, and the hotel room was beautiful! But beware, we stayed on the 3rd floor on the west side, and it was right over the mechanical roof of the lobby, so when our door was open, we could hear a droning sound. But it wasn't anything too bad. If you are on a higher floor, you probably wouldn't hear anything. All of the hotel staff were pretty friendly, including the three parrots in the lobby, who know how to say \"hola\" and \"hello\". At night, you can hear the coquis all around outside. Something you'd miss if you stayed in Condado. The beach area was so great, we didn't even go in the pool. They used riprap to create a sort of lagoon, with a gradually sloping beach facing north and west. It's not a very large beach, but even though there were a lot of people (president's day weekend), there was still plenty of beach chairs, umbrellas, and room to swim. The hammocks tended to get filled up until the afternoon (but they are awesome for when you want to get a break from the sun in the dappled shade of the palm trees), and the couches out over the water also got claimed early in the morning. We were hitting the beach around 9am each time we spent the morning at the hotel. The bar food is surprisingly plentiful, which made the price not so bad (I'm from New York though, so if you're from somewhere else, you may think it's expensive). Pina coladas are $10, from a mix, but pretty good and refreshing, with a maraschino cherry in each one. All in all, it has a great location right between Old San Juan, Condado, and Miramar, the private beach is great, and the room was chic and comfortable.

After spending 3 days here is my review: This place is very nice for the following reasons: 1) has a nice private beach; and an excellent swimming pool area. 2) it has an excellent location from where, with a rental car you can visit most places; 3) views are great and place is rooms are very quiet. However think about the following before you make reservations: 1) Is one of the most expensive hotels in San Juan: rooms and food. 2) It might get crowded, having as a consequence a very slow service. 3) Hotel is not that big, and common areas might get crowded too. 5) The hotel was built during the 1970's, some rooms are old. Depending the season (low or hight) and if you're traveling or not with family I would select Caribe Hilton.But if you're just waiting for the cruise or spending a couple of days in PR, give a shot to Hilton Double tree in Condado.

The cleaning service for rooms was uneven; on 2 days, our room was not cleaned by 5 pm (they did send someone when we complained). Also, leave absolutely nothing of value in your car in their garage; a friend's car was burglarized while parked there, and the management response was not very helpful. I am not sure this is different, however, than elsewhere. (The thieves used an RFID reader, it appears, to break into the car by \"reading\" the code when the car was being locked electronically.) The hotel is c. 2 miles from Old San Juan; easily reachable by car, of course, but parking availability is very poor and traffic in the Old city is horrendous. Avoid it on holidays; roads are blocked off and access is slow and difficult. Even so, this hotel is by far the closest luxury hotel to Old San Juan that is on a beach and a fabulous beach at that.

I stayed here as a pre-cruise hotel, on Sat 11th Sept 2010. Travelled with family consisting of - Mum, Dad (mid-late 50s), Brother (23yrs) & me (28yrs): Transfer from the airport was fairly painless, drivers were waiting at the luggage collection point. It was about 10-15 min ride, very smooth on the motorway, down to the port area. We got to our hotel 'Caribe Hilton' about 9pm, and the first thing you notice is that the lobby is open spaced & bathed in pretty blue light - nice touch for weary travellers! Check-in was quite busy despite the time of night; seemed quite a few cruise passengers we checking in. Service was swift, but front desk staff seemed indifferent & devoid of any real welcome or warmth... We made our own way to our room - there was a bell boy service for those that wished to use it. Our rooms were a decent size & spotlessly clean - we were on the 15th floor which allowed for amazing views of the private beach, the sea/coastline & lake/bay area - this is what makes this location! As there really isn't much else to looks at... We had two lovely double beds, tea/coffee facilities, built in wardrobes, seating area with a flat screen tv & a desk area. Had a nice size bathroom with crab tree & Evelyn goodies, walk-in shower with two types of head - one massive one attached to the celling and another more standard one on the wall- water pressure was ok - expected it to be more powerfull. we were too tired and hungry to really appreciate or explore the area, we weren't missing much since there wasn't really anything nearby - a pretty lake/bay - but no bars/entertainment. And besides, after nearly 12hrs travelling, we could not be bothered to take a taxi to Old San Juan; plus we had torrential (albiet warm) rain within half hour of our arrival, so that further put us off going anywhere. Decided to just grab something to eat & then chill in the lobby area/oasis bar for a while. We ate in the Pi\u00c3\u00b1a Colada Club, attached to the Honours towers - decent latino based food, watered down & wasn't spicy AT ALL - didn't have time to check out the Steakhouse Morton's, but it seemed that non-guests can also make reservations there & come quite dressed up... I woke up early to catch the sunrise over the beautiful grounds - it was worth it! The tropical garden, sun deck, cabana's, hammocks, pool area and beach are amazingly peaceful and empty at 6am so you can really explore & enjoy without anyone else there, only me & a few keen joggers. By 7:30-8am it started to come to life a bit. Note about the beach - there is two sides to the 'coastline' one side is rocky & a bit rough but it's not easily accessible to guests, there is a old fort there as well so makes for good scenic pics. The other half, is a small but nicely sectioned off & therefore makes for a calm, still water, sandy beach - yes, good enuff to build sandcastles!!! There were plenty of loungers available even at 11am. The hammocks were a quirky addition - I had a giggle with some random american chicks when we were all trying (not to elegantly) to get in them! The cabana's were nicely set apart from the beach, but close enough to all amenities, these are charged per day ($90) - good cross-breeze... Tropical gardens are very small & are situated out the back near the childrens pool, cool peacocks, lovely flowers & a lil pond area, got some nice pics. By the lobby there is a parrot cage - lovely birds, good temperment & caged was being cleaned out; they weren't there upon check-in so assume they only come out for the daytime. Met the rest of the family for breakfast in the Palmeras Restaurant - think this is the main restaurant. Nice views over looking the main pool & beach. All four of us had the buffet breakfast, that was a bit pricey $26 !!! Was just ok, usual fare to be honest, my dad said the coffee was amazing! It was puerto rican, but can't remember the name of it though... Had to leave the hotel quite early as we needed to get to the port & officially start our cruise. Shame really, as would have liked to have seen what the spa was like. Overall Caribe Hilton was a lovely stay, a beautiful, compact hotel & the staff were pleasant enough. However whilst I found it to be an asthetically pleasing hotel to stop at for one night, given the lack of entertainment (not even a singer or piano?) & the prices - I would be less inclined to stay there for a full two wk vacation, as I know I'd probably get bored! And realistically could find something with more variety, that's more holiday orientated & just as lush for the prices they were charging - I mean come on for $595 for a night & $26 for breakfast! Really?!? All I can say is I was extremely glad it was part of our cruise package!

Some of our party had a walk to the nearest shops for their breakfast which was about a 20-25 min walk.

The Oceanside view from the main building was terrific. I believe room 840. The other side is OK but not as great. The weather was great. Low 70's at night, low 80's during the day. We slept with the sliding glass open and listened to the Ocean 24/7.

Service was acceptable during the conference, but once the conference was over the staff was clearly changed to their second tier staff. Service deteriorated to below average and became unacceptable. Below is a list of issues with this hotel and why we would choose not to return: 1. Although the pool looks nice on pictures and in reality, the fact remains that it is freezing cold! 2. Wireless internet is only available in the lobby. 3. Internet access in your room costs $ 8 per day and is extremely slow..not business friendly. 4. Business center is rarely staffed. 5. Although there is a beach it is small. Thank heavens the ocean is warmer than the pool! 6. Breakfast buffet at Palmeras is extremely slow, as the hostesses seem to be working at a snails pace. On weekends there can be dozens of empty, set tables, yet there is a 20 minute wait for you to be seated! Food is good, especially the made to order omelettes.What you are charged for breakfast seems to be based on a magic eightball, since every day I was charged something different, despite the same people going and eating the same things! 7. Household service is inconsistent: one day they replace your in room coffee, the next day they replace your shampoos, but no day is ever the same consistent service. 8. There is a Starbucks, be prepared to wait as this one must be in the guiness book of records for world's slowest Starbucks! 9. The concierge is quiet arrogant and does not offer many alternatives beyond the rather pricey menu of bus tours they have on their list. 10. Security? Is there any? The open plan of the lobby allows anyone to wander onto the property at any time, so if you have kids, keep an eye on them at all times! 11. The property is located in an isolated area and there are no stores within walking distance. You'd have to take a taxi everywhere, including old San Juan. 12. There is a small airport nearby and small charter planes start taking off right over the hotel beginning at 6am! Thank heavens for tropical drinks...the Atlantico Pool bar has an offer whereby you buy a shaker with whatever tropical drink you want for around $22 the first time. You keep the shaker and bring it back to the bar for refills that are $16 and fill about four 16 ounce glasses. They may count on patrons having a couple of these to help them forget about the poor service at this property. And last but not least, they do claim to have invented the first Pina Colada which has caused a feud with a restaurant called Barrachina, in old San Juan. Apparently the same bartender, don Ramon Portas Mingot, worked at both places back in 1963. Having done a tast test of both in the same evening, we concluded that both recipes have since diverged significantly and personally we preferred the version at Barrachina.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bognor Regis", "Title": "\u201cFabulous surroundings poor service and local information\u201d", "Author": "Lesley Caroline...

We are frequent Hilton customers so we were looking forward to this highly recommended resort. The resort is beautiful, but a little off the mark in some aspects. 1) Room: we stayed in the Hilton Honors Tower and had an ocean view. The room was smallish but modern and seemed clean. We had a small balcony as well. The bathroom was pretty spacious and nice. There was construction noise from the parking garage each morning but it wasn't overwhelming. It would be much more annoying on a lower floor I imagine. Oh and the pillows are giant. As in, if you sleep on only one pillow you will wake up with a stiff neck. I am normally a 2 pillow girl, but these were kinda ridiculous! My husband had the same issue. 2) Pool area: The pool area is huge. There are plenty of umbrellas and lounges. The lounge chairs are not the most comfortable though. My biggest complaint is that the pool was freezing. We had nice weather, about eighty degrees, but the only people in the pool were little children because it was too cold. More people were swimming in the ocean than in the pool. 3) Service: Now this is where they really need to focus. My husband and I sat down at the pool one afternoon for lunch around 1pm. No one came to take our order until 2pm. The food we got was just ok. My husband had a chicken sandwich and I had the shrimp skewers. The shrimp skewers were over cooked and very dry. They were served with \"garlic bread\" which was wonder bread with garlic butter on it. We each had 2 drinks and the total before tip was over $100. I understand paying resort prices, but for the quality we really felt like we were getting ripped off. The drinks at the pool are $12 each. If they were fancy tropical cocktails, fine. But they taste like they are mostly sour mix and don't have much alcohol in them. The second day we found out they have shakers available for $22 and you can refill them for sixteen dollars. You get about 4 drinks in each so that is a pretty good deal. 4) Location: I will give them great points for location. The view is beautiful and the resort is close to the airport and Old San Juan for touring. I am fine paying the resort prices if you feel you are getting a value and are being taken care of while on vacation. I didn't get that vibe here. Not alot of smiles or hellos from the staff, with one exception. Arlene, at the pool was very nice. She waited on us our second day and was the one who told us about the shaker special.

Our misfortune started with arrival at around 2:30 on Jan 15 for check-in. The surly woman at the front desk remarked that our room wouldn't be ready until 4PM, gave us a note card to that effect, then said \"next\". There was no apology, no suggestion to have a drink at the bar, hold our luggage, page us, or a smile. And she, like most employees at this Hilton, did not have a name tag. Not wanting to start our vacation on the wrong foot, we pulled our suitcases down the stairs (yes stairs!) to the bar. After sitting at a table for 15 minutes with no service, I got up to get some drinks at the bar. Immediately a bar server ran over and said \"Relax, I'm coming.\" So I sat down... and waited another 15 minutes for this man with another bad attitude to come back. When he did, he didn't say anything but just stared at us. I asked for 2 beers, he said what kind, I replied the local Medalla, he said they were out, I asked what was available, he said only Light. This was ridiculous! Why not tell the customer you only have this one beer? We finally got our beers, watched the NFL playoff game, and then returned to the counter at 4:30. Another front desk employee (again no name tag), said the room still wasn't ready because they were understaffed. Again, no apology, no effort to help us with luggage and nothing was offered to us. My wife, who is normally the calm one, got quite agitated and asked what he was going to do for us. He replied, \"Nothing.\" At this point she said as an HHonors Gold member she had never had such poor service and if check-in time is 4 then that was Hilton Caribe's problem not ours. They should have had more cleaning staff available to clean rooms, especially since this was MLK long weekend and the hotel was booked for several groups, including my wife's Annual Company Meeting. He stood there with a blank stare and again said nothing else nor offered us anything. She asked if we could at least get some free drinks for our trouble. After mumbling about needing manager's approval and walking to the back area, he finally returned and gave us 2 drink tickets remarking that we should check back in an hour. We returned to the bar and waited another hour. At 5:30 we went back to the front desk. The original front desk employee informed us our room was finally ready. My wife asked if the upgrade she requested as HHonors Gold for a newer renovated room was available. The desk clerk said that we were in a standard room. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What about the request?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, asked my wife. Again, he gave us a blank stare and no comment. So despite waiting 3 hours for a room, the hotel was giving us a standard, old room that anyone could get just checking in. We reserved our rooms over 6 months in advance! The other clerk said he had a renovated room in the Tower. Thank goodness! I asked if it was renovated and he replied it was. As the desk clerk was giving us the keys, my wife remarked that at least we got a new room. Incredibly, the other desk clerk said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, this room isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t new. It was renovated 2 years ago!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Are you kidding me? We were referring to the recently renovated rooms like we requested!! My wife demanded to speak to the manager at this point. The desk clerk said he was unavailable, so we asked that he call us when he was. We never received a call or message or apology from any Hilton Caribe employee. Only Marisol, who I believe is an assistant manager, was pleasant to us when we told her our experience the next morning at breakfast. She asked us how things were going so that the Hilton Caribe could improve their service. Unfortunately, our comments must not have gone any further than her clipboard. Our room, #2065, was old and dated, with construction flaws, plastic counters, an old non-HD TV, and tired furnishings and linens. Pictures are attached so you can judge for yourself. This was a bit of a rant, but it comes after a week of no action from Hilton. My wife called and explained our experience to Hilton HHonors customer service, who said someone from the Hilton Caribe would contact us with resolution. We received a poorly written response, full of misspellings, telling us our next time would be personally guaranteed to be better. Next time? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to be a next time!

Ironically, I think the main building is actually older than the tower, but the rooms are definitely more modern and nicer. We had a fabulous view of the ocean and pool.

We were excited for our first family vacation and had splurged to stay at the Hilton Resort because we expected it to be a clean and elegant hotel. Unfortunately we did not find this to be the case. The outside facilities - the beach, the pools, and the gardens - are wonderful. They are beautiful and well-maintained. We had a great time playing at the beach. I wish I could say the same about our rooms. The first night we stayed in a dingy, old room that would have been outdated in the 1990's. While it did have an ocean view, there was a parking garage right between. When our daughter crawled on the floor, her hands were immediately filthy with grime. We complained about the room immediately and asked to be moved but we were informed the hotel was fully booked. We could request again tomorrow, and they sent someone up to vacuum the room. The next day we again inquired about moving and were told we could move that day at 6pm. When we finally moved (we had to move our own things after waiting hours for someone to assist) we found our new room cleaner, but equally inelegant. The view was improved (over the garden now) and the tile floors were not grimy, so we were happy about the change. We found the walls to be horribly thin, with even moderate conversations from our neighbors echoing through our room. Passersby in the hall made noise at all hours of the night. Normally this would not annoy me very much, but with my infant daughter trying to sleep in the crib it made me very frustrated. In general we found the staff to be helpful and accommodating, but slow to provide service. We were very disappointed by the overpriced, nickle-and-dime atmosphere. We expected prices at the resort to be steep but were surprised to find them as astronomical as they were. The night before our departure, we called the front desk to request a late checkout so our daughter could nap in the room before we left. We were told we would need to call back the next day. Puzzling, but we agreed. The next morning we called and again requested a late checkout. We were told it would be an additional $80 for two extra hours in the room. We were stunned! Never before had we been charged for a late checkout. But this is consistent with the way the hotel operates, constantly reaching for your wallet.

The Mortons on the property was very sub par, I must say) The big downside was what I would call the sort of sloppy service all around.

The greeter at the breakfast place was very friendly but the other waiters did somehow make you feel like you were in their way and several times staff members ran around us on stairs. There do seem to be some management issues. That said, this is a great family getaway and honestly the lack of genuine service orientation was a consistent issue with many places in San Juan. Perhaps that is the norm there, but somehow I doubt it. it doesn't seem to fit the vibe of the city.

In a city with such great culinary culture, it's a shame that this hotel is so isolated and has such bad food. The room decor was tired and hadn't been renovated in many years: cabinet doors didn't close, the bathroom grout needed redoing, the carpet was worn. Our ocean view was great, but the sound of the waves was drowned out by the sound of air conditioning mechanical units 5 floors below us (yes, they were that loud, and constant).

It is resort style hotel, but serves all purposes as a business hotel...and when staying in the Caribbean, why not stay on the water and feel like you're at a resort.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLovely Landscaping and Location, Just One Problem\u201d", "Author": "DF920", "ReviewID": "UR121400235", "Content": "My husband, 14-month-old daughter and I just returned from a week-long stay at the Caribe Hilton. We enjoyed our vacation. The lobby was pretty and open and the hotel grounds were gorgeous. We loved relaxing by, and swimming in, the pools and ocean and talking walks to Old San Juan and the Condado. Our room was pretty standard, though it had a nicely-styled bathroom, a balcony and a beautiful ocean view. We found service at the Caribe to be decent except for one instance that made an otherwise fantastic trip simply very good. When we arrived to the hotel at the beginning of our trip, the staff member who checked us in was clipped in her delivery and did not go over any amenities with us or any details at all regarding our stay. We were simply given two sets of keys and left completely on our own to figure out everything we needed to know. When it came time to check out, eight days later, my husband questioned why the two breakfasts we ate at The Palmeras restaurant did not show up on our bill. Well, it turned out the breakfast buffet which typically cost $23/person (and free for babies) was free for our entire stay, yet no one told us!!! This was a major snafu in an otherwise wonderful vacation. Because meals were pricey, we usually just had Starbucks or granola bars for breakfast and our daughter ate jarred baby food. On the two days we enjoyed the breakfast buffet at The Palmeras, we had delicious omelets and oatmeal, fresh fruit and pastries, fresh-squeezed juices, lovely cheeses, bacon, sausage, french toast, pancakes and yogurts and our baby could eat as much as she liked! When we found out we could have been enjoying this breakfast each day of our eight-day stay because it was included in our vacation package, we were so disappointed! So, so disappointed! We had to make two trips to Walgreens over the course of our vacation to get our baby more jarred baby food because we just couldn't find enough fresh and soft food she could eat (like bananas, yogurt, oatmeal, cheese and eggs). She could have eaten these things each day if someone had just told us what we were entitled to as part of our package! When we asked the staff about this issue at our check out, they apologized and comped the \"extras\" we had charged to our room, drinks by the pool and a pool float for our baby totaling $50. But that would have been worth just one breakfast we were entitled to, not the additional five breakfasts which would have cost $250 more. It just mostly saddens me that our baby could have been eating the kinds of foods she eats at home during our stay if someone had taken the time to properly inform us.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cCould do better.\u201d", "Author": "Vickie86", "ReviewID": "UR121334282", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for one night before our Royal Caribbean cruise.

The room was difficult to find and we seemed to be in a maze of hallways and outdoor spaces to reach our room. When we arrived at our room and opened the door there was an overwhelming smell of mildew or something. I do not have any type of allergies, but, if someone was forced to stay in this room that had allergies I would hope the hotel would be able to accomodate them and give them a different room. We immediately asked for another room because of the smell and we were promised an ocean view ( not a lagoon view ) room. we were told that the hotel was booked to capacity. Oh well..one night won't kill anyone! The location is not the best if you want to walk arouond to find a bar or restaurant to go to.

However, I would not recommend staying at the Caribe Hilton. To keep everything fair - I've listed out some of the pros first: 1. Great pools, nice landscaping, there is a smaller sandy beach that would be good for young kids. Also, there is an outdoor area with peacocks, coy fish, swans, ect. My daughter loved this. 2. The bed was nice and the bathroom was spacious. 3. There were a number of nice restaurants on the property. 4. Rooms were clean. The cons: 1. They overbooked the hotel the week we were staying there and the situation was poorly managed. In fact, I would go as far to say that it was a bit shady. My husband and I did not know until we walked into our room and noticed that our bed was a fold out couch that we had been downgraded. In the Hilton's defense - we ended up getting a credit for our first nights stay - but keep in mind - this didn't happen until AFTER we said something, and even then it was an argument. 2. VERY pricey - E.g. $22 for a 10 in pizza, or $15 for a hamburger. or $20 for a 'warm' continential breakfast, etc.And, you are a captive audience there - the only food walking distance really is subway. Everything else you have to take a taxi to get there. 3. Rooms weren't great. Broad interpretation of the description 'balcony' and 'ocean view'...Our balcony was about 2 ft out. And - our 'ocean view' was really a view of the lagoon, which is really isn't a view at all. Regardless, we weren't impressed. Also, lights wouldn't work, fan wasn't working, and the internet connection wouldn't work. 4. Poor/inconsisent service at times. E.g., waited about 45 min to eat at one of the restaurants (we were already seated) and waited about 20 min for 2 drinks in the lobby. (service in pool area was always nice). 5. !Poor location in San Juan! - unless you are renting a car - stay downtown in Old San Juan. Or around Isla Verde. The Caribe is isolated and everything is at least a $10 taxi. We drove around our last day in San Juan and decided we had picked wrong. Initally - we picked Caribe because we have a 2 yr old. We liked the idea of the small beach she could play on, the pools, the playground on the property, etc. In reality, she didn't care, and if we had at least stayed in old san jaun - it would have been easier to explore in the evenings. Other comments: - PR was great. Go to old San Juan at night. Visit the forts. Go to the rainforest, it was worth the drive.Eat at Raices. - Don't rent at the Hertz on site at the hotel. Go to the Allied car rental across the street. It's half as much. Also, they will give you a free shuttle to the airport if you drop the car off at the airport location. Hope this helps someone! If you are already staying there, you will be fine. It's not an awful hotel. i just wouldn't stay there again and feel there are probably a number of better options.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201ca little pricey\u201d", "Author": "gio044", "ReviewID": "UR121007267", "Content": "Stayed here in april 2011, 3 days before a cruise and three days after.

The hotels facilities are sensational, with a choice of relazing on its own private beach area (protected from the sea if its rough by a rock breaker) or by any one of three pool areas complete with pool bar and hot tubs. The staff were all very friendly and would go out of their way to help. We went to bio bay organised by the tours team who delivered a great trip for us. I like to try and give a balanced view but am struggling to come up with negatives - if i must and they are small points - there is no milk in the rooms just powdered cream which turns a black coffee into a very dark brown coffee (there is however a starbucks on site) and the hotel is a fair walk away from any of the bars and restaurants in Old San Juan. This isnt really a problem though as only a very short taxi ride away. If you are looking for a hotel before and after a cruise i would do what we did and maybe stay somewhere with OSJ on your doorstep (we stayed in Sheraton OSJ) and then Caribe Hilton after cruise for a continuation of the excellent service and relaxation after the cruise.

Typically we like to stay in Condos in Puerto Rico but we did discover a real jewel with something we did different this time. I highly would recommend the cooked to order buffet breakfast. Espresso bar, stunning views of Puerto Rican beach, they make a cooked to order breakfast and probably the best array of fruits and breakfast items that I have ever experienced. It was well worth the money to add it to the room, and believe that you can plan it w your itinerary even cheaper if in advance. Orlando, their employee at Palmera Restaurant gave us exceptional service. He offered great service even by the Puerto Rican standards which are way superior to most places in the U.S. We had such a wonderful breakfast and the best tasting papayas and mangoes ever....! Be aware that if you bring a car there is a daily parking fee. It is well worth getting off the plane and taking a cab for a couple of days from the airport just to avoid for a couple of first beach days. Tip: We got off the plane and the taxi prices are fixed. Don't even bother negotiating those. But if you find tourists like yourself standing outside waiting for a taxi, just discreetly ask them if they are also going to the Caribe Hilton. That is exactly what we did and instead of paying $25., we split the fare of $30. (they charge a flat rate and then add for each suitcase and person). Tourism is basically the main stream of income in Puerto Rico. Just accept that and make it work for you. Why not just stay at Caribe buy the great breakfast buffet, get a snack for lunch and then go to one of the restaurants there on site for dinner for your first few days? Restaurants are Morton's -wow wow- w shrimp alexander and check online for web specials as they do not mention them unless you do....-the other is an italian restaurant but I order Comida Criolla -basic churassco steak, habicuelas=beans and rice w avocado. yum. One thing to consider: Avoid at all costs the Hertz desk-we booked a full sized car and the snippy Neuyorican lady behind the counter insisted we keep the reservation and take a compact. What?! for a full sized price?? Sorry, but why would we do that? For a rental car the best price in San Juan these days is at the Enterprise place. Take a shuttle or taxi back to the airport. You'll be glad you did. The other rental agency is only for like a one day rental. Enterprise offers better week rates, and a much better selection.

Long overdue review.\u201d", "Author": "CarsonRSX", "ReviewID": "UR120316301", "Content": "Ok...I have stayed at the Caribe Hilton three times over the years and this is my first review of the hotel. This review is going to be a culmination of my experiences....here we go... Where to begin?! I have stayed in all kinds of Hilton properties in different states and countries...and the Caribe is my favorite Hilton property thus far. There are tons of little perks, gems, and eye candy dispersed all throughout the property. This hotel has everything including, and not limited to: parrots, peacocks, turkeys, iguanas, koi, swans, ponds, gardens, numerous beach-side pools, recreational equipment, indoor/outdoor bars, multiple hot tubs, open air lobby area, shops, free fruit infused water that rotates flavors throughout the day, a private beach area.....are you getting the picture?! The grounds are both expansive and immaculate. When you are sitting pool-side, you are also sitting beach-side! You have a wonderful view of the Caribbean sea and Condado from the pool area. The pool furniture is lovely as well....they have beds, chairs, hammocks strung between palms trees....it looks like something you would see in a movie! While the private beach is a nice option, don't be fooled....it isn't really a beach. The private beach is a small manmade cove with a manmade beach area. It is very small and is flat as a pond due to a manmade jetty that was created. However, it does offer some decent snorkeling and it is nice to have the option of switching from pool water to ocean water in a matter of seconds. As far as the rooms are concerned, the rooms/views vary depending on which building you stay in. If you want to pay extra money and get an ocean view....GO FOR IT. The view is outstanding and the onshore breeze is entirely refreshing! I would recommend getting an ocean view room in the tower or getting in one of the lagoon villas. I just stayed in the lagoon villas and the room was nice first and foremost due to the view. The only downside to the room was that it was a bit cramped for 2 people and it had an odd chemical smell that I did not like. Besides that....free wifi in the room, free coffee, free water, etc. The tower room I stayed in a few years ago was a lot better because it was larger, had a better view, and no odd smell. I only have a few complaints about the Caribe. One thing you should know is that they tack on all kinds of misc. taxes to your bill. You get hit with all the usual PR taxes and then you get hit with a 14% hotel tax of some sort that pays for the grounds, etc. I didn't like that. Also, as you would assume....the food/booze is overpriced. To be fair...the food is pretty darn good and I highly recommend the crab cake sliders offered in the lobby bar. A final word of advice....my most recent stay was a few weeks ago and August - Nov is the off season due to hurricane season, etc. Because of this, rates are significantly cheaper, and less people stay at the hotel during these months. With this comes yearly maintenance and upkeep. When I arrived, I noticed that the place needed some painting and the next thing I knew, painters were painting the whole property. Also, one of the main pools was closed due to remodeling and a lot of unsightly repair work was going on. However, I still had a blast and would recommend the Caribe any day!

As someone who loves PR and the Caribe, I would not stay anywhere else in San Juan. The location is perfect, between the Condado strip and Old San Juan, has a wonderful history, (read up on the hotel before going and look at the pictures in the reception of the executive offices), the only hotel in SJ with a private beach, the best open air lobby, a fabulous staff and a welcoming vibe. I get out of the taxi and immediately decompress. The hotel has a very successful business, social and conference business, and can be busy,but that is part of the charm. I always meet some of the most interesting guests. If you are looking for a secluded all inclusive type of resort, this is not the place for you. I will agree some sections of the hotel are more pleasant than others. Request a room in the newly renovated main building or the tower. I have stayed in the villas, but feel it is more appropriate for families, and there is a smaller pool and beach access from the villas, so you do not have to go through the main lobby. Are there more inexpensive options, yes, but without the charm. Even the Intercontinental and Ritz Carlton, which will run more, are so far removed from the \"action\" that the taxi fares do pile up. At Caribe, you can take a great 15 minute walk along the Atlantic to Old San Juan, spend a morning exploring, have lunch and be back in time to enjoy an afternoon at the great pool and beach. The Atlantico pool bar is the best. If you can't have a positive \"attitude adjustment\" there, it's not because of the environment or terrific long-term staff, who will welcome returning guests by name.

It started at check-in with my hostess Stephanny. She told me we would be staying in the Villas, room7424. She said it was just the next building over and pointed down a hallway. My wife and had booked this trip for four days and only had one suitcase and our computer bags so we we're going to take them ourselves. After getting lost trying to get to our room, one very attentive bell hop noticed we were lost and offered his assistance. He took our bags and escorted us to us our room which was about a city block away from the main hotel. The facility was very old and far away from everything in the main hotel. After getting our luggage to our room, I went to move my car to the parking garage. Another long walk, and after getting to my car, that was parked in the check-in area, a bell-hop was going through my car; I had left the back door open. He said he was looking for something with our name on it to call us. I was not gone any longer than it took to go to the room and back. Very uncomfortable. That night we attempted to get on the internet using their wi-fi in the lobby of the villas; they do not have free wi-fi in the rooms here. We were unsuccessful and after asking the front desk attendant for assistance, he suggested we go to the lobby in the main hotel. We did this, toting our laptops for another city block trip there and back. Here we were able to connect to the internet. Stephanny had told us we would have a balcony with a view of the ocean. We had a view of the corner of the ocean overlooking a building crane and construction site. Later that night, I tried closing the curtains to the room, but the curtain was torn at the top and it would not shut completely so I had to get a coat hanger with the 2 clips from the closet, and clip the curtains together to keep the light out. We had paid $16.50 a day for parking. Stephanny had given me a card that was stamped self-parking on it and said that it would cover as many in's and out's as I wanted to make in a day. When I tried leaving for the first time I had to get an attendant to let me out after showing him my card. What I found out was that when taking a card from the lot on entry, you are suppose to get it validated before leaving. There was no common courtesy of explaining this to me at check-in. After complaining the next day, they offered me another room in the tower, next to the main hotel, and closer to the beach area and restaurants. They said it would be available by 5 P.M.. When we returned at the end of the day, they did have our room available and my wife packed up our personal belongings and we moved. While this hotel has some nice amenities, be careful about reading the reviews they have posted on their site. NOT ALL THEIR ROOMS ARE EQUAL! This was a very bad start to what was suppose to a nice 4 day getaway for my wife and I. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone as there are others just as nice, and much less expensive, in the area. If you do stay here, ensure were your room will be in advance, huge difference in accommodations.

We had a nice room on the 10th floor overlooking the ocean with beautiul views of the ocean and surrounding area. The room had two double beds, a small balcony, a refrigerator, and a good sized bathroom. The room was a good size, clean and everything was up to date. The grounds of this property are exceptionally nice, with a walkway right up against the ocean and around the hotel. There is a private becah, whcih I beleive is the only one on the island. This is a nice feature as locals are not permitted o the beach to sell beads and wood carvings. There are 10 hammocks strung between palm trees which were fun to hang out on. Near the ocean there were outdoor all weather beds with cushions to relax on as you heard the waves breaking. There was also a raft a short swim from the shore that could fit at least 10 people. The pools was huge and had a series of cascading waterfalls that enhanced the overall appearence of the outdoors areas. There were also 2 hot tubs available for use. The nicest part of the pool and beach area was the fact there were always plenty of lounge chairs available, which made it a pleasure to visit as you did not have to search for a chair. There towels provided in the pool/beach area were also plentiful and plush. A a swim-up bar in the pool area was pretty cool and did a brisk business on the hot days during our stay. They were always good about checking your room key before you entered the pool area to avoid unregisterd guests from using hte facilities. We only ate at one of the 4 or 5 restaurants on the property that was a hamburger/sandwich place located on the far end of the hotel. The food was reasonably priced and very good. Other guests told us the food in all of the restaurants on the property was quite good as well. The drinks at the hotel and pool bar were priced quite high, but that is to be expected at a resport property such as this. We had a rental car, and there was a self parking garage across the street at a price of $16.00 per day. We were in san Juan for a convention and our room rate was $127.00 per day which I felt was a grea price. Every employee of the hotel was very accomodating in all departments.

We called and faxed the hotel ahead of time to let them know that besides coming for a convention we were also celebrating 50th birthdays and a 25th anniversary. We were upgraded to the Hilton Honors Towers on the 12th floor facing the private beach. The view was beautiful!! The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathrooms were huge! We arrived at 1:15 AM because of a delayed flight. We were greeted by the most pleasant front desk assistants. Even at that extremely late hour everyone was so kind. I was afraid we would get rooms that were not very nice because we were so late but our rooms were beautiful! We were sent a bottle of Champagne from someone back home and the hotel gave us a complimentary bottle as well. Everyone that works at the Caribe Hilton is friendly and helpful!

Mixed reviews and my own personal visit earlier had shown me there could be a lack of service and adequate lodging. After 8 nights there, I feel a little better about this property. Checking in was non-eventful although the upgrade I'd been promised was not available. Being from Florida, I was not surprised at the large dead roach just inside our door when we arrived - I was just glad he was dead - but it was representative of the less than perfect housekeeping. Although we tipped daily, all we could expect was the bed being made, the towels replaced, and a replacement (most of the time) of coffee for the coffeemaker. The bed was very comfortable and the internet service ($49.95 for 7 days) was excellent. It is free in the lobby and people sit at Starbucks for hours on their computers. Our room in the Hilton Honors tower was nicer than the ones in the older building, which smelled like mildew to me. Interaction with the staff was okay. Some were great and some were just civil. The Pina Colada Club on property is owned by a successful restaurant group in San Juan and the food and service were very good. Beer everywhere is $6 or $7 for local beer and $10 for tropical types. Buffet breakfast at Palmeris Restaurant in the lobby was very good for $15 continental and $22 including hot items. Starbucks coffee and pastries could add up very quickly so this was a better deal. There is a Subway down the block but I didn't care for it. I preferred to walk to El Hamburger or KFC half a mile to the right, or left over the bridge to the Condado (ritzy area) for more choices. We walked to the Casino at the Conrad hotel just over the bridge (half a mile) several times at night and never felt threatened. The setting is very nice and there is a nice beach protected from waves but you need to wear water shoes. There are rocks and sealife and a man stepped on a sea urchin, getting several spines through his foot, and was taken away by ambulance. I did not see any recommendations to protect your feet. You can take a taxi to Old San Juan for about $12 or walk the two miles, which we chose to do. We passed several large iquanas and lizards along the way, which was entertaining. As a frequent visitor to the island, I usually stay with relatives but love to stay at the La Concha Renaissance when I do stay in a hotel. This will be a backup when the price is right, which for me would be in the $100-125 range. The resort fee and tax will tack on another 20 percent or so. Definitely better than expected but I'm not sure I would recommend it to a first time visitor due to its location.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cLovely Property But Not Without Issues\u201d", "Author": "Frqflier", "ReviewID": "UR118215877", "Content": "Before I get to my specific issues, let me reiterate what other guests have said. It's a lovely property, with wonderful pools, beautiful grounds and a nice beach. That said it provides an uneven guest experience which will account for the mixed reviews on here. My 9-year-old son and I stayed here for one night ahead of a cruise. The hotel served its purpose. It was luxurious, casual and had nice pools and a beach. If staying one night ahead of a cruise is your only criteria, might I recommend the Sheraton in old San Juan which is directly across from the pier where Carnival ships depart from. That said, it was an expensive property. Not sure I would ever book this hotel as a destination for more than one or two nights. And as a convention hotel, I'd love it. But as other reviewers have pointed out, it is not within walking distance of much and meals here are quite expensive (which begs the question, if you can't afford the meals, should you even be considering this hotel in the first place?) Service here seemed to be an afterthought. I'm a Hilton Gold member. When we checked in, there was a long line for the special \"Hilton HHonors\" checkin. Turns out that by waiting on the regular checkin line we got faster service than by waiting in the \"HHonors\" line. So a note to people who don't sign up for loyalty programs, in this case you actually got preferential treatment than the people who do sign up for the benefits! And now the part that was guest-specific. Our reservation someone got messed up (errors happen.) We booked a room with two queen beds. After we took all of our bags up to the 20th floor to our room, we discovered there was only 1 king bed. When I called downstairs they said there was nothing they could do because they were full. But when I went down to the front desk, they were able to accomodate us on the fifth floor, with 2 queens. Just puzzled as to how a reservation booked and confirmed 4 months in advance could find us potentially with 1 king instead of 2 queens. Bottom line is it was ironed out, but then had to go back and wait on line for checkin, and once again, the regular checkin was faster than the gold Hilton Hhonors! Another issue was breakfast. Yes, we had a \"continental breakfast\" included in our rate. But if you want anything more substantial than their skimpy offerings, there's a six dollar surcharge. Again, there are no bargains at this hotel. We also were berated by the towel people who oversee the kids' playroom for spending more than the alloted amount of time on the video games. Problem was that we went in, played for 20 minutes and then left to go to the local Subway and returned an hour later. A member of the staff saw us there and thought we'd been playing non-stop. It was all chalked up to a misunderstanding, but clearly we were guilty before proving our innocence with a Subway sandwich and a receipt with a time on it! Another objection during my stay, and again, guest-specific and subject to my tastes, maybe not yours, was the loud blaring DJ music at the pool. Some guests might consider it a nice touch to have a live DJ playing music during the afternoon, but I thought it was intrusive and loud, especially right by the quiet hammock area. Again, it's all subjective, but I'd prefer peace and quiet in a relaxing environment. This hotel could be a fantastic property. The grounds are lovely, the setting is wonderful and for the most part it's a well-maintained property. But pay attention to the other reviews. Food is pricey, it's an expensive cab ride ($15 for what would be a $6 ride here in NYC to and from Old San Juan) and there's not much beyond the property other than a convenience store, a subway and a wine/beer store. I'm confident my review will be getting a response from hotel management and I can't wait to see what they say. I might add I'm a low maintenance guest.

Needless to say, I had high expectations about it primarily because of its history and being a the first Hilton operated outside the U.S. Sadly, I left with mixed feelings about recommending this hotel and I don't expect to return. First impressions count, and impressions during registration at the front desk and later finding a huge \"Cucaracha\" (Spanish for Cockroach) on my way to my room in the Hilton Honors tower (third floor) were not welcoming ones. From the business perspective, it is a known fact that Puerto Rico can be expensive, but I want to start by saying this is not a business hotel. There is only (free) WIFI on the first floor of the main building, otherwise in room Internet is available at US$15.00 per day. I was never pointed out to a business center, and staff was not even knowledgeable about where to find the closest copy center. The staff on the front desk were plain rude and they seemed having an attitude when one asked questions about how to get around the hotel. There was a gentleman who worked during the busiest hours and did not know anything, or care to research about it, and his excuse was that he had just moved a month ago from Florida and didn't know the island well. How come management placed someone with such limited knowledge in the front desk when the hotel was sold out for a whole week with visitors from all over the world? I was puzzled. Breakfast was priced at US$15-20.00, and I did not see myself paying $100.00 for breakfast for five days. I tried finding a supermarket or restaurants close by just to realize this hotel is located by itself in this peninsula and - if one wants to go else where - a taxi ride of $12-$25 (one way) was the only option. Thankfully, there is a Starbucks onsite, which became my best friend for coffee and snacks. There were some good moments during my trip: The cleaning lady was very friendly and always kept the room very neat. My air conditioning broke down and it got fixed the same day. My room view, which was on the 8th floor, was a good one. Even though I never used it, the pool was huge and it was a nice as in the pictures. The beach was a disappointment. The fitness center was to die for as it is managed by a third party company and, surprisingly, it was included in the staying. Finally, one of the bell hops (Esteban) was always very professional and helpful when the front desk staff did not know something. By the end of the week, I knew he was the best source to learn about the whereabouts of the hotel. I believe next time I will return to the Marriott hotels (Isla Verde or Condado) as not only one gets more for the money, but the staff is more friendly, and the properties are located at walking distance from restaurants, supermarkets, and nice beaches.

September 04, 2011 Went to what was supposed to be a full breakfast buffet which was not the actual buffet but a continental breakfast. The host (male) standing at the podium looked at us, turned away and started looking at the ceiling and gazing around the room. Not sure what his issue was. We only heard from him when it was time to collect money. Asked for two eggs over easy was not NO! Not here. Here you only get this and pointed to watery scrambled eggs. So we left but on our way out we were presented with a bill. We informed the host that breakfast was included. He said no that is for the other restaurant. I explained to him that if he was paying attention and greeted us like he was supposed to instead of picking his nose and scratching himself, we would have been in the right place. I do not work there so why should I pay a room rate and walk around and say good morning to each and every staff. I definitely did not pay to serve the staff! I went to the other restaurant and informed Gabriella Ponce the manager and she appeased the situation by inviting us for lunch. We ate at Atlantico Restaurant. The Mahi Mahi salad was good but the french fries were disgusting. Service from Yuri was good. Wanted to rent a car from Hertz in the hotel but the lady at the counter was more interested in eating and talking on the phone rather than wanting to rent a car. So I called Enterprise at the Conrad Hotel and they took care of it right away. Will NEVER rent from Hertz again until I die. Even if they give a free car I will never use them. September 04, 2011, Jose the manager on duty gave us two coupons for free drinks. He told us that we can redeem them for two drinks, complimentary of Rums of Puerto Rico. Very nice of Jose. Coupon numbers: 248683 and 248682. September 05, 2011 we went to the bar in the lobby and ordered an Oasis Breeze which was recommended by Jose the bartender. Drinks were made and bill was presented. I presented the coupon and he started making a big deal of the situation in front of all the other guests. He said that the coupon is not valid for special drinks and can only be used for \"other rum\" and not the good rum. So jose gave us a \"slap\" in the face by offering us third class quality liquor as a gesture to appease and set a positive tone towards a very negative Check in and overly horrid morning on the second day. Jose called the Bar Manager Joel Joel immediately said very loudly that those tickets are not for special drinks. They are only for Pina Coladas and those type of drinks. So with that we told Joel that he can keep his drink and we left the bar. We called for the manager on duty and Heydsha who was a supervisor came by. She wanted us to move to her office to talk but we were already comfortable in the lobby sofa. We told her of the situation and gave the coupons back. She offered to give us the drink, however, we REFUSED! We do not any freebees from the hotel. We are not poor and we will not be insulted by Hilton in the manner we have been the last few days. HILTON, you can keep your drinks and coupons and use them on yourself or other guests. What you have done is highly insulting. September 05, 2011, I called down to Valet like I was told the night before if I wanted my car. 20 min later I showed up at the lobby and the valet guy was sitting there cleaning his nails. Mark was having a casual conversation and talking to another employee. I saw not cars being pulled in or out and bellmen were all standing around the desk by the parrots. I asked for my car and he showed me the key and said, is this it? I said yes but why is the car not here???? \" Well we are very busy Sir and there are other cars in front of you. Mark stepped in and said \"it is very busy today.\" So this leads me to believe that cleaning ones nails and talking to employees is considered busy. No worries, I noted it down. As I did, Mark saw me write it down and he started to act sweet and say it will be here in a few minutes and so on acting like nothing was wrong. The car took forever to arrive. Later that day, I arrived back and dropped the car of to valet and it took a short while for someone to come to the car. They gave me a ticket and took no info down and left with the car without any words. This morning when I had breakfast, I asked Euclid to cook my eggs with butter only and no oil. He gave the most dirtiest face and starting demanding at the top of his lungs for me to go and get him some butter from the buffet table next to the honey and fruits. Finally his partner, whom I think was also Jose, calmed him down and basically told him to shut up. His partner got the butter and cooked my eggs for me. The freshly squeezed orange juice machine was not working and broken. There were several other guests complaining on Euclids behavior towards them and so that made the \"made to order\" line very long. I had a good experience with Leo in the Il Gardinia Restaurant. Employees to recognize on a positive note: Michelle in Room Service, Gabriella Ponce, Leo, Jose in the breakfast buffet, Jose in security, Jimenez the police officer.

I will start out by saying that I LOVE THIS Resort. The beach is soo convenient and the pool is great spent hours in both places during my 5 day 4 night stay. At check in the front desk agents was nice however she mixed up the keys and names of my reservation and my friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservation; however we were checking in at the same time. We were able to get this fixed later on in the evening. This was a girls trip and the four of us where so excited about our vacation. Like I mentioned I have worked in hotels for many years and so did the ladies I was traveling with. Dominick at the concierge desk is awesome and he helped us with many suggestions of places to eat and see. There is where we booked our snorkeling trip for later on in the week. (Which was awesome) We booked the Puerto Rico is Exciting package which included 2 free breakfast buffet each morning. We ate in the Palmeras Restaurant for breakfast each morning. Breakfast was great the mangos where my favorite along with the omelets. Soto was our server for 2 mornings and still assisted us on the morning when we were sat in a different section. He was friendly and attentive, he remembered what beverage we wanted and had our coffee and hot tea waiting before we even asked. Now that is service and should be treasured with employees. We were sad to find out that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working on our last morning because we wanted to say goodbye. Spa was wonderful and my 50 minute massage that I received from Alexis was the best massage I had ever had. I loved the open lobby found it amazing and I had never seen anything like that before. The housekeepers where friendly, only problem is they kept only leaving on glass in our room. It was two people staying in the room, not a big deal just thought I would mention it. We stayed in the newer renovated rooms. Room was nice spacious and I loved the balcony. Nice view of the garden. My only issue with the guest rooms is that they had small issues with the rooms that from my point of view where easy fixes. Like beside my bed there was a patch of paint missing. Easy fix and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why that was left like that. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how often PM is conducted with the engineering department but again just little nicks scratches at seem to be quick fixes.

The hotel was about 15-20 minutes away from the airport. It seemed like the hotel was located off the beaten path, with only a Subway sandwich shop and liquor store nearby. I was amazed when I walked into the hotel. The open-air lobby was beautiful and a fresh breeze was blowing through it. There were plenty of comfortable couches and chairs to sit on. We arrived around 12 PM and our room was not ready. That's completely understable because it was early in the day. The front desk staff gave us a card with a confirmation number and phone number on it and said that later in the day we could call it to see when our room would be ready. They also gave us an access code so we could get free WiFi in the lobby, which was extremely useful and nice. We left our luggage with a bellboy. Do not leave anything valuable in the luggage you leave with them because I don't know how a couple of bellboys could keep their eyes on every single piece of luggage. We were a little scared about leaving it there. First, we took a walk around the property. It is a large hotel with a lot of ground around it. We walked down a nice path and had a breath-taking view of the ocean and rocks. Lizards and even an iguana walked across the path. There is a nice area with hammocks, although I never got to use it because it was too crowded. The Caribe Hilton also has a beautiful garden section. It was so pretty. There were flowers blooming, ducks swimming in the pond, and benches for you sit on and enjoy the surroundings. I even came across a peacock walking around. The gardens were one of my favorite parts of the hotel. Then, we had lunch at one of the pool bars. They had hot dogs, chicken, burgers, fries, and other finger foods. The waitresses were very friendly and provided us with good service. The food was also good. Later, we checked to see if our room was ready. It was not, so we decided to go to the beach. We were allowed to use the changing rooms and restrooms. Both were very clean and attendants were on standby to pick up anything that was dropped on the floor. The beach is a small closed in area, what I would call a man made beach. This is because the ocean surrounding the hotel is too rough and rocky, not appropriate for swimming. It was crowded, therefore I only was able to find one lounge chair. Towels were provided by the hotel. The water was warm, but somewhat rocky. The beach area was nice, but I would not want to have to come to this man made beach for a week. The swimming pools were lovely. There are several pools with waterfalls and swim up bars. Pools even lead into each other. There was a hot tub, but it was dirty and gross, so needless to say, I did not get in it. Chairs and lounge beds are plentiful around the pool area, too. After 4 PM, we determined that our room was ready. Our room was located in the Hilton Honors Towers on floor 8. The room had two double beds, a desk, balcony with an amazing view, and a huge bathroom. The room was clean and kind of small. The balcony was great! It had a table and chairs and had an exceptional view of the ocean and palm trees. A deserted hotel, the Normandie, sits across the street. The bathroom was very large. It had two sinks and a shower so large that it had a seat in it! The shower did not have very good water pressure, though. For dinner, there are various choices. From expensive steakhouses to Italian restaurants, you definitely have options. My family and I ate at the Italian restaurant. Service was slow, but the food was good. The pizza was tasty and you got a lot of it for your money. Later that night, music was playing at the bar and people were dancing. It's a happening place at night. Way across the street, there was a stage with a band and LOUD music. No lie, the band played until at least 2 AM in the morning. Therefore, don't expect good sleeping quality. Beds and pillows were just ok. For breakfast, there is an expensive buffet or a Starbucks. We decided to eat at Starbucks. It was really crowded and we waited in a long line. We used the TV check out, since lines at the front desk were long. We had no problem getting a taxi, there are plenty that come and go from the hotel. And as an FYI the cruise ship port is about 10-15 minutes away from the property. I truly enjoyed my stay here at the Caribe Hilton. I would definitely return. Everything was fantastic.

Although the hotel is fantastic, the drink prices are very very steep which puts you off drinking here which is a shame with it having a swim up bar. As you can imagine it was always empty.

I had a room with a nice view looking east toward Isla Verde, so the sunrises were spectacular. The rooms were modern and clean, and the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. They will tell you to take a taxi in to Old San Juan (about $10-15), but on a nice day, you can walk (about 1-2 miles), or even catch the bus for about a dollar (runs every 15 minutes) and save the taxi ride for heading home after dark. A cab ride to/from the airport is around $25 each way. Unfortunately, all of the east facing rooms are right above some very, very noisy ventilation units on the lobby/restaurant roof. It makes it difficult to have the patio door open if you like to fall asleep to the sound of surf, or a nice tropical breeze (and I was on the 7th floor - those poor folks on the 2nd or 3rd floors must have been deafened). In addition, this is a tourist hotel. It is packed with a lot of tour groups and pleasure seekers. The restaurants are ok, but IMHO overpriced.

Oh! Lets not forget a personalized menu printed up with my name!!! I loved every second. The grounds are beautiful, theres snorkeling offered on site at their private beach.

Upon arriving at the hotel both parents commented on how \"run down\" the facility has become. The staff, except the valet parking guys, are extremely rude and don't seem to care if you're there or not. The major upside for this hotel is that it has a private beach, it has the most restaurants on-site than any other hotel is San Juan, and they have a spacous lobby. Two days into our stay we got trapped on their elevator for 30 minutes. The call button in the elevator wouldn't work. My dad was in the lobby so we had to call him so he could notify the front desk that we were trapped in their elevator. And this hotel has MANY issues with their elevators apparently because right before we left that elevator got stuck on the 7th floor this time with someone else and the other elevator likes to let people off on the wrong floor. I emailed the H Honors people, and they said they would get back to me within 48 hours...but still no response. Hilton doesn't care about their guest. But while we were here we went touring some of the othr hotels so we could decide where to stay in the future...my opinion is to book at the Intercontinental. It is a very nice hotel and the staff are ALL VERY nice to you, they treat you like you're a guest instead of garbage like Hilton does. DO NOT STAY AT THE CARIBE HILTON, instead stay at the Intercontinental! Another thing is is that their lobby is OPEN which means while you're sitting there and while you're eating breakfast in the restaurants a bird can come and land anywhere!

We had never been to Puerto Rico before, and I was looking for a hotel close to Old San Juan, but also with a nice beach. We got both in the CH. I scored a nice rate as part of a promotion late in the spring. I reserved a King Villa Stuido in the Condado Lagoon Villas portion of the CH. At check-in, we were upgraded to a larger suite with a full kitchen and right on the water. I am a Hilton Gold member, so the upgrade was automatic. There was almost no line for check-in on a Thursday. The weekends can be a different story. The lobby is beautiful, open, and airy. We enjoyed the parrots. The gift shop was well stocked and Starbucks was always busy. We were awed by the view from our fourth floor room. The balcony was directly facing the fort and ocean so we had a completely unobstructed view. There was a large table, two chairs, and a swivel chair and stool on the patio. We loved the patio and spent a lot of time relaxing there. The bed was very comfortable with a ceiling fan overhead. The kitchen was full size, with a dishwasher, full-size refrigerator, stove and microwave. There were lots of cupboards with pots, pans, plates, everything we needed. My husband especially loved the ice maker in the freezer. The air conditioner was downright frosty. There were only four small drawers, so for a longer stay for 2 people, we did have to get a little creative with where to put our clothes. I think every room must be a little different in the Villas section. The room was very clean, and the daily maid service was fantastic - they always came in the morning, which suited our schedule well. There was also a bar area with stools, and a dining table with 3 chairs. Lots of places to enjoy a meal in your room. A large chair with ottoman was also in the room. The bathroom was tiny, which may have been necessitated by the full size kitchen. There was a makeup mirror and scale. There was also a marble shower stall with a glass door that opened outward. The door was under 6 feet high, so while I had no problem getting in and out, my husband routinely bumped his head on the shower door frame. There was absolutely no hint of mold or mildew smell in the room or bathroom. The hotel itself was very clean. Based on prior reviews, I was expecting dirt everywhere, and it just wasn't so. We saw cleaning people all the time. There are lots of shortcuts that you can take to get around the resort, but it is sprawling and it took us two days to get comfortable with the layout. Therefore, this might not be the ideal hotel for just a one night stay. The beach itself is lovely. The breakers provide for a very large, calm swimming area. There were plenty of lounge chairs around the beach and pool area. We never had a problem finding a lounge chair. Most of the days, the beach was not crowded, but on Saturday, it was packed. I think they get a lot of families there for the weekends only. We never used the lovely sundeck, but I did take advantage of one of the many hammocks. The pool area is well designed with three levels including waterfalls. The swimup pool has whirlpool like jets with bench seating on either end, which were very relaxing. The service at the Atlantico pool bar was very good and everyone was friendly. There are also two heated jacuzzis connected to the pool area. There are also a separate small pool and jacuzzi in the Condado Lagoon Villas area. I knew going in that this hotel catered to families, and as a parent, I have no problem with that. However, as a hotel that is obviously also trying to attract couples, I have one small request. The swim-up pool (the smallest of the 3 pools) should be adults only. And please make one of the jacuzzis adults only. There were kids doing flips from the swim up pool to the second level, splashing, snorkeling, and it just wasn't enjoyable for us. The wildlife area was also a gem - we enjoyed watching the white and black swans, along with the turtles, geese, lizards, and peacocks. The fitness center is one of the best that I've seen in the Caribbean. Everything is new and state-of-the-art Precor equipment. There were 7 ellipticals, 5 treadmills, 4 bikes, along with numerous weight machines and free weights. It opens at 6:00 during the week and at 7:00 on the weekends. We used it every day and loved it. Plenty of towels, water, and sanitizing wipes, too. My husband jogged outside a few days, and thoroughly enjoyed the views. True, the hotel is not within easy walking distance to many restaurants. We did succumb to the temptation of Subway about midway through our trip after a full day of touring old San Juan. The convenience store across the street from the hotel is not a good option for stocking up for the week. We got a few supplies here (including an overpriced bottle of rum), then hit the SuperMax near the Doubletree on Friday. We made the decision to take advantage of the cabs. We enjoy a few cocktails with our meals, so we did not want to drink and drive. What a luxury to have cabs everywhere! The ride from the airport was $19 plus $1 per bag. The ride into Old San Juan was $12 (plus tips). El Morro was $14. When we factored in the price of a rental car and parking, it was MUCH cheaper to take the cabs. As long as you understand the situation going in, it shouldn't be a concern. Tip: the cabs congregate near the end of Forteneza Street and Colon Plaza, so it's easy to catch a ride back to the hotel. We got free passes for continental breakfast at Il Giordino (I think because of the Gold status). There was a huge selection of pastries, breads, fruit, cereals, juices, and even hard boiled eggs. We \"upgraded\" for $5 one day to try the hot selections, too. There were sausage, eggs, and the usual hot items, but you only get one go around, so we were perfectly happy with our free continental breakfast the other days. Seating was easy most days for breakfast, however the weekend was crazy. The line was out the door for the restaurant next to Il Giordino on the weekend. We had our anniversary dinner at Lemongrass. We ate outside on the deck area and enjoyed dining to the sounds of coqui. I had the angus steak special which was so tender I could have cut it with my fork. The total price was $180/two (including tip), but that included appetizer, bottle of wine, and cocktails (remember, we weren't driving, yipee!). We had to try to Pina Coladas at the Oasis lobby bar one evening. They were quite tasty and I believe under $10, so really just normal big hotel prices. We LOVED Old San Juan. We went into town several nights for dinner. Our particular favorite was the Parrot Club (live jazz on Tuesday evenings). The service there was fantastic, and the Cuban Burger is to die for (hamburger, pork, ham, swiss cheese and impossible to finish). Booty's bar and grill also had the best made from scratch Mojito in town. We toured El Morro early on a Saturday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The views are amazing, and it is incredible to stand in a structure that was started in 1539. We loved strolling the narrow cobblestone streets of Old San Juan. We took a snorkeling cruise on the \"Spread Eagle\" which was coordinated through the Tour desk at the hotel. This is a very long day, as the bus picked us up at 8:10 a.m., and we didn't get back until 5:00. But the catmaran crew was excellent. They provided lunch and drinks (except beer, which was available for $2.14). We stopped at two different places to snorkel. One family brought a young toddler (less than 2), and I strongly caution everyone that this is not the place for very small kids. The snorkeling directly off the CH beach was just fine. Lots of fish towards the breakers and along the rock walls. All in all, we thought the staff were all wonderful and friendly and we completely enjoyed our trip. The only thing stopping me from giving the CH resort five stars is that I stayed at the Phoenix in Belize last year, and that sets the standard for five star resorts. Also, the lack of an adult only pool and jacuzzi was a downer at the CH.

The line for check in was extremely long when we were checking in, but I never saw a line the rest of the time I was in the lobby. I guess if you hit it at the wrong time (4pm) you will have to wait a while. I did receive a complimentary non alcoholic pina colada while I was in line though. The grounds are really nice and I liked my room and big bathroom. One guest I met in the elevator said he had to move rooms b/c of mold, which I didn't see in my room, but housekeeping wasn't what I would expect staying at a Hilton (dusty ac vents and dirty rugs stick out to me). I know some other people complained about the AC but I found it worked fine and my room was able to get nice and cold, and then warm up if it was too cold. My major issue was regarding the lack of things to do in the area and place to eat. We didn't rent a car because we didn't want to pay for parking at the hotel on top of the rental fee, and thought we could just take a taxi everywhere we went, in an attempt to save money. It didn't quite work out that way. Since the only thing within walking distance was a Subway and a park, we had to take a taxi to go everywhere. After 7 or 8 days Subway got old, and the overpriced (though tasty) hotel restaurants were taking their toll. We did rent a car for one day, and made good use of it. I guess if you're prepared to spend $40-$60 a day on taxis or pay for the parking and try and navigate the roads yourself, you will have a better time. A few more things to mention. *The internet was not free. This is 2011 not 1996 when the internet was new and exciting and something only business people used. Seriously? Charge $5 more a night for each room and then take away the internet charges and provide everyone with internet, no one will know the difference and guests will think it's just one more awesome thing about staying at a Hilton. *The beds were extremely soft and comfy at first. But then after all the walking, my pregnant back began hurting. I have a bad back to begin with, so that may have been it, but the soft and plushness of the bed meant there wasn't as much support. *The fitness center was nice, and my husband used it almost every day. It has all the basic equipment you would see at a gym, and they have headphones to use and plug into the treadmills so you could listen to music or watch tv. I would bring my own headphones if I knew that was how the treadmills were set up. *The showers suck- water pressure isn't great and neither is the drainage. *The pool was a little cold, and I am surprised it's not heated (and I went in June when it was really warm out so that is saying something).

I also enjoyed a free locker while using the pool since our room was not ready since I was checking in early. As far as the outside spaces I would give this hotel an A. The rooms are a different story, I would give them a D. The only reason why I would not give them an F is because the beds were comfortable and it was quiet. I had room 1466, a balcony ocean view in the towers. The rooms are very dirty, the carpets stained, the lamp shades have multiple holes in them, a wall on the side of the toilet had a big hole, the shower floor had tons of mildew. It was really disgusting. It would not take much to maintain the rooms and keep them clean. The rooms were the worst I have ever seen at a 4 star hotel.

We both have traveled all over domestically and internationally for work and leisure. Looking for: Great location, clean hotel, great pool(s) / beach, good food. Not looking for: major entertainment, party scene, and lots of kids / younger crowd. Facts: 1. If you care about the exterior of the actual building, it does look a bit dated architecturally (but I thought it was fine). 2. Room: We were in the Hilton Honors Tower with ocean view / balcony. Room was large with king bed (one of the most comfortable beds ever), it was clean, air conditioning worked well. Bathroom was large (large walk-in shower with overhead rain shower head and also wall shower head). Were there some minor knicks in the walls from wear? Yes. Did I care? No, I had no plans to BUY the property. 3. Food and drink: Good options? Yes. Good quality? Yes. Expect to spend an average of $60 per meal for lunch and dinner if you're going to have a couple of drinks (beer: $7 / frozen drinks: $12). We ate at Mortons one night for dinner for a splurge - it was $200. 4. Property: LOVED the grounds and pools. You could lay out in well maintained grassy areas, sand/beach areas, or by the pool. A lot to look at and enjoy. The inlet water area was clean and beautiful - many fish to see in the water. 5. Service: Service was perfectly fine in the restaurants (top notch in Mortons). If you needed something, the hotel staff was helpful. 6. Location: Felt very safe (most times you feel unsafe beyond the fenced in property). Close to Old San Juan, which is lovely. It's an easy drive to the Rainforest (we spent the day hiking around). Some observations from previous posts: \"It rained our entire vacation\" - you can't blame the hotel. Yes, it does rain, but it clears away as fast as it arrives. \"Poor service\" - if you want an activities director and you're looking for tons of entertainment, pick a different type of hotel (e.g., all inclusive). We got a very good deal on this hotel that included full breakfasts. We didn't have huge expectations based on the reviews, but the negative reviews were off base, in our opinion. Again, know what you're looking for before you book.

Cab ride from hotel was $19 plus$1/bag-15 minute ride-we did not rent a car. People drive nuts there, especially the cab drivers. We arrived at the hotel three hours before check-in and the staff was able to get us a room right away. But when we got into the room in the main building it was not a renovated room like we hoped. The room wasn't very clean and the bathroom was falling apart with cracked tile and water pipes coming out of the wall. Thankfully I read a ton of reviews(good and bad) and remembered that people loved the renovated rooms in the tower buidling. The staff was very kind and got us the room we came for-no problem. The room was on the 17th floor and was awesome!!! It was everything a nice hotel room should be at a resort. Finally we were able to start our vacation! By the way the maid staff in the tower did a great job for us. The lobby is very nice with an open air feel to it, and there is free wifi in the lobby. We visited during the rainy season which wasn't bad. It would rain for about 10 minutes every two hours but the sun would come right back out. During the week was my favorite time because it was empty. The weekend did pick up but I never felt crowded. We had the breakfast buffet which is about $22 if not included-the meal was amazing and made to order omletts were great. Most days we had lunch at Subway across the street. Friendly people there and the price is right on...cause it's Subway. We had dinner twice in Old San Juan, once at Senor Frogs and once at Sophia's Place(an Italian resturant named after Sohpia Loren). Good food and staff at both places. We ate the rest of our dinners at the hotel and they were good but very pricey. I understand it's an island and they have to ship in most of the food, but come on now. I'm not a big sushi fan but the sushi resturant in the flower garden was awesome. Great service and food there. We didn't eat much local food but plan on it next time. Had a hard time finding a place to go dancing, which I am kinda glad cause I dance like a white guy anyway. She was kinda bummed though. Senor Frogs only had club music to dance to but no Salsa or anything else. We walked to the San Cristobal Fort in Old San Juan http://www.nps.gov/saju/index.htm and we loved it there. The history of that place is pretty amazing and an eye opener. The walk there was just over a mile. We took the bus back to the hotel which was 75 cents compared to $12 cab ride. Next time we may rent bikes and get around that way. We felt safe in Old San Juan but stuck to the tourist spots and dind't go off the beaten path too much. There were cops there blocking traffic for pedestrians and showing force. Thank you San Juan police! There is a trolly that will take you to many stops in Old San Juan for free. The souvenir shops in Old San Juan were all about the same with similar prices and product. The hotel actually had better prices on some things like T-shirts and shot glasses. This hotel used to have a casino back many moons ago. But now the nearest casino is only a 10-15 minute walk across the bridge to the Marriott-Condano Casino. Our hotel gave us $25 casino credit each. We won some money while playing with their money-gotta like that!!! For the most part we stuck to the private beach at the hotel and enjoyed the swimming pools and hot tubs. The pools were of great size but the hot tubs were small. Bartenders Jose and Fernando were great to us! We enjoyed the hammocks and slept half a day away in them with shade from the palm trees. Both of us snorkled in the water and found two small reefs with tropical fish in them. Copy and paste this link into YOUTUBE if you wish to see a short clip of the fish http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWWt2SUKXCg We also had a visit from a small but friendly lizard http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL5-RnmyZGQ again copy and paste if you wish to see the lizard. Drinks were about $10 each so be prepared for that if you are going to drink. There is a small shop across the street that sells water, beer and ready to drink rum. Both of us used this shop often, but it was kinda dirty. Overall we had a great time and will come back here. We found it to be family friendly, with nice guests and the service was right on point. I loved Puerto Rico because most people spoke English, there was no currency exchange, they fly our American flag, and no passports needed. Hope you found this to be helpful.

The open air lobby & check-in desk were a nice touch compared with other hotels with a relatively speedy check-in; we got in at 1:00p on a Thursday with only one other person in line before me. Check-in time is 4:00p, I believe, but they checked us in early with no problems. And while I certainly enjoyed the location in proximity to Old San Juan(OSJ), as well as the privacy of the pool/beach areas, there is definitely room for improvement. 1. Initially given an ocean view room in the main tower. Based on suggestions from other guests, I had called twice prior to my stay to ensure that my reservation was for a more recently remodeled room, but our first room was very outdated and dirty room with a slight view of the ocean (the view was surpassed by the sounds of the restaurant vents, cars, sirens and check-in area below our \"view\"). The wood furniture was warped, splintered and some of the doors to closets/fridge didn't close. I'm short and my knees nearly hit the bathroom door when sitting on the toilet. We were moved to the Garden wing the following day without any resistance & were greeted to a room about 15 years newer (apparently this wing had been remodeled in 2008 or so?). 2. Most of the staff were super friendly & helpful (maybe one person seemed annoyed with my questions). I like to ask locals wherever I travel for ideas on food, shopping, etc. and nearly everyone I asked was more than happy to share their personal recommendations & advice. I truly loved the people of Puerto Rico! 3. Garden view room much more modern. Ask for view of garden & ocean (you will have a balcony over the garden with a fantastic view of the ocean; AND you can be serenaded to sleep by the coqui frogs). Quieter, but still not clean. Hairs covered floor, a/c broken(but they did repair, it just took a long time for the room to cool due to the humidity), patio door lock missing, shower drain plugged, mildew/mold accumulated (a/c not equipped for PR humidity?) 4. No wireless in rooms; not even to purchase. Free WiFi was supposed to be available in main areas. HORRIBLE RECEPTION. I would get a connection for a few minutes, then it would sign off and force me to reenter the password to connect again. Frustrating. It was easier just to find a seat in, or close to, the onsite Starbucks because they had wonderful reception for their free WiFi. 5. Workout facilities were good. But, you have to rent tennis racquets & other fitness items. One would think that the 14% resort fee would cover some of these recreational items. Nothing was free here except for the coffee in the rooms, which was a suprisingly good morning fix for this Seattleite. :) And the Starbucks employees were super friendly & accommodating (i.e. gave me a free pastry when the line wasn't moving & allowed me to fill a cup with half & half for free to take to our room mini fridge for that aforementioned morning coffee). Side note: Starbucks prices were about a dollar more per drink/item than in the Seattle area; prices were the same at all other locations throughout PR, too, so hit up Cuatro Sombras in OSJ. 6. Onsite restaurants very overpriced, although the $15(pre-tax) Hilton Burger was a pretty good substitute for a 4th of July BBQ. :) I suggest researching restaurants in Old San Juan, Condado, etc. Look online at the Travel Channel recommendations (i.e. \"No Reservations\" or \"Man v.

The wife and I went with our 18yr old daughter and her boyfriend as a HS graduation trip and we got adjoining rooms which was a nice set up. Our first night we were in one South facing room and we switched to adjoining the next night on the North face of the building. The views were great from both sides as long as you are up at least four floors. The ocean views are from every room in the large hotel. There are a few other buildings you can stay in that would not provide a great view in some cases. I had high expectations from some \"over dramatized\" stories that I heard about this hotel, like how it boasted one of the biggest and best nightclubs in San Juan with a huge casino. Both of those things are not the case. The main lobby of hotel walks down into the only primary area that could be considered a 'club' but it was more of a small stage and dancing area with a bar that you pass on your way out to the outdoor pool and beach. It was nice but not nearly as Grand as I was expecting. We didn't find any dramatic night club scene in San Juan, and it wasn't short of asking locals and taxi drivers. Senior frogs in Old San Juan was the only big party scene we found on our Sat-Th trip and it was mostly Regaton music with 99% locals all in Spanish (not complaining, that's just what it was). The casino is a short cab ride across the bridge. I found that every cab ride in San Juan is going to cost about $12-15 dollars, no matter if it's 2 miles or 10 miles away. So if you want to go eat in the 'hotel strip' acorss the bridge you can tack $12 to your tab. The Casino has about 100 slots and six card tables so it's not Grand by any means, but it was in a nice modern hotel. I left $70 up but spent $30 celebrating with two shots of Patron on the way out...lol You can walk from the Hilton but I'd have a couple guys with you since you have to travel past a building under construction that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dark and spooky and looks like someone ran out of money on the project... One nice thing about Puerto Rico is you deal in american curency and they have some familiar restaurants like Chili's, a place that hits the belly nicely after eating some interesting native dishes for more than a few days. To save money I walked to the liquor store and stocked up on my favorite spirits which is only about 100yards from the front door of the hotel, purchased a jug, mixed batches of my favorite cocktails filled with ice and brought that to the beach....otherwise you'll pay $15 per drink at the Hotel. I spent just under $100 in liquor and it lasted the entire trip for everyone. The beach area was nice and diverse. Snorkel gear will set you back a rental fee so I would either buy a set at the local store for the same price as one hour and have no limitations or bring a set from home. The snorkeling right off the beach was cool. Tons of fish medium to small, sea urchins, saw a squid or two pass by....but it was nothing compared to the boat rental/snorkeling trip we did out of Fajuerdo. We rented a car for $60 for 24 hours from an independent car rental place located next to the liquor store. It was about an hour drive but a pretty cool one so the time went by fast. There are normal freeways the entire way with mountainous tropical surroundings. The pontoon style boats fit about four normal size people and we all got a chance to drive. We had about 700 lbs of people in our boat so it took a little effort to get them moving full speed within a chain of about five other boats. The sea was a bit choppy for these little boats at times but it made it an adventure and it was allot of fun and we were assured that these they were designed to be almost impossible to flip! One lady opted to travel in the bigger boat that lead us on the way back, everyone else went for it again! The snorkel spots you stop at are in the aqua waters with great visibility. The second stop brings you to the famous island shot in the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie with the white sands and little patch of trees in the center. Very cool spot. You can relax with some snacks they brought or keep on snorkeling. I did both and ended up seeing a sting ray. So hanging at the hotel beach is cool and all, but this boat trip is what made the trip for us. We took another day to check out Old San Juan. It's about a five minute taxi ride from the Hilton. It's been kept up well and has some pretty cool historical features. This is where the big WW2 bunker attraction is that you can pay a small fee to walk through and catch some great views and learn a little about Puerto Rican history. The old paved roads and architecture is neat in this area. This is where the cruise ships dump everyone off so I would try to figure out when they port so you can either party with more people or avoid to limit the crowds. We avoided. There are a million trinket shops and places to eat. There is an old church you can walk through that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty neat too.

I know what I like and I know what to expect, especially at a Hilton. I was disappointed with the hotel itself because first off EVERYTHING is over-priced. It was ridiculous. The entire 5 days we were in Puerto Rico it rained. 90% of our stay was inside the hotel/hotel grounds since we were in the middle of a tropical storm. We would wake up at 6 a.m., go straight to the pool area and lay out until 9 a.m. (that's when it usually started to rain). Our room was probably the worst! As a Hilton Honors Member I have experienced a lot of different types of rooms on our vacations. This was something else. We were on the 3rd floor of the old building. Our balcony view was of the air conditioning system for the entire hotel! Our balcony door was broken. It didn't lock. Actually, let me rephrase, there was no balcony. I'm not sure how to describe this slab of tiles. Only 1 person could be on the balcony at a time. It was adjacent to the roof of the restaurants we would always eat at. Here's the best part...there were workers on the roof every single day...all day! We would have to close the curtains in order to get dressed. And the lighting, it was pretty poor. It actually sucked. Bathroom was creepy because it was very old and outdated and disgustingly dirty. Nothing against the housekeeping staff, just obvious that some corners were cut. I actually have waited over a month to post this because I didn't want to post a bad review. But, in the end, this is what it comes down to: hotel room sucked, everything was over-priced and upon check-out we were notified that there is a 14% resort fee...for EVERY SINGLE DAY you are there. Not for the total trip, so basically we got ripped. I didn't like that aspect because I don't mind paying resort fees to be on a resort. There were never any activities planned, especially due to inclement weather.

At this point, we were disappointed but were looking forward to our beautiful room with an ocean view. To our great surprise, we were sent to a completely filthy and smelly room with a view of the roof and partial ocean view. Of course, we returned to the front desk and requested a clean room with a view of the ocean. This is what we had paid for after all. But, did we get this? No!!! They sent us to an even worse room. I have no idea how this was even possible. Again, we returned to the front desk and agreed to go to the original room they had given us because we had pre-paid for the hotel. We were trapped in this dump!!! And, to top it off, we had to wait about an hour to get into our room because the card key did not work. Did they even offer us water or something during the wait? Nope! We literally waited in front of that room until a staff member was sent to fix the door. How about that!?! Regardless of our experience upon arrival, we tried to be positive. We thought that the service would get better. Did it? Nope!!! It just got worse. Everyone that we encountered was extremely rude and unprofessional. For example, we went to eat breakfast at Las Palmeras on Monday morning. When we arrived, the hostess was having a personal conversation with another employee. Instead of greeting us, she completely ignored us and continued her conversation. At some point, my sister politely interrupted and asked if we could be seated. The hostess gave us a dirty look, made a rude gesture, and told us to follow her. Once we got to our table, she immediately left without saying a word and continued her rudeness.

I've stayed at both mid-range properties (Marriott Courtyard, Hampton Inns, etc.), to higher-end locations (Intercontinental, Four Seasons, Waldorf, etc.). Based on my years of experience with hotel stays, I can honestly say that my experience at the Hilton Caribe San Juan was one of the worst hotel experiences I've had in about 10 years. My first complaint is regarding the service my family and I received upon arriving at the hotel. We arrived on a Sunday, which I later found out was typically the hotels busiest day. It was a madhouse, but this was no excuse for the lax attitude of the staff. After a long 3.5 hour flight and 35 minute drive to the hotel, we were greeted by a traffic jam of cars and buses at the hotel lobby entrance. I saw more than enough adequate staff to handle the volume of cars and visitors, but no one seemed to be leading the staff or the guests. I saw some bellhops helping guests, but no one ever came up to our car to assist, so I finally just hopped out of the car and unloaded my own luggage. While my wife went to check-in, I walked over to the valet and requested that they park my car. Isn't the valet supposed to greet you upon arrival and offer this service? I would expect better service for $20/day parking. Once we checked-in a received our room number, I then had to walk over to the bellhop station and request luggage assistance. Again, I thought the bellhops were supposed to great the guests, not the other way around! The bellhop supervisor didn't even ask for my room number. I had to ask him if he needed it. Had I not done this, I don't know how we would have gotten our bags. Prior to leaving for San Juan we were somewhat concerned about the quality of the rooms based on many of the Hilton Caribe reviews on tripadvisor.com. Thus, my wife had exchanged several emails with Hilton Caribe and Hilton Corporate staff to request a clean/upgraded room. This also includes several email exchanges with Nitzamarie Escalera, who you can see has responded to many posts about the Hilton Caribe on tripadvisor.com. We were assured that we would be booked in a clean/upgraded room. My wife is a bit picky about hotel room cleanliness. I am not as picky (I travel too much for business to worry about that kind of thing), I still prefer a clean room. So with that in mind, after spending about an hour in the lobby, we were finally able to go up to our room in the Hilton Caribe tower. What a disappointment! The room was filthy, even by my standards. Specifically, the baseboards were caked with grime and dust. I wiped one down with a wet wipe and it was black with months of gunk and grime. The rug clearly and not been vacuumed. The room had a tile floor that had obviously not been mopped. There were large food crumbs in corners. There were visible crumbs and dust on the entertainment system under the television. The air conditioner vent leaked water from the ceiling to the floor of the room. Overall, this room was not representative of any Hilton property I'd ever stayed in. When we called the front-desk to complain, they did immediately send a supervisor from housekeeping to inspect the room. She gave the room a quick once over, and sent someone up to clean the room. The guy they sent, did a quick spot clean on a few areas on the floor, vacuumed the rug with an ancient vacuum that spewed toxic fumes/dust and left. I still ended up wiping down the base boards and surfaces of the room myself (he couldn't be troubled to do that). Even the hallway entrance leading to our room was filthy. There was debris all over the floor. It was as if the vacuums that housekeeping used didn't work at all. This whole process had wasted about an hour of our time and we still didn't have our bags! I had to go back downstairs and again ask the bellhop captain to send someone up with our luggage. I should also mention that just about everyone we encountered at the hotel (valet, bellhops, housekeeping) I found not to be very friendly or helpful. Whenever we requested assistance it seemed like we were \"bothering\" the hotel staff. In our previous emails with Nitzamarie Escalera and Hilton corporate, we'd gotten the sense that the staff would really go out of their way to make guests feel welcome. However, this was not the case at all. To sum-up our nightmare at this hotel, after our experience at check-in we finally decided to throw in the (dirty) towel. We ended up driving across the bay to the Conrad Hilton to see if their rooms were any better. Of course, before leaving, it took us about 30 minutes to get our car out of the Hilton Caribe valet. We found that the Conrad Hilton, while also showing it's age, was quite a bit cleaner and more organized than the Hilton Caribe. After speaking with a helpful manager at this property we were able to get one of their few remaining double rooms. We then went back to the Hilton Caribe, packed our bags, and checked-out. This whole process took about 4 hours, note that we'd been up since 5 am to catch our flight to Puerto Rico. What a wonderful way to start our first trip to Puerto Rico!! Overall the Hilton Caribe is a very old property and is showing it's age very badly. Having an older hotel does not have to be a bad thing, if the owners of the property keep the hotel in good condition. This hotel is falling apart.

We have been coming here since 2007, so we wanted to go back to a place where we felt comfortable, especially since it was for a short time. We are both very laid back vacationers and don't like to complain about anything, but sometimes you have to say something. here are a few things we noted on this trip. Grounds / Pool: Last stay before this was back in 2009, we noticed a little difference from the food, drinks, and maintenance of the grounds etc, but put it off as just a minor issue or maybe they were not staffed adequately? anyway, still had a good time, and gave them an outstanding review! This time around we definitely noticed a deterioration. The pool was dirty, cups floating inside and on bottom of the pool ground, gum, and other things like needing a treatment of some sort. This is a family oriented hotel, so we expected to see children, (which is always nice) however, the pools were filled with young teenagers, college kids and small children, so much so that they occupied the whole jacuzzi at one point. I don't know what was going on there this weekend, but it was chaotic and felt more like a budget hotel*, not the 4 star they claim. (*when your paying 4 star prices) Room: We originally booked a garden view room thru our travel agent. wasn't really concerned with the view, but more so a decent room. When we arrived, it was way before check in (maybe around 11am) the concierge graciously gave us a different room, i guess to avoid us having to wait for the garden view that wasn't ready till 4pm, which we would have waited for... she \"upgrades\" us to a partial ocean view. We get to our room, and noticed it was terribly dated (some bldgs and rooms are pending renovations), and our \"ocean View\" was of the roof of another bldg. We had to return to the front desk and ask for another room, preferably the one we originally had booked if necessary, as long as it was not one of the older rooms. We get the garden view and it was much nicer and definitely had some upgrading done. I don't get why they would have put someone there if you had a better room booked to begin with, or have stayed here before, but my observation in talking to other people we met there that have never stayed at the Hilton, is they probably give the good rooms to first time clients to get them to come back? that is what it appears to me. so i was a bit annoyed.. The garden-view room however was dirty, had food stuck on the desk from previous guest, and hairs on the floor. but again, we still had a great time. just disappointed on how the Caribe Hilton fell off from their original standards. will we return? not sure, alot of hotels in PR to visit. I will not take away the nice people you do meet there that have worked at the hotel for years, so when you come back they welcome you like family, but it is business and vacations are limited for some, so i would prefer to go back to a place that is consistent, no surprises :) hope this was helpful.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNice but away from anything\u201d", "Author": "mauiboundLynne", "ReviewID": "UR113139568", "Content": "We stayed at the Caribe on a recommendation for 4 days before a cruise. it was nice enough but it was neither at the beaches nor near Old Town.

We were in San Juan for a wedding, and it was the first time either of us visiting this amazing island. The Caribe Hilton is a beautiful property right on the beach. While it rained every day during our stay, we were able to enjoy a couple of hours at the pool for a little R&R. Our room was updated and fairly clean (som mildew in the shower grout and around the shower frame). The pool area and grounds are gorgeous and really helped us to unwind a bit. We enjoyed a few meals at the restaurants on-site and each meal was high-quality. While the food is pricy in comparison to the states, the pricing is on par with most tourist-filled restaurants. The service was good. Nobody stood out good or bad. My only service complaint was when housekeeping came to clean our room in the early afternoon we were getting dressed for a wedding. So we asked them to come back later and when we returned to our room that night, it had not been cleaned. In hind-sight, we should have rented a car (though I am not sure if the hotel charges for parking and how much that is per day). Cabs are very plentiful, but they cost adds up. And while the location of the Caribe provides a little seclusion, you really are not within walking distance of restaurants, shops, or sights. A cab to Old San Juan is $12 ($24 round-trip). So if you want to go to El Morro and other historic sights during the day, return to the hotel in the afternoon to rest and clean up and then go back for dinner, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $50. Improvements to the hotel to make it a 5 in my book really are very simple. They should offer free internet service in the rooms, free-wi-fi would be great. Your spending minimum of $120/night and they charge for internet. Pretty lame. A shuttle/trolley to the airport and Old San Juan would be nice as well. While the service was good, it could be great. And lastly, mold in the shower is pretty gross in my book. All in all, I will absolutely return to the Caribe Hilton, price permitting.

My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Caribe Hilton at the beginning of May for our honeymoon. Our only regret is that we had not planned a longer stay. Check in was easy and effortless, as Hilton Gold members were were provided with free internet access in the room and our choice of 1,000 extra points per night or free continental breakfast (which may have been the only subpar thing on the entire trip...skip the continental breakfast). We were put in a junior suite in the main tower on the 9th floor with a room overlooking the garden/bird sanctuary, lagoon, fort and the ocean. It was SPECTACULAR. I have heard that the hotel is transition in terms of a total renovation. I believe our room was one of the older ones, as some photos I have seen of other rooms look much more modern, but it was completely acceptable, clean, comfy Hilton bed...and again the view was amazing. We quite enjoyed being in the main tower as the elevators let us out right in the middle of the beautiful open air lobby and was just steps to the pool deck. The pools were fantastic. Temperature was great, the view overlooking the ocean was amazing and the swim up bar was a big plus. Hector and Hiram at the Atlantico Pool Bar were AWESOME! Drinks are pricey...$12 each, but if you get the pitcher for $39 it's a much better value and they are delicious. They will even store the pitcher in the freezer for you if they have room...so the rest of your drinks won't melt in the sun. We ate twice at the Pina Colada club. This is the least expensive dining option at the resort and actually has good food and great drinks. We enjoyed the Pina Colada and Passion Fruit drinks. They were only $8 & $9 and a little bigger then those at the pool bar, I think. The jerk chicken quesadilla is not to be missed, especially if you like spicy food. The spicy sauce that accompanies it is yummy! Saturday there was live entertainment outside by the pool and a party in the lobby bar with music at night. The lobby was very lively even at 1am -- but not loud enough to impose on your stay while in your room. There is a liquor store and a subway across the street from the main entrance if you want to grab a sandwich or mix some drinks in your room and save a few bucks. Most will find it more convenient to take a cab to visit Old San Juan as it's a few miles down the road, but we walked back after dinner one night and it was doable. Going the other way to Ashford Ave was a breeze, view a bridge that had a pedestrian walkway over the Condado Lagoon. In about a mile or so you have access to plenty of bars and restaurants -- lots of dining options. I had spent a good amount of time talking to other travelers and reading through posts on the travel forum of this site and many made it seem like the Caribe was to far to walk to anything. My husband and I did not find this to be the case, particularly if you are used to a city environment where you walk several blocks to get from point A to point B. We enjoyed the fact that the resort was tucked away, had a private beach and more privacy in general, yet a walk over the bridge and a 1 - 1.5 mile walk gave plenty of options. Dining options were expensive on site, but no different then other hotel restaurant options we've stayed in. Mortons Steakhouse has a great happy hour with very reasonably priced drinks and appetizers, try to catch that! The front desk personnel were very friendly. Jose in particular was a joy. We also happened to be at the hotel while the Best Buy event was in town and unlike the previous reviewer did not have any issue getting drinks at the hotel bars, etc. Maybe we got lucky, but just wanted to note that. Our friends were in town the same weekend and stayed at the Marriott. There was more of a night life feel in their lobby with the casino, etc. but the Caribe was definitely more resort like and had much prettier grounds. Everywhere you look you can see the ocean surrounding you, there are iguanas and other lizards walking around, the bird sanctuary and large koi pond was beautiful. They really have thought of everything. Starbucks in the lobby, as well as some other boutiques for shopping. We had an amazing time and are already planning our next trip...

The rooms were spacious and the balcony overlooked the water and felt very private because there was a full wall on either side (rather than just railings so that you are looking at your neighbors balcony). We don't have any children yet but, this strikes me as an ideal place to stay with little kids. There are multiple kids activities and the swiming beach is actually a large lagoon so, the surf is calm and because of the rounded shape it's fairly easy to keep an eye on the whole thing from any angle. There are 3 or 4 restaurants at the hotel and a Starbucks, we didn't eat at all of them but the ones we did try were good. The jerk chicken quesadilla wih spicy sauce at the pina colada club was the best meal I had. The downside is that the restaurants and drinks on sight are pretty expensive and there is not much else that we found off the resort within walking distance. You can take a taxi to old san juan for more restaurants and shoping, it takes about 10 minutes and the cost is 15$. I do have a couple of minor complaints about the service, which is not what I expected from a 5 star hotel with the Hilton name. First, when my husband and I left for the day (around 9:00) I saw the housekeeping staff cleaning other rooms on our floor. I made sure there was no \"quite please\" sign on our door and when I returned at 3, our room was still not made up. I had to call the housekeeping and request service. The other was when I went to get floats at the pool and the interrogated us about if we had kids, how many kids we had and how many floats we wanted. We were told rath by the crabby staff that told we could absoloutely not have more than 1 per person. Well they are rather small noodle type floats where 1 works for a child but, you really need 2 as a full grown adult. I would have no problem abiding by this policy or going without entirely so that a child could have one. My problem was the manner in which we were treated and the fact that this was monday morning, most weekend guests had gone home, there were a ton of floats and the beach was not crowded by any stretch. You'd think they could lend us 2 floats with the request that we return them as soon as we were finished incase other guests showed up or at least be a little nicer about the whole thing. The other minor issue was that when we went to get cash for a taxi to the airport both cash machines were out of money! We asked both the restaurant and the front desk to please run our credit card for 20$ additional and were told they could not do it because of the credit card charge. Well, I know credit card fees are usually around 5% so I hardly thought that the fee on an extra 20$ would be of consequence for a multi million dollar hotel chain especially considering the price we paid for the room not to mention food and drink. Also, my huband and I offered to pay the fees or more (we would have gladly tipped the waitress 50$ just to have her give by 20$ because we were really in a bind). The bell man did call us a cab which accepted credit cards (most there don't) but, it took a while to get there. Luckily our flight ended up being delayed. Anyways, sorry if these things sound really picky but, when you stay at a resort of this caliber, world class (not just fairly good) customer service should be part of the experience. All and all, if you decide to stay here you will probably have a nice relaxing vacation and not go home disspointed!", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the younger set\u201d", "Author": "Fiveforme", "ReviewID": "UR105440103", "Content": "Convenient location, would definitely rent a car though.

There is no consideration offered by the Caribe Hilton in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We made reservation for a post-cruise stay at this Hilton for April 3 through April 8, 2011. I made the reservations in early January, 2011. I requested an early check-in because we had VIP Priority Disembarkation from the cruise ship. I realize that early check-in is not a guarantee. Two weeks before our stay at the Hilton, I called the hotel and again reminded them that we would be arriving early and would like an early check-in if possible. We arrived at the hotel at 9:30 and were told that our room was not ready. We were told to call an extension, (7000), request room status, and check to see if our room was ready. I would call the number and/or check with the front desk several times, and each time, I was told that the room was not ready. At 12:00, I was told that the people had checked out of our room and they were waiting for housekeeping to prepare the room. I checked the room status at 1:00 and again at 2:00; both times, I was told the room is still not ready. At that time, I asked to speak to the hotel manager; and he was not forthright telling me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing that he could do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After another \u00c2\u00bd hour of waiting, I called another hotel to see if they had a suite available for the week, they did. I then proceeded to the front desk and told the salesperson that if a room is not available in the next ten minutes we were going to another hotel. She said to wait, she was going to talk to the hotel manager. Then, magically, a room became available. The room that was offered, was an oversized closet with an industrial view. Rejecting this offer, the salesperson again went to talk to the hotel manager, whereupon they offered us a smaller room. At that point, I cancelled the reservation and we proceeded to the Marriott for our week stay. Waiting for five and half hours in a hotel lobby for a reservation is not what I call customer consideration. When the room was vacated, (at noon), and the Hilton staff knew that someone was waiting in the lobby since 9:30 am to check in, that that room would be given top priority by housekeeping. I doubt very much if we will ever consider staying at a Hilton especially the Caribe Hilton.

Some tips to make the most of your stay: -- before you make a reservation online (either directly with the hotel or via any other web site), call the hotel directly to see if they are running any specials. By making our reservation with the hotel, we were able to get one night free along with free breakfast every morning of our stay. -- do not stay in the Villas section! The Hilton Caribe's web site makes it sound luxurious, but the Villas are definitely the oldest and most run-down part of the resort. We had booked our room there, but ended up switching to a room in the main building after being overwhelmed by the musty, moldy air in the Villas. We even looked at other rooms in the Villas to find a \"fresher\" one, but they were all the same. Despite the high-maintenance start to our stay, the hotel's staff was extremely patient and accommodating. -- there are mini refrigerators in every room, so instead of purchasing too many overpriced beverages at the hotel, stop at a store on your way there and stock up. There aren't any stores within easy walking distance of the hotel, but there is a SuperMax grocery store along the way from the airport. -- if you plan to venture out from the resort, look into renting a car. We went on daily excursions to nearby areas (Old San Juan, Condado, Pinones) and spent, on average, $30+ a day on taxis; it probably would have been more economical if we had rented a car. General thoughts on the hotel: -- it is a bit secluded as far as being within easy walking distance to anything, so be prepared to walk a lot, or take taxis, or rent a car. -- its seclusion, though, does mean that the resort sprawls over a lot of land so you never feel like it's over crowded. -- our free continental breakfast wasn't extensive, but it was totally adequate and was an easy way to start the day.

Cleanliness for the event, 1700 athletes and their families, pretty darn good! Service at Starbucks on property..good. Service at Hotel restaurants...good. Drinks at Hotel bars were expensive, $12 for slushy cocktails but when its hot out price is not an option. Hotel location not bad but you will need either a rental car, a big wallet for expensive taxi's, a good pair of walking shoes because Old SanJuan is a 30 min walk. Buses are also an option too. Condado is about a 10 min walk over the bridge with other dining options at the Conrad Hotel and downtown areas. Don't expect chic in town but you will get chic in the Conrad hotel. SanJuan area has alot of abandoned buildings for one reason or another. I felt very safe everywhere in and around the hotel and every where we walked. Rooms could use some minor fixes, like removing mold in shower, make common hallways a little more welcoming. Sleep quality..i love the smooshy beds and pillows. My partner had a bad back the entire trip. Depends on your sleep style. Fajardo beaches and town are about 45 minutes from the Caribe and not really worth it. El Yunque Rainforest..its a rainforest so expect rain and fog alot! Bring raincoats and change of clothes, don't know if I read that anywhere on TripAdvisor. If the rainforest is fogged in don't expect dramatic vistas. Quick sum up...best restaurant experience DragonFly, best breakfast any bakery.

This place is known for their customer service. One delightful young lady whom we saw working the front desk for a very long shift (I wish I caught her name) responded \"I love my job!\" when we commented on what a long day she was putting in. When we checked in, a very helpful man named Omar saw to it we had just the perfect room. We were travelling with friends and we love to cook, so Omar saw to it we had adjoining suites and our room had a full kitchen. Perfect! We bugged poor Carmen from housekeeping so much to assist us in getting cooking utensils, but she was unfailingly polite and helpful. The day we were to leave we found out that \"The Ironman Competion\" was being held, which meant all the streets around the hotel were blocked off by the police for this Triathalon. We were frantic we would miss our flight, as the police told us no cars could go in or go out. Jose, the manager on duty, came to our rescue, and promised that he himself would drive us to the airport if we could not get a cab! Well, the day of departure, Jose was in the lobby assisting all departing guests and ensuring a cab was available for all of us. So my hats off to the employees who do more than just tell you a good restaurant or bring an extra pillow to your room. These folks are A++ in hospitality. (But they did give good recommendations---San Jose Cafe and Dragonfly Restaurant were fantastic). Oh yes, I also want to say the hotel is spotlessly clean, the beach area is gorgeous and beach chairs are always available. The AC in our room was a bit cold and we had trouble regulating it but I would prefer too cold than too hot! The beds are fluffy comfortable with lots of pillows for great sleeping.

We were envisioning spending time exploring these tropical gardens, and walking to restaurants in old San Juan.

Turns out, the continental breakfast (toast, hard boiled eggs, coffee) was complimentary, but the GOOD breakfast (ie: mimosas and omlette bar) was a $15 upgrade for a diamond member a piece, or $30 a head otherwise! Norton's is right on site and is wonderful wonder wonderful. Some of the best steak I've ever had (and I lived in Argentina) and the servers went above and beyond to make my fiance's 30th birthday special. The front desk and other reception staff however, left much to be desired. Upon checkin, in the VIP line, we were handed our room keys and were hurried away from the desk. Left standing there, we had to stumble around until we found our room ourselves in the back tower. The room itself was spacious, had a great bathroom and nice balcony with a view, great for evening cocktails etc. The room itself was definitely well used, there were burn marks in the carpet from a hot iron falling on it, the carpet in the hallway was all bunched up so that when you opened the door it got stuck and there was a good sized hole in the wall in the bathroom that had a pretty strong breeze coming through it. (not huge issues, but at $300 a night, one would expect to not encounter these kind of issues). The bars at the hotel were very nice, staff was very friendly but they are SUPER overpriced!! Two 10oz beers will run you about $20 without tip. Best advice would be to go directly across the street from the hotel (if you head out near the tropical restaurant on the outside) and buy your beer there. You can get six packs of beer, wine and liquor for much much more reasonable prices. My boyfriend actually proposed while we were there and we requested champagne glasses for our room to celebrate. I called once and was told they'd be right up, called again a half our later, and then finally went to the bar myself and had to go get them since our request was ignored. Two other things to do while you're there: The Condado hotel is within walking distance of the Caribe and it has a great casino. Drinks and food is free while you're there, we spent several nights there before heading out and enjoyed the complimentary refreshments. Also, the Caribe will provide vouchers for $5 match betting on tables and points towards the slots (this really excited my fiance) - we were pretty lucky too! Ended up coming home with a few hundred dollars in winnings. Also, the Sea Ventures Discover Scuba program is AMAZING. We booked it through the concierge right at the hotel (DEFINITELY USE SEA VENTURES) DO NOT book scuba through the guy that has a hut on the beach, he literally takes you out in the cove at the hotel. Sea ventures took us on an amazing trip to Fajardo, Palomino and Palominito (where they filmed Pirates of the Carribbean!) Two dives, lunch, gear and transport for $180 a person, such a wonderful deal. The staff was incredibly nice and accomodating, our driver even took us grocery shopping on the way home. It was my first dive ever and I can't say enough good things about the instructor. He was awesome. Also, check out a restaurant called Budatai, its near the La Concha hotel and the seafood/sushi/ceviche is the best I have ever had.

All the staff from the front desk staff, to the porters, to Hector (bartender), to the breakfast buffet staff were friendly and offered outstanding customer service. The hotel is about a 15 minute taxi ride from the airport and the cab fare was about $ 21. The hotel is located near the Pan American Cruise Terminal and was abouta a $ 10 cab fare. We had dinner at the Mortan's Steak House located at the Caribe Hilton. It's very pricy but the food was outstanding!!!! My husband is a member of the Hilton Honors program and we received a coupon for the breakfast buffet ($15 each). It was a champagne buffet with omelets made to order, fresh squeezed orange juice and just about anything else you could desire.

Room was clean and comfortable, and complete with fridge, which is very convenient! The pool area was fantastic for our 7 and 8 year old daughter and son - they made lots of friends, and we had a clear view of their activities through all areas of the pool. The beach part was very nice for families as it was calm, and provided decent snorkeling for the beginner - our son loved this feature. The bartenders at the pool bar were so much fun, and we ended up purchasing our drinks by the pitcher, which was convenient and less expensive than by the glass - the margaritas are really good! I suggest using any breakfast coupon and upgrading to the full breakfast - kids 12 and under are free in the full buffet, and the adults are only a $15 upgrade, which is great for those of us who like champagne with breakfast, as it's included on the buffet - self serve mimosas with fresh squeezed orange juice are always a good thing!

My wife and 2-year-old came along for the trip as well. At one point, taking a shuttle bus back from the conference, I ended up riding past all the hotels in the conference block, which were all the major hotels in Condado and Isla Verde, since the Hilton was the last shuttle stop (hence the walk thereafter). From what I saw the Caribe Hilton was easily the best hotel. It's location is fantastic, but it's facilities were obviously superior. The hotel pool and private beach are quite simply fantastic. My wife and kid spent five whole days outside in the sand and water and at the playground, and they never got bored. Anything except a private cabana is free, so you don't have to worry about paying for a beach chair, umbrella, towel or hammock. In fact, they had a guy who comes by with a drill and pops an umbrella next to you in exactly the right spot. From our room we could see the beach at the Conrad down the street, and it was pathetic compared to the beach at the Hilton, which is probably why nobody seemed to use it. We had a room in the tower, which was fine. We had a huge king bed and a crib for our son. The bathroom was updated with a huge shower, and we loved the balcony. At night we could put on of the room's lamps on the balcony and relax and read while our son went to sleep inside the room. We ate at all the eateries on-site except the steakhouse. The continental breakfast was OK, nothing to write home about but perfectly adequate. They could inform you better though about the selections (eggs, french toast etc) that are on display but cost more. The food and drinks at Club Pina Colada were outstanding, we ate there multiple times. The frozen mojito and Pina Colada were amazing there. Definitely eat there if you stay at the Hilton. We also are at Lemongrass, which is the on-site Asian fusion restaurant. It's setting is amazing, inside a gorgeous garden, but this meal was the lowlight of our stay. The service was simply atrocious, taking over half an hour just to get us menus and water with lots of waitstaff seemingly doing nothing. With a young child waiting that long is not fun. My wife and son's meals came out first, while my meal came out half an hour after theirs. They had no children's menu, but cooked up some chicken fingers for our son, then tried to charge us $20 for them! When we complained they reduced the price by half, but still, it's just four chicken fingers. The entire experience was infuriating, which is too bad, since the food was pretty good and the setting was idyllic. I would give this place a pass until they clean up their act, however.

The boys could go to the ocean, play basketball, or use the pools. Great views and wonderfully maintained grounds. Our only recommendation is that the hotel place more emphasis on two key areas: the initial welcome and the young staff members focusing on the guests rather than their cellular phones. Upon arrival our room was not ready. We waited an additional hour and a half. The welcome staff did not apologize and were not sensitive to the fact that we had just flown and we were tired hoping to get settled into the room. I feel that the welcome is key to your customer service and staff should be more focused on ensuring that the inital contact with the hotel is pleasant and welcoming. Secondly, the young staff tend to be constantly on their cell phones texting or talking. They dont awknowledge guests until they are off their call or finished with their text. Management should make a rule that no cellular phones be used while working. Young staff in the parking garage and around the grounds spend too much time chatting and not attending to guests questions or needs.

The whole property has a patched-together quality, the result of too many decades of incremental expansion with new wings and buildings, without ever having mounted a comprehensive redesign.

Server was awesome. >lockerr ooms/showers were great to use after a day at the pool, and before heading over to the cruise port.... hair dryers are provided, but be sure to bring your own soap and towel! >wifi in the lobby... (if you can figure out the access codes!!) not something they openly tell you at check in, you have to dig for the information it seems! Lowlights: >did not receive upgraded room (but also understand that its based on availability....if they were \"truly\" sold out that night, fine. Gut tells me they were not.) >free breakfast, also included in HHonors perks= extremely poor food quality, and was nothing more than a highschool cafeteria steam line atmosphere. Hot food items were an additional charge. We did not go for the bait! >If you need to call the front desk for ANY reason... be prepared to be transferred multiple times... The name of the game here is \"pass the buck\" and this (unfortunately) created a lot of frustration right out of the gate for us. >upon arrival to our room with our bags, the door was actually propped open slightly w/ the lock, lights were on, and we immediately felt somewhat nervous that we were not the only ones w/ keys to the room. Called guest services to get an explanation, got transferred to Security who said they'd look into it, who also passed the buck to housekeeping. Ultimately, NO ONE looked into it, and it was impossible to get it resolved. >no information was provided at check in regarding internet service in room....discovered wifi was not available in the room, and had to plug in to high speed cable. $14.95 charge that required a phone call (or two) to guest services to be resolved, again as HH Diamond Members do not pay for internet access at any property >pop machine on our floor spit out COKE when you selected DIET COKE. Kind of frustrating when you're paying $1.25 for a can. Again, it took a call to guest services who passed the buck to Security who then passed the buck to Housekeeping, who then passed the buck to Room Service. Seriously, all we wanted was the bloody can of coke exchanged for diet!!! LOL! Imagine explaining why you're calling, 4 different times. It gets old. Would I stay here again if given the choice? No. I think there's a lot to be said for correcting problems behind the scenes without transferring a call 3+ times, and forcing the guest to explain the issue three times. The staff seem to lack some basic customer service skills. We did not encounter anyone who was outright rude to us, but they do not have a \"seamless\" feel to their level of service. I've had exceptional service at Hampton Inn's where the cost is $80 a night. I expect a whole lot more when the cost is triple that!!

I was particularly excited to make my first visit to San Juan and stay at the legendary Caribe Hilton. Unfortunately, the hype far outweighed the actual experience, and there are some real issues here which should give prospective vacationers in particular pause. First off, and this won't apply to all Trip Advisor readers, but I never felt treated well as a Hilton VIP. I was given a room in the far back of the hotel (\"garden rooms\"), the Gold/Diamond line at reception was always backed up (see \"random charges\", below), and the complimentary breakfast requires a $5 \"upcharge\" if you want any hot items (otherwise it's strictly a continental affair). Given the volume of business this place churns out, they probably don't need to pay much attention to Gold status folks, but it was still disappointing. More generally - there is a real issue concerning the location of the hotel. It's very much by itself, sort of in between Condado and Old San Juan. Unfortunately the location is also a little scary, once you get off property. I'm a young guy and I walked into OSJ at midday one afternoon, and I would definitely not do that again - lots of sketchy characters, abandoned businesses, etc. The concierge told me that they discourage guests from leaving the property at night, period, unless it's in a taxi. So - the bottom line is that there really are no restaurants or other resorts nearby that you can take advantage of, and a cab ride to any of the other tourist districts will set you back $12 (Condado) to $20 (Isla Verde). If you're here on business, as I was, you can write those expenses off, but for a vacationing family it adds up. The service at the Caribe Hilton is, as expected, \"island quality\". Generally this means friendly but unhurried, to put it politely. However I did have two negative service experiences. One was the housekeepers, who start pretty early (8-8:30) and were unbelievably loud in their hallway conversations. It was to a point where, if I had been staying any longer than 3 days, I would have asked to speak to the Housekeeping supervisor, the maids were that obnoxious. The second was the appearance of random \"bellman\" and \"maid\" charges on my bill, which totaled just $7 but completely baffled me as to their origin. I would have inquired at the front desk at check out, but, again, the lines were painfully long. A final note on charges: the 14% resort fee is pretty worthless if you're on business. It doesn't even get you free 1-800 calls or free internet or anything useful in that respect, just amenities at the beach etc. All that being said - the Caribe Hilton is a beautiful property, with a great series of pools and views of the ocean. Some of the restaurants are quite good (I particularly liked Lemongrass) and they do have daily activities like yoga classes, pina colada tastings, etc. There's no casino but there are several bars that stay open late. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel for vacationers - you'd be better off staying in Old San Juan itself, or in one of the two \"beach\" districts (Condado or Isla Verde). Similarly, I can't in good faith recommend it for business travelers - if my experience is a guide, you won't be the main clientele base and won't receive much in the way of attentive or personalized service.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cPublic areas awesome, guest rooms tired\u201d", "Author": "slaterinde", "ReviewID": "UR97094959", "Content": "We found that this resort is in a great location and the public areas are incredible.

The woman at the Business Center treated us like we were there to steal something and enforced the '10 minutes of computer time' rule too forcefully. At one point we requested a new room key because one of our cards was not working properly. They simply asked for our room number and gave us a new key; no identification was requested at all! We could have been there to steal other people's belongings - this incident made me feel that the hotel has very lax security standards. Don't use the cabs to go into Old San Juan! Ask around to find out where the bus stop is and use the M3 or ME bus - it's only 50 or 75 cents; a one way cab ride is $12. Getting the bus back is as simple as finding the transportation center (down near where the ships come in) and grabbing the right bus. The hotel staff lied and told us that the buses are unreliable, but we found them to be very reliable. I will recommend this hotel, but with the caveats stated earlier (tired rooms, unfriendly staff).", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation\u201d", "Author": "pushkinhoward", "ReviewID": "UR96998655", "Content": "Just got back from staying in Carib Hilton for 8 nights.

The hotel is away from everything except a Subway sandwich shop and a small liquor store. You need to walk at least 15 minutes to Condado and it is not a safe walk at night. The alternative is a $12 taxi ride to most places. Also, the restaurants are ridiculous. Went to Il Giardino and was disappointed by the service and value. Atlantico pool bar was overpriced but still nice and the staff was very friendly. Palmeras breakfast is disappointing for the money. Was very happy with Pina Colada Club. The staff there is very friendly and they make great drinks. Also, you get more for your money with the meals. If you don't go there, I would find a restaurant away from the hotel.

I had a partial water view, all for about 100/night through hotwire. The room did show some age but nothing like what other reviewers have posted here. The bathroom especially was clearly in need of a facelift but it was strictly cosmetic with everything in working order. Maid service was very efficient and cordial, always giving enough towels, soap, lotion, etc. I left the room to discover the real jewel of this resort is its outdoor spaces. A great pool, hammocks for lounging, a jacuzzi, and a great beach. The biggest problem with this resort is its location and the resorts incredibly expensive food (very poor quality) and wine. There are only a few restaurants on sight, none with anything special. The only non-resort restaurants within walking distance are a subway and a small local hole in the wall diner/bodega. You will be left with deciding to spend the money to go into town for a decent meal or forking over big bucks (I'm talking 100 for two people for mediocre food) at the resort. The cheapest wine was close to 40 bucks/bottle and was nothing to write home about. Examples of terrible food I tried: pizza for $30 (think frozen then microwaved pizza from the grocery store), breakfast buffet for $40 (using liquid egg product to make all egg dishes, including the horrible watery scrambled eggs), $70 seafood appetizer @ Morton's---very under spectacular for the price. The only restaurant serving anything close to good was the Pina Colada club at the very edge of the resort. While nothing was particularly local, the fish tacos were good and reasonably priced ($15).

We stopped in at several other hotels and concluded that Caribe Hilton was the nicest--no casino, but that is a plus for us. The pool area is beautiful, with free floats in the morning and a couple of nice jacuzzi pools. Some tour books criticize the lobby but we liked it--it's airy and comfortable, with a Starbucks, beautiful parrots, fruit-flavored water offered at no charge and a nice vibe. The service was very good at every level, including Mildred at the front desk who was very helpful. The garden area is stunning with peacocks, swans & fish in a pond.

Our room was billed as an oceanfront villa. Oceanfront yes, but an extremely cramped studio apartment would have been more spacious than this so-called villa. Where do I begin? Walking from our lobby to our room, incidentally at 12 am after traveling all day from Europe with a 4 month old baby: 1) we were offered no assistance with our luggage--enough for a 2 week stay away from home; 2) leftovers from the New Year's Eve bash (I assume) littered the hallways, broken glass and trash outside at the cabana; 3) God knows what floating in the pool. On arriving in the room, it was cramped, dirty, musty, the bathroom tiles--which appeared to have applied by a novice--looked to be in the process of slowly falling off the walls, and there were cigarette burns in the carpet. There was no in-room wireless service, but you could purchase ethernet service for $15 a day. Very limited channel selection on the television but you could purchase an episode of the office for $10. At those prices I shudder to think what an actual movie would have cost. Local calls on the telephone weren't free, you had to pay for them. We ordered room service and the food was passable for room service but a sandwich and fries (which we split) and 2 ginger ales ran us over $40. It may seem like a small issue but the picture hanging over our bed--of a surfboard I think--was askew. Like 45 degrees askew. I thought at first it was maybe an artistic touch but I think it was just inattentive housekeeping. Really the only plus about the place were the beds. They were very comfortable and we actually got a decent night's sleep. The view from the patio the following morning was nice if you overlooked the disintegrating and moldy deck chairs and the rusted and pitted door fixtures and peeling paint. And the bargain price for this unmitigated dump? $300. This is our first time traveling to San Juan and if this is what $300 gets you we'll never visit again. For that price I think it is reasonable to expect a modestly spacious room (being able to turn around in it without stepping over the beds would have been acceptable), immaculately kept and refurbished within the last decade. I also don't expect to be nickel-and-dimed for every little thing every time I turn around.

One - there is no decent walkway from the resort/pool area to the tropical gardens. One night, I walked alone from the pool to the gardens and had to walk through an unlit, rocky pavement which was a bit scary. It almost felt like an alley way.

It was so load that the noise traumatized my son and the hotel's parrots/cockatoos in the lobby. The front desk didn't care one bit about this or customer service in general. One day, it rained and flooded the lobby bar. All but one of the hotels six restaurants tasted like industrial cafeteria food (except we paid $100 for dinner and $50 for breakfast). The only positive about the hotel is that it had six pools and a private beach, though we spent most of our days sightseeing so we didn't even enjoy this. We were alos charged the 14% \"resort fee\" twice -- once when we prepaid for the hotel and once when we checked out. When I complained to the front desk, they told us that they cannot remove the charge -- a big lie, of course. If you are like us and have all your hotel loyalty points tied up with Hilton HHonors, try the Conrad a block away.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it old and dilapidated as some reviews has stated.

The pier is lovely, you can see the reefs and tons of fish, they even give you some bread to feed them and that is quite the sight. Our room had a beautiful view, as long as you looked past the roof top. Ask for a room in the tower but away from the roof so you get the best view, it was still totally amazing to wake up and see the grounds and ocean.

We did find the hotel a little isolated but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you have to do if you want a private beach and lagoon resort feel. The Hilton stands alone from the other hotels which are also nice. It is a 2 mile walk to Old Town and there is nothing much around the Hotel. We walked to Condado which is a mile or so to other restaurants as the Hotel food prices were truly exorbitant. The Pool grill food was awful and very expensive. The Hilton should really try to encourage people to stay but at those prices, and nothing local about it we opted to eat out for most meals. We did have the breakfast buffet one morning which was amazing but cost almost $50 for the two of us, a little excessive for breakfast! We found some fabulous restaurants in OSJ. This weekend was also the tree lighting ceremony and the food and cultural festival which offered some wonderful local and international foods. We ate at Marmalade one night, as it was my birthday, it was expensive but worth it if you really want to eat like a judge on Iron Chef, it was like art. We did walk back to the hotel one night, defiantly not advisable. There are lots of derelict and abandoned buildings on the main roads and I did not feel safe at all.

Our flight arrived at 5AM the day before our cruise (on Saturday) so we took an easy cab ride ($19 plus $1 per bag) to the Caribe Hilton. My husband had stayed at the hotel 20 years before for a wedding. This was my first time to PR. We had set up with the hotel a half day rate so that we could check in that early and the rate was very reasonable. Since it was so early, very few people were around. The entranceway was beautiful with the lights and was quiet impressive. I also was impressed with the open air lobby. We were put in a Tower Room which at 5:30AM seemed very far away from the check-in. We were put in the 11th floor. Room: At that time, we were happy to have a nice comfortable bed, which it was, but were disappointed that there was no water available. We were quite thirsty from our travels and even the hallway vending machine would not take our money. DH had to melt down some ice from the ice machine. I know this seems minor but the hotel we stayed at the end of our week (which was less than half the price of the Caribe), provided two bottles of complimentary water. Anyways, as I mentioned, the bed was super comfortable and the pillows were the best of any hotel I have ever stayed in (I need to know what kind they were). The room was a decent size with a balcony overlooking the parking area and lagoon. The bathroom was quite large with a huge walk in shower and double sinks. There was an impressive flat screen television which we did not even use. Now come the complaints, while it seemed they have done some updating, it still needs some work. The floor was warped in places and the carpet seemed worn. Plus, you could hear EVERYTHING that was going on in the hallways! Others have mentioned this in their reviews, and I would have to agree. We were awoken to slamming of doors and people walking to the elevator. This motivated us to get up, put on our bathing suits, and head down to their pool/beach area. Grounds: This is definitely the highlight of this hotel. The grounds are very beautiful with many different nooks and crannies. You have the calm lagoon area, the pier, the seats along the sea wall (with the waves crashing against it) the pool area, and the back pond near the fort. We were lucky to find two seats on the round pier (see picture) with the water right behind our heads. We loved this spot! The resort was busy but we were still able to relax. The lagoon was calm and clean and a perfect place to cool off from the hot sun. There is a beautiful pool area with a swim up bar. We actually ate lunch here, and albeit a little expensive, it was very good. My DH had a salmon sandwich and I had a mahi one. There was only a mahi salad on the menu but they were very happy to accommodate my wish. We thought that the bartenders were excellent and enjoyed sitting there (and drinking pina coladas and mojitos). They do not take cash but only cc or you can charge it to your room. This is probably b/c the drinks are expensive and people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care as much if they are not handing over the cash! Overall, the landscaping was very nice but we did notice some places that need to be refurbished (the bridge over by the pond and Asian restaurant is in desperate need of a good painting). Restaurants: Beside the one at the pool, we did not eat at any of the restaurants but that is because we were only there one night and already planned on going to Marmalades in Old San Juan. The property has three restaurants all in prices you can expect for a resort (a little on the high side). We did sit in the lobby bar which was a happening place on a Saturday night (prices once again on the high side). As we were leaving on Sunday, we both wished we could spend another day or two at the Caribe. We found that this is a great resort for an extended weekend but could be very expensive for anything more than that. Our TA booked this for us and she got us a good price (I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I would pay some of the prices they were asking).

After about 45 minutes, the two hotel employees (one of them was Jose) came and told them they are holding the lounge chairs for other clients. They were very rude, they did not try to find other chairs for them, they did not help them to move either. We are non-white and felt they were purposefully rude so that we do not come to the beach again. We were told by other guests that these employees taking money from local rich ladies for reserving seats for them depriving legitimate guests. They do have a beach club for local people and take additional bribe from them to provide special treatment. It was truly a bad experience particularly as we paid $37 + tax for resort facility per day in addition to rental charges to Travelocity. They also charged $14.95 per day for internet that did not work very well and $16 per day for parking.

Our room was a decent size, very clean, and the bed was heaven. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t request an ocean view, but we got one that looked east down the entire coast line of PR. Sure there was some view of a roof top, but we were high up enough that we saw WELL beyond that. The only complaint I have is we had to call the front desk a few times about issues, which they were happy to fix, if you were willing to wait a long time. Our hair dryer didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, and they said they would bring one up\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.which they did over an hour later. Our remote didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, they said they would bring up a new one\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.which they did several hours and a second phone call later. We were on vacation so we were laid back about it, but it was certainly annoying. The restaurants are definitely not cheap, but I cant complain about the food, its amazing. The pool side bar and the Pina Colada restaurant aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad, hamburger for $14, chicken fingers wer2 $12, salads about the same and hot dog for $8. We went to the Itialian restaurant which was great, , pasta dishes are around $20-25. And you can never go wrong with a Mortons steak, but its going to cost you. We got to go to Old San Juan and eat out there which I HIGHLY suggest you do. Food is cheaper and Old San Juan is great. . Last a 100% must is a hike through El Yunque Rainforest. The hotel has a deal that provides guided transportation and the tour for $53 which is a pretty good deal if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to go to the Bio Bay because of the weather, but really wanted to, the hotel offers a tour and transportation for $90 which is a bit much, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure worth it. The hotel is definatley secluded, so if you are looking for a quite, relaxing vacation, this is 100% your spot, especially if you love the beach over pools. If you need some place more lively, you might want to venture somewhere else. We went to the Condado (Conrad) to use their casino and it looked nice, and only a short walk from the Hilton. The Marriott and Intercontinenal are in a great and lively area. We walked to Old San Juan from the Hilton which was beautiful (but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it at night) but it was a good 20 min walk.

I researched the heck out of Puerto Rico before booking my trip, and the Caribe delivered within all the parameters I was looking for in a place to stay. Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be helpful to take you through my decision-making thought process. I definitely wanted a good beach. While my idea of a vacation is more adventurous and active, my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideal vacation is to relax on a beach. That meant anything in the Condado area, Isla Verde, or out east to Fajardo would work in that regard. I seriously considered the El Conquistador in Fajardo. The only thing holding me back was the poor recent reviews. I saw it from a distance when we took a boat out to Calebra and it looked magnificent. I was drawn to the El Conquistador\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more isolated setting, but another negative is the beach is not readily available; it takes a short boat ride. That may have not been a problem for us either, but some people complained about the fact you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just walk down to a beach on the property. The other area I considered was Isla Verde. The Intercontinental and Ritz I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been fine, and the beach great, but I really liked the idea of having a more private beach. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done the south Florida thing a couple times and preferred something where not anyone and everyone can walk the beach. Isla Verde seemed too close to the airport as well; I imagined lots of noise. Also wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that excited to stay at a casino hotel (but we went and gambled at the Conrad anyway\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6go figure). The Caribe seemed to fit into what I was looking for. On a four night trip, we could do the Old San Juan sites, enjoy a private beach, great ocean views, and be off the beaten path somewhat (which is both good and bad\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the bad being too few food choices within walking distance). Having an ocean room was also a requirement of mine, and the Caribe compared nicely on price, but honestly cost was not much a factor; everyone was fairly similar through our CheapCaribbean.com booking. The Caribe lobby is impressive. Wide open, clean, and greeted by the ocean. We were completely happy with our room. Top floor, good view of the ocean, the fort, and Condado. The king bed was super comfortable and had at least 6 pillows. No issues with cleanliness or service. The maids were always helpful when I raided their carts in the morning for more coffee packets. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any beefs with customer service. Upon check-in, the receptionist gave us the option to upgrade to a villa for an extra $20/night. Otherwise we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have the 10th floor ocean view. She gave us a key to go look at the villa and we decided against it; although it was right on the ocean, the old fort was the primary focal point and the balcony was tiny (no room to sit at all). Also, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s removed too far from the main resort/pool area. If a person wants more privacy from the rest of the resort, this would be a good option; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a separate pool and hot tub, and the garden area with the swans is really peaceful. We opted for the pool where we could belly up to the bar and drink. Speaking of drinks, yeah, this place isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap, but it also isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as some of the reviews made it sound. C\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mon people, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Hilton resort. Ordering a pitcher is the best deal: $39 versus $12 a pop. The menu says a pitcher will give you 5 drinks, but we consistently got at least 6 out of it. That averages out to chain-restaurant prices. The local draft beer Madalla is $6 so that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too horrible either. Besides, they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t picky about bringing your own drinks down to the beach; just be discrete about it. We stocked up at one of the gas stations up the road on the first day (a Shell station I think). We only patronized one on-site restaurant during our stay: the Pina Colada Club. Not impressive. We were just looking for a laid-back, simple way to fill our stomachs the first night we arrived, but very small portions for the price. With so many good restaurants in the area we ventured elsewhere for the rest of our trip (unless you count Starbucks\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6nice to have in the lobby). We rented a car for the entire stay, mainly because I got it dirt cheat through the airport Alamo ($84 total 4 days, incl tax). Even with hotel parking, which is $15.00/day plus tax (but they only charged me for 2 days\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask why), I figured I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get my money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth out of it. We drove to Old San Juan a couple times for dinner, and we would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve needed to rent a car for our Calebra excursion anyway so it worked out nicely. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in decent shape, the walk to Old San Juan is a certainly a doable jaunt. We walked it twice during our stay. We had no issues with safety, although our first impression of some areas between the hotel and Old San Juan (Puerta de Tierra) were sketchy. A local was telling us the government has been trying to push out the low rent stuff but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a slow process. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weird to see high-end condo towers scattered amongst trashy old buildings, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see.

One evening we had dinner at Lemongrass and the service and food were very good. The drinks at the hotel were well made and the bartender at Atlantico spontaneously offered my daughter a virgin pina colada with cherries which she loved and was so kindof him to do so. Staff was always respectful and courteous, at no point did I witness any harsh exchanges between staff and clientele. Puerto Rican people generally take pride in presenting in courteous and conservative fashion. Meal and drink costs are no higher at this resort than at any other U.S. or Caribbean resort, so you can't fault the hotel. You generally expect to pay while on vacation, economically there is no better deal than an all-inclusive resort and these are virtually non-existent in Puerto Rico. Also, of critical importance YOU MUST RENT A CAR in Puerto Rico. If you don't, it's difficult to get around and, more importantly, you are missing the opportunity to explore new horizons and meet new people on the island. Consider this when making your travel plans. I wish I could have rated five stars during this stay but refrained from doing so because of all the remodeling going on i.e. tropical gardens, italian restaurant, but am certain that if I were to stay here again it would be five stars hands down.

I would have left sooner but I had a hard time finding availability at other hotels. The check in process at the villas was painful. When I entered I was the only guest there to check in however the gal on staff was too busy talking on the phone to say hello or acknowledge I was there. Finally after 15 minutes she started the check in process. After getting my key I headed to my room and found I was not given the room type I had booked. I booked a room with a kitchen however I was given a regular room. When I went back to inquire at the desk I was told they were over booked and I'd have to try again in the morning. No apologies just a very persistent unwillingness to help. The following morning I woke up to find that my room door had been shoved open and the only thing preventing whomever from entering was the metal bar at the top. When I asked about a new room in the morning and explained what happened I didn't receive an explanation or an apology... in fact my safety issue was not even addressed. The gentleman in the morning said he would check for me during the day to find a room and leave a message for me since I had to work. Upon return to my room that evening I found my room had been left unlocked by house cleaning. I just had to shove the door and it opened. No message from the gentleman who said he'd help me and when I went back down to the desk to complain about my room and explain what happened the previous night I received no apology or concern. Very disheartening. After a third day and return to find my room unlocked I finally was moved to another room but not after going to the same women as check in at the desk who I had pleaded my case to before. You would think after day three going to the same people, having the same continuous issue they would remember you (especially since you are an extended stay customer). Every time I went to the desk I was given the same I don't really want to help you attitude. I never did receive an apology or acknowledgement about my security issues, I was asked finally asked if I needed someone to come with me to verify my belongings were still there. The staff at the front desk made me feel like I was an annoyance and not of value. They even sent a bellhop to the wrong room to help me move my bags. I do have to say the new room was better. They area they say is a kitchen is not a kitchen, nor does it come equipped with anything. I've stayed at plenty of hotels who boast a kitchen and at least they had a cup or a plate. This was a sink with a microwave and a mini fridge. No utensils, dishes, or cleaning supplies. I had a few more bumps along the way on my 22 night stay. A fire in the main part of the hotel. It was on the local news and luckily it was contained and no one was hurt. There was never any notification to the guests at the hotel about the incident. I thought for sure there would be a note letting the guests know everything was safe but nothing. There was a day of rancid sewer smell as it was being pumped and spilled over into the street and pathways where people had to walk from the parking garage to the villas. The grounds are beautiful and the pool area is nice but that was not enough to keep me there. I have now relocated to another nearby hotel and I am so glad I did.

I was concerned based upon the other reviews but as soon as the taxi dropped us off at the hotel, I knew we picked the right place. Check-in took 5 minutes, we stayed in the towers with two connecting ocean view rooms, which were really nice and clean. The beds were very very comfortable and the bathrooms were clean, large and the walk in shower was great! We did eat at the restaurants in the hotel, the pina colada is at the bottom of the towers and has a less expensive breakfast option on weekends which was nice. We also ate at palmeras for breakfast because our two kids ate free with accompanying adults. The location was excellent, however we are used to walking long distances so I wouldnt recommend it to everyone. We walked several times back and forth to Old San Juan, even at night and didnt have any problems. To get to Old San Juan it took about 30 minute and is a straight walk to and from the hotel. We also walked to condado and it is a much easier 10-15 minute walk depending where you are eating. To get there we just went to the back of the hotel to the lagoon villas and there is a red brick walkway going towards a condo next door and we just followed it to the main street, made a left and turned left onto the bridge and we were there. Dont be scared to walk around, there are many joggers, bicyclists and people around, even at night. The beach is small, but it was big enough to be enjoyable and swim around. We loved the fish swimming around and it was clear and clean. The pools are nice and were not crowded at all when we were there. There were plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas all throughout the day. Housekeeping did a good job and made sure it was cleaned every day. The front desk staff was efficient, nice and answered our questions without a problem. Getting a taxi takes about 2 seconds, they are lined up at the front entrance so you just tell a staff member and they will signal one and off you go.

We had a wonderful time. We originally booked an ocean view room in the Hilton Tower. Upon checkin we upgraded (for an additional $15 per night) to a villa overlooking San Geronimo fort and the Condado lagoon, we were very happy with our upgrade. The bed was extremely comfortable and our room was cleaned each and every day. The staff always greeted us with a smile. The beach is the only private beach on the island and is protected all around by rock barriers. The water is crystal clear and very, VERY, warm! :) The pool area was beautiful! Plenty of space for us to hang out in! We could swear we had the place to ourselves as there were not too many guests when we stayed. The pool is a 3 tiered infinity pool. The most popular is the top tier which is located right at the bar. Upon check out, there is a hotel tax fee. I read one review on here where the person was upset with the charge... it's 3 dollars a day total!!!!!!!! The Caribe HIlton is not for penny pinchers. For those guests who've stayed at the Hilton and complained about how expensive the food is... Why did you stay here? The menus are posted online. We did our research and saved our money to have wonderful meals as we don't eat McDonald's or SUBWAY! We had the luxury of eating in all of the restaurants in the hotel. Each experience was better than the last. We had the buffet breakfast every morning. Their oatmeal is delicious. We also had egg white omelets made to order. We ate at Morton's steakhouse which was expensive, but worth every penny. We had dinner there for our anniversary and they put our names on the menu! :) They treated us to dessert as well! We had lunch in the Pineapple Club a few times! Delicious food! Their PinaColada tres leches cake is to die for! We had lunch at the Atlantico Pool once. It was really good. We had dinner at the italian restaurant as well. Our experience at the restaurants was fabulous! We took a cab into Old San Juan for 12 dollars each way. We walked to the lobby and concierge got us a cab in one second! We had lunch at Raices restaurant. The food was fabulous. We walked around the old cobblestone streets and were enchanted. (There are a few beggars here and there) If you like to walk, you can walk from the Hilton to Old San Juan, I figure it's about 40 minutes or so. I would not walk at night. We also walked accross the lagoon's bridge to the Conrad Condado Plaza hotel one night. Lots of joggers on the bridge! We had dinner at Varita. It was ok. We basically relaxed on the beautiful private beach! We were the only ones in the water at one point. They have plenty of chairs and umbrellas. You have to sign out the beach towels and umbrellas. They set up the umbrella where you want it. Simply return them and you will not get charged a fee. We had no problem with this. Just an FYI, they are constructing and remodeling. All to better the hotel. When we checked out... we realized we'd be back! We loved the people, the hotel, the private beach, the forts, the food, EVERYTHING.

The rooms had very comfortable beds with flat screen tv's. I especially liked the bathroom, which was marble with oversized glass showers and double sinks. The hotel grounds were beautiful, and perfect for relaxing. I did not find any part of the hotel that was in \"ruins\" nor was it \"old and decaying\". Atleast that wasn't my definition of it. The hotel did have a 1950's atmosphere when you walked into the open air lobby, but I thought it gave it a nostalgic character, not an indication for a renewal. Yes, everything at the hotel was very expensive which seems like the prominent concern amongst all of the reviewers here. But all resorts have expensive restaurants and drinks. There are plenty of frugal options. For one, we always took a bus rather than a taxi to Old San Juan. The bus stop is just blocks away from the hotel, and runs until midnight. The Starbucks onsite has reasonable breakfast sandwhiches, and the Subway across the street makes great for lunch. Also, don't forget that you can order food to your room from anything from Dominos to Chinese food. The only thing is that you have to eat it in your room rather than the hotel grounds. Ask the concierge for the phone numbers of fast food delivery restaurants. In addition, the Morton's Steakhouse onsite has a happy hour most days of the week. My only complaint was that the beach in the resort is not a natural beach, it is a man-made beach blockaded by wavebreakers. It is quite small, and sufficient for swimming and relaxing. But I definitely suggest you take a day trip to one of San Juan's \"real\" beaches. Overall, from the parrots to the peacocks, this was a lovely hotel that was well worth what we paid.

However, all the times we tried to go to the pool (early in the morning, late at night, right in the middle of the day) it was so full that we no longer found it enjoyable. It was hard to find a little space to swim or stay still without being really close to ther people or children jumping and splashing everywhere. Maybe because of this overcrowding, I felt like the staff treated you like you were one of a pack and not like an individual. When we calmly strolled into the pool area, a guy harshly demanded that we show him our key to prove we were guests. Maybe we so many guests it's hard for him to address everyone in a gentle tone? Also, I feel the towel policies are ridiculous. There are signs everywhere threatening to charge you $25 if you fail to return it to the pool area. Again, it seems like the type of blancket threats one would use on children or a huge crowd to get them to comply. What happened to a relaxing vacation?

Food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The restaurants in OSJ are all pretty much priced the same - $20-25 for an entr\u00c3\u00a9e. Lunch is about $10-15. I recommend Dragonfly (Japanese) and Sofia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (Italian). Puerto Rican food in general consists of pork, rice, beans, plantains, etc. It was OK, but not exactly the healthiest option. We discovered that there is a Subway right next door to the hotel! We definitely saved some money eating breakfast ($5-6) and occasionally lunch ($6-7) there. Keep in mind the taxi fair if you do travel to OSJ to eat, because that adds to the cost of your meal. We did eat once at the hotel at the Italian restaurant. It was $25 for each meal, and consisted of nothing but a portion of pasta. I would not recommend eating here, even if it is convenient. The food quality was average. Drinks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Drinks at the hotel are not cheap! $7 for a beer, $10 for a mixed drink or pina colada. They are good, of course, but pretty pricey. We chose to drink while at restaurants or buy our own alcohol at the convenient store next door. Touring \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The El Morro and San Cristobal tours together are $5. You can spend an entire morning+ at these sites. Very historical and interesting. Keep in mind it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot! Bring a big bottle of water. We went on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excursion to El Yunque and loved it! We did the option with the La Mina Falls hike. It requires a lot of walking/hiking, but definitely a neat experience, and you get to swim in the falls in some pretty chilly water! El Yunque is beautiful. Overall we did a lot of walking, got a good tan, and had a great trip. Everyone at the hotel was very nice, the beds were extremely comfy, the beach was clear.

They absolutely loved the property....but it is still a slightly mixed bag, to be honest. My room was in the older tower. Not a bad room at all, but not the greatest Hilton room I've ever been in. View was great. Room was clean. Nothing was missing. I was pleased. The only problem we encountered in the entire stay was one of the two guest elevators was broken. Hotel staff was quick to put up signs directing us just around the corner to the service elevators. Not a major problem in the scheme of things. My family all had rooms in the newer tower.

I recently stayed at the Caribe Hilton for a business conference and was very disappointed in the quality of accomodations, service, and amenities. When you reserve your room, you should note that there is a 14% resort fee, but we were also charged a portage fee of $10.00 and a room cleaning fee of $6.00 both of which I found to be unacceptable. To make matters worse, the level of service we received (or lack there of) by no means justified the excessive fees. In my opinion if you are going to charge these additional fees, you better be delivering exceptional service. Additionally, we had to pay $15.00 a day for parking and everyday it was a battle to get our car out of the garage as the attendants were rude and incompetent. Also, the hotel is an older property and it showed. Mold and mildew were rampant, there were stains all over the carpet, and a 3 inch hole in the tile that went all the way down to the cement subfloor in the bathroom. We had to request for maintenance 3 out of the 6 days we were there. Our air conditioner was not properly working and leaked water all over the carpet. We had to walk on wet carpet as there was no offer to move us to another room. When they finally fixed the leak, no attempts were made to dry out the carpet. The finally dried naturally by day four. We also had to request maintenance fix our sliding door to our balcony as it would not open and no telling when the last time those windows had been cleaned. You should also be prepared to find alternative dining solutions unless you enjoy paying $26 for breakfast. We were fortunate to find a great place for breakfast in Old San Juan where they were friendly and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, the hotel has no reasonably priced dining options. We saw a lot of people bringing in sandwiches from the Subway down the street.

My wife and I attended a conference at this hotel last week and took our youngest daughter and our granddaughter along to combine business with pleasure. We rented a Garden Suite and although we had a few minor issues, for the most part were very pleased with our stay. I think in fairness, that prospective guests have to view this place for what it is and recognize that there will be inconsistencies and that you get what you pay for. First, it is a 61 year old property as others have pointed out. And, it shows its age in a few places. Our room was fine----a bit dated and retro, but well appointed, spacious and clean. We did hear from some our colleagues at the conference, who rented at the conference rate, that some rooms really needed work. However, the rate that they were paying was far below the standard rate and the place appeared to be rather full. I would guess that either plans for renovations are in the works, or that ownership is milking the property. If the latter is true, they will most certainly loose the Hilton flag and diminish the value of the real estate. Second, it is classified as a 4 star resort, so expect to pay higher than average food and beverage rates. We stopped over in South Florida at the Breakers, for a few days before the conference, and paid about the same. Third, the property has over 650 rooms, and probably a billion employees, so there will be minor service glitches. Finally, from what I could tell, the rates are below those of the competition for standard and superior rooms, and if you were to stay at competing properties, you would still pay comparable food and beverage rates. I guess there is an issue with the only choice being the $26 breakfast buffet and the perceived lack of nearby low cost alternatives for dining. However, we were able to use both the hotel facilities and find lower cost alternatives for minor meals and snacks. One that comes to mind is El Hamburger which is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. El Hamburger serves cheeseburgers with a variety of different toppings and the burgers are hand formed and delicious. A cheeseburger, fries and soft drink will set you back about $6. There is also a Subway and a convenience store located right around the corner from the hotel. Some of our colleagues also said that there was a low cost breakfast place near the hotel as well. We do not eat breakfast so this was not a problem for us. Now, for ours stay. We only had two minor service glitches. One occurred the first two nights of our stay when, it appeared as if the room service department was overwhelmed and it took an hour or more to get room service. However, in fairness, this was explained to us at the time our order was taken. The other problem occurred when I tried to get more than two glasses in our room. I called housekeeping and was told that this room was only supposed to have two glasses. I tried to explain that we there were four people staying in the room and that we were expecting guests. I got nowhere for a few minutes until I said that I really did not care about what was specified for the room and to get at least 6 more glasses up here ASAP. They arrived within 10 minutes. Other than that service was fine and the staff was friendly---especially the folks who worked at the pool beach complex. The staff soon learn what you like to eat and drink and are quick to recognize you and offer you your favorites. In fact we had one server who volunteered to look after our children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs when we were at meetings and he did a a great job without taking advantage of the situation. Also, the pool/beach complex is magnificent. There is a swim up bar, waterfalls and infinity edges. This breaks down into several pools and is quite attractive. The beach may not be to everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liking because it lacks surf but it is protected from heavy surf, private, and the waters are clear. I heard of numerous other beaches and the next time I come, we will rent a car and check those out, as well. There is also a beautiful garden area with Swans, a Koi pond, roaming Peacocks and lush foliage. On balance it was a good experience and the pricing was as expected.

The weather was hot & humid & the open air areas of the hotel were sometimes too hot & muggy to bear. We felt the need to seek out air conditioning much of the time we were here. The hotel lacks reasonably priced dining venues within walking distance.

Hotel is 61 years old and still looks it in certain parts. Very awesome beach and wonderful pools. But it really ends there. Service rendered by employees was often very poor. My party of eight waited 50 minutes seated at a table for service in the lobby bar at 9pm at night after a group function. We went to the bar 3 TIMES requesting a server be sent over. Alwyas told one would be sent, never was, until one person went to the lobby to complain. The server then made excuses how it was not her fault and the lobby bar was staffed short.Yet, the bar was not that busy and it was a Wednesday night. The hotel knew we had a big group function that would end at that hours and should have staffed appropriately. So many people at this conference requested room changes because of \"old and tired\" guestrooms. See photo of rusting door hinge. I changed rooms once. Some changed 3-4 times. The front desk clerk that checked me in barely spoke wth me. Seemed not interested in creating that \"welcome magical memory\". Had problems at the pool snack bar area and several times in the lobby lounge attempting to get service. Not that they were busy, employees just displayed a \"I don't give a damn\" attitude. It was apparent in their facial expressions, body language, and interactions.If you wanted something, you basically had to get upset to get action at this hotel.Desk in guestroom had tiny ants crawling over it for two days. Bathroom had hair stuck to the ceiling and it was never removed during the stay. Found a few stray hairs in the bed linens (not mine). Scuffs and gouges on the hall and guestroom walls. One of two guest elevators didn't work for two days in the main building. Housekeeping staff never vacuums the guestroom floor hallways. I saw the same lint, trash, and even gum on the carpet outside my guestroom for 6 days (see photo). Staff did vacuum the guestroom though during the stay, so their vacuum DOES work. Stained furniture in guestroom (see photo). Hotel charges mandatory resort fee of $23.66 for beach use, towels, newspaper and .50 housekeeper gratuity. Never saw a newspaper during entire stay despite being Hilton Honors prestige level member (I will not mention which level I have attained; but I stay about 20 nights a year at Hilton brands, and about 75 nights a year in various hotels.). Eric the concierge was very helpful and should be recognized. Buffet breakfast for 2 costs about $63.00.

After reading multiple reviews on tripadvisor, I decided to dismiss the less-than-flattering reviews & search for the helpful positives as a guide. Perhaps your travel-research style is similar to my own and maybe you're also someone who likes to frugally explore new places. If so, my honest review may be of use. What we enjoyed most about the Caribe Hilton was the lounge area by the beach. Unfortunately, the storm fronts limited our access to this area. What's not so great? The costly on-site dining options, our room phone not being able to answer incoming wake-up calls, needing to call for assistance three times before having a staff member come to our room to correct a non-working toilet, broken lights within our room, water-damaged/moldy bathroom floor boards, & a concierge that seemed only slightly knowledgeable about how to enjoy the less expensive parts of Puerto Rico and annoyed when asked a series of questions. The hotel's proximity to dining options and stores is limited. OSJ is over a mile from the hotel, but is accessible via a direct walking path from the hotel. This is a plus if paying $16 for one-way taxi access isn't something in your travel budget. Unsure this is something you can handle? Being five months pregnant, it was a minimal expense of energy--you can do it! A word of caution: the path can encounter some sketchy areas. OSJ is a tourist mecca, so expect high prices on some menus. A lunch recommendation would be Cafe Manolin. It's inexpensive & it features local, homemade food. We found an older artist near the Radio Shack & happily encourage you to visit him & view his artwork. For $300, we bought two original paintings--one framed--& had the larger one shipped to us in Upstate New York. I can provide a name at your request. Venturing to other parts of Condado also comes with a price. It has a trendy appeal, but the restaurants are not cheap. Furthermore, if you're from an area that does not require parking meters to be filled after 6 pm, this does not apply to the streets of Puerto Rico--my $35 parking ticket is proof. We rented a car for $70 and drove to El Yunque which I'd recommend. Allied Car Rental is adjacent to the hotel. Overall, my husband & I will most likely look to travel to future destinations--not including Puerto Rico. Sadly, it's coastline is a littered mess (you'll see this as you walk toward OSJ) & the resorts along the San Juan coast unfairly portray the status of Puerto Rico--true socioeconomic disparity.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDecent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ubish", "ReviewID": "UR71836604", "Content": "Stayed at the Caribe Hilton before and after our cruise.

Everyone could hear the pastor during the ceremony and the sound was perfect for the reception. The entire banquet staff that serviced our wedding was attentive and very personable.

I have to do a special thank you to Hiram the bartender at the Atlantico grill for his attentiveness to our guests. Everyone could not say enough great things about him. He was so thoughtful and brought the wedding party beer before the ceremony and gave my husband and me a glass of champagne for the reception. He has left a lasting memory with us and our friends.

But this case is different. I started NOT to book this hotel based on several negative reviews which highlighted expense, specifically of the hotel restaurants, shops etc. What a mistake that would have been. You can do just fine at this beautifully wonderful hotel if you are willing to venture off the grounds. Our goal was not to visit a Hilton, it was to visit Puerto Rico, and trust me coming back to this hotel after a day out and about is wonderful. Here are some ideas that worked well for us in sticking to our vacation budget. 1) take the public bus to Old san Juan. It costs 0.75 per trip and get you there in 10 minutes. The bus stop is right down the block from the hotel. Old San Juan is the last stop on the route so there is no confusion, and coming back just tell the driver you are staying at the Caribe and he will announce your stop coming back. A cab back and forth costs $24. We hit Old san Juan 4 out of 5 days. 2) While in Old San Juan - EAT. There are tons of authentic PR restaurants most of which are reasonable. We fell in love with Mojitos Restaurant (please google for reviews). We ate there 3 times and never paid more than $65 (for 2). Other suggestions are Raices and Tio Danny's. 3) Also in Old San Juan there is a supermarket and Walgreen's, stock up your room with snacks etc. - especially if you have children with you. 4) Rent a car for at least 1 day. As an alternative to paying $100 for the rainforest tour we rented a car for 39.99 and drove to the El Yunque rainforest. The information center at El Yunque gives you all the info you need to find the trails and attractions at your own pace, and it only costs $4. 5) While you still have the car, drive to the Isla Verde hotel strip (10 minutes from the Caribe) where there are all types of food options (fast food and small inexpensive restaurants), as well as casino options at other hotels such as the Intercontinental. The Isla Verde strip is a nice place to visit for a while, but the Caribe is definitely the much better place to stay. Hopefully this is useful to someone.

It came with a balcony off of both the master bedroom and adjoining living room. The oversize tub was my son's favorite place. We didn't expect 2 bathrooms but were pleasantly surprised. My son loved having his own space and it was nice not to compete over shower time. The couch folded out to a full size bed which suited his sleeping needs just fine! As for the beach - we rented a beach cabana 3 of the 6 days and thought the space was really nice to leave our stuff plus it came with cold water and a beautiful, delicious fruit plate. We did have to remind the staff 2 of the days about the fruit plate and 1 day it never arrived, though management gave us a prompt credit. If I were to do it again, I would rent the cabana only 1 day. It was a great place for taking a nap on the beach, but my son wanted to spend most of his time in one of the 3 pools. I did not feel comfortable enough to leave our personal belongings behind jumping from the beach to the pool. The swim up bar at the pool was a lot of fun for all of us. Hiram made some great drinks for us but with all comments, I too agree - PRICEY. I did find out ON THE LAST DAY, that you can buy a pitcher of any drink for $39. The pitcher equals 9 drinks vs. each drink for $12 AND they will keep the pitcher in the freezer for you and pour as you need a refill. Even if you don't finish it, you will still be way ahead.

We took a cab from the airport (2 adults, 2 suitcases, 1 carry-on). The cab stand attendant asked us where we were staying. The prices are pre-set based on location. It was $19 and $1 per bag plus tip. The hotel sits alone on the beach away from town so the only way to get anywhere you must take a cab or the bus. I understand it to be only $1 or so round trip by bus. We didn't leave the property as there was plenty to see and do. The lobby is open-air to the front of the hotel. We didn't wait very long at all considering the number of other cruisers that were staying there along with several wedding guests. I booked the hotel over the phone then opened my reservation online and opted to upgrade to a suite if it was available for $35 more. I am a Hilton Honors member so the buffet breakfast was included. I have never seen a buffet breakfast where they will slice proschutto for you. It was the best! Our room was on the 10th floor facing northwest. We could see the old fort in San Juan in the distance and the cruise ship in the harbor. Straight out from our balcony was the three-level pool (with swim-up bar), the lawn area with beach beds and hammocks, and the beach beyond. There were several restaurants and snack bars to choose from - sandwiches and beach drinks at Atlantico Pool Bar, all the way to the Morton's The Steakhouse. Or you can walk across the street to Subway. You won't go hungry. There was a small fort just to the east of the hotel that was a great photo opp. The hotel is one of the oldest in San Juan so it does show its age in some areas but that just adds to the character of it. I don't let a spot on the carpet or a cracked tile in the bathroom affect my impression of a hotel. If that were the case, I'd spend $500 for less than 24 hours somewhere else. The bed was comfortable, the room was spotless, and the view was beautiful. Too much to describe.

Although San Juan may be in an economic slump, like much of the world, it does have a very European charm (Old San Juan), sans the overload of cheap T-shirt/jewelry shops. Many people seem to complain about the cost of dinners, cabs, etc. My wife and I took the bus each day to Old San Juan for $0.75 each. The ride was straightforward and easy. The other local riders were friendly and openly willing to assist when my wife and I must have look puzzled. Supplies were purchased at the local convenience store across the street, as other guests have mentioned (bottled water in the room should be available like many other Hilton properties) . Ways to save money are definitely available, if you look, which you will always have to do when staying at a beach resort. They are not in business to save you money. Meals were at restaurants serving local or Caribbean food recommended by the concierge (Cafe Puerto Rico [Pork Mofongo, black bean soup] and Ropa Vieja Grill [skirt steak, black beans and rice]), for reasonable prices and excellent food. No meal cost over $100 with drinks, except the last one at the hotel. Drinks at the hotel are priced like any other Hilton I have been too (not cheap but expected). Beach and poolside service is available, but if you position yourself away from the crowds you may have to hunt down a server. One comment I must make is the friendliness and knowledge of the concierge staff. In our four day stay, we visited the concierge several time for ideas or recommendations. Each time we where extremely impressed by their knowledge of the area and their ability to provide us with exactly we were looking for. Dominic helped us several times and really stood out but the others were extremely helpful also.

The other amenities are great, but you're going to be paying three to ten times regular price for anything. The resort fee covers a paltry few towels and chairs, but be careful, as the towels have to be returned hours before the pool closes, or whoops $20 charge. And the attendants will tell you different times. And be sure to check your bill carefully at the end. We had a wrong charge and when I challenged it, the receipt wasn't to be found. I'd have been a lot more willing to do them the favor of letting something like that slide if they would have reciprocated. It didn't ruin or vacation or anything, but it was really obnoxious. We witnessed another guest snap at an attendant for similar reasons, saying that he'd been coming there for 20 years, but he'd had the last straw with their increasing charges for everything. So I guess it wasn't always this way. The rest of the facilities are great, the beach is nice with lots of fish to see snorkeling in the cove, the pools are nice, the jacuzzi's hot, the view is terrific.

We paid $146.00 so overall not bad considering the options. The pool and beach are absoutely spectacular. Similiar to a Sandals resort the big downer is that it's not a resort and everything is Ala carte and very expensize. $14.00 for a Hamburger lunch $9.00 a budweiser. There's a small store next to the Hotel but they know what you pay at the Hotel thus there their prices are trumped up as well.

The hotel is laid out in a choppy manner. The pool and the beach are nice. Surprisingly, the Pina Colada was undrinkable at the poolside! What is this reputation of the origin of the Pinia Colada here and the fact that you will be served from a prepared mix? Many complain. Delicious at the Pina Colada Club, in the lobby area of the property. $8 and $9 cost. ASK FOR IT TO BE MADE W/COCO LOPEZ AND FRESH or they will serve you the prepared mix that sits in a machine, like a frozen frape. Buffet bkfst is a disappointent. The buffet is lacking anything special or tasty. Eveyday is the same. Only omlettes are made in front of you as you stand and wait to order. The french toast and pancakes sit in a pan under heat lamps. Dry and tasteless. The waiter service is nill. Ask for coffee or tea and wait until after the meal. You'll get it then. I sent back two stained cups and one very chipped one. My tea came long after I finished eating. We forfeited the free bkfst and ate in Old San Juan bakery with the locals. Greasy fried stuff, not like our foods here. The recommended restaurants on this site are the same recommended by the concierge. Not one restaurant was satisfactory to everyone in our party. Only the black bean soup and rice and beans were tasty. All main dishes are in the mid 20 price range. Desserts $7 or $8. After your third night of rice and beans and flan, you can leave now! We were convinced that there really is no good retaurant worth the cost of the meal. Now for the reason for the title of this review. Ashford Ave, Condado, in San Juan is a suffering from the evidence of a very depressed economy with stores closed and graffiti on some of the bldgs. The hotels are worn and the streets in disrepair. I felt like I was in a country deep in poverty. There is no pleaseure in walking upon broken streets in humidity, looking at abandoned bldgs and some undergoing a facelift of construction. As for Old San Juan, the cobblestone narrow and hilly roads are quaint and remid me of what you see in Europe. Most of the stores are rip off jewelry stores, so many trinket sovuneer shops, and some restuarants. We ate in many that were recommended here. The Parrot Club served two under cooked salmons that tasted like the most oily fishy taste I have experiencd. $9 for the small tossed green salad and add'l $7 for the unedible fish we both sent back. The spoon had a dried piece of food on it. Server was nice. We do not recommend. The menu was lacking anything imaginitive. Cafe Puerto Rico was liked by my husband and O.K. with three others. Small and stuffy, only a few tables on each level. The cabbie told us it was his favorite place. Ropa Villa in Condado (Ashford Ave) had a live, too loud entertainer, hard to make conversation in this small restaurant with a man playing an instrument and singing. If sang more quietly, to create a sense of ombience, it would have been a nice idea. I had a fish that had a cilantro sauce that was very tasty. Food was served warm, not hot and fish was spongy and hard in the middle. Waitress was lovely and bread was good. Ceasar salad was a nice size and had the shavings, but the dressing was much too thick and made it difficult to enjoy. One dinner sent back because it was not warm enough to eat. Not worth the $$$$. Our first night we ate at Raices. Cold hard to chew steak sent back by two people. I only ate an appetizer of cod fritters. They were brought before all the other appetizers and placed in the center of the table, so we all ate it, thinking it was complimentry, like bread. Weird. So I had to order another one just for me to eat. When we asked why it was served right after the drinks were served and not with the other appetizers, the english speaking waitress could only laugh. She suddenly did not understand. That was our first awareness that many here pretend to understand and really do not and some choose not to when it meets their needs. There is really no attraction to come here. IF you plan to, then stay at a resort that offers it all. The staff here are friendly for the most part. Housekeeping is a mess. All calls take an hour to respond to and you will get less than what you ask for, the wrong request, etc. The operator is a total idiot who connects you to the wrong extensions. It takes forever for her and the housekeeping dep't to answer. We had water leak issues with our rooms and were moved twice. Construction begins at 6m and then so does your day! Low flying plans begin at 6:30am and are right next to the hotel. The pkg garage is heard from the room as well. If you plan to stay here and get rest, ...no, you will have little sleep. I did not see any kyacking, tennis or snorkeling that is advertised on their site. I did see a few men in shallow water wearing snorkel gear. We were told there is no snorkeling. 17 miles of beach? No way. A small, but nice area adjacent to a small public beach. From the pool area, you verlook jutting rocks and the ocean. There is no 17 miles of walking or usable beach here. That is an outrageous misrepresentation that may mislead you to thinnking it's a sizable place beach. No beach service. At the pool, I never saw a waitress in the week we were there. This site is has false and misleading attraction info that are just not true. P.R. is in a slump and that's reality. The food is over priced crap, and the cabbies try to charge more than the rate.

The bathroom had two sinks, two shower head options and lots of towels and shampoo, conditioner and soap. There is a Starbucks in the lobby. There is a Subway around the corner walking distance. There is also a small variety store that sells beer and snacks across the street. The staff was very professional and courteous to us at all times. The pool and beach areas are immaculate and the views stunning. There are many chair options to choose from. Towels must be returned by 6 pm or you will be charged. You can get free internet access in most parts of the lobby - if you use it in your room you will be charged. Old San Juan is a $13 taxi drive from the hotel. We took the \"Flavors of San Juan\" food and culture tour I found on Tripadvisor our first day - it was the best! We learned lots about the city and where to eat and drink for the rest of our stay. There is no way we could have walked from the hotel to Old San Juan - it's really far! We had a wonderful stay here and I would totally recommend this Hotel! Oh ya...we also survived the earthquake that woke us up at 1:22am! Room rate was $125 plus all the taxes per night. (corporate rate) * Now for the review of the Olas Spa which is part of the the Carible Hilton. I booked a massage, facial, pedicure and lunch. The massage by Henry was magnificent...the pedicure was nothing special...in fact they served me my lunch while I was getting my pedicure which I thought very strange. The facial was a total rip off...Gladys a very pushy Puerto Rican talked me into a more expensive treatment for my face saying it would even out my tone...I agreed. The facial was very unprofessional, cold, sloppy and not soothing at all. Gladys basically slapped on some creams and left me laying in a cold room for 20 minutes. When she returned she cleaned up my face with a cold cloth and showed me in a mirror how even my tone was. I was very happy at the time of the results...that is until I got to my room to shower - when I dried off my face the towel was covered in foundation!!! What a rip off! I just paid over $150 for a foundation facial treatment!!! I do not recommend this place for any kind of treatment!!! I would give this spa only one star if I could find a place to review it on it's own. Total cost of spa $340 including tax and tips.

I wanted to go for a swim after work, I walked down to the pool area and was greeted with a sign that said the pool closed at 9pm. I walked over to get a towel, had to sign one out (because they charge you $25 if you lose it). The attendant said the towel must be returned at 6pm. I had 30 minutes to enjoy the beach and get the towel back. I decided I didn't want to chance it. I asked the front desk about this policy and they said that I could just use a towel from my room. Seems they need a memo sent around about this. I was afraid I would be charged $25 over the 14% pool surcharge so I never did use the pool or beach area.

The main downside to booking this way is that we got a room at the back of the hotel which overlooked a roof. However, the roof was clean and attractively painted and we could still see the ocean. The room itself was spacious and comfortable; we chose a king-size bed that was extremely comfy. There is a refrigerator, 32\" TV, and hair dryer in the room, but no microwave. There is a safe which I'm pretty sure requires a fee to use. Internet in the rooms is 25/day but wifi in the lobby area is free. Parking is 16/day in the nearby lot. There was plenty of room in the lot and we were able to park right next to an elevator every time. Staff was moderately helpful and friendly. Unfortunately one of the concierges only seemed to be able to say \"In Old San Juan\" every time we asked him a question. He spoke perfect English but unfortunately seemed to give lazy answers; for example, when we asked about buying stamps he neglected to tell us that we could mail letters at the front desk for 60 cents; instead we visited both CVS and Walgreens to no avail before we discovered the hotel's postage service. Other staff was very friendly, and helpful, however. We really appreciated the hotel's flexible cleaning schedule. We could freely place the \"do not disturb\" on our door at any time, multiple times per day, and still be sure that our room would be magically made up if we left for an hour or more. Beach access is fantastic with a large, clean, and well-appointed beach area with free towel service. There are several expansive pools including a smaller pool and whirlpool at the rear of the hotel in a quiet, secluded area. There is a quiet tropical garden complete with swans, peacocks, and carp. The small San Geronimo fort is clearly visible nearby though at this time it is not open to the public. Shopping and eating amenities were plentiful but expensive, so we didn't take advantage of them. 12 buck cocktails served in small plastic cups or 6 buck local beer was the norm. However, there is a small package store and deli nearby which serves excellent breakfast and lunch, and there's a Subway within less than a block. Further, most stores in Old San Juan sell beer and hard liquor that can be brought back to the room fridge for a fraction of hotel bar and restaurant prices, and good restaurants abound within a short distance either in Old San Juan or across a short bridge in El Condado on Ashford Ave. Additionally, many bars and clubs are located nearby but we wary of taking a cab--we paid 15 bucks each way for a short ride. Renting a car to get around is definitely recommended, though parking can be hard to find. Old San Juan is within walking distance and a good free trolley service will take you around the city if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re tired from the walk in to town.

As far as PR main island goes this beach is about as good as it gets. I found no issues with the staff and all encountered were pleasant and curteous. In fact as a whole, the Puerto Rican people seem to hold friendliness and customer service to a much higher high standard than the rest of the Caribbean and the US for that matter. This hotel also has an excellent gym. Some say the restaurants are expensive, and they are, but no more expensive than any nice hotel restaurant and only a couple of bucks more an entree than Old San Juan. The best meal of the week was at the Lemongrass in this hotel. Some minor gripes were that the A/C seemed to cycle wrong so it would get a little warm in the room before kicking on and the hot water in the sink kind of trickled out (shower was OK) so this may have been a problem in this room only. The one thing that really bugged me about the hotel was the bar drinks. I watched the bartender make 3 frozen drinks and drop about 1 1/2 oz's of alcohol in the blender for all three. I mean, it's hard to justify charging $14 a drink as it is but it is a downright ripoff when you cannot even taste the slightest hint of rum in the drink. I could see why so many have posted bad reviews on this subject.

I was one of the few lucky ones that did get the room that i wanted.. beautiful room on the top floor with an ocean view..accomdations? great. guest services? non-existent. When I say \"guest services\", I will tell you that I am talking about everyone from the hotel operators, front desk clerks, managers, housekeeping, outside bartenders, one of the sales people, reservations, etc. the wedding planner and wedding planners assistant i will have to write on another review because they were not part of hilton staff but were completely utterly useless. Lets see, where do i begin, so much to say. this will not be in order but here goes: at check in, which is 4:00..late to begin with, a lot of guests' rooms were not ready. many of our guests were arriving on friday (wedding was saturday). some guests did not get into their rooms until 6:00pm. the groom, who instead of relaxing the day before his wedding, had to be in the lobby with the person who was in charge of the room bookings, directing her as each guest came. it turns out that a lot of the guest werent given the room they wanted/needed (king bed versus double beds or vice versa) so the groom spent a considerable amount of time directing and helping to coordinate the guest rooms with the sales manager (what a joke title). my sister in laws ceiling had a leak. one guest sat at the edge of her bed and the upper end went flying.., housekeeping NEVER came to clean our room.. i checked in Friday, saturday it was never cleaned. the morning of the wedding, my daughter was in the honeymoon suite and the ac was not working. temp was 90 outside with humidity high. it took over an hour for someone to come to the room and attempt to fix it. we called again after another hour goes by and room still hadnt cooled. they came back up rather annoyed and told us that because we were using a blow dryer (ONE BLOW DRYER) that must be the reason the air wasnt cooling. (WE WERE IN A 2 STORY SUITE, HOW CAN ONE BLOW DRYER HEAT UP A ROOM AND OUTDO AN AC) My daughter was trying to get ready for her wedding day for christ sake! another request to guest services went unanswered (2 calls within one hour) phone rang off the hook before someone finally answered. i simply asked for 10 champagne glasses to be brought up (the photographer wanted to take pic of bridal party pretending to drink champagne before heading off) the glasses NEVER came). housekeeping did not come to clean room later. they did not come AT ALL. the maid of honor (my 15 yr old and grooms sister snuck away during cocktail hour) to clean the honeymoon suite for them) after all, there were about 10 of us in there that sat morning getting ready. the atm machines in the hotel were not working. at check out time, my bill was totally wrong. we were supposed to get a discount for saturday nite because of the group rate for wedding at $165 per night. the bill said $185. i \"calmly\" argued with the front desk clerk (who never once looked me in the eye but instead kept his eyes on the computer screen the entire time i was talking to him - Joel was his name) he said, well, do you have the confirmation for that???? hellllllooooooooo we have a CONTRACT. no i dont have it, but the bride does...for gods sake. i told him, well, every single guest's bill is going to be wrong. so out comes Victor who also insisted that was the correct charge. (IT WASNT) but rather than \"calmly\" continuing to argue i just paid the bill at $185 for both nights. later, i was correct, yes, it was supposed to be $165 as my daughter told me.. its in her CONTRACT. do you think i will see my money? no....why, because i paid cash and they probably just pocketed the extra. when i mentioned that housekeeping never came there was no comment.. nothing, no apology or explanation.. just more looking at the screen.. he was probably playing a video game for all i know. also, i fyou want to sleep late, forget it, they want to kick you out of there as early as possible.. but check you in as late as possible.. and trust me, you will not get a discount if you get checked in late through no fault of your own. forget breakfast. at the hotel..everything is way overpriced,. go out the lobby, take a left and walk right across the way to Subway where you can get breakfast for $4.00 including coffee. you can take the bus to Old San Juan from the bus stop near the Normandie Hotel for .75 cents per person. the taxi in front of the hilton cost you $3.00 per person plus whatever else fee they want to charge.. the reality is, a taxi, even if there are like 5 or 6 of you travelling to Old San Juan, should cost $10 flat. Jose Gonzalez who runs a private taxi and is wonderful will take you his number is 787-909-2236. he picked us up in front of the hilton and he got royally yelled at by the staff. make sure he picks you up across the street! I can honestly say that guest services in this hotel do not exist at all, although i cant speak for the concierge as i did not use their service. as far as the actual SITE.. as in the reception area..was beautiful.. outside by the area to the left of the pool was spectacular and the food was delicious. the photographers and videogrpaher and musicians hired by my daughter and son in law were phenomenal (not referred by the Hilton) but researched on their own. as far as the scenic beauty and the privacy of the beach by the Caribe Hilton, it is truly amazing as is the tropical garden, however, if that is ALL you are looking for and you want to fend for yourself in every other way, then by all means stay, but if you want to get your moneys worth in terms of oh, say, having someone answer the guest service phone when you dial their number.. or... i dont know.. say, you ac in your room is not working and you're getting ready for an important day and your makeup is starting to smear down your face cuz its so hot, and you might want someone to fix it, yes, well, then i say, stay at the Marriott or any of the other just as highly priced but much better service at the Condado strip just a little ways down, the Hilton area is appealing..but what are you willing to give up to stay here?

And the elevator continued to break down. The staff is friendly but slow. It takes at least 45 mins to get anything. And everything is extremely overpriced. We paid $50 for a buffet style breakfast that was cold & awful. Drinks are $12 a pop and we paid $8 for a plain hotdog & $7 for 2 pieces of bread & a slice of cheese that was supposed to be a grilled cheese.

My Wife and I went down on vacation and were not sure what to expect from San Juan or Puerto Rico. We were pleasently surprised with the culture and experience. The Caribe Hilton was very nice and clean. They are in the middle of remodeling some of the rooms and painting the hallways. The hotel had a nice and clean beach area and a private lagoon. The snorkeling was not great...but they do feed the fish and there were some great ones to see. We came across a sea horse, a lion fish, and about 15 other species. The pool was nice and had a couple of whirlpools. Next to the pool area was a shaded area with nice hammocks to relax in. There were also many areas with outdoor beds. The fitness center was one of the best I have been to at a hotel. The pool bar was expensive but the service was good. At night Morton's has a reasonably priced \"power hour\" for cheaper drinks and food. Across the street is a small convience store where we bought most of our liquor, beer, water, snacks. For some great Puerto Rican food we walked to Escambron Beach and ate a small restaurant behind the stadium. It was more reasonably priced and the food was good. Don't be scared off if no one is in there....it was not a very crowded restaurant. It was good though. You can walk to Old San Juan from the hotel but it is about a 40 minute walk. I took a run there in the morning which was nice. Instead of taking cabs my Wife and I took the bus everywhere. Every bus driver was so helpful and so were the locals taking the bus. To get to old San Juan it was .50 instead of a $10 cab ride. We also took the bus to Isle Verde which was a nice public beach and to the Art Museum in San Juan. We only took a cab to and from the airport. Make sure to get out of San Juan though...the island has so much more to offer. We went on a trip to Toro Negro (the tallest forest on the island) with Acampa. These guys were amazing...and it was a great tour. We also rented a car from Allied Rental across the street....$53 a day and went to El Yunque, Seven Seas beach, and the kiosks at Luquillobeach. Our stay was great.

For example, the outside bar had the bartender go to the main resturant to get the food orders vs. having a someone else being as the runner. This caused 45 minutes in getting a drink at this bar. The main reason why my family elected this hotel was based on their advertisement as a family hotel with a kids program called Kitz Paradise and swimming activities. What we found was the Kids programs was lacking any structure. For example my two kids ages 5 and 7 had an art activity that was done in 10 minutes.

Now, for some downsides to the Caribe Hilton: If you are a couple with no children you may not enjoy this place so much as it is full of kids and teens. Check-in is usually a 20 minute wait in line, even if your Hilton Honors! The walls are thin, so you can hear everything.

The best part of the room though was the ocean front balcony and the view of the tropical gardens below! We had a great view of the ocean and the Fort behind the property. Pool/Beach Area: The beach area was great, but a little small. You definitely had to get over there earlier than later if you wanted a good spot. The main pool area got a little crowded too and was where the children would swim and played. My sister and I ended up finding a smaller pool area where we spent most of our time. It was very quiet and VERY SUNNY! I would definitely suggest walking around the property the first day you get there and scope out the different places where you can lay out and relax. There are a lot of secluded chairs if you just want time to yourself! Food: When it comes to the food, I definitely suggest when booking the room you see if they have any package deals that include breakfast. When we booked our room, thats what we did and go free breakfast every morning. We went to breakfast at the Palmeras Restaurant and it was great! They had just about everything you could think of, including an omlette chef! Another cheaper option for breakfast is just going to Starbucks. The prices at Starbuck are basically the same as they are in the States. For lunch we pretty much ate at the Atlantic Bar & Grill or grabbed a pre-made sandwhich from Starbucks. The Atlantic Bar & Grill is a little pricey, but nothing beats having your food delivered to you by the pool or while you're laying on the beach. We tried to go to Subway one day for lunch and it was horrible. The service was horrible and the food was disgusting. Dinner was our favorite part of the night ;-) One night we tried the Italian restaurant at the hotel and it was fantastic! Our waiter was very sweet and made us laugh. Pasta plates ranged from $20-$25 and the seafood/meat dishes were around $30-$40. I personally thought that everything was reasonaibly priced there. Another night we tried to go to the Pi\u00c3\u00b1a Colada Club because I wanted to trie the Mahi Mahi fish tacos, but they we're very rude and ended up just ordering drinks and going back to the Italian Restaurant.

The rooms are remodeled and the beds are very comfortable. Two issues: 1) the restaurant prices are very expensive given the average quality of the food ($22 for an individual pizza for a child). There is no snack bar for a quick bite to eat; the only option is a Subway a few blocks away. 2) The two ladies in the pool booth distributing towels and play equipment need major training in customer service. They were extremely rude to everyone, including children seeking inner tubes or toys. They were not busy, so there seemed to be no reason for the rudeness - many of the hotel guests we met commented on this attitude.

The Hilton could run a shuttle - but they want you to stay at the hotel and pay the very high prices for their mediocre food. To be expected I guess, but the Hilton took it a step further by having the concierge lie to us about restaurants in old san juan being open on good friday and easter. He said that \"not many restaurants would be open good friday, and just about everything would be closed on easter.\" He was very clear about this. We decided to brave it anyways on Good Friday and guess what - there were many restaurants open and we had no problem getting dinner. After that we decided to go there again for Easter and there was a traffic jam to get into old san juan it was so packed! Shops and every restaurant we passed was open and the streets were packed with people. He lied. The most disturbing part of our stay happened when the power went out in the hotel. We woke up about 7 am to the smell of chemicals and burning. An awful smell. My husband ran out into the hall where the smell was much worse and saw 2 staff members who told him the power went out and to go back to our room. It was clear that something other than a power outage was happening, so we decided to leave. We went down the fire escape from the 5th floor. The last 2 or 3 floors had no lights or power in the fire escape stairwell and the staff had put a few glow sticks on the stairs which barely lit the stairs at all. It was scary. When we got to the lobby - it was business as usual. No alarm, no announcement - nothing, we were shocked. We saw a small group of about 6 people crowed around a security officer and we went to join them and figure out what was happening. One women told us that her room had filled with smoke and she had set off the alarm on her floor and ran out. We also told the security guard our story and he just kept repeating that \"the power went out.\" Nothing happened for sometime and at least 30 minutes after we had come downstairs we finally saw other people coming downstairs. The staff was aware of smoke and chemical burning and allowed the guests to breathe it in for some time before they decided to tell them. My husband and others kept telling the security officer to evacuate the hotel, but he waited. This experience made me realize how much trust you put in a hotel that you stay in. You trust them to protect you and alert you to fires, toxic fumes etc. Unfortunately, this hotel will not do this. We never got a real explanation. We were told they evacuated the hotel as soon as they realized that there was a problem, but we know first hand that this is NOT true. Given that there were staff in the hallway when we woke up - they knew of the problem before we even woke up. One staff member told my husband that there was a power surge that caused some of the air conditioning to burn before the power went out. This seems like what the burning chemical smell could be and could explain what caused the smoke. The manager, however, told us with a good deal of attitude that it was sewage, not chemicals, that we were smelling on the 5th floor (it was not a sewage smell but he would not back down and told us that we were wrong - so I asked him about the smoke in the other guest's room and he said that \"sometimes air conditioners smoke when the power goes out\"...?). This was hopefully not a problem that happens often - however it shows this hotel's attitude towards safety and their guests. I would never stay somewhere like this again and will be much more cautious in choosing a hotel in the future.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201c2 nights pre-cruise, a fine place, met expectations\u201d", "Author": "JLind", "ReviewID": "UR60818130", "Content": "Thanks to TripAdvisor, our expectations were set in the right place- and so our stay was great. We booked through PL and the room was only $110/nt, and then a resort fee was added on top of that per night. When we checked in, I mentioned TripAdvisor negative reviews, and very politely asked that we please be placed in a room that is not shabby (\"please, no mold in the shower\"), a reasonable request, I think. The person who checked us in was lovely and placed us in the newer \"Garden\" building. The room was new and beautiful. We did not eat at the hotel, as we had read that it was resort-priced - we rented a car. For us, it was worth renting the car because we have driven in many cities and countries, and for the price of taking taxis we came out ahead financially having the car. It rained while we were there, so we did not hang out at the pool or beach. We enjoyed exploring Old San Juan, and spent a fun day at El Yunque rain forest. When we first arrived it was about 4:30pm and we ended up going to Morton's Steak house (onsite) and had one of the famous Pina Colada's there- it was 'happy hour' so drinks were reduced priced and only $6-7 and also enjoyed some $7 appetizers. Loved the drinks, service, food and the view. In the non-raining moments, we walked the grounds - and it is a beautiful property. (Still not an equal to the property at the Iberostar resort in Costa Maya Mexico, but fantastic for a hotel on outskirts of a city). So the bottom line is- Caribe Hilton was perfect for a 2 night pre-cruise stay, booked through Priceline. I do think that a hotel in Condado area would be my first choice, because there is so much there within walking distance. *Favorite restaurant was \"Rope Vieja\" in Condado!* I'm glad we rented a car. We didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel, but it was a beautiful place to have as home-base for a couple of days. If I was planning a longer leisure vacation where we truly stay at the hotel the whole time, I'd probably choose something different. But pre-cruise, knowing that we were heading for a week of Caribbean beaches, these days in San Juan were just what we wanted/ expected/ hoped for.

From the minute we got there until the minute we left, the entire staff was excellent and very attentive and helpful. As Hilton Gold Honor members we were given a room on the 9th floor of the main building. The view from the room was absolutely fantastic with a view of both the beach and the pool area. The room was neat and clean with an oversized flat screen TV. The bathroom was average size and quite acceptable. As with any resort, food and beverages on site are on the high side. We had lunch at the pool bar which was good, and with soft drinks it came to about $32 for the two of us including tip. There is a Starbucks in the lobby that is very reasonable but since we were on a mini vacation we treated ourselves. For the five days we were in San Juan we rented a car (Charlies Car Rental) which worked out great. Parking is $15 a day, however we opted for the valet service which was another $6 but well worth it. All of the valets were friendly and yes you had to tip them on top of the charge but then that is what you are paying for the service. The pool areas and beaches are clean and there was always plenty of available seating either on the beach or by the pool. As Hilton Gold Members the Continental breakfast is included however we opted to pay $11 more for the full buffet which regularly is $26. The buffet was excellent, however at full price, $52for two plus tip for breakfast is a bit much. As for the rooms, they were more than adequate. They were very quiet and the air conditioning worked just fine. They do not have the adjustable beds as do many of the Hilton Garden Inns but in spite of that it was fairly comfortable. By the way, sodas from the machine on the floor were only $1.50, a bargain considering the other prices. As previously mentioned we found all of the staff from the front desk to the housekeeping service to be extremely friendly and helpful. When dining or drinking outside by the pool, only credit or room charge is available which we thought was a good safe way to avoid having to carry cash with you when going to the pool or beach. By the way, for parrot fans, there is a cage in the lobby with three very pretty and friendly parrots. I found myself going to the lobby for the complimentary high speed WiFi and ending up feeding sunflower seeds to the parrots especially the white one. They just loved to take the seeds from your hand. All in all, our stay at the Caribe Hilton far exceeded our expectations, having read many of the negative reviews. We would come back here in a heartbeat given the opportunity. By the way if you do come down to Puerto Rico, and enjoy great jazz piano, you must definitely visit Carli's Cafe Concierto in Old San Juan at the bottom of the Banco Popular building.

However, once we stayed at the Caribe Hilton 4 years ago, we only want to stay there each time we go! The beach there is the most beautiful in San Juan! It has gotten better and better over the last few years due to the obvious presence of the general manager, Mr. Jose Campo and one of his top hotel staff, Mr. Nelson Torres. Both regularly walked the grounds to ensure that the guests were taken care of and to ensure that the staff were providing the best service possible. Every aspect of the stay was fabulous....from the excellent housekeeping services to the wonderful consierge service and the fantastic service staff at both the indoor and outdoor bar/grills. The food, both in room and outside was outstanding! Our favorite was having the Mahi Mahi at lunch. We stayed in the Laguna Villas and love the beautiful view of the ocean and the San Geronimo fort and the peaceful atmosphere provided there. We will be going back again before the end of the year. Our daughter, who is getting married in August, is planning on spending her honeymoon there! I'm sure it will be a wonderful time for her and her husband.

Short cab ride from the airport (20min/about $20), short cab ride to Old San Juan (10 min/$12-$14). Right on the water. The Beach: The main reason for our trip was to play in the sand and surf. The beach at the hotel was perfect for our 6 year old. It is in a crescent shape with breakers so the waves were not big. The sand was clean, the water was clear, and It was shallow for a distance. We did not have a problem finding beach chairs, and the staff were helpful putting up our umbrellas. The chairs, umbrellas, sand toys were complimentary. We did rent a life jacket for $5. Don't forget sunscreen and goggles for the kids. The Pool: There are 3/4 pools on property. The main pool is split by a bridge with a very shallow kids side and the main side. There's an infinity type pool up a level which spills over into the main pool. The last pool is a small area around the pool bar. Finally there are two small jacuzzi type spots near the infinity pool. None of the pools are very large but they serve their purpose. Most people laid around the pool, leaving the actual water to the kids. We went in late February and the pool was rather cold, so we spent more time in the ocean. The Room: Basic room. We paid for a balcony with an view but the balcony was teeny tiny and the view could be seen at a diagonal so we would not pay extra next time. Otherwise, a standard room, clean, with nice big tv. The Food: We liked the starbucks in the lobby. We had their sandwiches a few times - inexpensive comparatively, easy and good. The poolside grill was okay, small menu, nothing special. The breakfast buffet was very nice. It was included in our package, but we would not have paid for it if it wasn't. ($$) There was also a subway a very short walk away. They had fancier restaurants but they were not for us. The Staff: Very nice and friendly land helpful. Overall: We loved the hotel for the location and the beach.

We loved hiking in the Yunque Rainforest a couple days, visiting other beaches, touring the ruins, hanging out in Old San Juan. Overall the hotel was fine. The gardens were pretty, fitness center nice, didn't try the spa, beds were good, the beach was calm and clean. Because of the reef you couldn't experience swimming in the ocean waves. But this beach was great for kids if you bring them. I loved the beds by the beach and pool but needed to grab them early in the day. We usually sat in chairs/beds farther from the pool. We never had service come all 3 days we sat there. I asked if they provided pool service and they said yes and that the guys are out there somewhere. I never saw them. The room was small and needed updating but it was clean. Our view was a rooftop and a glimpse of the ocean. They had a small refrig. which was nice just to keep a few things for our next days hike. The conciege was helpful in choosing restaurants offsite. We did stay at the hotel one evening and ate at the Rotisserie II Giardino. It wasn't great food for what you paid for. There are lots of great places to eat in old san juan which is really close. When we checked out the hotel tried to bill us $150 for Mortons Steakhouse but never ate there! They looked up the bill and showed it to us. It wasn't our signature. We had to argue with the manager who wasn't apologetic at all but rather rude. They said to pay it and they would talk to Mortons when they opened for the day and refund it once they looked into it more. We wouldn't settle for that b/c most likely we would never get that refund. It was Mortons fault for not matching name (which was just a scribble for a signature) with room number when they signed for the bill that night, but that is to be disputed with Mortons and the hotel. We didn't pay and like I said, the manager was rude about the whole thing. When we check in they give us small slips with our room number on them to give to resaturants and gifts stores to add to our hotel bill. I'm not sure why Mortons didn't use this procedure. It took over 30 minutes to go through this hassel and we needed to get to the airport. So check your hotel bill carefully for details before you leave. That just ruined the end of our stay there.

We rented a car at the airport and drove to the hotel via the highway. You have to be careful if you drive because the Caribe Hilton entrance is tucked back from the road....easy to miss.

I \"upgraded\" to a Villa with a \"waterview\". I booked my room probably about 5 months before our trip. When I got up to our room, I found that we were able to view some lagoon water hitting rocks...otherwise the view looked out on construction, traffic, and buildings. I'm not one to usually complain, but I felt like I deserved better for a \"waterview\". I was told at the front desk that most rooms were taken. They switched us to a room where they said that we would be facing and have a direct view of the ocean! Well, the room was on the ground floor, there was a wall with big potted plants on the patio. If we stood on our tippy toes and looked between the pots...we could see the ocean. I would not spring for a Villa in the future. On the day we were leaving, I viewed a \"regular\" room. It appeared to me to be just as spacious. The only thing it didn't have that the villa did was a little wet bar area that had a microwave.

Old world ambience, the best staff, their own beach and the best tropical bar I had ever been to and I stayed there on and off for 2 years. 25 years later we decide to bring the family to PR and my first choice, of course.... is the Caribe Hilton. Fly into San Juan late at night, cab ride takes less than 15 minutes and is less than 20 dollars. It's 3 am in the morn but we are greeted warmly, we easily find our room and we sleep soundly wakening to yet another beautiful day in paradise. We stayed in the lagoon villas where they are a bit more spacious and a bit removed from the main core of the hotel, they have their own pool and hot tub and it was very nice. However, the AC blew only one speed and temperature and so we asked to move to a room so they could fix it. The staff was very accomodating and our second room on the 5th floor ended up w/ a much nicer view and an AC that worked. The Starbucks was the choice for morning fare 4 of the 5 days and was great. However, even though my teenager had one of the cards that showed he could charge and he was on the list to charge, they wouldn't let him so it was a bit disconcerting for him the first day. We also ate at Morton's (great), tried to get into Lemongrass when supposedly we did not need reservations but actually should have had them, and Malerbas for breakfast one day (nice buffet w/ great fruit and cooked to order eggs). Wifi always worked, we rented a cabana one day for $100 and it was well worth it, the staff needed to be reminded on the waters etc, but came through w/ shining service, the outdoor luch by the pool was casual and unhurried, the towel return was inconsistent and we had a charge on our final bill even though we had returned the towels(be careful as the pools are open to 9pm but the towel return closes at 6pm) and they gracefully removed the charge. There is a Hertz rental right at the hotel and it was an easy pickup and return one day when we took a spin @ the island. The concierge printed out of boarding passes, gave us a great recommendation on an ATV trail riding adventure, they had coolers of water in the lobby w/ fresh fruit in them for the thirsty throughout the day, the beds were comfortable and the weather divine. Nice pool and hot tubs, great views across the water and a really pleasant experience. I really like the private beach and NOT being in Dorado which is just a strip of hotels like any other place, the location of the Caribe Hilton makes it special and private. The cab into Old San Juan is only $12, although you could walk it if you want. While the Caribe Hilton still retains a bit of it's old world charm it has moved on and while a bit inconsistent w/ its services, the staff makes up for a very good experience and still my first choice when I go back to PR.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in San Juan\u201d", "Author": "nikki721", "ReviewID": "UR56088174", "Content": "This hotel is only 10 minutes from the airport.

There is a subway apart from the hotel restaurants within a minute walking distance. The next closest decent restaurant is on asford ave which is a good 15 minute walk over the bridge. The hotel restaurants are pretty pricey for the food they serve so we choose to walk to ashford nearly everyday and for a quick bite we resorted to subway. The biggest downside for us was the beakfast at the hotel. My husband and I are both Diamond Hilton Honors and we opted for the free breakfast every morning instead of the free internet. The breakfast was the same every single day and there was no hot food option. It consisted of cold, slightly hard croissants, cereal, toast, bagel, fruit choices and coffee out of a coffee machine that was just not good. The juices (orange/fruit punch) was again from a machine. I wish they had a variety and maybe 1-2 hot breakfast options.

Some unfair negative reviews of this hotel on this site.\u201d", "Author": "Bobeana", "ReviewID": "UR55569643", "Content": "I just returned from a six-day trip to the Caribe Hilton. My mother booked the hotel on Priceline ($109/night) and after we learned of the hotel, I was concerned re: the many negative interviews I read on TripAdvisor. I needn't have worried. This was our first time staying here for both of us and we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the hotel, the level of service and the nice beach and pool area. We both travel frequently to San Juan to visit family (we also travel a lot internationally and domestically). We'll definitely stay here again. Mom has stayed at nearly all the nicer hotels and some apartments/condos and this was by far her favorite. Our room was on the 16th floor of the Tower. It very comfortable and designed to a high standard. Our balcony had a gorgeous view of the beach/lagoon. Beds were really comfortable and the bathroom was large with a nice, huge, glass enclosed, double-headed shower (including one of those \"rain\"/\"sunflower\" showerheads). Yes, food and drinks at the hotel are expensive, but not much different from other hotels where I have stayed. The challenge here vs. staying in Condado or in downtown San Juan is not being able to walk to more affordable restaurants. If that's really important to you, this might not be the best place. Otherwise, be creative. Go to a grocery store your first day and stock up. Enjoy coffee in your room vs. Starbucks. Have breakfast at Subway or the little diner nearby. For food, our favorite place to go was the Pina Colada Club that recently opened. Management has done an excellent job here: service was great, they were patient with children and the food at better prices than the other hotel restaurants. We watched the SuperBowl here and had a great time. Congrats to Marco and his staff there on a job well done. Morton's was running a deal on drinks and bar snacks from 5:-6:30 and 9-close that I had hoped to check out, but didn't. $4 beer and wine and $6 tapas plates. We took taxis sometimes and took the bus a few times ($.75 one way, $.35 for those over 60). A bus stop a few blocks from the Hilton can take you to Old San Juan or Condado. Disclosure: my sister often picked up and gave us rides, so we definitely benefited from that local connection re: transportation. Taxi's are $12-15 depending on where you want to go. I walked to Old San Juan one morning -- it was 45 minutes to Plaza Las Armas. The west end of Condado would be a good bit closer. Yes, you're certainly off on your own here, but I find that a plus -- a quiet respite to return to after sight-seeing and visiting my family. I particularly enjoyed the nice beach/lagoon for swimming. The \"round\" deck was my favorite place to hang out. Property and grounds were very nice, in general. I was able to check in to my room on time, they upgraded our room to a higher floor upon request, and they granted me a late check out. Can't say that for many other of my hotel experiences. Staff, for the most part, was friendly and attentive. So, as you read the other reviews, be mindful of the whiners and those not accustomed to life in the tropics. Caribe Hilton was excellent -- and the $12 Pina Coladas? Best I've ever had. I enjoyed fewer as a result of the price tag, but also didn't have to do as many laps in the lagoon to work them off.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nantucket, Ma.

The hotel lobby is amazing! The lobby is open to the outside environment with no doors or windows to the outside. Upon check-in the hotel staff gave us our keys and directions to our room. The room was very clean and top-notch, everything you would expect from a $260 per night room: 3rd floor, with balcony and garden view. They also had a nice empty fridge in the room which was perfect for drinks and snacks that we purchased at a drugstore down the street (Walgreens). This hotel has 4 awesome pools (1 pool bar). The pools were clean and the towels and chairs are nice. The hot tubs are luke warm at best which was a little bit of a let down but being at this hotel and resort is like heaven. You can snorkel right at the very calm beach swimming area and the fish are awesome! Expensive Extras: A drink or food at any of the hotel bars is extremely extremely expensive. $12 mixed drink, $8 beer, $12 hamburger, etc. Also everyone is charged a 14% resort fee for use of the pool and beach on a daily basis. They include the use of towels but you have to pay for use of kids floats ($10/hour), kayaks & peddle boats($25/half hour). You can lay on an outside bed near the beach for ($35/day) and they are always empty because who is spending that kind of money? We felt like they were kind of milking you for more money every time we turned around. Those things should all be included in your \"resort fee\". Food: We ended up walking to Ashford Avenue each night for dinner (10 minute walk at a very slow pace). There you will find 4 and 5 star restaurants and very reasonable prices. People dress nicely for dinner there so men wear khaki pants and a collar shirt. One final note is that we were not impressed with the hotel staff. The cleaning ladies were really nice and did a really super job but the rest of the workers were not helpful. The concierge never picked up his phone when we called and when we asked him questions or directions in person he was really only minimally helpful.

The beach is small but was not crowded and the water was clean,beautiful and calm enough so that our 10 year old daughter could easily swim alone.

Be aware that the hotel does charge a daily resort fee and 14% tax on top of the rate, and also charges $15 for self parking and $20 for valet parking. We rented a car and drove to the rain forest, which was beautiful. We also went to Old San Juan for dinner several nights. Parking in Old San Juan is extremely difficult - it's probably easier to take a cab. The hotel gives free beach toys to kids, but charges $10 a day for rafts - if you think your kids will want one, pack it! They also have a free non alcoholic mini pina colada at 1:00 every afternoon and free fruit flavored water in the lobby. The lobby is very pretty - open and breezy with parrots in a cage for entertainment. They also have an area with ducks, peacocks and a koi pond, and free miniature golf for the kids. The Hilton Towers rooms have terraces with nice ocean views and new bathrooms. We found the restaurants that we ate in at the hotel to be quite good: the Pina Colada room for a quick dinner; the Italian restaurant was delicious, contrary to the reviews; and the breakfast buffet was good with a large selection - it is served up until 11:30 so you can have that for brunch if you are a late riser (it is a bit expensive at $26, but kids are free). The poolside bar & grill food is also decent and the prices are what you would expect for a hotel. There is a Subways right outside the hotel if you want a quick sandwich, and you can also walk over the bridge to Condado if you wish - its about a 10 minute walk, where there is the Conrad Hilton with a small casino and other restaurants. There is not much else within the area around the Caribe Hilton, however I would definitely not call the area around it a slum whatsoever, as other reviewers have stated! Everyone we met in San Juan was very nice and helpful - and we kept getting lost and asking directions. We did see a few homeless people in the streets, but we are from New York City, so I guess we are immune to it. One complaint was that I found the concierges at the hotel to not be as helpful as I would expect - the driving directions they gave every time were vague, and they never printed out anything on mapquest or google. Considering that the signs were all in a foreign language it made it even more difficult to get around, but after a few days we were fine. The rainforest (El Yunuque) was beautiful and definitely worth seeing - not necessary to take a tour if you have a car, just drive there, park and hike on one of the trails - it's amazing. Also, Old San Juan is a beautiful historic place to see, and Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Berlin was a great restaurant there (especially if you are a vegetarian but they have meat also)! The main thing missing at the Hilton was a casino, but you can't have everything.

Even at the very low prices we paid we were upgraded to the Villas. We stayed in rooms 7110 (the same number as our room on the ship) and 7311.. Both exceeded our expectations.The grounds, pool area and beach are beautiful. I do not share earlier reviews that this place is showing its age or is rundown, as it is showing its class of having evolved over the past 60 years and as the first Hilton outside the continental US. The prpoerty is on a 17 acre site at the beginning of a Penninsula leading to Old San Juan. On each side of the property are remnants from an old Spanish Fort dating back over 500 years or so. We were able to check in following our cruise at 10:00 am which was a real plus. Our only negative housekeeping issue was that the Everyready bunny in our TV remote died and we had to wait over 1/2 hour to get a new remote. There were 2 other negatives from our stays the first of which can not be blamed on the Hilton. The weather was not sunny for either of our stays which is quite unusual in that we only had 1 previous bad weather day in our last 7 visits to San Juan at this time of the year. Second I concur with the previous reviews that the prices for food and drink were excessive, even in the Starbucks. We ate at the bar on each of our 2 nights and I had the bacon cheeseburger and fries with a beer for $16 which is only a little overpriced, My wife had shrimp and iced tea which at $4.75 per glass (no free refills) was a bit high. The alternatives which many guests seem to do is the $12 or $15 dollar cab ride each way to either Old San Juan or Condado each of which areas is loaded with a variety of normally priced restaurants. There is a Subway and 2 convenience stores just outside the entrance to the resort/. We were able to buy pop, water and Orange Juice for 1/2 the price charged at the Starbucks inside the Hilton. While the Starbucks at $6 for a bagel and coffee is a reasonable alternative to the $26 buffet breakfast it is still too much. While the pool food was pricey you were paying for the convenience. The hotels Asian and Italian restaurants seemed to do very little business at the prices they charged. The bar area could be rocking and full but for the $10 and up drinks and overpriced food.

Carpet in needed repalced in both rooms. We were put in the Villas section (which is a long and initially confusing walk from the check-in.)

Some pros & cons: The grounds have suffered some damage and have not been repaired, i.e., the bridge to the beautiful round deck is broken, and it's the best place to sunbathe. Also the big iceberg is gone. When I went into the lagoon I felt little stinging things all over my legs, but the people at the towel desk said they didn't know what I was talking about. (Another guest told me she experienced the same thing). If the weather is good, the pool/beach area is the main draw for this hotel. If it's not nice, there's not much in the area to do. Oh, a big disappointment was the mojito at the pool bar. Last time I was there it was the best mojito I've ever had. Now they don't even use fresh mint, blaming \"their supplier.\" Funny, every other bar I went to had fresh mint, including the Pina Colada Club on the Hilton property. At $12 it the pool bar version was a rip off. The first room we stayed in, which was considered an upgrade because my friend is a Hilton Club member, was pretty tired and in need of renovation. And the A/C didn't work properly. We then moved to the Garden Tower, which is renovated and quite nice. Last time I stayed in the Villas, which was also newly renovated and pleasant, altho a bit of a walk to the pool area if that's a problem for you. A couple of the restaurants were closed the entire time. Because there really isn't much nearby this hotel except a Subway (it's a bit isolated) this could be a problem. We ate a lot of meals at the casual & friendly Pina Colada Club on the property. The manager Marcus and the entire staff are very friendly and it's a pleasure to hang out there. Good salads, mahi tacos, and mojitos (with fresh mint). Also used the fitness center, which is clean & well equipped. All in all, I enjoyed the Caribe more during a previous stay. Part of this was weather-related (it rained a lot this time). Also, it's a better bargain if you get it thru Hotwire. They charge a 14% resort fee, which pushes the price up pretty high. We took the bus (75 cents) to the Mariott Stalaris one night. The Tuscany Restaurant there had an excellent $20 prix fixe dinner.

Pros: - Well designed, well-staffed, efficient. - Has it's own beach. NOTE: If you want to lay on the beach, go down and get your towels from the towel stand EARLY - 7:30 or 8am - and put them on the lounge chairs you want. Only _then_ go get breakfast, etc. You must stake your ground early, or you won't have a chair. Note the beach is self-contained. You can't walk several miles up and down a long beach; the pictures show a lagoon - and that's what you get. - Several large pools. However, think large with lots of people in them - including kids. If you're squeamish about water, think carefully. - \"Good enough\" food, though nothing really remarkable, IMHO. We only ate breakfasts, and a lunch or two here. - Family-friendly. They have ways to keep kids of all ages happy and busy. It's very safe. I'd not hesitate a moment to bring children from infants through early-teens, and would let my 8-14 year olds run free. Well-staffed, responsible staff does a good job. - Free WiFi in the lobby area. - Fun to learn that the Pina Colada was invented by the bartender here in 1954. Cons: - There isn't anything cheap. A very standard-ish buffet breakfast is $30/person. Drinks are $15 and up. - LOTS of guests. This hotel can hold a lot of people, and it's evident. Never do you feel like you're in a hotel with any kind of exclusive feel; it's a machine. There's _just_ enough room for all of them when sunbathing, but you won't get your choice of locale (unless you stake it very early), and you'll be chair-to-chair with those next to you. - Long taxi lines in the evenings. Plan on waiting 15 minutes to get one. And you're likely to share a van-taxi with 3-6 other people. No fare-sharing - all of you will pay full fare. It's $12 to either the Condado area or to Old Town San Juan. Both are walkable - but plan on a 30-45 minute walk. - Did I say it already? LOTS of guests. - Internet in the room is $15/day. - You pretty much must take a taxi either to the Condado or to old San Juan if you don't want to eat on-site. There's nothing nearby. So you tend to go there, and stay there. - Very standard, cheesy resort-style atriums, and cheesy steel drum music throughout (and live). We were fine with our stay? Yes. This hotel does what it does, just fine. But all in all, though my wife and I will probably be back to San Juan, we won't be back to this Hilton; not because isn't a hotel that does _it's_ job badly; but because it's just not our type of hotel. We'd rather have the more boutique hotel with a very neon-lit finish, contemporary lounge music, and a very chi-chi / chic, jet-setter feel, or a villa or condo-hotel room. I'm going to put \"No\" on recommend a hotel to friend, because my friends would look for the same kind of boutique hotel I would. But I wouldn't necessarily say NO for all other people.

The garden area is worth visiting (I like to rooms facing it): a secluded spot with very nice walks in the lush landscaping, the sea walk and pier, especially at night, lets you look at large fish coming in to feed. There's no casino but, take a 15 minute walk (or short cab ride) to the condado, enjoy the casinos there plus take in some of the flavors of San Juan and then cab it back.

Room service was ordered but never arrived. We were overcharged -- LOOK OVER YOUR BILL CAREFULLY. It seems by the way the staff handled it that this was a regular occurrence. So if service is your thing, skip it. I only stay at the Caribe Hilton if I can get it for less than $150, otherwise it's not worth it. But if you can get a good rate, service isn't your thing, and you just want to lay around a gorgeous pool, swim in a protected ocean bay, walk to downtown shopping and dining, this is the place for you.

I would say that the Caribe Hilton is great for a family vacation. The hotel is very family-friendly. Kids eat free (I can't remember if it was for ages 5 and under or 10 and under). There is a kiddie pool, a playground, great gardens, a pier where you can feed fish - they even leave out bread for you to feed the fish. The towel hut had beach toys to borrow so you didn't have to buy or bring your own with you. We had called the concierge in advance and they recommended a babysitting service so that two of the night, my husband & I could go out on our own. As Hilton Honors Gold level members, we received vouchers for free continental breakfasts or we could upgrade to the full buffet for $11 each. Our hotel room, while nothing special, was fine and the mini-fridge was empty so we could store our own food in there - especially for the baby. The sundry store downstairs had yogurt and snacks, and even a cute floatie for just $8 that we used there and were able to bring home for future use. We also got lunch from the Subway one of the days - it is a just off the hotel premises and a quick walk. I loved the pool area, except that I wished the different levels of the pool were somehow attacghed so that you didn't need to get out of the water to go from one to the other. My 3.5 yr old fell in love with the \"food pool\" where the swim-up bar was. It was so hot when we were there that we really just sat in that pool for 2 hours straight and it was great. As for some of the negative comments from previous posters: 1) Rooms/Hotel is dated - yes, i agree with this one. The room did look dated and could use a refresh, especially the bathrooms, but they were clean and comfortable. Don't expect Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton level of luxury - but these rooms also cost 1/4- 1/2 as much so you shouldn't expect that anyway. Also, there was a balcony on the room, but it was tiny and not really appealing to sit out on, especially since my room overlooked the top of the meeting rooms. 2) Food is expensive - what hotel doesn't have expensive food and drinks? I know when I go on vacation that if I eat at the hotel, I will be paying up for that convenience and it is just part of the cost of going on vacation. The kidis eat free helped with that, as did eating at Subway for lunch a few times and my breakfast vouchers. 3) location - our intention was really just ot hang out with the kids by the beach and pool and it was perfect for that. it got really hot during the day so we actually had to go inside from 12-3pm. I wish there was more shade at the outdoor restaurant for lunch and that the playground was shaded so that my kids could have played there during the day. the beach is small but a nice, manageable size for little kids. Because it was so hot we barely played on the beach - if we were outside, we were in the pool. You do need to take a cab to go out, but it wasn't too expensive and it was a quick trip. We had a great dinner at Puerto Rico Cafe (recommended by the concierge) and then at BLT Steak in the Ritz Carlton, where we then did some gambling since the Hilton does not have a casino. Had this been a getaway for just me & my husband, I probably would have preferred somewhere a bit more modern and luxurious... but if you are looking for a great hotel to spend some time with the kids, i think this was about as good as you will find, especially for the money.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evansville, Indiana", "Title": "\u201clove it!\u201d", "Author": "Impoolside2000", "ReviewID": "UR49451303", "Content": "Where to lay and get sun?

Our 6 year old has several allergies (dust mites, peanuts, pollen) and often when we stay at hotels he gets congested. However, he had absolutley no problem at the Caribe Hilton. We did have issues with food since they cannot guarantee that the food be peanut free. This is normal for most hotels so we prepared ahead of time and brought food with us in our suitcase (bagels with cream cheese, canned goods, etc). I'm pretty creative with this since we travel a lot and we are dealing with this peanut allergy. We had to bring food with us because there is no grocery store nearby. There are two little stores but they only have junk food, nothing healthy. The hotel was great for adults and kids. There were 3 pools, gardesn with peacocks and geese, the hotel had baskets of dried bread to feed to the fish in the little garden stream, there was a playground for toddlers - 6 year olds, there were huge chess games and connect four games (all of this stuff for free), there were little crabs on the beach at night to catch, and hammocks (tons of them to swing in or just lie around), there was free pina colada tasting at 1pm.

Please treat yourself and forget those who find a reason to complain if everything isn't just perfect. Glen and Paula P.S.

I went to the web site and it was promoting stay 4 nights and two nights were free. July 20 til Dec sometime. So I called the hotel direct, and they were sorry but even though they were advertising this special you were not able to book the special. I asked to speak to the manager, Ivan Ayala and he told me he would honor the web site. We discussed the \"room type\" I had selected and he said it would be honored. He told me to just put it in writing. So I did. I asked Mr. Ayala if he had taken this off the web site ( it was very disturbing to \"think\" you're getting a deal only to find out it had expired). He said he had. I went to the web site and that was a lie. I made my flight arrangements and the next day received a reservation for 1 person in a smoking room at full price. When asked why the \"special\" was not included, Mr. Ayala said he thought I had rejected the stay 4 nights and pay for 2 and opted for another \"special\". Really! At 10pm I finally spoke with another manager. By this time, they had posted a small sentence saying the stay 4 nights pay for 2 was not available for the room options. So, they would not honor the web site from two days ago. Listen, does anyone there care how upsetting this is? That would be NO. They make a mistake and then take it out on the customer. So, now I go to bed, with no hotel plans but non refundable plane tickets. Tomorrow is my birthday and next week is my anniversary. It was suppose to be fun.

We did not eat any meals at the hotel as they were above our price range, but that was not a hardship. We brought some snacks with us, which came in handy.

I'll begin with the positives. The grounds, pool areas. beach area. and property amenities for children were excellent. The views of the ocean from various sites of the hotel were awesome.There was a daily activivty program for children but appeared to be absolutely NO structured supervision. Therefore, my 10 year old daughter didn't engage in the program. The lobby area is a completely open area allowing birds to fly freely within the open areas including the main restaurant area. Birds would perch on tables and chairs throughout the restaurant and other open areas. Then there was my favorite...the LOUD and inceessantly noisy screams from caged mucaws and a cockateil in the lobby. It was horrible ...especially since my 10 year old has a fear of birds!! Upon registering , you are greeting by this inescapeable sound....and all day until about 6pm. Then there was the 4.5 star rooms....NOT! I requested and paid for an ocean view. I was assigned to the towers which overlooked roof tops in need of repair and a hole in the adjoining buliding which I assumed served as a door. The second room was located in the Garden view of the hotel with cracks in the floor leading to the small bathroom and walls inadequetly painted in an attempt to hide molding. At this point, I called the hotel manager. My third and accepted option given 4 hours after checking into the hotel was a view of the ocean and tropical garden. I was told that this area was the \"new\" section of the hotel. The word \"new\" was obviously used in relative terms. At this point, I was too exhausted to continue my opposition. The slate floors were filthy. I left a note requesting housekeeping to sweep and mop the floors. The floors were swept once but not mopped.

My mother (who is Puerto Rican) wanted to stay at the Caribe Hilton after staying there in the mid 90s. And the Caribe Hilton MORE than surprised me with both it's natural beauty and location as well as the renovated areas of the hotel. Check in is at 4pm, but we arrived at 2pm. Because of the multiple packages (my sisters on Continental Tours, ours on Expedia) the woman at check in found us all rooms in the Tower though on different floors. She gave us a claim to use the pool and beach and we quickly changed into bathing suits and were thrilled at the accomodations on the beach. Chaises, umbrellas and towels are free. We brought face masks and snorkels with us so we had an amazing afternoon swimming by the rocks near the beach and viewing the schools of fish - like being in an aquarium! Once we received our room location in the tower, the bellhop brought up our luggage and made sure we had enough towels. We had lunch at the Subway down the street, filling and less expensive than the restaurants at the hotel. After a wonderful day on the beach, we took a $12 cab ride into Old San Juan to Buren' on San Christo Plaza (same street as the great upscale shops that close at 7pm) where the food was wonderful but the service was slow. For 9 people to move easily was not difficult. The Caribe has wi-fi in the lobby (get the code at the front desk) and that was perfect for just enough work connection while on vacation. For breakfast - kids under 12 are free at the buffet with an adult. However, the adult buffet at $26 was too pricey for my husband and I. My mother took the smaller kids with her to breakfast and we ate at Starbucks, which is a wonderful addition to the lobby. Get to the beach by 9:30 to get towels and lounges as well as umbrellas. Hammocks go quickly, The pool, beach and grounds are amazing - if you eat at the pool grill, the kosher hot dog at $8 was huge with a generous plate of fries. We found that 9:30-1pm at the pool/beach was plenty (don't forget the 1pm pina colada tasting at the swim up bar , no alcohol, but tasty) and then a quick nap on the beach and up to shower at 5pm. Dinners in Old San Juan were excellent at Cafe Puerto Rican, Sophias and at JAM in Condado Beach (their sister bar, Marmalade in OSJ is also excellent) and that the Caribe bar is not that exciting at night. The Salsa Congress started during our stay, so we had free entertainment each night with bands and dancing. The hotel was overcrowded and fully booked and still I felt that the rooms were clean and the hotel was keeping up with the crowds. The room itself was spacious and the bathrooms in the Tower were wonderful with a two person shower, double sinks and lots of outlets. The double beds were very comfortable, the air conditioning excellent and the safe under the TV console were perfect. Elevators were a bit slow, but the blast of air conditioning when walking into the Tower lobby was refreshing. The kids loved the parrots in the lobby (and they are indeed a bit loud when excited) the options of pool, hot tub and ocean, the water trampoline (it was being repaired the last part of our trip) and all the fish when snorkeling. While I was suspect, I would NOT hesitate to go back to the Caribe Hilton.

He was in San Juan for a convention and this was the primary hotel in which attendees were housed. Had we come to Puerto Rico on vacation, we probably would have stayed right in Old San Juan to sightsee for a couple of days, then rented a car and left the city to explore less developed parts of the island. Nevertheless, we thought the Caribe Hilton was a nice hotel in general, and we enjoyed our stay. On a side note, I arrived a day earlier by myself (due to my HUSBAND telling me the wrong dates when I booked my airline ticket) Since the Caribe Hilton was full, I had to stay one night at the Condado Plaza Hilton, which I have also reviewed. (So if you are a Hilton Points member and are trying to decide between the two, you can read both reviews). The following are things we liked about the Caribe: BEACH. Small but fairly pretty crescent shaped beach with nice view of ocean. It would have been even prettier if not marred by the ugly concrete sun bed jutting out into the little bay. Also the giant inflated trampoline smack in the middle marred the natural beauty, but lots of kids sure enjoyed it. There were plenty of recliners in spite of the hotel being full. It may take a while to get the attention of the umbrella guy. You may have to go fetch him, but he will surely bring you one. The water is calm and it is possible to see a few things if you snorkel by the edges. They rent equiptment, and sometimes there's a free equiptment hour- see activity sheet at towel stand for times. GROUNDS. Lovely and fun to explore and look at the animals. Just like the photos in the reviews. Disturbing, though, how the bellies of the swans are dyed blue from whatever additives they put in the pond, maybe to retard algae or mosquitos? ACTIVITIES. At the towel booth, you can pick up a list of the week's activities. Some are for kids, some for adults. I certainly would have been at the daily pina colada tasting at one o'clock. Unfortunately, I didn't find out about the activity list until the last day. No one tells you. Here are the things we did not like so much: CROWDED. The lobby seemed crowded and chaotic at times. If I were on my honeymoon, I would have been devastated because, Man, this place was full of kids! We didn't care so much due to being there primarily for convention, not vacation. In fairness, July/August is the big time for vacationing families and somewhat for conventions as well. I imagine the resort would be more tranquil at most other times besides Xmas or Easter. EXPENSIVE FOOD, DRINKS. To be expected. But my $16 chicken caesar salad was very mediocre. The exact same dish at the Condado Plaza was excellent. Drinks were good, though, and they had better be for the $$$. INCONSISTANT SERVICE. Probably due to hotel being full. Hard to get attention of bar staff, though, in spite of good tips and few patrons. On the beach, there was a call button for if you wanted to order something- sometimes you'd get a quick response, sometimes you would wonder if someone was ever going to answer. Good points in service were the efficient banquet service at the functions we attended and also how extra hangers (even more than we asked for) were brought to the room quickly when requested. All in all, I got the feeling that most staffers were trying their best. ROOM AND VIEW. It was room 7114 in the lagoon villas section, all of which I think come with fully equipped kitchen. It looked newly remodeled. Bedroom was good sized and comfortable. AC, appliances, everything were functioning well. Bathroom small but new, no tub. This unit would have been great for a family. It was more a matter of personal taste for us. It just seemed ugly and not what I would want on vacation to be sitting in bed and looking right at a kitchen. The room was done in a dark tan and green scheme with heavy fabrics and drapes that seemed depressing and out of place in a tropical environment, especially after my pretty, modern, stylish and airy room with tropical decor that I stayed in at the Condado Plaza, where my room had a free safe. Here they wanted to charge for it. That really irks me for some reason. Regarding cleanliness, we noticed a couple icky hairball-dustbunny type things in the hall and in the room as we first entered after check in. Otherwise OK. The unit had a nice patio, but we spent zero time on it because view was just plain BAD. It is of a lagoon with an ugly bridge under construction with big cranes and traffic. Sadly, the view will still be unattractive when the construction is completed. The lagoon is surrounded by blah concrete hotels and appartments. It isn't just this hotel, either. It seems to be a similar case at many San Juan hotels. I strongly suggest ponying up for ocean view wherever you choose to stay. That way you can forget you're surrounded by development. LOCATION. The Caribe is on a point of land and other than a Subway and a couple of high priced little convenience stores that carry liquor and snacks, there is not really anything within walking distance. Walking within Condado once you get over the bridge is doable. It is not adviseable to try walking longer distances such as between neighborhoods, as everywhere is crisscrossed by busy roads, highways, and some gated residential areas and you kind or get trapped by all of it. You will be spending a lot on cabs. If going to OSJ, you can ask where to catch the bus for only 35 cents. One may come immediately, or you may wait a half hour (just like Chicago, ha ha) and it only goes as far as San Cristobal, aproximately. It does not go furthur into OSJ. But you can then pick up the free tourist trolley. In sum, because of the calm beach (with trampoline), activities, and grounds with animals, I think the Caribe would be a great choice for families planning to not leave the resort much, especially if you could get a lagoon villa with kitchenette like we stayed in. You could store lots of snacks in the full fridge or pop a frozen pizza in the microwave or oven to feed the kids lunch or dinner and in that way avoid buying expensive food at the beach. So even though I rated the hotel as average, many of those points I disliked would be favorable if you have kids. It was also a good hotel for the convention. I feel like they tried to treat us well, sometimes in spite of how some of the guests acted. We were happy to be contributing to the local economy and felt appreciated in turn. My husband has spent quite a bit of time in PR in the past, but it was my first visit. In spite of being turned off by overdevelopment in a lot of outlying San Juan, I was charmed by Old San Juan. I like the diversity, creativity and urban worldliness exuded by Sanjuaneros. I don't like how everyone responds in English when I try to speak Spanish (but my Spanish is lame). I think it's awesome how everyone really dresses up to go out at night. I hope to return to Puerto Rico to explore more of the island's beauty in the various other regions and cities I have read about. I loved the Puertorican culture, music and food. Highlights were a night of the Le Lo Lai music/dancing show at Fuerte San Cristobal, the views from El Morro, Museo de Arte de Puertorico and its sculpture garden (in Santurce neighborhood-don't try to walk, big mistake), impressive folk art and indigenous cultures display at Museum of Puertorican culture in OSJ, awesome coffee everywhere and yummy pastry called ?quesilla? that I couldn't get enough of, Bebo's restaurant, the great fruit and world's sweetest mangoes at municipal market near art museum, roast pork with skin all crispy, beans and rice.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Owensboro", "Title": "\u201cParadise in Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "63galaxie", "ReviewID": "UR35314566", "Content": "The Caribe Hilton is simply perfect on so many levels. We have stayed here three times (pre and post cruise), the last time was in June 2008. I have seen so many negative reviews yet so many other reviews that are polar opposite. Our experiences have been so memorable that I wanted to take the time to share. Expect a short cab ride from the airport and/or the pier. The bellhops are always waiting to open the car doors, take your luggage, greet you with a smile and a big welcome. We found them to be efficient and friendly without exception. The front-desk staff left nothing unattended. They were cheerful, quick to answer questions, informative, and very willing to check for upgrades. We were given a partial oceanview room which overlooked the gardens. The view was spectacular. The room was modern, fresh, and spotlessly clean. The beds were perfect for us. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the bellhop. He unloaded our luggage and seemed eager to share his suggestions for a local dinner spot. He took time to greet us and check on us every time we saw him in the lobby. And, his dinner suggestion was spot-on for authentic, homecooked food. Dinner was inexpensive and delicious! We were given access to the Concierge Lounge which included free food and beverages in the evening and for breakfast. Sofas and seating were plentiful, including seating on a balcony overlooking the deep blue sea. Free internet and computers were available as well as local newspapers. The food was fresh and the lounge made our living space all that much more. We spent time in the magnificent lounge/bar area in the lobby. I couldn't decide which was more relaxing, the view over the pool and out to the ocean, or those soothing ocean breezes. Another great find was the Starbucks in the lobby. They carried all the usual drinks, but what we enjoyed were the homemade local pastries. Again, inexpensive and unusual. Others have mentioned the birds in the lobby. They are colorful and lively and we enjoyed bantering with them! There were plenty of interesting shops in the resort which made for some great window shopping. The prices were, shall we say, not exactly budget friendly, but then again, we are in a resort. We ate bbq'd burgers and caesar salads outside. Again, the views were spectacular! The portions were large and the flavors were first-rate. And the Pina Coladas were predictably top-notch. After lunch we walked through the botanical gardens, stopping to sit in the gazebo to watch the fish and the big black swans. It was a cool and quiet spot to read a book. We noticed a restaurant with huge glass walls tucked in the corner of the gardens. It wasn't open for lunch and we never made it back for dinner, but I'm betting the Lemon Grass was elegant and cozy dinner venue. The resort has an old fort right on the grounds. Unfortunately, it was not open to the public. There's a beautiful stone wall with a lovely walkway alongside the ocean. It included a long stone pier which one could look down on and see the waves crashing below. At night, they turn on spotlights and the fish are actually fed. It's like snorkeling without getting in the water. My favorite feature had to be the lovely and large palm trees strung with hammocks. The ocean breeze will literally rock you to sleep while you gaze up into their shiny green fronds. The infiinty pool has a waterfall and a swim-up bar. It overlooks the ocean too. A short walk will bring you to the private beach. Free nonmotorized sports equipment was available for guests. The sand was soft, the water was gentle and shallow for quite a long ways out, and the water was just the right temperature. In the middle of the lagoon is a slide and a small floating dock. We never visited the spa or the fitness center, but they have both available. They also have a children's play area with several plastic climb-on/over contraptions for the little ones. We found a Subway just up the street. The prices were equal to stateside prices. They had a full coffee and ice cream bar, as well as local soups, and the standard Subway sandwiches and salads. Breakfast choices included pancakes, eggs, meats, and pastries. Directly across the street from the resort is a small local market. It had soups to nuts (wine, souveniers, beer, local food items, cameras, you name it). We saw at least one other restaurant onsite but we never ate there either. Kudos to the concierge staff who graciously packed up a guitar my husband had purchased precruise. She arranged for Fed Ex to pick it up and she had it shipped back to us in the U.S. This resort has been almost a mecca for us. We recommend it to families, couples, singles, travelers, and business people. It has a lovely laid-back vibe with enough luxurious touches to let you know you are in a resort in the Caribbean.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Jersey", "Title": "\u201c.....

The Hilton is about two miles away from the beginning of the center of Old San Juan. It is about as far to get to any significant area in the Condado area. So here are your options: You can walk but in hot and humid weather it may not be the suitable option (Especially if you are dressed to impress). The cheapest fare would be to find the bus schedule and bus stops. This costs about fifty cents for a ride. You can rent a bike but you are confined to the hours you are allowed to take the bike out. It is twenty five dollars for the day. You can rent a car. Not recommended if you are going into Old San Juan (There will be trouble with parking and traffic). Also Hilton will charge you for parking. You can take a taxi. Can be pricey especially if you are comparing a fifty cent bus fare to a twelve dollar taxi ride (one way). Food and Beverages. The Hilton is ridiculously overpriced for its food or drinks. Eight dollars a beer. twelve dollars for a Pina Colada. A \"small\" salad from the outside bar was ten dollars. We ate at the lemon grass, which is an Asian fusion type restaurant and the prices there were expensive as well. One Sushi roll there is a minimum of fifteen dollars. There is a Subway and a small restaurant next to a mini-mart right outside the Hilton. I would recommend going to these spots to eat to save money. You can also get beverages (regular drinks and alcohol) at the mini-mart which would save you money as well. The Beach The Beach that is provided by the Hilton is closed off by rocks so if you like waves you will not like their beach. The rocks stop any waves from coming into the Hilton beach area. In my opinion this defeats the purpose of going in the water! You are better off just using the pool (Which is nice). If you want the waves there is a public beach around the corner of the Hilton on the other side of the ball fields (surfers go there). Nightlife The bar sometimes has something going on but it usually is not a happening spot. The closest spots would be in Old San Juan (Busy night life only on the weekends). La Placita in Santurce (ten minutes from the Hilton) is a happening spot on some nights with a lot more local flavor. The other side of San Juan on Isla Verde Avenue is much more bustling with nightlife (About a $20.00 cab fee one way). The busiest spot seemed to always be El San Juan Hotel and Casino. There is a lot going on there especially on the weekends (If you go there on the weekends dress to impress). The Room We stayed in the main building and I had absolutely no problem with the room what so ever. I will say this though. When I plan my trips I never really care about certain amenities the room has to offer such as cable TV or whatever. I use the room to sleep and that is it. All I care about is if the room is comfortable and clean. The Hilton had that. Oh and yes the Hilton did have cable TV, air conditioning, and an internet connection but I believe you had to pay a daily rate for that. The lobby has a free wireless connection. Overall I went there with my wife looking for adventure but from what I have seen it did look like a place for the whole family (kids). The place may not be a hot spot but it is far from quiet (The loud parrots at the front of the lobby will attest to that). It is like everyone is there for business though. I would recommend somewhere else. If you want to be closer to Old San Juan find a place closer or get a place that is right in Old San Juan. If you are looking for night life I would recommend the El San Juan Hotel and Casino on Isla Verde Avenue (A lot of things are in walking distance of this hotel) and I think the beach is better.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "ChantelleSTX", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced and Horrible customer service\u201d", "Author": "ChantelleSTX", "ReviewID": "UR34910928", "Content": "This is the type of hotel that will nickel and dime you. But that is often the case with a large resort that has trouble keeping itself full. So that wasn't that big of an issue. I've lived in the Caribbean for about 10 years and customer service is often lacking, but I have never come across anything like this. Every single employee I encountered was sour. From the Check in to the check out., no smiles and no courtesy. Check in took over 45 minutes and most of that time was for us check in, not waiting in line. All we asked was to upgrade to a King Villa with Ocean View (we were not asking for it for free but to pay for it), from an ocean view deluxe room. He said it was available as soon as we asked for it but then took FOREVER to check us in, never chatting with us or telling us what was wrong, just frowning silence. On a side note I hate the loud squawking parrots in hotel lobbies. Feels like its going to pierce your ear drums, but I guess kids like that. So after a long very confusing walk to the villa area of the property we get to our room. I was really disappointed. It was beige, beige and beige with a white bed (Who decides to make a Caribbean room brown? Just makes it look dingy). It was a very dark room and on top of the disappointing first impression we had no ocean view but some kind of canal with construction going on. The windows and the walls are extremely thin, we could hear our neighbors every night and construction woke us up every morning!!! And the room would barely get cool. We paying all sorts of taxes and energy charges and we have a hot room. Also after discovering our room OPEN (if you did not lift the door handle back up it wouldn't lock) we called down to the operator right away and reported the problem, no one came, reported it again, not one came. That was pretty much the last straw. We ate at Mortons several times and had excellent service. That is the best part of the hotel. Ask the Concierge for recommendations twice and the recommendations were awful. And again she acted like we were putting her out by bothering her. We moved to the Marriott San Juan & Stellaris Casino, halfway during our stay because I could not stand the service any longer at the Caribe. We had a wonderful stay there.

The hotel is a bit aged, as it was built in the 50's, but has a lot of activities. The pools and beach areas are nice, they were not crowded at all thru the week, but got busy on Friday and Saturday. The beach hammock area is very nice. The food is very pricey and there is not much within walking distance. There is a Subway nearby. Old San Juan is only a 50cent bus ride away, but we took a taxi when we went. The taxi cost around $12 plus tip, each way. Very easy access to taxis in Old San Juan. I would not recommend driving in Old San Juan, because it is very hectic, and no place to park. We stayed in the main tower in 719, but our room did not have a very nice view, although we could see the ocean. Mostly you see the top of the lower floors in the main building. We had trouble on four consecutive days with the lock on our door. We had to have new room keys made daily. They worked on the lock, but did not seem to know how to fix it.

The pool by the garden is always empty if you want to relax in peace. Check in was fine and there were no lines. We had one of the garden view rooms in the newly renovated wing. The room was very clean and well decorated. All the basic essentials provided. However, there is no bathtub only a standing shower, which I didn't mind. The view from our third floor room wasn't great. All I could see were some trees in the garden and the back of the Lemon Grass restaurant. I asked for an ocean view prior to my stay but the woman at the front desk told me I had a newly renovated room so I decide to stay where I was. There were several minor problems with our room. First, the shower had a odd/ faint smell of throw-up. I'm not really sure what the smell was but I saw the maid clean our shower several times we were there. Second, the ceiling had a small leak from the air conditioner but we didn't inform the front desk til check out because we didn't want them fixing it during our stay like they did with the third problem...our broken/jammed door. But none of these problems really bothered us. I don't know if we didn't let all the small things get to us because we enjoyed everything else the hotel has to offer or if we're just laid back people.

The Food & Beverage department of this hotel may be its low point. Lunch service at the Italian restaurant was painfully slow, and prices at all of the on-site restaurants are high. Getting a bartender at the lobby bar to even make eye contact is a challenge, let alone obtaining prompt service! On the other hand, the breakfast buffet was good and well-stocked.

Upon arrival, we waited in a very long, slow line for check-in, only to be told that the hotel did not have our reservation information. We were quickly sent to an \"ocean view\" room, which we had paid additional for upon booking. The room we received was in the \"Villas\". It was a beautiful room, but was NOT an oceanview. It was a Lagoon/inlet view with scenes of the bay, skyscrapers, and construction vehicles, like cranes! NOT the view we had paid extra to have!! See our photo labelled \"villa room\". Additionally, the room did not have a balcony, as advertised. There was a ledge approximately 12 inches wide to stand on. If you turned your head to the extreme left, there was a sliver of ocean visible--- apparently where they got that it was an \"ocean view\". We contacted our travel agent, who efficiently arranged for us to be moved to another room, in the Tower building. We waited for two hours in the lobby for this room because the front desk clerk told us that the room was waiting to be inspected by the housekeeping manager. Our original room keys had already been taken, so we were forced to sit in the lobby and await the new room. We were told that the bell hops would take our bags, but not to a secured area. Rather, they keep a large area in the middle of the lobby stacked with suitcases around the clock. Not secured. Not under constant surveillance (and next to the taxis!), which we were not comfortable with AT ALL. At the end of the two hours, our travel agent again called the desk. The same person at the desk \"assisted us\" and was extremely rude. No apologies for the fact that we'd spent two hours when she had initially told us to come back in 15 minutes... not once, but three times! This time, the office manager immediately gave us keys to an ocean front room. Our room was on the 20th floor and faced the ocean. It was a great room and we woke to spectacular views every day. The private beach was more of a moat than a beach. It is walled off from the ocean, so snorkeling is obviously very limited. The pool was very nice size, although not very clean. The swim up pool bar closed before the sun went down every day, even on the weekend, even though the pool was still opened. Additionally, we had to sign in and sign out beach towels daily under the threat that our credit card would be charged $20 per towel if we did not comply. Each day there was confusion about where to do this? The cabana outside or the front desk. The trips to the front desk meant ALWAYS waiting in a long line and unfriendly service. High speed internet service was a whopping $15/day. Don't buy it! Go to starbucks and get online for FREE. The location was great and we were able to walk to the bus which took us into Old San Juan. In fact, we walked from the hotel to El Morro at the far point in Old San Juan. If you stay in the hotel, consider the bus as decent transportation. It costs only 75 cents to ride to Old San Juan, whereas a taxi costs $12. We went on the snorkeling excursion and had a blast! We met a lot of fun people, had lunch and (weak) drinks on board. It cost $89 each, which included the boat ride, equipment use, transportation, lunch and drinks. Our bus driver was awful, complained about the US the entire way home... but that is the bus company, not the fault of the excursion company. The Bacardi factory tour was fun, BUT don't pay at the hotel for the excursion... take the 75 cent bus and then the 50 cent water taxi. You can catch a 3 dollar taxi at the dock. This will save you about $49 dollars per person! As a side note, the little restaurant across the street and to the left from the dock in Catano has excellent pizza (when you want a reasonable, fast meal) and the staff was extremely friendly and happy to have us! We ate in two of the restaurants at the Hilton, as well as ordered room service. Breakfast in Palmeras was very good, lots of options, including the ability to mix a mimosa. It cost us $26 pp for the breakfast buffet, but we felt it was worth it. After breakfast, we would be able to skip lunch and then eat dinner. We had Mortons one time while staying in the Hilton. It was very pricey, $50 for a steak which DID NOT include a salad or side dish! Those were an additional $10-14 each! The food was very good, but not better than we can have in our local steakhouse and Mortons was more than twice as expensive. Room service was prompt, but pricey. $73 for two sandwiches and dessert. Overall, we would not recommend the HIlton Caribe to our friends and family. Although the location was great, the service was awful. The staff was very short with us... what we would expect in NYC, not in the Caribbean at a vacation destination. The food was expensive. The pool bar closed before the sun went down.

I have quite a bit to share. If you have no expectations, then go to this hotel. If you are expecting a palatial resort with more amenities than you can shake a stick at with the personnel to boot, don't do it. I had an early check-in. The front desk was VERY helpful getting me in before the allowed 4:00 (room was ready at 3:15). Gerardo escorted me to room 738, but he asked to enter first to make sure it was up to par. It wasn't. The A/C unit had no cover & there were visible wires. He apologized profusely, got us another room and then sent a bottle of champagne for our troubles. Hello!? I was happy. Tired from the flight and hungry, we checked out the room service menu. I had read the reviews on prices, but I was NOT expecting a $23 sammich. I was starving, I ordered it, and it was the last day I ate room service. Pool was nice although I never got in it. The Beach was also nice. But \"nice\" isn't what I paid for. My hopes were WAY to high and I was expecting something a little more than what I got. Two words: Rocky & Man-made. Although there were no children in my party, the kids seemed to enjoy the iceberg & trampoline. Service at the pool and/or deck was POOR. After the 1st day, I found it hard to believe anyone worked in that area. On the second day, I timed the appearance of a CH employee on the deck. There was a 3 hour delay and the hotel was not even full. It was cloudy and there weren't many people in the area. Third day, went to get a towel from the towel stand (which by the way you sign for and have to return by 6 or they charge you $20 PER towel), I was greeted by a sign. Yep a sign that said the stand opened up an hour before yet not a single soul was protecting these rather valuable towels. I grabbed 2 towels & laid out. I did not see anyone for another 45 minutes. Yes, I had on my watch. The spa- I don't even no where to start. Seriously. My massage was more like a rub-you-doen-in-oil session. I know what a massage is supposed to feel like. What I paid $150 for in San Juan was something I do every night when I get out of the shower. I treated myself to a pedicure, her name was Ana and she was fabulous! The salon area is lacking. Not a wide range of polishes and magazines from December '08. I am not picky I just believe in the value of a dollar! The sauna was nice if you avoided the top, right bench which was broken into pieces. The ladies steam room well......that was scary. The paint is peeling from the ceiling, the moisture collects on these hanging pieces and it BURNS real bad if you don't know it is coming. Trust me. I stood in the doorway rather than sit. It was the only place that didn't have boiling raindrops falling on my head and skin. If you want to try these out for yourself, then it is free if you are receiving a treatment. Otherwise, expect to pay $20. What you read about high prices here is true. I paid $7.50 for a brush at the Sundry store. My husband bought a toothbrush for $6.50. We knew this going in but were amazed at the prices. Oh, how can I forget the $10 pina colada in a plastic cup? Classy! There was a young male concierge working who spent more time on his iPhone than one probably should if they are there to assist. There is a young female concierge who promised to call me back Wednesday night. (I was stranded in Old San Juan there was not a taxi in sight, I called her). She hasn't returned my call yet. Which brings me to another point, I had a member of the front desk promise to call me back last night. Never happened. Instead, two hours later, I went down to the desk. There were 2 trainees manning to fort. They had no clue what the devil I was talking about. This property is too big and understaffed. Please be advised, that once I realized the minimart sold items for cheaper, I would walk over. I did this more than once and each time I encountered a strange individual on Hilton's property. The first man just made me nervous. He did not appear to be a guest and followed me into the Subway. The second was an elderly gentleman who tried to sell me some ice. Yeah. Some ice on the Hilton lot. I also met a couple staying at the Normandie next door. They told me that they preferred the Hilton to their hotel and came over (each day) for b'fast, hang out in lobby and on the beach. Now, I'm sure these were nice people but Hilton, really? Security? Oh, and last but certainly NOT least for those of us who <3 our internet. Internet is free as a bird in the hotel lobby 24 hours a day! This increases the number of lobby loungers throughout the day. For a small fee of $14.95/day you can have internet access in your room. (I was there 4 days, my internet doesn't cost that much per month). I will not return here. I am used to service, attention, and better kept common areas (did I mention the dead fish in the pond? or the bathroom off of the lobby? YIKES!).

We were Not upgraded to the Hilton tower for preferred members so I can not speak to those rooms or that bldg in particular. Our room was on the 7th floor and it was somewhat out dated in the carpet and furniture, but not awful. When vacationing at a resort one expects the food, drinks and restaurants to be somewhat more costly than the average off site restaurant. But saying this we felt that this resort was outrageous! We paid $14 with tip at the pool bar for a Pina Colada in a 10 oz plastic cup. A burger with a side of fries and water was $21 before tip and it was not huge or the best by any means. We had the free breakfast buffett for the preferred Hilton members and that is the only meal we ate at the resort. We walked to the store at the entrance of the hotel daily for Subway for lunch and adult beverages. I thought the walk would be long since the hotel was on 17 acres but it was very close. The concierge resources were very helpful and went out of their way to make sure we got the reservations and types of food and restaurants we requested. The beach area was not anything what we were used to from the Carribean or Mexico. It was somewhat murkey and more like a man made beach at a lake or state park in the United States. The majority of the coast line along the hotel was sharp rocks, so the only option for getting into the ocean was the small man made area. This was not appealing so after checking this out we did not use this area of the resort. The pool area is nice but the way it is set up with the waterfall there is not as much deck area as one would expect. Luckily each day we were able to secure two lounge chairs side by side without much effort and we did NOT go out to the pool by 8 am - more like 9:30 ish.

We stayed at the resort for one night before embarking on a Caribbean Cruise in December of 2008. Before we arrived at the hotel, I emailed them to let them know that we would likely be arriving a little earlier than check-in time (arriving around 12:30-1pm instead of 4pm, which is check-in time). I received a prompt email response telling me not to worry, that they would be able to have the room ready for then. When we arrived at the hotel, they had our room all ready for us and got our room keys right away. The hotel lobby is beautiful - there are parrots, some complimentary water with fresh fruit, and some shops. Also, there is a Starbucks right on site (very important for coffee lovers!) as well as some restaurants, a bar, etc. Our room was very clean; the bathroom was very spacious. Our only complaint about the bathroom is that the towels tended to leave some fuzzies on your body after you bathed - an incredibly minor complaint! You know it is a good hotel when all you have to complain about are the towels! Our room had a fabulous balcony that had a great view of the hotel grounds overlooking the ocean. Absolutely beautiful! The grounds had a wonderful area that was a sanctuary to some fish and birds. It was a very relaxing area. We didn't end up using any of the pools or the beach at the hotel, but it looked like a great place to relax and swim. We ate at the Italian Restaurant on site and even though it was a tad expensive, the service was excellent and the food was delicious. The buffet breakfast had a lot of options as well, including many hot foods. All in all, the Caribe Hilton was a great way to relax after a long flight before we boarded a cruise, and it also seemed like a great place for a longer vacation in Puerto Rico.

Yes, what a few other reviewers have said is true.. the restaurants and bars are very expensive. We followed some others advice listed here and frequented the Subway and the minimart/liquor store across the street in order to save a few dollars. With taxes and resort fees included our cost per night for a standard ocean view room was around $230 and this included the breakfast buffet. We certainly did not find the food here to be inedible- there was a very large selection of breakfast items, fruits, juices.. also an omelet station. Our kids loved it! Also ate at Mortons, food was very good and it is very expensive and no kids menu, but the waiter (really nice, funny guy) accomodated us by splitting one entree for the 2 kids. Same for the Italian restaurant (there is a childrens menu here but my kids again split an adult entree) although I would rate the food as just good. Service can be a bit too \"relaxed\", particularly the housekeeping (no washcloths), but we never once felt that we were being treated rudely. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful - if you greeted people with a smile and a friendly attitude, it would be returned. The room itself was a bit worn and \"oceanview\" isn't exactly what you would expect since you're looking at the water at an angle and because of the unusual layout of the hotel, we were actually looking down at the front lobby. Street noise would make it's way up to our balcony but didn't interfere with sleeping. Beds were comfortable and room was clean. Loved the grounds, esp. the various options for lounging (hammocks, lounge chairs, wicker \"beds\") and the kids absolutely loved the pool. The hot tubs could have been a bit hotter. Again, the drinks at the outdoor bar are pricey, but the Pina Coladas and the Mojitos were very tasty! Only spent one morning at the beach - the kids preferred the pool. It is only a short taxi ride ($12) to Old San Juan. Loved the forts, restaurants (Cafe Puerto Rico- 2 thumbs up, Parrot Club -great coconut mojito) and shops. Also, rented a car (from Payless across from the hotel) and went to El Yunque to hike down to LaMina falls and go swimming - highly recommended. Finally- we went a snorkeling/catamaran excursion in Fajardo on the Salty Dog Catamaran (there are discount coupons at the concierge desk). What a fabulous time we all had.

There were plenty of lounge chairs by the pool and the beach. The main problem with this property is the service. It charges like a high-end resort but has the service level of a low-end property. The sink in our bathroom had hot water coming out of both sides of the faucet. This was reported to the front desk every day of our 5-day stay but was never fixed. One day, the housekeeping staff forgot to leave us additional soap for the shower (we were out of soap). We asked at the front desk, more was delivered but were charged a fee at check-out for a revisit from housekeeping! In the 3 days that we laid out by the pool, no one ever came by to see if we wanted a drink or needed anything. This is especially amazing since this is where most resorts make a lot of money. The food at the property is practically inedible. The first morning we went for breakfast and the only option was the buffet. We paid over $60 for 2 and had to go to Starbucks afterwards to find something to eat. The next evening, we were in the same restaurant for a late snack. We ordered a burger & chicken sandwich and 2 drinks. After paying over $58 for this, we again found the food inedible. Needless to say, we never ate at the property again. Every morning, the hotel puts out 3 lovely, glass serving vessels of water in the lobby with various fruits in them for their guests. After a couple of hours, the water is gone and they sit there all day empty and no one ever refills them. This is a perfect example of what is wrong with this property.

April 1st. Now we did pay the full price of $300per night so I am basing my review on that as well! We arrived and waited for our room only about an hour (we were early). We headed out to the grill next to the pool and had lunch - what a great start. The Mahi Mahi was perfect and only $16, we were not drinking much because of the kids, but did have to try the Pina Colada's (they originated at this hotel). They are $13 each. So if you are a drinker, you will blow some money! We first booked the villa for the kitchenette, but it looked straight onto a crane and the highway bridge, we changed to a standard room which was actually larger. They are filming a movie here (starring Johhny Depp) so all the villa suites and good rooms are taken. Room was ok, balcony was a little scary - did not let kids near it, railing was a little wobbly and very small. SUNBLOCK!!!! We reapplied but kids still got burned first day, the cool wind is very tricky, you don't realize how intense the sun is, we ended up reapplying every 30 mins to make sure. KIDS ACTIVITIES: The kids club (drop off club) was not open and did not get clear answer on what dates is was open, they do have an arcade and an area to play in the arcade. There is a trampoline in the ocean - must be able to swim well to get there, also a climbing iceberg. My 10 year old loved these. He loved to snorkle so it was fun for him, perfect beach for little ones, my 3 yr old had a blast making castles and the water is calm for her to splash around in. Pools were awesome! The paddle boats and water riders are $25 per 1/2hr. To much for us, but looked fun. Kids can feed fish off pier, there are swans, and peacocks, and coi fish near Lemongrass rest. On the website it offered 4 hrs of Nanny Service with package, glad i printed that off cause they said they no longer offer this, but did honor cause i had a copy of it. Nanny service is safe, but that's about it (she managed to rent 5 ppv movies w/in 4 hrs???? - concierge actually took 3 of the movies off our bill - which was very nice. (Nanny service is $25 per hour w/4 hr min) DINING - was good. Lemongrass was good. All others were awesome, Breakfast did run us $60 every morning until we found the Subway across the street and had breakfast that was good for $16. I suggest taking the kids across the street to subway for lunch a couple days and or am. Also, this sounds stupid but also take them to the liquor store across the street, it has soda, candy, chips, etc half the price of the hotel - we made daily trips there. Mortons Steak house was $300 for our dinner! and my 3 yr old did not order, she had some of mine. Not worth the money, was very good though, but your on vaca so you do what you can :) Kids only eat free and 1/2 price for hot dogs & Chicken fingers at the grill, and for breakfast. You pay full price everywhere else and they dont have kids menus at morton's, hence the 300 bill :) SERVICE - Very good, all were accommodating to kids and always friendly to us. **Take bus during day, only 3 min walk to stop and 50cents, but they dont take dollars must have change - it is safe ** Parrot club in Old San Juan was good dinner with kids **Cafe Puerto Rico in Old San Juan was awesome for lunch! **Domino's does deliver to Hilton :) Still $30 but that's cheap dinner there **Breakfast Avg - $60 **Lunch Avg - $60-80 **Dinner Avg - $80+ (norm was $120) I wanted to see more of Puerto Rico but all the kids wanted was beach and pool, so that is all we did. And i was ok with that, this trip was for them (their 1st plane ride also). Did not do any excursions, it was an hour ride away to get to boat docks, not up for that with the kids. They did not care anyway. Overall, was great time, would not return. Not because of Hotel or Hilton, but we would rather do an all-inlcusive somewhere else. All-inlcusive would be more budget friendly with kids. My husband travels everyweek and we have been to all inclusives so we do know what to expect from resorts and hotels, this was a very nice hotel overall just very expensive, but we knew that going into it :) Happy Travels!", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful experience--just not a bargain!\u201d", "Author": "lebelgo", "ReviewID": "UR27880740", "Content": "I rarely spend this much on a hotel, but we'd thought we'd splurge for a night of relaxing by the beach after our Caribbean cruise. I'm a Hilton HHonors Gold member, and reserved a standard ocean-view room, and received an ocean-view room from the new tower. The hotel consists of three parts: the old tower built in 1949, the new tower, and the time-share suites in a more secluded part of the hotel past the garden and duck ponds. I have to say this hotel really wowed me. It's a visual feast, almost on par with the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island (and unlike the Big Island's Hilton, the pool here is heated). Unlike most of Puerto Rico's beaches, which are public by law, this beach is man-made and private. There is a breakwater to keep the water calm and safe for the children, but I didn't find it made the water stagnant, unlike what other reviewers felt. The lobby was beautiful, with macaws and free fruit punch. The beach was beautiful, and there was a trampoline and \"iceberg\" in the water, which was harder to climb than it looks (I only made it half-way up, and I'm not fat). The drinks and pool-side food were not that expensive by luxury beach hotel standards. The mixed drinks were $10, including a Coco Loco made with 151-proof rum which will knock your socks off. We got a turkey wrap with fries for about $7--enough to share. The main pool is also beautiful, with a mini waterfall, and a wade-up bar. There is a pretty little garden with a duck pond, amply filled with blue dye for some reason (the swans' bellies were blue due to the dye). There are also a couple of peacocks and geese wandering in the area, as well as a centuries-old fort which is currently closed to the public, but nice to look at from the beach or rooms. Our room on the 13th floor was beautiful, with a nice balcony where we could sit in the evening sipping beers and watching the cruise ships leave for the eastern Caribbean. On our floor, we were a little too low to see over the old tower to the hotel beach, but we did have a good view of Condado, the fort, and the Conrad Hilton's beach. I had the sense that our place was nicer, although I have to say that I haven't stayed at the Conrad. I think one would have to be at least on the 15th floor to see over the old tower to this hotel's beach. The room was REALLY quiet--I didn't hear a peep from any neighbors--above, below, or to the side. The location is rather good in that it's within walking distance of both the Condado area and Old San Juan (about a mile or so in either direction). Although it's a bit of a walk, there are tons of great places to eat in either Condado or old San Juan, so we didn't eat at the hotel (except the free Continental breakfast buffet for Gold members). My only two complaints were fairly minor: (1) the drink/snack service to the beach was very infrequent--I don't know why, since I'm sure she earned plenty in tips, and (2) I wish they had made a bit of an effort to have our room ready by 3 PM, when we checked in at 10 AM. Yes, I realize they have until 3 PM to get our room ready, but since they knew we were there, they could have called housekeeping to ask them to speed things up. Well, with the resort fee, taxes, and internet, it came to over $300 for the night, which is quite pricey. That being said, I really like the place.", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGood for Families\u201d", "Author": "beefsterNY", "ReviewID": "UR27544241", "Content": "Just returned from a relaxing stay at the Caribe Hilton. It's not the most beautiful beach on the island because it's man made, but it serves its purpose. There were plenty of beach chairs and loved that they drilled the umbrellas into the sand where you ask. Traveling with a 3-month old, I was worried that we would have to fight to find shade, but that wasn't the case. There were also a lot of different nooks to relax. It seemed that families with young children stayed on the beach, the college crowd hung out on the round dock and everybody else was pool or jetty side. I could see that as a plus if you're traveling with a large group and wanted to get some quiet time. Loved that kids under 12 eat free -- although the food isn't that good and way over priced as everyone has mentioned in their reviews. However, there is a free pina colada tasting at 1:00pm at the pool bar every day. If you don't mind virgins, they let you take as many as you want in tiny cups. Perfect size for the kids. Our room was okay. We booked a standard with points then upgraded to the junior suite upon arrival. The standard was just way too small for 2 adults, a 3-year old and a 3-month old. I saw in another review that the outlet in their wall was falling out with wires exposed. That was the case in our room as well. Wasn't too happy with housekeeping. They literally just made the bed and neglected to do turndown completely. One big plus ... the night we arrived our 3-year old woke in the middle of the night with a double ear infection. We called the front desk and they had a doctor in our room by 9:30 the next morning. We could have gotten a prescription from our home doctor, but it was good to have someone actually confirm the infection.

I must admit that I was not expecting much after reading the other reviews on Tripadvisor. I completely agree with most of the other reviews. The hotel is lovely, but in need of some updating. Most of the negatives are out of the hotel's control. It is within walking distance of Old San Juan, though we always took the public bus home after dark (50 cents) which dropped us off right behind our hotel. It is also close to the airport but not so close that the planes bother you. First of all, do not let them book you into the Condado Lagoon Villas. These are tired, worn out and dirty time share units that are far from the main complex, beach and pool. After seeing two of the units, I requested a regular hotel room in the Tower and was much happier. Our room on the ninth floor was large, clean and had a very modern updated marble walk in shower, but no bath. It had a view of the lagoon and the fort, but also overlooked the roof of the building below. Maid service was prompt and good. Room service was expensive, but delicious. We ordered off the \"kids menu\" and the portions were fine for adults. We did not eat at any of the hotel's restaurants as they were very expensive, but did get sandwiches and bagels daily at the Starbucks in the lobby. We also found two very good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel--Atlantico and Escabron--which was right on the public beach. The concierge and the travel agents were very helpful with directions and excursions. We did kayaking in the Biobay with Island Kayak Adventures and Zip-lining in the rainforest with Ecoquest. The private beach was bigger than expected but not very clean. Lots of garbage in the water, including a used condom floating by!!! There is some snorkeling along the breakwater which had a nice variety of fish. The pool was nice and clean but cold. The hot tubs were also too cold to sit in for long at night. The gardens were lovely and well maintained. There is a nice gym and mini golf for the kids. Daily activities were posted but not well attended. There was absolutely no nightlife, and only one small bar in the lobby. If you wanted dancing or gambling you had to take a taxi elsewhere.

The hotel was great for the price we paid ($100 a night on priceline). Experience broken down below: Check in - a breeze. we arrived at the hotel around 12:30PM and were given a room immediately. we did need to change though because we need a king room, but it was very simple and they sent the bellman to help us move our luggage. the room - a little better than expected. we stayed in the tower section, which is furthest away from the beach and pools. that section seemed reserved mostly for business travelers. every room has a balcony, and we had a great view of the ocean. the 24 hour sound of the waves is amazing. had a flat screen TV. comfortable bed (though a little too soft for my taste). fine sheets, blanket and pillows. bathroom was a stand up shower with a rainshower head and completely tiled in travertine. very nice. loved showering in there. i never take baths a hotels, so not having a tub was no big deal. dual sinks was nice too (we could brush at the same time). the beach - easy access but because on an inlet, the water seemed stagnant. huge waves, but they didn't reach the beach because of the rock barrier. brown sand. we didn't go in the water here at all. tons of chairs. beach was empty most of the time. the pools - there is one giant pool with two levels and another smaller adult pool by the villas. there are also two kiddy pools, one near each adult pool, but the kiddy pool by the main pool seemed dirty. we used the kiddy pool by the villas which was much cleaner. the adult pool by the villas was deeper at 4.5 feet than the main pool (3.5 ft.). water is cold, but you get used to it really fast. tons of lounge chairs. hotel restaurants - we only ate at Palmeras for our breakfasts (buffet $25 p/p) and had one dinner at Lemongrass. The breakfast buffet was adequate and had everything you'd expect: hot breakfast items, cooked to order eggs, pastries, fresh fruit, cereal, fresh fruit juices (including mango, yum), cold meats/cheeses, breads, yogurt, and even champagne. Lemongrass was a bit pricey. the location in the tropical gardens was beautiful though and the restaurant is very stylish and high end. we had two drinks, one appetizer, one sushi roll, one entree and one dessert and the total was $140 (incl tax/tip), but the food/drinks were delicious. also starbucks in the lobby was wonderful. the coffee there was perfect every time, and the pastries/sandwiches were great. the rest of hotel - many touristy shops in the hotel, one that carried lots of drug store items if in a bind (everything double price, but that's expected for a hotel store). also carried kiddy water toys, which is also great if you forget to bring some. the tropical gardens were very nice. i don't know why they color the water to look like windex though. i felt bad for the swans whose undersides were stained blue from swimming in it. i'm sure it's non toxic, but still, why the need to color the water? lobby area was nice and always lots of people coming in and out. lobby had a nice buzz. starbucks on site was huge. we're coffee drinkers and stopped by here twice a day. a hot latte after a cold swim in the pool was the best. hotel staff - all very nice and accommodating. i tried to discreetly tip second check in agent when we asked to change rooms, but he declined and seemed kind of offended. i felt weird though since he changed our room no problem anyway and said that was not necessary. didn't mean to offend. **money saving tip** - we did not rent a car and used taxis every day to get to/from the hotel. ask the drivers YOURSELF BEFORE getting in what the cost will be. several times when taking taxis from the hotel, we asked the person hailing the cars what the cost was (standard for to/from zones) and when we arrived the driver charged us more. even though from the hotel to old san juan was to cost $10 (very quick ride), we were often charged $12 or $14. it's not huge, but it does add up, and i hate feeling taken like i was overcharged because i looked like a \"stupid tourist.\" whenever we asked up front, the charge was always $10. **recommended catamaran day trip** - use Salty Dog (yeah, i love the name too)! we asked the person near the concierge desk for information on the catamaran trips to culebra or iacos and they kept aggressively pushing two charters. the person at the desk does NOT work for the hotel, and receives a commission from those two companies (damn, i can't remember the names, but you'll see when you go there). they act like they are a part of the concierge desk, but they are not. i remember now that spread eagle was one of the ones they were pushing and that boat was PACKED (we saw them when we took our trip on salty dog). it looked like standing room only on that boat...soooo glad we didn't use them. the lobby has $5 coupons for salty dog, and they were one of the most reasonably priced day trips. we were treated fabulously on the boat. great food, drinks, music, and NOT too crowed. the snorkeling area was fantastic and we saw lots of fish before even getting off the boat. do this trip! it's totally worth it and was the highlight of our trip (and esp our 2.5 year old's)! other restaurants - DO NOT GO TO Escambron Beach Club for dinner. though it looks like it in the brochures, it's not a regular restaurant. it's a wedding/conference venue and it was soooo weird to sit in that HUGE space having dinner practically by ourselves. go to Raices, Aqua Vida, YuerbaBuena. we ate at Mojito's one night, but were not impressed. there are lots of restaurants in Old San Juan near Raices if you can't get in that one, so walk around.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommend this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Ollie12", "ReviewID": "UR26577311", "Content": "My family and I were extremely happy and impressed with this hotel.

Overall, it was a nice experience. As a Hilton Gold member, we were upgraded to a Villa Suite. The Villa section is a bit of a hike from the front desk, but very nice with it's own pool and hot tub. The rooms are nicely laid out with good amenities. Okay, here are the good things about the Caribe Hilton: The Beach - a beautiful sandy beach, warm ocean water with enough chairs for all of the guests. The Pools: large, lots of chairs. The Hammocks: lots well laid out for privacy. (Frankly, pretty much everything outisde of the hotel was top notch. The grounds, pools, etc., were all great) The Hotel: friendly staff, nice number of shops (including a little sundries store), easy to find front desk/concierge. Tourist stuff: Close to Old San Juan, easy drive to rain forest and airport. Here's the down side: The food. Very expensive and not very good (the $20 hamburger was not better than Burger King). Especially room service. Food over cooked, not very flavorful and of limited variety. Most of the restaurants open at night are \"dress up\" restaurants. If you want some local flavor, you need to go to Old San Juan or the Condado. Fortunately, these are not too far away. Lobby gets really busy and noisy at night. Construction on the new hotel next door and the bridge across the lagoon was loud and could be pretty annoying (like driving pilings for the bridge at 2AM). Internet went down for two days - not their fault but still annoying. Hot tubs were not much warmer than the swimming pools. One restaurant recommendation is Panza in Old San Juan.

With the bad economy we decided to give the Caribe a try. We booked the SPRING BREAK rate which includes breakfast (tip #1, ALWAYS book the room that includes the hot breakfast even if your gold or diamond, its worth it over the \"free\" breakfast.) The resort is very easy on the eyes, the lobby still shows that this Hilton was once the Queen of the company. We didn't experience any of the service problems with check-in (perhaps because of my status). We booked into a King Villa -- the Villas are in the hotel/condo building at the far \"right\" of the property as you face the ocean. They are slightly larger than the standard king rooms in the main building, and have a full kitchen, larger dining table, and better balcony furniture. Alas, Hilton no longer upgrades from these villas to larger villas, but for two people it was perfect. The beach is very nice, it was uncrowded (even though the hotel was 98% full), however beach services were slow to non-existent (drinks, mists, relocation of shade, etc). We did not use the SPA or even the main pool. Onto the food! As I mentioned, get the hot breakfast with your rate... its $25.00 per person + tax and tip -- for two people you save around $50.00 a day... In our case, our rate was \"lower\" than the standard rate AND included breakfast. Since we usually stay at upscale properties, the prices were actually pretty much inline with what you would expect at at Four Seasons, Ritz, etc. The problem in my opinion is the quality and service -- no one wants to eat a $20.00 lunch of chicken tenders and a drink out of a plastic container (sides are extra). Our advise is to skip lunch AND dinner at the hotel and head out. The subway across the street is perfect for the lunch time snack, and you can pick up a six-pack of soda for the price of one at the resort at the store just up the street from the subway. For dinner, ask for directions to the newly named Conrad Condado Plaza Hotel & Casino San Juan Puerto... its a easy walk (save the money on the over priced taxis). If you feel the urge to gamble go into the Casino, if not, walk PAST the hotel entrance until you come to a series of restaurants... the Cuban / Puerto Rican fusion place on the left is excellent.

The view from the balcony was excellent and the sound of the ocean was refreshing - except when the fans from the ventilation units on the roof below were going. The in-room safe was large and easy to use. The rooms were cleaned well, but had an irritant seen all too often, sheets too short for the bed. The beach is protected from the waves by a sea wall, which is good or bad depending on your perspective. But, it was clean and well maintained, as were the nice pools. We really enjoyed the large hammocks, large beds, and traditional recliners near the pools and ocean. We'd never seen anything like the beds and thought them a great touch. As noted in some other reviews, the prices of adjacent restaurants and shops are very high - Starbucks' prices were about twice as high as at their airport location. The nearby Subway provides some relief from this, and one can always walk a ways or take a bus or taxi to old San Juan or Condado. Internet service was expensive, but fairly typical for city Hilton's: about $15 per day wired in the room or on the Hilton wireless in the lobby. But, you could use the Starbuck's wireless in the lobby for free (called \"Centennial\" or something like that) so forget the Hilton connection and fee.

I also didn't like how they charge a resort fee; however you have to pay to rent the kayaks or paddle boats, and it was very expensive to do.

We bought milk, a hunk of cheese, crackers, a gallon of water, and 2 bottles of wine at the little store across from the hotel entrance on our first day and that prob saved us a couple hundrd dollars i figure. We had our appetizer and cocktails before we went to dinner and it was so relaxing! Be sure to walk a few doorsdown from the Subway to the store there - it has a better selection than the liquore store mart you'll see first. As many others have mentioned the Subway is also a great spot to save on a few meals. The breakfasts are really cheap! We also loved the Oasis Spa grill at the health club and the prices were much cheaper over there. We had a chicken salad wrap that was out of this world and the breakfast was also amazing. Everything is made so healthy too. A word of thanks to Jose at the pool bar. I recently had gastric bypass surgery and have to keep my sugar intake very low. I wanted a margarita but was afraid of the sugar in the pre mixed stuff. I told him my situation and he happily squeezed fresh limes for me then added some splenda, tequila and voila....it was delicious! He made my trip and I was so grateful.

It was great for walking around for a few hours, mostly tacky touristy shops but we found a gorgeous street with high end stores and the best was this place El Convent, a hotel with some great tapas restaurant. Be sure to go for lunch and sit in the open courtyard- it is beautiful. The church across the street is also really nice and if you walk down to the water across from the church- you will find a National Historic site, a nice walk on the water around the old walls that surround the city. Overall it as one of the best hotes we have ever stayed at and we will definitely be back. We would bring our son next time- he is 4 and would have loved the parrots in the lobby, the swans and turtles and ducks in the tropical garden, feeding the fish, the playground, hammocks, and Kids Klub.

The negatives are divided into things which didn't really bother me and things that did. Pros: 1. How bad can sitting on a balcony in 80 degree weather, overlooking the Caribbean be? 2. The staff was friendly if not super efficient. The bartender at the pool really does know how to make a good cocktail. 3. The pool and beach are nice. Not as nice as some other beaches (e.g. Luquillo) I've seen but, again, how bad can 84 degree water in January be? 4. There are some wonderful restaurants relatively nearby. The liquor store across the street is good for most drinks and snacks. 5. The complaints of paying $12 for a cab ride to old San Juan or most locations in San Juan seem silly to me. When is the last time you were able to take a cab for $12 in New York, L.A. or any other big city? Cons: Things that might bother some people: 1. I stayed in the Hhonors Towers 18th floor. There is some sort of hallway nearby where carts are being pushed all day and night. This noise didn't bother me as I am a sound sleeper but might bother you. 2. The air conditioner made a loud clunking noise when it cycled on and off. I slept through it. 3. The room decor is a little dated but the room was clean and comfortable. Things that bothered me: 1. My shower door, I suspect, was installed backwards, requiring me to scrunch up in the corner of the shower against the cold stone wall to get in out out. 2. The toilet had a slow leak in the floor gasket which created a very slow trickle of water. This was easily dealt with by placing a towel at the base of the toilet. I reported this to the front desk and was told someone would be up to take a look. Nobody ever showed up. I did not call back or ask for another room but I shouldn't have to. If I go back to San Juan I will likely look at and probably stay at a different hotel but if my business sends me back to the Caribe Hilton I will be very happy. A few restaurants you may like are: Bonbanera in old SJ on San Francisco street. The locals go there for breakfast. Try the Mallorcas. Panaderia Espana Reposteria is a great cafe and bakery. Locals eat there. Our cab driver took us there for a late night snack. Great coffee too. La Fonda del Jibarito 270 Sol St. Old San Juan. I didn't eat here but one of our fellow travelers who is a native of Puerto Rico recommends it highly. It is also reviewed elsewhere on this site. Likewise a restaurant called Picayo. I also agree with other members that seeing the old forts is worthwhile. Take the tour at San Cristobal. When you buy tickets for admission you can get a combo ticket for both forts. I recommend seeing both but you have to really like forts to fully enjoy both. You may want to see just one or the other.

To be sure, The Caribe Hilton has advantages no other San Juan hotel enjoys. Since it was one of the first resorts on the island--the main building dates from 1949--it has an incomparable location, spreading out over 17 beachfront acres halfway between Condado and Old San Juan. 60 years later, the city has largely grown up around the property, so the beach, pool area, and park complete with a fort, is even more notable given the surrounding congestion. The main building, situated to enjoy ocean balcony views from nearly every room, connects to a later tower with a large open air lobby-cum- shopping mall; the tower also enjoys waterviews from most accommodations, though the number of roofs and loading docks may make that vistas less than postcard. The hotel's bars and restaurants are numerous, and most surround this lobby area. There is even a Starbucks. I am a Hilton HHonors Gold member and I used points for my stay. It took me three rooms to get what was appropriate accommodations. My first room had two beds--I'd requested one king--and the second room had the doors ripped off the armoire; just the hinges remained. These two were in the main building--the third one was on the 11th floor of the tower. While I remained in this one--and in my opinion, it was nicer than the other two--upkeep issues are apparent all over the hotel, and in a number of cases, the decor is a bit dated. One notable difference between the main building rooms and the tower rooms is in the bathroom. The main building, dating from 1949, has very standard bathrooms, now updated to include curved shower rods, whereas the tower rooms have only showers--but very nice ones. Still my shower head was duct taped in place. Guests here get used to such makeshift remedies. The emergency exit door in the hallway opposite my room had peeling paint, and the carpet in my room was stained--as was the lampshade. Beds throughout the hotel are very nice--quite cushy--and the bedroom portion of the tower rooms is smaller than the bedrooms of the main building. Your resort fee--14% of your rate, so a $300 per night room for five nights will cost an additional $210--includes two in-room coffee bags. I asked twice for decaf to be delivered--it never came. The resort fee also includes the fitness center--nice, but usually crowded--beach towels, and a few other things that might prompt you to ask what you are paying for in your room rate. The hotel's beach, a likely man-made comma of graham cracker-colored sand, is quite popular, and the hotel does a nice job of creating a comfortable place for sunbathing around its crescent. It is customary for Gold and Platinum HHonors members to get complimentary internet and breakfast. Such guests here get both, but with a catch. You must visit the ninth floor lounge in the main building to access wifi--not supremely convenient for a guest in the tower. And the breakfast for HHonors members is a special continental breakfast buffet in an otherwise closed Italian restaurant. If your idea of a tropical getaway includes a lavish breakfast outside by the pool or beach...well, the hotel's \"most valued\" guests aren't treated to that. The breakfast area is windowless, and capped by a cracked skylight. The spread is carb-heavy...and not particularly well restocked. The room itself is made even more depressing by inattention to detail...the second day I was there, half the tables had had their tablecloths removed to expose bare, unvarnished wood. Better still, the staff was using paper placemats over again, so the previous guest's coffee stain was on the mat you got to reuse. Coffee comes out of a machine like those you might find in a college dorm's dining hall, and a jar of peanut butter--half used, with a butter knife standing upright was among the only protein on the buffet...not even yogurt was a part of the morning menu for this \"special\" breakfast. Even for free, this was just too much--so I had breakfast in the restaurant the other mornings...the buffet there, with tip, is $30 a person. For the record, that is a nice spread. The staff overall wasn't hostile, but you aren't likely to confuse them with any Nordstrom help, either. In fairness, I brought a number of these issues up with the management --the hotel manager bought me breakfast two mornings, and re-credited my account with one of four nights' worth of points. What he didn't do, and really couldn't, is renovate a hotel that was last redone 9 years ago in 2000, or even make the repairs that would paint doors, fix ceiling stains, or touch-up caulk in the bathtub. If you are considering this hotel, ask whether such inattention to detail is worth $300 a night plus a $42 resort fee (though in fairness, this hotel is also available with some frequency on Priceline at very advantageous rates--I've seen $85 a night in season, in fact. And yes, at $85 I could overlook these lapses...) Will be interesting to see if other competition makes things a bit better here. The newly renovated 1958 La Concha, down Condado Beach from the Caribe Hilton, sports stunning public areas and a new parkside setting--and seems to be trying harder, if such appearances are any indication. For now, unless you are getting a screaming Priceline deal, or have mega-points to burn, best to wait until the planned 2010 renovation is done. It will be great, for sure. Right now, however, it is just an unfortunate shell of what this once-glamorous resort once was. . .", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cHold onto your belongings...\u201d", "Author": "travellingedna", "ReviewID": "UR23729031", "Content": "After spending two weeks at the Caribe Hilton this January on business I can say I've seen all aspects that the hotel has to offer and I have to say, I was highly disappointed.

Also,word to the wise... if you stay there for over a week they will charge your card without contacting you. The rooms are very standard, not what you would think was worth the extra cost. We ended up switching rooms three times only to find that there was really no difference between any of them from the villas to the tower. One plus would be the front desk staff, they were all very helpful and always went above and beyond to find us answers. And now for the bad. There is absolutely no security at this hotel, we had three bags stolen while we were at the pool. There were no cameras in the facility to help find the people who were to blame, and no one manning the front pool area to make sure that only hotel guests came in. The property boasts a private pool and beach but it is generally inhabited with non-guests day in and day out. The worst part of the stay was how the Hilton handled the theft, this resulted in buying us room service at 11:30 p.m. after we were forced to switch rooms once again. The meal that we got from room service did not make up for the hundreds of dollars lost due to their lacking security. My personal dish was cold. I would not recommend staying here to anyone that likes security. You can just stay anywhere else and use the facilities as it seems everyone else on the island does.

Our university booked the students as part of this program in a locally owned hotel in Condado, but we felt we'd be much safer at the Caribe Hilton and chose to pay extra to stay there instead. Unfortunately, we learned a lesson the hard way. The third evening of our stay, my wallet and my 2 friends' purses were stolen from the pool area with us just 10 feet away. The hotel security guards claimed this sort of thing \"never happens\" there, but we have a very hard time believing that when there were no security cameras and absolutely anyone is allowed in the pool area. Our belongings were stolen within minutes because we made the mistake of allowing ourselves to feel safe at this expensive hotel. Hotel security was very cooperative and nice and did what they could to \"lessen the blow\" of having our items stolen. By the next evening, hotel security had retrieved our belongings, minus the cash, medications, cell phone and cameras (basically anything someone could quickly sell). However, cooperation aside, this event made us hyper-aware of the lack of security at the hotel for the rest of our stay. ANYONE, and I mean ANYONE can walk right through the lobby, into the pool area, take a towel, and stay for the day. Only ONCE in TWO WHOLE WEEKS were we asked to show a room key to enter the pool area, and it was the morning we were checking out to go outside and take a few last minute photos!!! One afternoon, there were several shady-looking local adolescents at the hotel (who were very obviously NOT guests) hanging around the pool area, scoping out everyone and their belongings. PLEASE, if you stay here, WATCH YOUR STUFF!! Better yet, don't bring anything to the pool. The hotel security guard slipped and said people get their cameras and cell phones stolen all the time from the pool (after he already told us this sort of thing \"never happens\". Riiiiight). Another disturbing incident happened one evening when we returned to the room and none of our room keys were working. I called the front desk from the lobby of our building (the Towers) and they said they would send a bellman up with new room keys. That's it! They didn't ask my name, didn't ask me to come to the front desk to verify who I was or where we were staying. They just -- in blind faith -- sent someone over with new room keys to let us in. They didn't even know who we were or if it was our room. Again, ANYONE could have gotten in our room!!! SCARY!!! This was my 4th trip to Puerto Rico and I would NEVER EVER stay at the Caribe Hilton ever again. I have been a travel agent for 12 years, stayed at resorts all over the Caribbean and have never experienced less security in a facility in my life.

Complete Rip Off\u201d", "Author": "IslandFlyer1", "ReviewID": "UR23633989", "Content": "Let me just preface this review by stating that I booked this trip extremely last minute through priceline.com. And thank god I did, because had I paid the rack rate at this resort I would have been one unhappy individual. Having flown in from JFK on January 11th, through the snow and rain which pummeled the Northeast region, we finally arrived in San Juan after countless hours of flying and delays. However, upon initial views of the resort it looked amazing... to be exact it looked something out of a magazine promoting South Beach. Now we checked in at about 11pm, and let me tell you the agent who was checking us in was COMPLETELY and UTTERLY rude, without question. She assigned us a room in the tower, which was what I had requested she NOT do. She continued to give me an attitude stating the resort was at full occupancy and then continued to tell me to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deal with it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Well, I obliged and went up to our room. Mind you at first view, it seemed stunning until you saw the 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motif bathroom and countless stained carpeting, along with an odd caddy-cornered balcony. Which led to my immediate call to the front desk manager, who changed my room immediately (thank you, blade). He also let me know that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was only at 20% occupancy and it would not be a problem, only proving that the agent who had checked me in was only worried about one thing, and that is what most people at this resort and on this island are worried about which is their plans for that evening or congregating with their co-workers to chat and ignore customers. Now after they placed us in the Condado Lagoon Villas, which was an adequate room if the lighting in the bathroom did not have to be changed because they were inoperable, along with fixing the phone because we got no dial tone as well as the lack of internet availability in the room. All in all, this proves to be one of those Hilton hotels which IS NOT kept up well. The pool chairs were ancient looking with straps falling off and the cushions having a brown/black tinge to them. After complaining to the pool crew, we were told they were new and made aware of an apparent $600 million dollar renovation. On which I had no comment because the pools were dirty, the chairs were dirty, the beach was rocky, dirty and not raked once while we were there. This leads me to my next gripe which is the apparent resort fee to use the facilities. Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this fee supposed to be disclosed to you at check in? Well this was another aspect that my inadequate check in agent neglected to go over. The resort fee is 14% nightly according to your room rate and apparently is used to take care of the beach, pool towels, etc. Which if such a fee was being charged I would expect clean pool chair cushions, a raked beach without ketchup packets, magazine inserts, as well as cups and silverware from ordered lunches. Perhaps I would even expect towels which aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t torn and thinner than a t-shirt. The resort had many restaurants which are overpriced and inadequate so much so that we had ordered room service on multiple occasions and had one of the people in our party get sick because of the breakfast ordered one day. I called and spoke to the front desk manager about it and was told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no one else got sick\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd essentially blaming it on one of us. At any rate, this is a three star hotel at best, and for the $600 million dollar renovation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where the money went because this place should be torn down and rebuilt. Or this money should be better spent on up keeping this property simply said. I would NOT choose to stay at this property if it was offered to me for free, the facilities are dated, the restaurants were decent at best, the staff was completely and utterly rude, and the only bright spot of our trip was our tan and the best housekeeping staff in the hospitality industry. If you want to have a great stay on the Island of Puerto Rico, visit the Wyndham Rio Mar, or wait for the Ritz Carlton Dorado Beach to open next year. It is suppose to take place of the two Hyatt resorts in Dorado and bring true luxury to Puerto Rico. And if your looking to stay in Condado stay at the La Concha or the Condado Plaza.

The room my husband and I checked into in the main building was updated, however, the lock on our balcony door was not functioning. Rather than fix the lock, we were offered another room on a lower floor. We were advised to take a look at the room before moving into it. The room overlooked the top of another building and the tile in the bathroom was moldy, so we requested another room. We were told that the only available rooms were in the hotel tower and that those rooms were nicer. We accepted a room on the 7th floor of the tower, the level was for Hilton Honors members. The room itself wasn't that bad at first glace. The woodwork was updated, flat screened television, our view was of the parking ramp and we could barely see the ocean, but it was still better than the view of the top of the building. The bathroom at first glace was nicely updated with a tiled shower and glass door. Double sinks with a sitting area. Unfortunately, the wall above the toilet had mold stains and had a slightly musty moist odor. I mentioned this to the front desk staff, but they didn't seem to care. The bed and bath linens were dingy and stained. The carpet was weathered. A bit of cleaning could have easily rid the walls of mold. A bit of bleach could have brightened the linens. I was a bit bothered by the staff's lack of concern for the upkeep of the rooms. The room my sister and mother stayed in had a better view of the ocean. It didn't have a moldy bathroom, however, the bathroom door itself was very weathered and it appeared as though the wood was peeling off. The sheets on one of the beds was dingy and stained. My sister requested new linens. Housekeeping came with an attitude and changed the linens. The new linens were also dingy and had very visible black stains, yet the staff member didn't seem to notice and quickly left the room. My sister later found the location of the housekeeping linens and replaced the sheet herself. The location is right on the beach and has a nice pool area. The beds are comfortable, classic Hilton style. The drinks were a bit overpriced; $12 for a mojito. There are several restaurants on site, but quite pricey as well.

All in all, there wasn't anything worthy of major complaints, and there wasn't anything worthy of major praise. Plusses: - Beach and pool areas were nice, and though crowded, we were able to carve out an area for the two of us every day we sought to. - Staff was generally friendly, particularly the guys running the comp breakfast (for HHonors Gold & Platinum VIPs only) at the main restaurant. - Our room, located in the main building (not the tower) with a small balcony and ocean view, was clean and comfortable if slightly dated. - Concierge desk was helpful for local restaurants and getting around. - The comp breakfast at that restaurant (noted above), which normally goes for $18 pp, was solid and a good way to start the day. Not an amazing spread, but adequate and really satisfying if you're getting it for free. - The on-site Hertz makes renting cars easy, and we only paid $78 (all in) per day during a peak time. We were also able to return at the airport at no charge, saving a $25 cab ride. - The dollar is still all-mighty in PR (translation: you don't have to exchange money or worry about rates). Minuses: - Property is not central to anything. It's not far from the airport or Old San Juan, but it's certainly not walkable to anything particularly worthwhile (I know because I ventured out by foot my first day, wandering into a pretty shady neighborhood where I was warned by a fellow gringo to not be walking there, and this was at 3 in the afternoon). - There are two small shops just off the property, both offering a limited selection of basic supplies (beer, liquor, sodas, chips, etc.) at inflated prices. Still a better deal than the hotel, but it would be nice if there were more selections nearby. - As far as we could tell, there are no restaurant or bar options near the property, which was unfortunate when coming back at night hoping for a late bite or nightcap. - Everything at the property is, as other reviewers say, over-priced. This is a direct result of the notes above about nothing else being nearby. Light sandwiches, drinks at the bar, internet time, massages at the spa-- all cost more than they should have, probably contributing to ill-will among some guests. So much for \"being hospitable\" or \"travel taking you places\" (or maybe travel should take you into debt?). - The hallway leading to our room on the 5th floor was absurdly cold, to the point we would jog between the room and the elevator. - The actual swimming pools aren't that large, so don't expect to get your laps in or anything. - The hotel hosts a few separate New Years Eve bashes, which turned the place into a bit of a zoo. It didn't really affect us, although we could hear one party thumping well into the morning, but I suspect it ruined the night of some guests. - While the concierge desk was helpful, on the first night (12/28) we were told by both the concierge and the bellman that taxis to Old San Juan would be charging double the normal rate (from like $12.50 to $25) because traffic was so bad. This didn't happen any other night, and when we mentioned this to another, apparently higher-ranking member of the staff a few nights later on New Year's Eve, he gave a puzzled look and said that couldn't be the case and that the taxi drivers must have been up to something. When we told him the concierge and the bellman both told us this before getting a taxi, he seemed to be more concerned and confused by why this happened. So I think there could have been something shady going on there, and the staff might have been a part of it, which is very disturbing if true. General Comments: - In Puerto Rico, like most other places where tourists flock, there will be shadiness among the locals to make money off the tourists. So just be wise to what seems weird (like, say, taxis charging double on a random Sunday night). - Depending on what you're vacationing for, it's either a pro or a con, but the hotel was packed with families and kids. Happily, I didn't witness much misbehavior among the kids, but if you're not into hearing or seeing kids, this isn't the place for you (at least not at a peak time). - Yes, everything at the hotel is over-priced, just like at every hotel I've ever stayed at. But if your goal on a vacation is to never leave the hotel, while I can't relate, perhaps you should look into all-inclusive options elsewhere. - As noted, the Hertz on premises (in addition to the PayLess Rental Car directly across the street) make day trips to El Yunque, Luquillo and Fajardo (or all three, which we did in a day), extremely accessible. For the $120 you might spend in a day at the hotel pool on sandwiches, drinks and activities for the family, you can rent a car, see/hike the rainforest, sit on a much less crowded beach and eat cheap local food (or stop by a real grocery store and pack a picnic lunch, as I was advised to do by one of the concierges). Something to think about. - Full disclosure, I used HHonors points for the stay, so it made high-end dinners in Old San Juan and taxi rides less of an issue in terms of overall cost of the vacation.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ventura, CA", "Title": "\u201cCaribe Hilton good location/value for couples & families\u201d", "Author": "SoCalBC", "ReviewID": "UR23268277", "Content": "My wife & I stayed at the Caribe Hilton for 2 days & 1 night prior to taking a cruise.

The service at the beach was the usual food service- My burger was $15 but it came out quickly. The inflatable rafts are a bit steep, but they do have a huge inflatable trampoline out in the water that is free for everyone to use. The beach is in a small lagoon type setting, and the waves aren't anything like you would see on the U.S. Atlantic Coast, but there are waves and the water is very warm even in December. For the proximity to the hotel, you can't beat it. Always keep your room key on you, as they ask you to show it occasionally to enter the pool/beach walkway as you leave the hotel.

When I made a reservation in a world famous Hilton resort hotel chain, paying a certain amount of money, there was a certain expectation, but this hotel didn't meet my expectation. First Impression: My first impression of this hotel was that it was old and crowded. I saw wear and tear, here and there, although our room in the tower seemed new. Location: The location was good for old San Juan and Ashford Avenue, and about one hour or more one-way driving to the biobay, scuba diving, ferries for Vieques, or El Yunque, which is ok. However, it was not easy to find a market or a restaurant nearby. Room and Tower: Our tower room was nice and new. Our bed throw had black spots here and there, which I strongly suspected as mold, so we never used the throw. Other bedding stuffs were good and comfortable. The bathroom didn't have a bathtub and ventilation, which was a minus, but had a nice shower system with good hot water pressure. No minibar, which translated to a free empty refrigerator. The tower didn't have any security, so anyone from the street could go in and out freely. Also it was a little bit away from the private beach or the swimming pool. Beach and Swimming area: The swimming pool was OK but didn't look as good as other resort hotels' pools I visited including other Hiltons although it didn't matter for me because I spent time not in the pool but on the beach. The private beach was good and safe for children as it was protected by a breakwater or something. There were some floating things to climb up and enjoy, and a sunbathing balcony on the sea. Although it was crowded, we had a good time on the beach. Food: Everything is overpriced. One bottle of Bud Light will cost you $8+tax+tips. A McDonald quality hamburger was $13+tax+tips at a bar, and it was the cheapest snack you can get in the hotel except Starbucks, which was the only place with reasonable prices in this hotel. If the food quality was good, we wouldn't complain about the price because we were on vacation and ready to spend some. However, we didn't want to pay that money for this quality of food, so we always drove out to eat and to shop for the next day's breakfast. BTW, this hotel claims that its pool bar is the birth place of the pina colada. If you want to try it, it is $13+tax+tips. Staff: Most of the staff was friendly and nice except for the front desk manager. The concierge was so helpful, and even house keepers were always smiling although they were not good at English. However, when I was in trouble, the front desk manager was very unhelpful and gave me a why-should-I-be-bothered-about-your-fault attitude. How she neglected me really astounded me. Fee, Parking, Internet, ETC: You need to pay the additional resort fee (about 13 or 14%) even if you already paid for your room. Everything costs you money. I already wrote about the overpriced food. Parking also costs like $15 a day, and the parking garage was not connected to the hotel facilities which was very bad while raining. Internet was also like $15 a day. Although they said the wireless Internet on the lobby was free, we couldn't get the signal at the lobby and ended up paying the money to get the wired access.

The staff we encountered was courteous and professional. The only glitch we had was with our initial room which was a handicapped equipped one with shower. I went back to the main desk and politely asked if we could be moved. We were immediately moved to an ocean front room in the Hilton Towers on the 13th floor with amazing views. The private beach was great and with plenty of chairs and umbrellas and towel services. The pools were very nice. The exercise room we used every day and was one of the better equipped hotel ones I have used. In terms of pricing, it is true the resort is pricey. Internet is $15 if you want it in your room, but free in the lobby. We also stayed away from the restaurants and bar by having breakfast at the Subway (which was much better than the ones in the US. The omeletes were made fresh in front of you.). We ordered carry out Cuban sandwiches and Medallia beers at the local liquor store. The Cuban sandwiches were amazingly good. The liquor store is right across the street and perhaps looks a little seedy on the outside, but it is a family run business. We saw many locals and police eating there. There were the best Cuban sandwiches we ever had. The beer was $1.50 a can and we stocked them in our refrigerator in our room. And, for dinner, we took the bus to Old San Juan. The bus stop is about 3 blocks away and costs 50 cent. We never waited more than 5 minutes for a bus. We took it both ways.

Our room was ready on the sixth floor and we found the room acceptably clean. I had read somewhere that the property had undergone a 90 or so million dollar renovation not that long ago. I don't think they spent it on the rooms. There was a nice view at least. On our return stay, we again arrived around 11am. and proceeded directly to our room, this time on the ninth floor. This time was a bit pricier. We paid $274 a night plus about another $60 in taxes. Ditto on the room condition but the hallway had a rather unpleasant odor. The food prices were a bit extreme with Morton's being the worst. The steaks were good, I'll concede that, but let's not even talk about the $10 baked potato. I don't care how big it is, a potato isn't worth 10 bucks. I found the $15 a glass wine at my local liquor store for $23 for the bottle.

I just like to get something of value in return. On the brighter side, the pool and beach were very nice. The hotel staff was outgoing and helpful. Victor the bartender was exceptionally nice and makes a mean mango colada. The cab rides to and from Old San Juan varied from $12 to $14.

We could see a hotel / casino from our room but when we tried to walk there, we quickly ran out of sidewalk, light and pedestrian traffic and decided to turn back.

The secluded beach is a plus. The forts are beautiful and the pina coladas are by far THE BEST I have ever tasted! We stayed in Room 1665 in the HH Tower, which is a fairly new building and the room was beautiful. My only complaint was the air conditioning made a loud crashing noise every time it turned on and off. It started on our last night there so we didnt bother. I was a little worried about not having any security in the tower since anybody from the street can literally walk in there. Not one person was ever sitting at the front desk, which was odd. At night, the hotel's halls were empty and quiet. Very relaxing atmosphere but if you want to party, I'd strongly suggest El San Juan Resort just a few minutes away. The nightlife there is sizzling. A few tips for those traveling to San Juan and staying at this hotel: book your room on their website using the pre-pay method ... it comes out much cheaper that way. DO NOT eat at Mortons as it is extremely and ridiculously overpriced. Take the bus as it is free until next month and once they do start charging, it's only 50 cents. Taxi rides are expensive and can run you up to $21 for a 12-15 minute cab ride. Walk El Paseo del Morro ... you'll find a dead end at the end of the trail but it is worth it and very beautiful. Rent a car if you plan on going out of the San Juan area, it is much cheaper. There is a Subway around the corner from the hotel. We ate there for lunch almost everyday and they even serve breakfast ... about 70% cheaper than eating at one of the hotel's restaurants. We liked the Spanish restaurant called Madrid-San Juan and we also enjoyed Lemongrass which serves sushi and asian dishes. All in all, we had a lovely stay but would have prefered El San Juan for more nightlife. The location of the hotel is perfect.

In general they didnt fail to satisfy, and earned a slightly above average score. Location The hotel is very nicely located in close proximity to Condado (touristy), and old San Juan (a must see), and 10 minutes from the airport and Plaza Las Americas (shopping). It has its own beach -not great at all by Caribbean standards. But a very nice pool area and relaxing hammocks under coconut trees. Rooms: True to my memory, the beds were more heavenly than other brands promote - certainly very comfortable. My room viewed the old fort and Condado shoreline. There were two spoilers to the view, however: (i) the hotel restaurant rooftop in the foreground; (ii) an intensely bright beam of light from across a close section of the condado public beach area, where apparently there may have been some music festivals. this not only prevented an enjoyable viewing experience, but also facilitated noise and affected privacy at nights forcing use of the drapes. The room i had was close to the elevators and therefore a little noisy the first evening especially. When i asked for a change i was very pleasantly advised that the hotel was currently full to capacity, however if i checked back the following day they could inform whether or not another room would be available. The better response would be for them to follow up with me the following day, but hey...its not a five star! Restaurant Only had breakfast. It does make sense to book the breakfast buffet package. The offerings were wide, varied and delicious. Absolutely no complaints in that area. Valet/Parking This made no sense to me. I rented a car, but the hotel had no parking whatsoever on or apparently near property. Once you arrive you are ambushed by the valet service and charged a mountain for the dubious benefit of having them take your car to an undisclosed location (I did ask, and was told vaguely that it was at a location \"nearby\". When i asked further, the valet agent suddenly had a difficulty speaking in English!) The difficulty i had was that it took an average of 15 minutes for my vehicle to be returned each time i visited the valet with my ticket. The frontdesk informed me pleasantly (yup, always pleasant) that the valet service was not affiliated with the hotel, but was unable to assist with options other than use of the valet. Service Apart from valet service, generally very pleasant and willing to assist. Room service and restaurant scores high points. Overall Because of the rooms, the location/environment and the service this hotel scores high points with me. It was easy to forget the valet service, once inside the hotel, however it certainly would cause me to reconsider staying there next time.", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staten Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and Easy Transportation to Old San Juan\u201d", "Author": "Linda929", "ReviewID": "UR20060582", "Content": "My family and I just got back from a one week trip to San Juan. We booked a stay at this hotel and loved it. I'm not a beach lover so I wasn't sure if this would be the hotel for me. Fortunately, there's a little something for everyone here. There's a private beach for the hotel guests, a pool, a jacuzzi, a fitness center, and spa. My favorite thing to do was swing in the hammock at night, staring up at the palm trees against the evening sky with the sound of ocean waves crashing in the background. It was great. There are exotic birds in the lobby, swans and other birds in the garden, and tropical fish in the back. To get up close with the swans, just follow the signs to the garden. To see the fish, you just need to follow the green pier that stretches out into the water at the back of the hotel. Go in the evening. The giant fish swimming there will be a sight worth seeing. In terms of location, it was pretty easy to get to Old San Juan by bus. About a 5 minute walk to the bus stop and less than a 20 minute ride. Since this year is an election year, the city buses were all free. Otherwise, it would have cost around 75-cents per trip. Still better than the $15 cab ride (for five people) we paid on our first day! Also, if you're up for a walk in the heat, you can walk to the Condado Hotel & Casino that's across the bay. There's a little bridge that stretches over there. At one point, you may even bump into some kids jumping off the bridge and diving into the water. The bridge is pretty low so there's no danger with the height. Just watch out for the rocks if you choose to follow. For meals, the hotel restaurants are somewhat pricey. As an alternative, there is a Subway sandwhich shop located at the corner across the street. They also sell gelato in there. It's pretty good.

My husband and I and our two children(8 and 11) had a great experience. My husband travels for work and we stayed using Hilton Honors points (diamond club member, I think) so we had a room in the executive tower which is newer and very nice. We actually lived in PR for six months and this was our mini vacation before flying home. We had been all over the island and my husband and I had also stayed in the Ponce Hilton (south side of island). I admit that the service and overall appearance of the hotel is not as nice as some hiltons and even the Ponce Hilton, but it was still very nice. (don't expect the same quality of service in PR as in the states - they have a much more laid back approach to everything and you will wait for food everywhere you go - even fast food - just let go of your Western expectations, relax and follow the local motto -\"no worries\") I also admit that the food is VERY expensive, even compared to other nice hotels on the island. (there are restuarants within walking distance, both cheap fast food and nice ones - you can also always take a cab as well). Having said that, I will tell you what I liked and why I would recommend it to anyone. 1. It's within walking distance to one of the best beaches in San Juan - Escambron. It's very popular with locals, which gives you a taste of the local culture, and it is a great place for beginners to snorkel. It's one of the places we always took visitors. The peninsula of sorts is a great place to walk at night and there is a decent nice restuarant there with an outdoor patio overlooking the beach. make sure to try the Red Snapper (traditionally cooked whole, fins and all in a beautiful presentation - check out their sign which has a picture on it) 2. It is also with in walking or short cab ride to Old San Juan, which is a must see and do. 3. The scenery is very nice. The beach is in a cove and looks over toward escambron beach. There are ruins of the old wall of the city across the little bay. You also get a great view of the San Juan coast line, especially at night. 4. The grounds are attractive and large enough to find a quiet place, most of the time. It is a great place to sit and look at the ocean. 5. The pool is large and good for kids or adults wanting to lounge, with a bar in the adult pool. 6.The beach is great for families - who cares that the sand is imported - at least it's clean. There is a raft with slides that our kids liked. Beginners can also snorkel here - try over by the rocks . One of the tourist groups that takes people to snorkel is often out in the bay just outside of the beach markers. 7. It's off of the beaten path away from most of the other Hotels. FYI, I have also stayed at the Intercontinental and loved it very much. It is on the nicest white sand beach on the Island and in the heart of Hotel row near the airport. (Isla Verde) It may be a bit nicer, but the grounds and pool area are much smaller. They do have a great place to sit on the beach and have a casual dinner watching the sun go down. Take a cab there to spend an afternoon and stay and have dinner on the beach. We recommended the Caribe to a friend going to SAn Juan for work. She's traveled all over the world. She spent a week there (including a night at the Intercontential) and LOVED the Hotel Caribe. She sat outside until late at night never wanting to go inside. Annother of my husbands co-workers who travels extensively and is very picky about where he stays, has stayed in many of the upscale hotels in San Juan and always chooses to come back here when on the Island. He even chooses it over the Ponce Hilton and the Intercontinental .

We arrived in San Juan around 2:30 on a saturday so of course the airport was very crowded. We finally got a cab and he took us to our hotel. We waited forever to check in (and there really weren't alot of people in line) in the open air lobby, so by the time we were done we were hot and sweaty. We were \"upgraded\" to the Honors tower. We were very impressed to begin with the shops seemed nice and the honors tower lobby was beautiful, we took the elevator up to the 15 floor, and it ended there. As soon as we stepped off we saw dirty walls and stained carpet. We got to our room, and it was worse. The walls seems filthy and needed repainting in the worst way, the air didn't work well, and while the bathroom was very large, with nice tile floors and showers, there were holes in the floor under the sink. Not sure what they were doing in there but maybe they need to finish their renovations before renting rooms out to people. We had to turn the air down to 65 just to get it to run for more than 2 minutes at a time. We first set it on 70, when it was close to 80 already in the room, and it ran for 2 minutes ( we timed it) then went right back off. It finally cooled off when we went to bed around 10:00 that night. We finally decided that we only had to stay one night (at least it seemed clean, and the bed was comfy I will give them that) so we would go explore the grounds. First we walked over to where the fort was and watched about 50 crabs crawl around walked over around the pool, then finally over to the fish pond to see the swans and the peacocks. We enjoyed that, then went back to order room service and waited over an hour for a cheeseburger. I don't know if it was really good, or I was just really hungary, but since I hadn't eaten for 14 hours, (not even peanuts on the plane) it seemed to me like the best cheeseburger ever, my husband says otherwise; not bad but just ok. The view was ok, pretty to the left and right but straight in front of us was a \"very nice\" roof if looking past it you could see water. We only stayed one night, as we were leaving on a cruise the next day, and when we checked out we were stuck with over $100 over what we were quoted as our final price. We spoke with the Hilton before we left and were told what our total would be complete with taxes and hotel fees, and we were lied to, because our total bill was close to $100 more than that. To sum it up, it would be worth staying there if they didn't charge so much. But with the problems we had I wouldn't stay again. I guess you only pay for the name, not the actual quality of the hotel. I will be wiser next time.

I had called the hotel 5 days prior to arriving, just in case, to confirm our reservation and let them know we would be arriving late (11:00 pm) and to request one king size bed instead of two queen size beds. They confirmed us for a late arrival and one king size bed. So naturally, when we entered our room (right by the elevators) we found we had two double/full size beds. Not king size, and even smaller than queen size! So my husband headed downstairs, spoke to the manager on duty and was told there were no other rooms, but that the next day they should have rooms become available and we would be switched to another room. He also said to just leave all our bags packed the next morning and staff would move our suitcases to our new room. So that night we slept in kid-sized beds, as best we could with the constant noise of the elevator all night long! It literally sounded like a roller coaster! The room itself was seriously out dated and abused. We weren't expecting luxury here, just a certain standard of cleanliness and care in the room. Very disappointed. The next morning we headed out and, just in case, stopped at the front desk to remind someone about our room change. No one knew a thing about it. No notes were left by the manager for anyone to follow up on. But they did change our room to one in the Hilton Honors tower. We thought that sounded great, but it still turned out to be less than what you would expect of a Hilton Hotel anywhere else. Again they put us right next to the elevators, but at least in this building you couldn't hear it. The room was......okay. Nothing great, just okay. There were stains on sofa and carpet, a hole punched in at the base of bathroom entryway (odd) and a leak in the bathroom ceiling that landed on the bathroom counter. (I had noticed a stinky wet towel on the counter when we arrived and figured the maid had left a dirty cleaning towel there by accident. No, the maid had left a towel there on purpose to sop up all the dirty water that leaked through the ceiling! I had to keep doing the same every day to keep my personal items from being soaked!) We didn't bother to change rooms again as I can't imagine that any of the other rooms in the BEST tower would be any different. Also, the parking is atrocious. Seems like the Normandie Hotel next door is quite the hot spot on Friday and Saturday nights, and they all park at the Hilton! So you can forget about parking on the street and or even in the \"hotel\" parking! Everyone parks there, hotel guest or not! We had no choice but to go with valet parking, and even still our car stayed exactly where we left in front of the lobby for about 2 hours because even the valets had nowhere to park it or even move it. The food and drinks at the hotel are overpriced, as expected. The pool definitely didn't look clean. The beach is okay, definitely not a \"Caribbean white sand and blue water\" beach....far from it! We really only picked this hotel because the location was convenient for our needs on this trip and because we figured (wrongly) that we could count on Hilton quality. If you require a clean hotel room with few visible signs of wear and tear, do not stay here. The lobby area is very nice, and deceiving if you think the rooms will be similar in quality.

We were provided passes for the executive lounge and a promise that the room would be ready by 2:30pm. By 1:30pm. We were in our room - EXCELLENT FIRST IMPRESSION! It was located in the Hiltons Honors building room 1268...our view was of the fort and ocean (very nice) EXECPT we also had the view of the roof... very large eye sore. But from the 12th floor we just looked beyond it...and that was fine...The room was in okay but had it's issues... there were cracks in the wall that were painted over...the frame of the bath room door was rusted and the inside cabinet of the mini frigde was gross - the water never got hot enough in the shower or double sinks. hey seemed to put a bit more effort into the bathroom...as it did have somewhat of an upscale feel. And the bedding was comfy. Housekeeping was very nice but we had to call for wash cloths 5 out of 7 days. We had roomservice for breakfast one morning which was delicious and for $60.00 for eggs bacon and french toast for 2...it should have been delicious. We ate at the pool twice and at the lobby bar one late night...other than that we did not experience the restaurants. I must say that ALL the common areas of the Hilton are nice - not spectacular, but nice. On some days the pool cleanliness was questionable so I decided to just catch some sun...the water was NOT appealing at all, and when we asked the pool area staff, they said it was all the sunscreen/suntan lotion etc. creating residue??? YUKE. We visited the LaConcha for cocktails one evening - very upscale feeling at the LaConcha and the Marriott Stellars Casino another evening...they are within two blocks of each other and are nice properties...I cannot say anything about the rooms at those places but the common areas were beautiful and felt upscale...more so than the Caribe Hilton. Oh well...in the end...we did not spend a lot of time in the room and were gone most days by noon and rarely returned before 9 - 10pm. The Caribe Hilton was an okay home bases...Oh and did I mention we only paid $130.00 per night - direct internet deal directly with Hilton, which included full access to the executive lounge which as cool for free soft drinks, assorted fruits and contentental breakfast...On the day we rented a car(to go to the rainforest), we parked on the street, walked about a half block to the hotel and saved on the $15.00 daily parking too...In the end, we had a great time in San Juan...that great time had very little to do with the Caribe Hilton as the Hilton does not offer anything in the way of daily activities...unless feeding the fish with the free bread they provide is your idea of activity. A pool side band/music would add some needed atmosphere to the day time pool area....for sure.

An employee mentioned that a big remodel will begin in the near future. The AC could not be increased above 62 degrees. We changed room twice. The general atmosphere in the lobby is beautiful. It is classic 40's modern and is very cool. The rooms however, were shabby. Paint peeling, rusty pipes in bathroom etc... When I complained the staff were very accomodating and understanding. I get the feeling that they hear complaints all day long and must change rooms frequently for customers. I heard everyone complaining and lots of room credit charges being given. I guess I should have asked for financial compensation for my headaches. Instead, they just kept changing my room. The rooms never seemed to get much better. The kid activities were minimal.

I have stayed here in the past (which is why I decided to stay here again) but it was nothing like I remember. It was very disappointing and I highly doubt if I would ever stay here again.

On top of the fact that the room had seen better days, the TV did not work properly with or without the remote. The dresser had a door in front of it that was loose and coming off the hinges. We complained about both and they sent two people up to fix the door but the TV problem was NEVER resolved. At first they blamed it on the cable company, then on the remote, then on the TV itself. (however our friends across the hall had no problem with their TV from the start). Let's see what else...the air conditioning was difficult to control. One minute we were hot and the next we were freezing. We had a problem with the tub because the water would not drain properly. The bathroom also had loose fixtures. I spent the first four days trying to correct the various problems with the front desk staff and several managers.

According to the friends we traveled with who have been coming to this resort for the past 10 years, things have slipped with the new manager.

I can live with the missing art on the wall, but the mess in the fridge took hours for us to soak off and clean. On day two, our toilet quit working so we were moved to another room. It was okay though there were only two towels and the fridge, again, was dirty. On one occasion, due to the aforementioned work slow down, our room was not made up at all. The restaurants are ridiculously expensive and we ended up eating all meals except three, off the property. We paid $22 per person for a breakfast buffet and they didn't refill food items in a timely manner. The Atlantico charged $15 for a small burger and $11 for a wrap that was dry. The Spanish restaurant, while spendy, excelled with customer service thanks to friendly, and very funny, Victor. He was charming, funny, warm, helpful and I wish we would've eaten there more often. He is a diamond. Beware of the pool towel scam, they make you sign for pool towels and then charge you if they're not back by 6:00 p.m. We questioned this because their posted sign says you have until 9:00 to return them but the pool staff said no, 6:00 or you pay $20 per towel. If you go early you don't have to sign for the towels. Also be careful in the pool. On the weekend it was completely out of control (foul language, drinking, jumping off the waterfalls and other permanent fixtures, etc.). The pool staff did NOTHING to bring order to the chaos. We ended up leaving the pool when it appeared two very loud women were about to fight. It scared us. They now allow drinking IN the pool and hot tubs. We picked out litter, cans, plastic cups and removed glasses and bottles from the pool deck so that no one would get cut. The pool decks also are coated in a slime that really needs to be power-washed off. Be careful if it rains because they are SLICK.

Cab ride from airport to hotel for 3 people with 3 bags was $23. checked with others, and everyone paid under $25. Nice hotel, nice people working there, very clean. Lots of places to eat at hotel, some more expensive than others. Drinks are not cheap, pretty standard for resorts. No complaints. Our room was in the tower and was very nice. It was clean, the bathroom was updated and very nice. Our housekeeper was a wonderful lady that did a great job and went out of her way to make our stay comfortable. We had a small fridge in the room that we stocked with water and drinks from the shop across the street. No complaints at all. The beach area is sheltered by the man made reef area, we enjoyed it, great for kids to play in, and mine loved the big slide out on a \"float\". We snorkeled every day at the Caribe beach and saw amazing fish! Highly recommend - they rent the masks/snorkels for $5 at towel hut. Every room can get a beach umbrella free of charge, and that made staying out for long times bearable. We liked the pool, although it is a small one. My child liked jumping off the sides into the pool, and the waterfalls. The pool does get a bit dirty, however, I saw them \"scooping and cleaning\" everyday. Only downside for this hotel is how far away it is to Old San Juan. We wanted to shop and sightsee, and heard cabs were about $12 to get to Old San Juan. We did walk to the bus stop, easy walk around the corner. Bus ride is easy and quick and no more than .75 cents. Bus stops running at 9pm. We went with a big group in cab and they charged us $3 per person instead of flat rate, so just be upfront with them. The bus stop in Old San Juan is right by cruise ships, and it's quite a bit of walking to get to the old forts and the other side of shopping area, so wear good shoes and bring a map. There is a free trolley that goes around Old San Juan, however we found that the cruise ship people took up all the seats and you could waste much time just waiting on a trolley. We had no problems with the trolley the day there were no cruise ships in port.

It was awsome. We arrived early (around 2 pm) and had to wait for our room to be ready. Check in time is 4pm, the bellstaff stored our luggage and we headed to enjoy the facilities, the front desk staff took our information to let us know when the room was ready. By 3pm they had already called us to give us our room. At the desk we noticed several other guests complaining about having to wait for their rooms since noon. As the bellman escorted us to the room I asked if it was frequent that guests have to wait so many hours like those other guests. He told me that this hotel runs full almost everyday, which makes it hard to have vacant/ clean rooms during the day for early arrivals. He also mentioned that the more of a hard time you give the front desk the worst of a room you will get. So beware. Thankfully our room was lovely, we stood in room 1865 at the tower building, it had the most awsome ocean view. The hotel layout is side ways so no room is ocean front but this side of the tower building is the only one where you wont see the roof of the next building in the hotel. Since it was the 18th floor we saw some of the front garden , a park , and the ocean, during the day you can even see the ships as the approach the pier. The room was spacious and had a great marble bathroom with a walk in shower instead of a tub. We always had fresh towls and sheets, although you have to request them, as a hilton standard the beds now have only a duvet instead of sheets. Since we are hilton honors members we have free access to the lounge in the executive level of the main building. It was nice because it offeres continental breakfast in the day and in the evening they have appetizers and cocktails, if you are not a gold or diamond member you might want to consider upgrading to the executive level to have this access because the food in the hotel is expensive and there are not much options outside the hotel unless you take a cab or rent a car. Walking distance there is a minimart, a small local coffeshop that makes great sandwiches and awsome eggs with bacon, and a subway restaurant. But thats about it. The options inside the hotel are good although expensive, they have a Morton's steakhouse, a pan- asian restaurant called Lemongrass, an Italian restaurant called Il Giardino and a Spanish restaurant called Madrid - San Juan. My favorite was Lemongrass, wonderful sushi. My least favorite was Madrid San Juan, the service was not so good and the food was just ok. The grounds are perfect, a nice big 3 tier pool,very kid frindly beach, plenty of hammoks to nap under the shade of the palm trees, we always were able to get umbrellas and towels, although the hotel was full we never felt crowded. They also have a nice quiet tropical garden with a pond with swans in it, also they have peacocks that stroll around the garden , this garden also has a small pool that you can enjoy if you pefer to be in a more quiet and private surrounding. Our check out was ok we did the express check out option to avoid the lines, we booked with travelocity so we had to pay the extra resort fee and occupancy tax that is not covered by these wholesalers ( Travelocity, orbitz, hotels.com, priceline,etc) the resort fee is about a 12% of the rate and the occupancy tax is 5 dollars per person per day. If you book with a travel agency ask if its included so you wont be surprised when you check out. Also, be carefull when you give your credit card, as in all hotels they put a hold on the card for an estimated amount of your total nights rate with taxes plus 75dollars per day per person for incidentals, if you use a debit card these funds will be automaticly deducted from your account and you will not be able to use your money . If you use a debit card I suggest you withdraw the money and pay in cash. In my case i was promised they would not make a hold but rather keep the credit card number to charge me at check out. I gave them my card and a few moments later I checked my balance, they had taken an approval for 800 dollars, when my total stay did not sum up to 400 dollars. I had to wait a week to get the money back in my account. I would surely return to the Caribe hilton , the staff was always friendly and had a can do attitude,I always felt welcome.

In my stay I was able to experience two towers of the hotel. First they put me in the \"Main Tower.\" This part of the hotel was just ok. It was older, but the rooms looked renovated with new furniture & large bathrooms with two sinks & an overhead \"rain\" shower. The bad part of the room was my view looked at a construction site, & the noise woke me up every morning. After 2 nights of my air conditioning breaking down & the staff trying to fix it, I asked for a room change. The Hilton staff was somewhat unwilling to do this (said the hotel was booked & could not change rooms), but after talking to a manager I was able to be moved into the Executive Tower. This part of the hotel is much nicer. The rooms are newer, although bathrooms are smaller (no rain shower) than the older tower. I had an awesome view of the beach & ocean. This tower also has the \"executive lounge\" where they have breakfast every morning (bagels, fruit, pastries, cereal, coffee) & hors devours after 5pm. In both towers the rooms I had featured safes & small fridges. The resort part of the hotel is nice. They have a 2 tiered pool, hammocks, a gym & tennis courts. The private beach is a little small, & the water was somewhat choppy. Old San Juan is around 15 min by bus & the bus stop is a 2 min walk from the hotel. Condado is about a 15-20 min walk from the hotel. If you take a cab its about $15 to each destination. One of the problems with the hotel is the area. Besides the resort & neighboring Normandie hotel, there is not much around. If you want to eat quick, the only options to eat close to the hotel besides the overpriced hotel restaurants is Subway Sandwich across the street. After visiting Condado, I wished I stayed there because of proximity to restaurants & nightlife. There are many nice Casino/Resort Hotels there, and a ton of restaurants on that strip within walking distance. So, if you're a person who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk, take a cab, or bus every time you want to eat stay in Condado. Overall, my stay at the Caribe Hilton was decent. Although, I'm not sure if it would have been as good had I not been able to switch rooms & have access to the breakfast lounge. Like I said, if I was to stay in around the San Juan area again, I would probably stay in Condado. Extra Info: You will be charged a resort fee every day of your stay. Also, had some good pizza at Via Appia in Condado & if you're looking for close nightlife to the hotel the La Concha in Condado is nice. The lobby & pool of this hotel have a Miami nightlife feel.

But since I waited a little too late for my passport, we chose to go ahead and go. After much carousing and reviewing of all the different hotels in San Juan, we settle on the Caribe Hilton. We really didn't know what to expect because some of the reviews were very exceptional and some were down right anti-Caribe. We arrived in San Juan on Friday May 23rd and stayed until Tuesday May 27th. Upon arriving and checking in at the Caribe Hilton I notified the check in desk that I was a Hilton Honors member and immediately got a free upgrade. I'm not sure were we where staying prior but we were upgraded to the Garden Towers on the 4th floor. The room had 2 bathrooms (only one had a shower), a king size bed and a pullout sofa bed in the living room. There was a television in each room. It came with a safe and refrigerator. It was nicely decorated and gave you the feel of apartment living. We had 2 separate balconies with an entrance to each one. The view was partial garden and partial ocean, which was very nice. After we settled down into the room, two of us decided to go downstairs to one of the hotel restaurants to eat. We chose Palmeras...which was a great thing....because every Friday they have an all you can eat Seafood buffett (great for those seafood lovers). They had sauteed lobster ready to eat, stone crab claws sauteed ready to eat, fried shrimp, baked fish, cold boiled shrimp, various choices of salads with seafood...it was AMAZING. Yes, it was a little pricey...about $52 per person, but it was worth every bit of the price. While we were eating we did have a small incident take place back at our room. The other young lady left behind in the room had a nice surprise when she stepped out of the shower. There was another set of guest sitting in the living room. After trying to straighten it out herself (hard due to language constraints), I paid a visit to the front desk and spoke with the manager. She kindly apologized, changed the keys and gave us a $75.00 credit towards our room. This really did come in handy because it just about covered our tab at the restaurant. Each day was a new adventure at the hotel. There was the lively breakfast buffet that Palmera had every morning, not to mention a great menu selection too. Did I mention how awesome the wait staff is in this restaurant, especially Efrim, he's very attentive and as a guest you will not lack quality service. Then there's the mimosa's served that you could take by the pool area and layout. The pool area was absolutely beautiful and spacious. Several pools to choose from. There was small private beach, however, alongside of the Caribe's property was a public beach and there were a lot of visitors. The Caribe offered the rental of paddle boats at the hotel to take out on the water. There were water activities going on in the private area of the beach. It was great. There was never a shortage of cabs in the front of the hotel. Or you could walk 2 blocks and catch the city bus to Old San Juan to get there in 10 minutes for only .75 cents and it lets you off right by the cruise docks. The great part about this hotel is the location. It's not in the middle of all the Old San Juan hustle and bustle and it's not part of the Isla Verde fast paced strip. You can have quiet and then you can take a cab or bus to the busy areas in under 10 minutes. Any time of night or day. A great perk about this hotel is not just the boutiques that are located there in the hotel or the modern openness of the lobby, but it's the great convenience of the Starbucks. Located in the downstairs lobby. Great for the late night recoveries. Go downstairs get a cup of mojo and go back to the room to wake up. Lastly I can not go without mentioning how great the room service and housekeeping was. We were never short of towels and if we happened to use to many (because women do that sometimes) we called housekeeping for more and in a matter of 15 minutes we would have our fresh towels. We put in a late night call to room service for a request of a microwave, within a matter of 20minutes we had a microwave set up in our room, free of charge. The staff was great, service was great, ambiance was one of a kind.

We ate at Morton's one night, great food, nice atmosphere, what you would expect from a nice steakhouse. We did however eat at the Parrot Club in old San Juan two nights. It was one the best places I have ever eaten, hands down. I recommend getting only appetizers and ordering a few, they were all outstanding! Don't forget desert also, the banana spring rolls were amazing! OK, be sure to see the forts. Both are really awesome if you like history. As for the rest of the hotel, lobby, pool, restaraunts were all first class and we enjoyed the pool bar immensly. Hiram and Jose will take good care of you if you take care of them. The room was a little \"Dumpy\" for being a Hilton, but I know the place is old. All in all, I would defintely recommend the hotel. Everything people said about prices are true, but if you are prepared, it's no big deal. It's not Mexico.

The room and the hallway had been renovated but could tell there had been some water damage in the room. No mold or stale smells though. Bathroom had some upgrades but could use some more work to give it a more polished modern look. However, it was clean and nice size and after a day some of the older features had developed a certain charm. No complaints on the room, everything up to date (minus the LCD TV), extremely comfortable bed, balcony with table and two chairs, and refrigerator (a microwave would have been nice too). Ate at Palmeras twice and had the buffet. The restaurants like most hotel restaurants are pricey but the food was good. For those without a rental car, there is a subway and a ice cream shop at the end of the block. Went there a couple of times to help offset the more costly meals. Also, took a cab to San Juan ($22 round trip) for sightseeing and to try some other restaurants (about a 10 minute ride there and 15 minute ride back due to the increased traffic). The recreational areas of the hotel were truly spectacular. From the tranquil garden area to the pool and beach areas. The hammocks and the fish feeding pier were nice extras.

Not to be overlooked is the small cafe in the spa building which is located at the end of the beach, in a seperate building from the hotel. They make wonderful fresh, made-to-order wraps here which we got for lunch everyday and took out onto the beach with us. They also have breakfast items and smoothies. The wraps were only about $10 each and much healthier than the menu at the pool bar. The store just across the street is a great place to go to stock up on water, beverages, and snacks. The rooms do have a refrigerator so you can keep your snacks cold. The rooms were very nice, the beds were great. The balconies are big enough to enjoy a cup of coffee on and feature a small table and two chairs. Having a Starbucks in the lobby was great. A coffee and a bagel in the morning will run you about $5. My only \"negative\" remark would be not necessarily about the resort but about Puerto Rico itself. The shoreline is very built up, one high rise hotel or condo building after another. The buildings just seem to be on top of each other near the water.

If you were Hilton Honors or a VIP your line was staffed but there was no one there for normal check-ins. Not the best first impression. 2) Room service trays and garbage were not picked up promptly from the hallways. When my next door neighbor had dinner his tray of half-eaten food remained outside the room until lunchtime the next day. This happened more than once. 3) Beach service was spotty. One day there was someone taking orders but the next day there was no one to be seen. I don't mind getting up to get my drinks and food but sometimes you just want to veg out and not move. 4) Food and drink prices are extraordinarily high. $10 for a Bud Light!

We had done some investigation and knew that this is the begining of the off-season. The crowds are less and prices drop some. We arrived at the hotel around 3pm. I am a Hilton Honour Silver member and was shown to a private registration desk attached to the Condado Villas. No waiting and we were able to check-in early. We had a King Villa on the 7th floor (7720) that over-looked the lagoon in which we saw a sea turtle!. The room had a full kitchen which was a little much as I didn't plan on doing any cooking. We utilized the refrigerator and we stocked it with beer, cheese, wine, etc. which was convenient and cost effective. The freezer had an icemaker which was great. There was also a table with four chairs for eating and the balcony had 3 chairs and a table. The lagoon was very pretty, but if we looked to our right there is new construction being done. The construction started around 7am. and is quite noisey. This was not an issue for us as we were off and running by 8am everyday anyway. The bathroom had a nice size shower (no tub). Closet space was sufficient. The king bed was excellent. Pillows were perfect and comforter was cozy. If you are a Hilton Honours member you can access the Executive Lounge which stocks water and soda pop. We only went there one time and grabbed some bottled water. It was nothing special. The Villa Lagoon area has a small pool which is by the garden area. It is was very quite. The main pool is nice with plenty of lounge chairs to be had. The Atlantis swim up bar makes great Mojitos, however they are $9 each. My husband and I liked to relax at the private beach area. The water is calm and the sand feels nice. It is perfect for small children as there is sufficient shallow water to play in and no waves. There are about 6 different restaurants attached with the hotel. We ate at two. Morton's Steakhouse for dinner one night and on the last day of our stay we ate at the breakfast buffet. Morton's was very good and we expected it to be pricey. The breakfast buffet was average and the bill was $50.00. Not worth the money. We had rented a car and did a lot of sight seeing..so we didn't stay and hang around at the hotel very much. But we managed to return everyday around 3pm and spend 2 hours on the beach. Perfect! Old San Juan is very close and you have many choices for dinner if you don't want to eat at the hotel. The staff at the hotel was very helpful with directions and the parking attendants were fast in retrieving the car. (Note: $20 a day for valet parking, $15 for manual). The Caribe is in a good spot to explore the North and East side of Puerto Rico. Side note: There is a great parking garage in Old San Juan. Follow the signs to the historical sites (forts). Drive up and around until you see a water fountain. The first street past the fountain turn left and the parking garage is on the left. $1.95 an hour.

The lunch buffet looked just fair and overpriced at $26. One ice tea looked like mud and it was easily substituted with Arizona Tea. We went to the Italian restaurant in the hotel. It was Ok\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.even Ok++ The gnocchi and veal got the best vote. Service was very good. We went to Morton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the hotel. It was good\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..but it was freezing cold. Most of us had a collared short sleeve golf shirt on and it was a little brisk. Someone should have done something about the screaming 3 year old in the center section booth. The 60 minutes of screaming pretty much ruined our 7 meals. I would blame the parents first, and then the staff. The ice tea was, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as thick as mud,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and was sent back. We ordered the $8.95 side of baked potato and it never came out, but we did get to pay for it. The bone in rib eye was quite good, as was the Filet Oscar. The fillet looked Ok, but recieved very good reviews tableside. The saut\u00c3\u00a9ed mushrooms were outstanding, as was the overall service. We dropped $400 for dinner (without tip), 7 people, 2 beers, no desserts. It was good, overpriced, and I left unimpressed. You might find it better. A can of local light beer (Medalla) at the pool-side bar was an outrageous $6.96\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..add a couple of dollars for a tip and you are at $9.00 per beer. Surely not worth it, and the hotel management should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wake up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and change the pricing. Medalla is similar to our Miller Light here in the states. The little Mini-Mart 85 meters from the lobby probably does a booming business. The marketing genius that suggested to management to charge $20 per unreturned towel has shown that he has never stayed at a good 4 star hotel. Nor, more than likely, will he ever be employed by one. Yes, you want your cheap blue and white towels back, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat us up. It will get mentioned by people that rate your hotel. The concierge service was a cut above even though they were in the process of physically moving the desks and rebuilding. It took several days of tearing out and measuring, more tearing, and more measuring for everything to be moved. After the concierge desk was moved, they put up white plastic from floor to ceiling in the lobby, and began to fire nails through studs and into the concrete floor. The gun shots sounded like 9mm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being fired a distance of 5 meters with 40 mils of white plastic protecting customers that were walking down to the HonorsTower. We all ducked when the random shots were fired. The first time through was a little scary. They took good care of the two large parrots in the lobby, but let the customers walk past what sounded like a shooting range at a close distance. It was funny watching people duck. To finish with the concierge, they were extremely helpful. We dealt with at least 3 or 4 of them. They were all very good. One stands out as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hustler type that went the extra yard for us and was very professional. I approached him at the desk and he was excellent in highlighting the way to the Bacardi Factory Tour. (tour was Ok) I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get his name, but he is the only young thin large guy there that is 6\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 5\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tall. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got the right \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attitude and is extremely professional. They were quick to make things correct\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..should have been more proactive\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. than reactive. All 3 rooms had some degree of mold. Our room stunk like mold. This really ruined the stay for me. My wife is allergic to mold and we had to request the maid service to clean the mold from the shower ceiling. (It works better if you pay to have an extra service completed) We were told the renovations were done 1 year ago. It sure didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like it. The carpet looked like it was 5 to 10 years old. The sliding track balcony door didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The paint was slopped over all the outlet switches. The air conditioner appeared as thought it was original. (30 years old) It was filthy with mold\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..and no filter. These types of conditions are unacceptable. The air conditioner was hard-wired to the slider, so that if the balcony slider was open, the air conditioner wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. So you had a choice, either a cool moldy room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..or a hot fresh smelling room. Two poor choices for spending $5m on 3 rooms for 7 days. Portions of the hallway ceiling were cutout (drywall pull through holes) and remained unrepaired. This is unacceptable. Two of our rooms had nightstand lamps, one room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. A good Red Roof Inn would have been better than this. We got a 30 year old concreted moldy room that had been painted about 4 times. Furniture looked like it was 20+ years old. The 1.6 gpf toilet still had the tattered label on the front of it about 6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd off the floor. The plumber never took it off\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.nor did the maid service. This is the sign of a dirty room. Ironically, it was a modern low gallons per flush toilet\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.but ours had a slow leak all day. (it is leaking right now) The small shampoo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and mouth wash contents were horrible. The boxed bar soap was fair. I have traveled for over 30 years\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..and this was some of the worst. Tasted and smelled like they were bulk packaged and poured out by bucket in the basement. You may like them, but ours stayed behind. The hallway ceiling drywall had \"pull throughs\".....square holes every 20 feet. (probably to pull cable through) Never fixed. Some in our group were at this very same location 30 years ago when it was new. (and this was the 3rd visit for them!) It's my last visit.

Another Exec Lounge associate worth mentioning is Miss Annia who is both super-professional and sweet as sugar and is a real asset. The lounge is just a great place to enjoy a delicioso cafe con leche and meet other nice travelers in a calm setting. The Continental breakfast is lovely and the servers are quick to keep things tidy; there's a certain code of conduct you see up there from the staff and they are all lovely people con clase. The best part for me outdoors is the hammock area; imagine swinging in between two huge Palm Trees for hours - it's this sort of experience that blew me away because despite the grand size of the hotel, there are still...quiet...places...for...simple...solitude. Chef Pagan at Lemongrass (on premise) is a big star; a likeable guy that has created the most beautiful Asian fusion restaurant overlooking the Hilton's Tropical Gardens.

There are plenty of shady walkways, a tropical garden complete with koi pond and black swans, an open air reception desk, multi level swimming pools, and a private beach in an area protected by a jetty. It's a good thing the grounds were so nice, because we spend four hours strolling them, waiting for our room to be ready. We were able to check our luggage with bell services, but their security was very lax...my wife and I both went back to retrieve items from our luggage, and no one paid any attention or questioned what we were doing. I'm glad I had luggage locks. Check in lines were long, and the reception desk was polite but firm in their insistence that my room would not be ready until exactly 4pm. My room wasn't in the main building or the tower, but in the \"Condado Lagoon Villas\". These peculiar rooms appear to be part of a time share or condominium venture. They're very large, with doors to adjoining rooms, and many locked closets. The bathrooms are huge, with a shower and separate tub, two sinks, and a separate water closet with toilet and bidet. Our room had a shared ground floor terrace with two other rooms, with a view of the Condado Lagoon. These rooms are off the beaten path, to say the least...so much so that it has its own reception desk and pool area. This section of the hotel gives the impression of being old and musty, but it actually wasn't bad. There was, however, a party at a beach across the lagoon on Friday night, that made things a little noisy until well into the night. There are a number of restaurants on site, including a Starbucks, and all are what I would consider to be expensive. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night, and found it to be very fussy, with poor service, but good food with large portions. A meal of chicken parmigiana for two, with no alcohol, ran over $90. At times, it seemed like a parody of a fancy restaurant. The location of the Caribe Hilton is the major drawback. Neighborhood food options are limited, and it's an inconvenient walk through a tent city full of protesters (protesting the construction of a new high rise) and across a bridge to get to the Condado district. There was a substantial police presence, including mounted units, while we were there. Checkout was less arduous, as there was an interactive TV in the room. Internet was $14.95 per day, and we were hit with an unexpected \"Resort Charge\" of about $24 when we checked out. I wasn't displeased with my stay, but in the future I would be more inclined to book a hotel right in Old San Juan.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Union, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Great Location\u201d", "Author": "BeachBoy123", "ReviewID": "UR15464162", "Content": "Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children ages 4 and 8) spent 6 nights at the Caribe Hilton.

Room: Bedroom was well maintained with a very comfortable bed, we didn't have the flat panel TV, but other rooms in the tower and executive floors did have them. The carpets are clean and well maintained as was the furniture. There was a lot of storage space which is a plus. Bathroom: Was well maintained but there was a tile missing in the shower. The sink faucet and countertop were in good condition. Grounds: The grounds of the hotel were well maintained. The pools are large and accommodated the people using it very well. On Saturday and Sunday, chairs weren't available around 2PM all other times, chairs were available. The beach was great and shallow. It was never crowded and only had some leaves floating on the water. Others: The gardens and lobby are well maintained. Restaurants: I didn't eat anywhere expect for Atlantico for lunch and the food was OK, It was expensive but the kids ate for free or half price. Good drinks but expensive. Starbucks was good. Executive Lounge: Very nice with good selection for breakfast. They have an espresso machine that made fresh cappuccino, I was in heaven. They also have cookies at night and drinks at 5 (at $3 a drink they are a bargain). Location: Great location with a private beach, close to Condado and Old San Juan. We drove to Old San Juan every night and had dinner there. Overall: The hotel was great for families and you could enjoy yourself without feeling crowded. Remember the hotel has over 800 rooms.

The hotel has a wonderful beach, perfect for toddlers and young kids. There is little to no waves in the beach area. There are some little rocks here and there on the beach, but they didn't bother us much. The pool area is great. There are about 4 separate pools connected via small \"waterfalls.\" There is even a kiddie pool and 2 hot tubs! We got a great deal on our room. We paid just under $200 a night. The room was very clean, but a little small. It looked like they had recently renovated the room and expanded the bathroom. The result was a closet that was difficult to get into because it was less than two feet away from the side of the bed and you could not open the door to the safe completely because of the proximity of the bed. The beds were super comfortable and the bedding was great. The bathroom was very spacious, but only had a walk in shower. We had a balcony in our room. The door was nearly impossible to open. Our \"view\" looked out into a new hotel that is being built next door. Some people on our floor complained about the noise, but we hardly noticed. Generally they started work a little after 7:00 am and were finished around 3:00pm. Our room was located in the Hilton Honors tower. This gave us access to the Honors lounge. There was a free breakfast every morning in the lounge that included breads, fruit, juice, coffee, etc. Throughout the day we had access to free Cokes, water, and coffee in the lounge. In the evening they had free snack hours and a pay bar. The drinks at the pay bar was at a reduced rate, only $3 for wine & beer, and $4 for hard liquor. We had drinks once in the lobby bar and they ranged from $8-$12 (about what you would expect given the location). The lounge saved us at least $30 a day! What a nice benefit. The hotel has a number of restaurants. We only at the poolside restaurant and the casual restaurant. As one would expect they were very overpriced for the quality. At least children under 5 eat free at those locations! We also had Starbucks a few times. Take note that the Starbucks does not accept room charges or the Starbucks card. We did take advantage of the proximity of the Subway one evening for dinner. The hotel is a $10, short, cab ride into Old San Juan. Some people have indicated they walked into Old San Juan, I would not advise it. I enjoy walking, but it seems like it would be a rather long walk and the walk would take you into a few questionable areas. Old San Juan has pretty much been taken over by tourist , but the buildings are still beautiful. It rained all day one day of our vacation. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't much to do around the hotel. My son enjoyed talking to the two birds in the lobby and the tropical gardens was a nice diversion. The kids club is really not very good. The kids area includes an arcade with about 10 very old arcade games and a few toddler tables. No one was ever in the kids area when we were there to try check out games. We did do the \"arts and craft\" project one day. They made a little bunny pin that required the kids to glue three things on to the pin. Not really what I was expecting. Also the children's playground was a little disappointing.

Unfortunately, it never did warm up, but I was too tired to deal with it and went to bed.

Had received a voicemail from the Hotel hoping my stay was going well and if there were any issues, to call the Manager on Duty. I tried calling the MOD, but no answer so I called Guest Services again. They sent up another engineer and housekeeping. This guy at least tried longer to fix the unit & housekeeping sprayed the room with some stench cover-up. Neither worked.

Rotisserie Il Giardino: If I was the F&B Manager at the Caribe Hilton I would shut it down immediately it was the worst restaurant experience I have had in years. _________________________________________________ My wife and I stayed several nights in a \"San Geronimo\" suite on a romantic getaway. The hotel is beautiful. The staff was very friendly. We didn't want to leave the room. In fact we wanted to stay an extra night and the staff was able to accomodate us. The San Geronimo suite is in one of the newer buildings on the hotel grounds and a short hike from the lobby. Even though the hotel was near capacity we never once had to wait for an elevator or even share an elevator. In fact, we never saw another guest in our building the entire time we were there. That was strange. The room was simply fabulous. It had a living room with a kitchenette (microwave, fridge and coffee maker) and 1/2 bath. It also had a balcony, sleeper sofa (not too comfortable to sit on, though), dining room table with 4 chairs and a 40\" or so LCD TV. The bedroom had a very comfortable king size bed, another balcony, another TV, large closet, dressing area, and a surprisingly smallish bathroom. I was a little surprised that they didn't enlarge the bathroom but it was still very nicely equipped with great amenities. Problems in the room: Hot water was hard to come by. Eventually it came, however, it was quite annoying. We spent an afternoon at the Olas Spa and got some lovely treatments. The spa staff was very accomodating and they new how to give great massage and body wraps and I highly recommend them. The spa facility and amenities left a bit to be desired and felt old. They wanted us to shower twice but they only gave us one towel. All in all still very good experience. We had an amazing dinner at Mortons Steakhouse on property. We love Mortons. We drank too much, we ate too much and we laughed a lot. The wait staff was fun and we even made friends with some other guests there. It was a very inviting, warm atmosphere. Then the next night we had dinner at the italian restaurant on property, Rotiisserie Il Giardino, and it was exactly the opposite. We went in for dinner and the place was almost empty (a few tables seated). We were whisked to our table by the maitre d. The server brought us the menu and offered me the wine list (I was still nursing a hangover) which I declined and he all of a sudden got cold (since we weren't going to buy a $100 bottle of wine this night). We had some questions about the menu and he was very rude in answering. We placed our order which included 1 appetizer to share, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 2 cokes. Throughout the entire dinner, this waiter never approached us again (until later). Another guy, a young hard worker, brought out the appetizer with my wife's salad. I very nicely requested that he bring my salad because I expected the appetizer first before the salad. Of course, the waiter didn't put in a salad order for me. So I asked for a salad so that my wife and I could have salad together. The appetizer was just a simple bruschetta. The topping on the bread seemed like it had been blended rather than chopped and it tasted funny. And I don't think the bread had been toasted. The salad dressings tasted watered down. Then our main courses (delivered by yet another guy not our waiter). I had veal marsala which was okay. The potatoes and the vegetables were absolutely delicious. The entree was just okay. Passable. I could get just as good a dinner at the corner pizza shop and pay 2/3 less. My wife got some chicken thing that was wayyyyy too salty. But she, too, loved the potatoes. We never did get our Cokes. Right after they brought our entrees we stopped a busboy (or waiter, there's no telling) and asked for our 2 Cokes. Seemed like it got turned into a much bigger deal than it should have been and even then it took like another 10 minutes for us to get something to drink. A refill would have been completely out of the question. Right after we left (it took 15 freakin minutes to get our check after we declined their coffee and nasty dessert) we walked over to Starbucks for coffee and dessert and a good laugh. Anyways, stay away from this restaurant. Eat dinner every night at Mortons. Oh yeah. Back to the hotel. All in all we had a wonderful time. The weather wasn't great all week so we didn't do much at the pool or beach. It was windy every second of every day and rained a bunch. But we ventured out quite a bit and we enjoyed being tourists in Old San Juan and elsewhere on the island.

We arrived 3 hours before the posted check-in time and our room was ready and waiting for us! Front desk staff was very courteous and helpful throughout our stay. One night, at about 3 a.m., our youngest came down with a horrible stomach virus and we had to call for replacement towels and bedding. Housekeeping arrived very fast (remember, it was around 3 a.m.!), with a great attitude, all the replacement supplies we needed, and they were prepared to actually clean the mess for us (but we had already cleaned up before we called). Truly wonderful service. Daily housekeeping/maid service was also prompt and efficient. Very comfortable beds! A large bathroom with tub and shower. There was one tile missing from the bathroom wall (outside the shower), and on the nightstand between the two beds there was a patch on the wall that was waiting to be repainted (both gave the room a little bit of a dingy feel, it being a Hilton I expected better visuals, although this really was just minor cosmetic). There was absolutely no moldy or musty smell in our room or in the hallway as other reviewers experienced with their rooms. Using the room card in the elevators to get to your floor required a small learning curve. Once you figure out which way to face the card strip when swiping your card and learn to be fast doing it, you'll be fine. We didn't have any trouble with it after a few tries. This is a wonderful place for kids (not teenagers -- probably too boring for teens -- but for younger kids). The beach is calm. The beach hut staff were fast and friendly. We didn't use the pools, preferring the beach instead. There are loads of activities and entertainment for the kids (many other reviewers have already listed all this, so I'll skip the details). Our kids loved the parrots in the lobby and the gameroom where games were surprisingly cheap -- and that was about the only surprisingly inexpensive thing about this hotel though! We ate off-site because the hotel restaurant food prices were too expensive. A pina colada (about $10) in the lobby bar proved quite disappointing and weak. Skip it. Upon check-in you are informed that there is a \"voluntary\" $1/night charge added to your bill used for supporting programs for local children. This is automatically billed unless you ask for it to be removed. Other than that, there were no surprises or unexpected charges on the bill. Check-out was quick and painless.

I thought we scored big but I will say it is a basic continental breakfast and from 5 - 8 pm a cocktail hour that had awful appts. and one night only had one wine choose which had to be the worst wine of ever drank.

I stayed in the Villas with 3 of my friends ( 3rd floor w/ ocean view). The bedroom is an okay size- 2 queen beds, nice bathroom and nice balcony view of the condado. The kitchenette is cute, it includes a small fridge, sink, microwave, cabinets, and counter space. Bedroom Cons: not much floor space for luggage, no WIFI (which was a HUUUUGE disappointment). I couldn't believe that in 2008 Hilton didn't have WIFI in the bedrooms. But we were able to pick up the WIFI from the Condado Plaza Hotel (Mariott- i think) across the water. So make sure you know how to use your phone as a modem or bring some type of wireless card if you go. (they only have free WIFI in the lobby). Room service is really expensive Bedroom Pros: Nice clean linen, nice size bathroom, nice balcony, good service. You can also buy food and store it in the cabinets and fridge. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Hilton was not as glamorous as I thought it would be, but it is nice. The lobby was clean and it's kind of cool how it's connected to the outside- meaning that when you arrive to the hotel you get out of your car and automatically step into the lobby. The pool and beach area is great, simply nice. Its not grandeur, but its very extensive- the property includes alot: gardens, pools, jacuzzis, beaches, playground area, bars, decks, ponds, exotic fish and animals and more- I was not able to fully explore this area, but my friends were able to and they LOVED it. It's a great place for couples at night. The villas has its own separate lobby which is really small, but its somewhat convenient when you need help and information. But I did NOT like all the construction being built - because of the construction going on outside the lobby of the Villas, the outside of the villa area was ugly (very gray and gloomy). Overall Hilton Pros: perfect location- the Hilton seems to be in the middle of everything (Old San Juan (5 minutes away), the Condado (5 minutes away), Isla Verde(12 minutes away), Airport (15 minutes away) plus its a low traffic area so we barely got caught in traffic (which is everywhere in PR), the Hilton pool and beach area offers the widest variety of things to do, and nice people. Overall Hilton Cons: all the Construction, no WIFI, not very glamorous, lack of floor space in rooms w/ 2 beds Most people say the Hilton is overpriced, but I personally think you are paying for the location over anything else b/c the hotel itself is not very ritzy- it's sort of aesthetically disappointing, but you have to keep in mind that this is Hilton's first hotel in the Caribbean (they actually consider it historic) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I also visited The Ritz, El San Juan Hotel, and the Intercontinental. The Ritz's beach was very disappointing and dirty.The intercontinental lobby, beach, and pool area was really pretty (i visited at night), but they all seemed kind of small (and their Casino is really small, but busy). El San Juan Hotel is the hot spot- the lobby is BEAUTIFUL and very grand i felt like i was in a fashion magazine- EVERY person there was BEAUTIFUL. It is veeeerry busy, so if you want to watch alot of beautiful people-go there. If you ever visit that hotel (especially at night) be sure to have your best and most fashionable clothes on w/ makeup & hair done etc. (women should wear dresses that compliment their body types with heels and men should just look clean and smell good). If you want to live the \"high life\" you should stay at a hotel like El San Juan, but if you want to relax you should stay at a hotel like the Hilton. El San Juan Hotel is sort of a place for single people (their are too many temptations there especially for men) and other hotels are better for couples and families. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERALL Puerto Rico Advice: First off, I lost my camera in a taxi on the first night which made me really sad (b/c i lost over 200 pics) and put a little damper on my trip. So I greatly advise everyone to find one taxi driver and stick with them throughout your stay (be sure to ALWAYS get their name, number, and taxi number or license plate). But moreover to Truly experience Puerto Rico you should rent a car. After my experience I advise you to use taxi's for a day, then drive after that- you can get more done and you feel more free! Places to visit: 1. Old San Juan is a must at night (eat at a great restaurant and walk around and visit a club or three) 2. The rain forest (this was probably the best day we had in Puerto Rico- it was BEAUTIFUL!)- bring water and/or drinks, oh and good shoes 3. Culebra, Vieques, or Gilligans Island - you MUST visit one of the three (but visiting one of those will be an all day trip because you will need to arrive early and take ferries to them (so be sure to bring snacks, drinks, snorkel equipment, and an umbrella). 4. Forts in Old San Juan (Fort San Cristobal is better than el Morro) 5. For young people: -Isla Verde at night is a must, definitely go to the clubs, bars, and El San Juan Hotel -Senor Frogs (old san juan), Brava (el san juan hotel), and just ask around. . . (Vibes seemed nice, but we didnt get to go) 6. The Condado at night is really pretty too, when we went there were singers and performers on the big lawn/park area. 7. Ponce is a nice area with many historic places, gardens, etc. . .(old french town so it looks different from old San Juan). You should plan before you get there b/c its very easy to go astray and not get as much done as you want. Remember that EVERYTHING closes early (around 6pm) so tourist activities MUST be planned early and they must be done during the day. At night Old San Juan, the Condado, and Isla Verde are the best. . .If you drive be very cautious b/c people drive very loose down there. Though Puerto Rico is an American territory - 75% of the people their speak Spanish ONLY -if not more. So you should have a basic knowledge of spanish and download some type of translation program on your phone (i just used babelfish.altavista.com- which is an online translator). Walgreens are everywhere (and that will be your grocery and everything else store during the trip (we went almost everyday:-). --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall I LOVED Puerto Rico and I was not ready to go back after 5 days, I felt like I needed atleast 1 or 2 more days. I loved how racism and colorism just seemed to go out the window and everyone loved/liked each other for who they were and respected everyone's individual beauty. So don't be a typical stiff American when you go- relax, have fun, talk to random people no matter their background, race, or ethnicity. Most phone companies don't charge for using your phone in Puerto Rico, but call and make sure. Okay, I think my review is long enough. . . Vive (las) Puerto Rico! lol. . . . Adios! *make sure your camera has a strap on it and put your name and number on it- I would hate for anyone else to lose their camera. * you'll easily notice that most Puerto Ricans seem to be in relationships b/c everywhere you go there will be couples *as an attractive dark-skin woman of color i felt sooo Beautiful in Puerto Rico, everywhere i went i was told how gorgeous i was, not only by Puerto Rican men (and even some women) but by many white Americans (people seem to lose their prejudices in Puerto Rico)- this made my trip even better- i felt like a Goddess there:-)", "Date": "March 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington D.

We booked this on Priceline (bidding) for $115 per night. For that price it was a steal. We booked it for before and after a cruise. It is actually a very nice hotel in a great location and has an excellent pool and beach. The hotel has a large open air lobby which is nice but not as classy as the Wyndham El San Juan but nice enough. The hotel has been built in phases over the years. We were in the original building which I prefer since all of the rooms have great water views. Some of the later buildings have sections that look out on other buildings and parking garage, etc. The rooms are a decent size with nice bathrooms and very nice beds and bedding. The furniture is a little dated. The hotel has an excellent location on a peninsula into the water on the outskirts of Old San Juan. You are only about a 10 minute ride from the cruise ships and Old San Juan. If you are looking for a lot of nightlife and shopping outside your door this is not the place for you. The nicest part of the hotel is the beach and pool area. The beach is on its own cove, not much in the way of waves, but otherwise very nice. It has a great pool area and a nice area with hammocks and palm trees for shade. We are members of the Hilton Honors and were put on the club floor. The club floors have the use of a very nice lounge with free snacks drinks, newspapers and computer. For $115 per night this was a great deal. We were originally booked at the Marriott for the stay on the return from the cruise, but at $350 a night for the Marriott and $155 for the Hilton it was a no brainer. If you are going to pay $350 a night I would consider the El San Juan or the Marriott, but with the discount rates on the Hilton it is well worth it. My only complaint was that it does not have a casino, so you need to get a cab to go to a casino or to go to other restaurants.

We traveled with 3 families with kids 10-16. 10 of us all together. We have traveled every Feb break for the last 10 years. That being said my review of the Caribe Hilton is great. The biggest problem we encountered was the wind and that had nothing to do with the hotel. Our check in was quick and painless, the only glitch was that we were all not on the same floor. We did not get crazy but asked if they could move the one family and it was done the next morning. Our reservations were for the executive level. It was worth the extra money for breakfast in the morning it had something for everyone, snacks and sodas(including water) during the day and cocktail hour at night(although they now offer a cash bar where in the past it was free). We even made it a point to be back to the hotel so we could get a cookie before bed! T hey just installed a new system to get to the executive room floors(8-10) you need to slide your room key in order to push your floor button and it did not always happen on the first try and we took a \"few\" rides up and down till we heard the \"BEEP\" and knew we were going to our floor. Our rooms were fine and I thought the bed was comfy. Like I said we have been going away for the last ten years and we have slept in some really bad beds. The pool area was clean and although this was a peak break time and the hotel seemed to be busy we never seemed to have a problem getting a bunch of chairs together. It is not like we had to get out there at 6AM. We had breakfast and got out there around 9:30 The water was a bit cool for me but the kids all got in and played around. The beach area was fine. If you are looking for waves dont look here. The beach is great for little ones. Again we never had a problem getting chairs there either. Maybe we would have to walk down the beach. But we could always get a seat. They have a list of activities down by the beach they seem to have lots of things planed for the little ones. I did see a yoga class one day and a bunch of people playing bingo another. They have a volleyball net but it is in the grass( a big disappointment for our group) but like I said it was also very windy so it would not have been fun to play anyway. We never had a problem getting a towel. Sometimes they took your room number and sometimes they did not. I am not sure how they decided what system they were using. They had basketballs that you could sign out. This trip has been planned since last june. In Jan I saw on the TA forum about a food a beverage credit through go to PR.com I called my travel agent. Our trip fit all of the criteria including the hotel. So we were given a 250.00 F&B credit to each of our rooms. That took the sting out of eating at the pool bar for lunch. We just sent the kids each day over to order lunch. We ate 3 lunches and one dinner(at the restaurant near the pool) plus a few cocktails and we each only went over the 250 by 40 dollars. Not bad. One day the dads went to subway and brought it back for us. It also helped that we brought down waters with us from the executive lounge. We took the bus(.50cents) each way exact change per person to old San juan on two evenings and had dinner and a walk about. We did take cabs back. They were ten dollars each cab. I have to mention that the buses do not run like in Cancun you will have to wait up to 20 min. It was deffinaly worth it because we could move all 10 of us for 5.00 compared to the 20 or 30 dollars for the cabs each way We walked into Condado for dinner but we took a cab back. We rented a van from \"target\"(not related to the stores) and took a tour of El Yunke and then spent the day at Luguillo beach. The beach was beautiful and you can rent chairs and umbrella right there(5.00 and 10.00 respectively). We booked a snorkle adventure through the tour desk for one day.

I am pleased to say that my experience was nothing less than wonderful. As soon as you walk into the lobby (which is open air) you are welcomed into a tropical paradise. We arrived at the hotel at 1pm and our room was not ready. However, the staff kept our luggage and we were allowed to used the hotel ammenities. The room was ready at around 2pm. The hotel is divided into two sections - the main building (which is the older) and the tower. We stayed in the main building room #639, which had a beautiful view of the ocean and the Condado Lagoon. Every room has a balcony with a small table and two chairs. The room was very comfortable and nicely decorated. The bed, pillows and sheets were very comfortable. The pool area is large, beautiful and very clean. It has a swim up bar and waterfalls. There is also a small private beach, a tropical garden with a pond filled with colorful fish and many benches, and a walkway along the beach for long walks. The hammock area was very relaxing. The Carbe Hilton is between Old San Juan and the Condado area - so you will need a taxi if you plan on going to Old San Juan or the Casinos. The restaurants are a bit expensive but what do you expect - its a hotel! I recommend going to the local small restaurants - La Hacienda in the Condado area - just a few minutes away. Both local and Mexican food - great ocean views - we went there and had a table next to the ocean - beautiful - the food was good and inexpensive (compared to the Hilton). I also recommend the Bombonera in Old San Juan - diner type setting - but you get to experience real local food at inexpensive prices. Many tourists come here to taste the Mallorca bread (puertorican danish), the coffee and the freshly squeezed orange juice. If you go to the Morro - one of the Trolleys stops at the Bombonera - and its free!

I would not believe the bad reviews. This hotel was great. I was at the hotel over winter break and the hotel was happening. The pools are great, service is great, and the hotel property is great. I would say that if you could get a rate below 250 it is definitely worth it. The location is a okay at best, but it is no big deal. There is a subway sandwich shop on the property and a convenience store too. Cabs are expensive in San Juan and based on zone. A 4 minute cab to old san juan is 11 dollars and Condanado is 15 ( I walked to Condanado in about 10 minutes) and don't even bother going to Isla Verde for 19 dollars. I had access to the Executive Lounge which was great. I recommend going to the lounge on floor 9 of the main building instead of going to the lounge in the Hhonors tower. They have fridges full of water and all types of pop that are free all day. I took the drinks and put them in the fridge that is in the room. I wasn't with little kids, but it is a fantastic hotel for kids. Plenty of shallow water in the pool area and the beach is protected by rocks, which limits the high waves that most of san juan sees. The beach is fantastic, not many waves, but a nice little stretch (especially compared to other hotels in San Juan). The rooms are a little above standard, but not extremely fancy. I went to the Old San Juan Hotel and Ritz and was not impressed. Those hotels are for people who want to tell people that \"I stayed at the Ritz or I stayed at the InterContinental. Lunch by the pool and drinks are expensive, but what do you expect, its a hilton not a Motel 6. I am not a little kid, but the coolest thing at the hotel is the fish feeding pier. They give you bread to throw in the ocean, and you get to see many different types of fish (size and color) without having to go snorkeling or scuba diving. I did not use the spa, but it did look nice (but expensive...what do you expect). The workout facility in the Spa (which if free for guests) is fantastic and overlooks the ocean. So the moral of the story...don't believe the bad reviews and if you get a good rate don't hesitate to book it. The hotel doesn't have a casino, but the candanado hotel which is about a 10 minute walk and the Marriot which is about 15 minute walk have casinos (I'd go to the Marriott...I won Big). Keep in mind this is San Juan not Las Vegas. A couple restaurants that I definitely recommend: Parrot Club (Old San Juan/Local Cuisine/Average entree 20-30), Dragon Fly (Old San Juan/Fusion between Asian and Latino Cuisine). I could write another couple pages, but I hope you get the point. This property is fantastic...if you get a good rate book it and don't worry about the bad reviews. Keep in mind most people only review a hotel when they have a great time or a terrible experience. As you could tell, I had a great time and can't wait to go back. P.S.

There are at least 3 other sections -- the Towers, the Garden Suites, and the Lagoon Villas. We have stayed only in the Towers and the main building. The main building the last 2 times we've stayed, has been in need of some remodeling. The grout around the tile and tub was cracked and black, and the tub did not turn off all the way. The wooden bathroom door and trim were starting to deteriorate from the moisture. And the tile in the bathroom was a pale mauve circa 1958, I'd guess. But everything in the room worked. The bathroom ventilation is a bit odd because you can hear people talking through it as if they were in your bathroom, but you can hear it only when you are in the bathroom. The bottom of the tub in 515 was also starting to separate from the floor, which gave a feeling of standing on a waterbed when in the bathroom. So, the room wasn't great. But we didn't really care. The tower rooms are newer and in our experience are in better condition. A tip -- book online at the Hilton website and check into the bounceback rate.

This was our 4th family stay there (and Dad had had several business visits in addition). Last year we were particularly impressed by the Executive Level lounge, where we enjoyed unlimited alcoholic beverages each evening. The hors d'oevres and desserts/coffee were also free. This was a significant factor in our returning to the Caribe. However, unannounced the hotel has changed its policy. Now there is a \"cash\" bar - with a barman - for a couple of hours only each evening. (Actually, they won't take cash, only charges to your room). Admittedly, at $3 for wine and (I think) $4 for spirits it's still a good deal compared with other bars in the hotel. However, it was disappointing. Presumably the free bar was felt to be open to abuse, costing the hotel more than it was prepared to pay for the goodwill. The hotel has a stated policy of not allowing children under 14 into the Executive Lounge. They need to enforce this. Frequently, small children were allowed to run around; one we saw burned her fingers \"playing\" with the steam option on the expresso machine. We are not against small children, but this lounge is not a suitable place for them to play. We found the hotel rather quiet: other guests opined that aggressive competition from new super-resort hotels (eg the Conquistador) is hurting the Caribe (and the Normandie Hotel next door appeared almost empty, as judged by the paucity of lit rooms at night). We ran into a demonstration one morning against the villa development on Condado: apparently some of the new building, incl the Caribe's, has encroached on the protected Old Fort site. (We didn't expect to run into a political demo against our hotel!). Overall, our stay met our expectations. Very low key and relaxing. Things we'd like improved? The infinity pool that is the centerpiece of the hotel recreation area is colder than the ocean in December. How much would it cost the hotel to heat it up a bit for its guests, who are paying plenty for the privilege of swimming in cold water? They might actually recoup the cost in swim-up patrons to the pool bar! (currently, no one is brave enough to endure to cold water to sit on the pool side of the bar). Also, get rid of the guys posted at the entrance to the pool area who check to make sure only guests get through. We encountered several who insisted we go away and return with room keys.

Spa - we had the spa vacation, so it included all the spa had to offer. The spa itself was nothing to write home about (pretty bland), but the treatments were good & we were treated pretty well. Restaurants - Breakfasts - we had breakfast included in the spa vacation and the buffet was good. Decent selection & it seemed fresh. The knock would be that it was $23 per person, but if you are on a package that includes it, it doesn't matter & is worth it. Lunch - we ate everyday at the pool bar. The food was so-so at best and we never had great service. Dinner - we only ate at Morton's, and you really can't go wrong there. Beverages - all the beverages we had were very good, and we tried a fair amount, but they were a drop pricey. Not too bad as we've been places where they were worse, but at least they were good each time. Location - for us, this was a huge plus. We wanted to have a very relaxing vacation...and this was a great location for it. We went to visit a bunch of the other big hotels - and they are all right on top of each other with planes flying over them. This hotel was out of the main area, but very close to Old San Juan as well for a little sight seeing. One note - we booked the vacation on hilton.com. After booking I checked the site a few times to see what else was available. Each time, the price of the room dropped. We started out with just a breakfast package, but ended up with a Spa package on the executive floor for less $. Once we booked that, we still noticed the price dropped a few times. Each time, we called the hotel and they quickly adjusted our price. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone else looking.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucks County, PA", "Title": "\u201cNegative Reviews Had Merit, Unfortunately for Us\u201d", "Author": "buckscountybabe", "ReviewID": "UR10969084", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a 5 day trip to San Juan. We stayed at the Caribe Hilton because he was attending a conference there. I admit I was apprehensive about the negative reviews on this site, but I've found over the years that bad reviews don't always reflect the total experience, and I try to give hotels I visit the benefit of the doubt. After all, everyone has a bad day now and then! I really believe you should not let one bad experience ruin a trip. With that in mind, we checked into the Hilton with 5 days of sun and fun on our mind. I booked the room through the Hilton website and upgraded from $179/night to a $279/night room in order to have access to the Executive Lounge (more about that later) and, I thought, to have a nicer room. Au contrare! First of all, the fees, even for a resort, are pretty steep. There is the resort fee, then tax, then (I forget all the fees) but our $279 room ended up costing $359 per night. Just be sure to figure that into your budget. When I checked in I asked Michael if the room we were in was one of the renovated rooms. He said no, but it was quite nice. When I persisted asking him if we could have one of the renovated rooms in the tower, he convinced me to look at our assigned room (921 in the main building) and then come back down if we weren't happy and he would switch it for us. We went up, weren't happy with the size of the room, the size of the bathroom, the mold on the ceiling in the bathroom and the \"blah\" furnishings. Truth to tell, I was expecting a little more for our upgraded room. Went back down, saw a different clerk at the desk, and here's where the disappointment started. I was told (1) that none of the desk clerks had seen any of the rooms that had been renovated, so they could not tell me if they would be nicer, (2) the tower rooms were VERY far away (not true) (3) they only had one room available in the tower and it faced the parking lot on a lower floor, (4) there were better rooms, but they were being saved for VIP's, so basically tough luck! I tried telling her that it was our 32nd anniversary and we had really hoped for a nice room (it really WAS our anniversary). I was met with a blank stare - a sort of non-verbal \"So What???\" Well, didn't want to ruin our vacation by fighting with a front desk staff that couldn't care less, so we made do with what we were originally assigned. Please see the photos and you'll see what I mean. We actually had to draw on our sense of humor when we pulled out the single robe. I was about to call for a second robe, then took a good look and decided we really didn't need robes. It was threadbare and looked like it had not been recently cleaned. Once the room debacle was over we settled down to enjoy our vacation. In a nutshell: Beach was very nice, water warm as bathwater, no waves and minimal equipment (like noodles and floats). Great service from the umbrella guys. Had to sign a slip for our towels - only wanted to give us one apiece! Had to make sure the slip was ripped up when towels came back or be charged $20/per towel. Ouch. Especially since the towels had seen better days. Pro: Plenty of chaises. Pool was beautiful, plenty of chairs, series of pools was big, but the hot tub was definitely a \"lukewarm\" tub, no fluke, same on all four days. Only tried the Italian Restuarant on the last night - it was okay but nothing special. The Executive Lounge was worth the extra money. Continental breakfast, tea sandwiches and fruit during the day, free sodas and water, and $3 drinks. Never too crowded and the concierge there was very helpful. I did have an 85 minute massage for $125 which was wonderful, but I have to agree with the other reviewer who said the spa was very bare bones, no amenities, with a tiny outdoor whirlpool. (But really, can anyone complain about a massage??) My husband used the gym and said the equipment was pretty good (some old, some newer) with elipticals, treadmills and bikes. Never got too crowded either. Walked to Old San Juan one day - healthy one hour walk each way. We visited El Morro - beautiful and interesting, and only $3 to get in. Kite flyers were having a ball. Walked through Old San Juan two different days - Had dinner one night at the Berlin Cafe which had good food and service. Varied menu, some Puerto Rican specialities, plus a ton of vegetarian dishes. The other night we visited the Parrot Club, which had a fun lively atmosphere and great Puerto Rican cuisine. Be advised, many of the restaurants downtown don't accept reservations per se, but you can call ahead and get on their waiting list. You should do this especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Cab to or from the old city $10. We also toured the Cathedral, which has mass Sat. at 7PM and Sunday at 9 and 11AM. It's right down the street from Ben and Jerrys - yumm! One other great place to try for dinner is Pamela's Restaurant (recommended by the concierge). About a 10 minute cab ride (not sure of the section of the city), but right on the beach. We ate outside on the sand and had a gorgeous view and excellent seafood and service. Highly recommended. All in all a great vacation, not spoiled by the bad room or indifferent service at the hotel. YES, I will return to Puerto Rico (next time to see the rainforest), but NO I would never stay at the Caribe Hilton again. There are too many other great resorts to waste time on this has-been hotel.

The hotel also has lots of games/toys for kids to play with (such as slides into the ocean, floaties, etc). The service is also fantastic -- everywhere, from the reception to the staff at the pool. What we didn't like about the hotel: We weren't at all impressed with the food (at the poolside bar and grill). On that note, there is a Starbucks onsite and a Subway and mini-mart (with snack food, drinks, etc) across the street from the hotel, which were convenient. The rooms really do need an upgrade. We had one room in the main wing, which was fairly run down (especially the bathroom). The other half of our group stayed in a room in the Honors tower -- that had clearly been upgraded and was a lot nicer. Spa: I got a massage at the spa. The massage itself was good, but I was unimpressed with the rest of the spa -- it was very bare bones and not at all luxurious (prices of services were on par with other spas I have been to) -- not quite the overall experience I had been looking forward to. Other: Location is pretty good -- a ten minute drive from Old San Juan. We were told that there is also a bus that you can take from outside the hotel to Old San Juan that is pretty convenient.

I took this trip by myself looking for a great week of rest, relaxation and a little bit of fun in between. Well, I definately got the rest and relaxation but I was missing a lot of the fun part. My room was beautiful with the most gorgeous marble/glass bathroom with a big ol' sexy shower, his and her sinks and a tinyitty bitty toilet pushed up in a corner behind the bathroom door! lol!! Other then the compromised space of the toilet, the bathroom was great, the room was a decent size and the bed was hell-a comfy!!! I had a room on a high floor overlooking the ocean and resort and let's not forget the dirty old building of the second hotel tower right smack in the middle of your view. And its nothing nice to look at. Trust me. I don't know whose bright idea it was to build a new tower of the hotel over looking the old one with teases of oceanview on your right and left sides. I feel sorry for the people that were below me on lower floors because I'm sure they got to experience more of the second tower then I did as they were not high enough to over look most of the building. So anyway, I had a spa package guys. The spa was great! I received a wonderful sweedish massage, manicure, pedicure and facial. But beware people...They charge tax for spa services. Now eventhough the spa services were included in my hotel price, I was still charged around $65 in taxes for the three days I was there. Definately caught me off guard. Now as far as dining and entertainment is concerned, they have a great little bar located in the lobby. Drinks are pricey but where are they not pricey? They have $3 beers during Happy Hour so make sure you rack up. There's also a swim up bar outside at the pool where you can order burgers and finger foods which are pretty tasty. That's only if you need a quick snack. I did not eat at Morton's Steak House because of the reviews that I read about the prices and quality. So for the most part, I ate in old San Juan a couple of times, therefore, I can't comment too much on the food at the hotel. I did receive complimentary buffet breakfast at the main hotel restaurant (sorry, I forgot the name) which was pretty good. You get omlets to order and an erray of breakfast treats. The pool and beach area are very nice with tons of places to set up lounge chairs. The beach is man made (what's with these resorts with man made beaches?) But if you're looking for a hotel with the watersports and outdoor activities, then this is not the place for you!! There's no casino, no water sports, no activites, nothing!! It kind of sucked! There was really nothing special about this hotel except for the over-priced food (which was nothing to brag about either when I did get a chance to eat there) and the hell-a comfy bed. If you want good food you're gonna have to take a $20 cab ride to Old San Juan. Aguasvivas was great! And word to the wise...... If you're gonna take a trip to the Bacardi Factory, call them first to make sure they are open. I was told by one of the travel agents at the hotel that the Bacardi factory was open 7 days a week eventhough the hotel only offered its tour on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday but you can take a 20 minute ride out there yourself and get a tour. SO.... that's what I did. I hopped in a cab and went over to the Bacardi Distillery just to find out that the place was closed!!! I paid $50 for a cab ride to nowhere!!!! Also, don't be fooled by the little boutiques at the hotel. If you walk right down the street there is a little bodega that sells souveniers for half the price. I racked up on those!! Overall, the hotel was nothing exciting. The people were pleasant, they all spoke English but it was like being in New York City with a tropical feel. Everyone is Amercianized.

The hotel has put in an artificial reef on the beach which kept the water calm and made for some great snorkeling. The health club was very good too. I didn't try the spa. The down side is that the hotel is quite isolated from everything else. When I was there, quite a bit of construction was going on, which made walking to Condado Beach impossible. Not really the fault of the hotel. But, there aren't any restaurants within walking distance, so you either have to grab a cab to get something to eat or pay the prices at the hotel, quite expensive! The food was good though, even at poolside. Go to Isla Verde beach. Old San Juan is a shopper's paradise, but as I'm not into shopping, I didn't really enjoy it so much.

In any event, beautiful location, food is a bit high(ex. $100 on dinner 1 ngt..Subway @ top of blk $15 for 3/ngt) but overall nice location.With that, I took my time to explore Ft. Geronimo out back...and went to Ft. San Cristobal, sunburned but it was worth it. Condado is nice too.

I travelled with my 19 year old daughter and my seven year old and I have to say, the staff was very nice and they certainly went out of their way to accomodate children of all ages, myself included, LOL!!. One instance in particular. We were fish feeding by the small pier next to the beach area when my son's favorite hat in the whole world flew away and landed in the water between the rocks. He was devastated!! This hat has alot of sentimental value to my son, so I took a chance and asked two employees if there was anything they can do. Without question or hestitation these nice gentlemen sprung into action and before I knew it they climbed onto the rocks (which is prohibited to vacationers) and used a tool that extended very far out and managed to capture my son's hat. I was cheering and people around me kept asking \"what's going on?\", when I told them, they just shrugged their shoulders. My son was totally elated and thanked each and every one of them with a big hug. This was definitely a \"Catch Me At My Best Caribe Moment\".

I did not understand the review that said that the beach was too far it was right there. Downside: the beach is not open so you can't go for long walks.

I was a bit scared to stay here after reading the reviews, but I am so glad I did! I stayed for 8 days at the Hilton Caribe in June. My boyfriend and I booked a King Executive Room, however, when we got there we opted to move into the Hilton Honors Tower. The Executive room was incredibly comfortable, and the only reason we switched to the Honors Tower was because of the HUGE shower. After reading reviews on here, I knew that I didn't want to stay in one of the old, regular [cheaper] guestrooms. Every aspect of our trip was incredible - the breakfast buffet was included in our package, and it was amazing. A bit too much for for us to handle, so we took advantage of the modest, but good breakfast offered in the Executive or Honors lounges - they have amazing cookies too! A nice feature about staying in either an Executive room or the Honors TOwer is access to their lounges, where you get free drinks [which we stocked in our fridge, so we didn't feel so bad about paying $15 for suntan lotion!] We ate at the hotel - for a buffet [which was actually worth the price!] and in the Italian restaurant, which was okay. We also had a 'romantic' meal in the hotel - which was absolutely amazing. I'm not sure if it was a mistake or not, but our drinks were also comped for during the meal - tally up a few mojitos, and that can really add up!! We were also given complinetary champagne, which was great! We toured Old San Juan - a must, Bacardi factory [free drinks!!] a snorkle excursion from Farjado was included in our stay [a must regardless if it's included or not!!!] and we treated ourselves to a couples massage in the spa [great for my boyfriend considering he was home on leave from Iraq!!!] We ate at several charming restaurants on the island, including one where you sit directly on the beach - fantastic! The concierge desk has a virtual computer where you can see menus from many restaurants, maps, etc... it's a really wonderful feature! I also love the fact there is an airline kiosk so you can check in at the hotel - really saved us some time! I also loved the private beach! It's a good size and there is plenty of room. Obviously prices at hotel restaurants are a bit on the more expensive side, I've never been one that hasn't been!

If given the chance to do it over, I would certainly return. My wife and I (particularly my wife) are very discriminating travelers. Were we to go to Puerto Rico alone, we'd be unlikely to return. However, the Caribe Hilton was certainly fine enough to satisfy us (even her), and for a work-outing, it was a perfect fit. The outside areas of the hotel are beautifully done. The water is great, the resort property is vast and diverse, and in general, it was well-kept. The public areas of the hotel were spacious, clean and inviting. As for the rooms, this is not a new hotel. It has gone through a major renovation and we were not displeased - but you can only cover up so much in a 50-year hotel. Be sure you stay in one of the newer sections of the property! Here are some I shared with our travel agent who had directed us to this property: 1. For what it is, the resort is great. Compared to other convention resorts, it scores well. As a high-end luxury retreat, it would not fare as well. The property is definately feeling its age - even in the tower where we stayed, they can only paint over, plaster over and carpet over so much. The common areas were good, and the pool/beach areas were laid out very nicely. But, it's not a new hotel. 2. I found the location to be excellent. It's 10 minutes from the airport, within walking distance of casinos and restaurants, and its location on the water was great. The property is basically encased by two old forts, surrounded by a low stone wall, and in beautiful water. The outdoor area offers a great combination of pool (with waterfalls), beach, shaded hammocks, and grassy areas lined with palms. 3. The spa was top notch. This includes the fitness center. High marks all around. 4. We ate at two of the on-property restaurants. I would suggest doing no more than eating lunch at the property. The restaurants weren't bad, they just were very over-priced for what ended up being pretty pedestrian food and service. 5. We went to three restaurants for dinner in Old San Juan. One was a local dive in a neighborhood we probably shouldn't have ventured to ... but it was great. The other two we would highly recommend: The Parrott Club and Aqua Viva.

I have been traveling to Puerto Rico all of my life and used to stay in the Caribe Hilton in the 1970's-1980's. The hotel recently underwent rennovations in the lobby. The rennovations are nice but to me I feel that the hotel has lost a lot of it's Puerto Rican charm. It seems to have become a mega resort. What I mean by that, is that it is not anymore a tranquil hotel as I remembered from my youth but is now a bustling resort with too many people and extremely high prices. We stayed in a garden room on the 10th floor. We had a beautiful view of the gardens below, the beautiful sea surrounding us and the historic fort. The rooms are pretty well maintained although I do think they can use some rennovations. The first and last nights that we stayed at the hotel were very nice and quiet. However the 2nd night of our stay was horrible. I cannot say it is the fault of the hotel but the people staying around us. They were slamming the doors all night long which of course made it very difficult to sleep. On our first day there we arrived around lunch time and had lunch in the grille. The food was very good and the lunch menu was pretty reasonable. We also decided to have dinner there. They offer different buffets every night of the week and although the food looked good we decided to order off of the menu. The dinner was o.k. and again the prices were o.k. On our second day we decided to have breakfast also in the grille. Well, this is where they really get you. When we first sat down they did not give us a menu. There was however a menu on the table. The menu only showed 2 or 3 options and then the $20.50 buffet. Well we are not huge eaters and so did not want to spend the $20.50 for the small amount of food we would be eating. We were about to leave when my husband asked if that was all they served. At that point, the waiter said, \"oh, no, we have another menu.\" I am assuming from what happened to us, that they try to get everyone to order the buffet so they do not give the full menu unless you ask for it. Well, needless to say, we ordered from the regular menu and to be perfectly honest, we ended up spending the same amount that we would have spent had we ordered the buffet. For an order of French Toast, eggs, orange juice and a cup of coffee it ended up costing us over $40.00. We have stayed in many resorts of this kind and even larger ones and have never, ever paid anything like that for breakfast. With that being said, I feel like they definitely take advantagebecause there are not a lot of places to go that are near the hotel. Fortunately, there is a Starbucks in the lobby and although you cannot get a hot breakfast from them at least you can get something to hold you over for breakfast and not spend a ton of money. We opted to eat breakfast at Starbucks for the remainder of our stay and it actually was quite good. If you are looking for Puerto Rican cuisine in the Condado area, we ate at 2 pretty good restaurants for dinner. The first was Ajili Mojili. It is pretty moderately priced and the atmosphere and most important the food was very good. The other place I would recommend would be Ropa Vieja. If you only have one night to eat in the Condado area then this is the place I would say to visit. The atmosphere is really nice and the food is wonderful. Check out the spa at the Normandie Hotel, right next to the Caribe Hilton. Although it is a very small spa, the service is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.

The cost of a single mixed drink, with a modest tip, will set you back $11. And, while they have 4 restaurants on the premises, they all charge Hilton prices. We saved some cash by eating several meals at the Subway nearby and taking advantage of the small market, where you can buy a liter of PR's finest for less than the cost of one mixed drink by the pool.

I read reviews of multiple hotels before made reservations and decided to stay at Caribe Hilton. Great choice! I was a little concerned about reviews that mentioned molding rooms that smelled awful. As soon as I booked my trip I called the hotel directly and asked for a recently renovated room. My request was honored. We were placed in HH Towers. The room was great - we asked for 2 double beds - they were so comfortable. The room was rather spacious and the bathroom was great too - with nice shower. I read in one of the reviews that if you stay in the Towers you get access to free continental breakfast. Right on! We got free breakfast every morning - just swipe your access key and it works. Another tip -- there are free appetizers and rather cheap alcohol between 5 and 7.30pm every day served in the same lounge where you eat breakfast. Everybody complains about how expensive everything at the resort is, but if you go to the executive lounge you get $3 glass of wine and $4 hard liquor.... you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat that, can you? Plus you get free appetizers. About food - I live in NYC so to me it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem overpriced. There is Subway next to the hotel but I would rather personally get a nice sandwich and salad at the Grill at the Hotel for $7 than a nasty sandwich at Subway for $5. You decide. Food is delicious at all the restaurants located in this hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what others complain about - lobby is spectacular, the beach area is secluded and just perfect. Pool area is large too. No problem getting towels or umbrella. Staff is very friendly and ready to help. Example: I was ordering lunch while lounging by the pool. The waiter came over to take my order. She asked if I wanted a drink - I said no and she saw that I had a bottle of water standing on my table. In few minutes she came back with my sandwich and glass full of ice- I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even ask for it! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I call great service- when you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have to ask for it. Condado area is located across a bridge and is about 15-20 min walk away. There are many restaurants there. I was not impressed by any of them. But again, I am very picky having lived in NYC. There is a small convenience store next to the hotel. If you are out of sunscreen, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy it at the store located on hotel's premises (outrageous prices) - walk a few steps over to the convenience store and pay just $7. As far as activities are concerned, we went on sailing and snorkeling tour which was great! They take you to 2 different islands and there is so much fish there, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breathtaking. I booked the trip at the activities desk at the hotel. It was $89/person including tax and it included free bus ride to Fajardo area as well. We also went to Old San Juan - not on tour, just took a cab - it was $12 on the way there and $10 back. We went to El Morro - admission is $3/person and it was really cool. The food was way better in Old San Juan than in Condado. Try Berlin Cafe. It was great. We didnt rent a car - we figured we would not need it. There are cabs everywhere and there is so much to do at the hotel plus the different tours available i thought it was unnecessary to have a car.", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood enough\u201d", "Author": "Jolenie", "ReviewID": "UR7715099", "Content": "I had some trepidations about staying at this hotel after reading some of the other reviews. After a pleasant four day stay at this hotel, I have to conclude that those who hated the place either had unrealistic expectations, or they were given a completely unrenovated room.

We did request the Hilton Honors tower, and were somewhat surprised and disappointed when we were told that they didn't have a room available in the tower. However, we were given a room on one of the higher floors in the main building, which they considered to be an \"executive room\". Perks included use of the Executive room which provided a free Continental breakfast, coctail hour (mainly cheese and fruit), dessert in the evening, and free access to the internet. Given the expensive restaurants in the hotel, the breakfast saved us a decent amount of money, and consisted of the usual Continental fare. The food was constantly being replenished by the staff. The room was on the smaller side, but not tiny. It had relatively new carpeting and a decent bathroom. It was well maintained and very clean. The duvet cover was pilling which was annoying because the white threads stuck to our pj's, but otherwise, the bed was comfortable. The lobby was attractive and open. The beach was great for swimming and kayaking. I loved it because the water was calm and clear. For those who like to surf, find another hotel. Palm trees provided shade if you didn't want to get an umbrella. Chairs were plentiful on the beach and by the pool. The restaurants were generally overpriced and the food just OK, except for the Lemongrass which was fabulous. It was romantic and the food was wonderful. All in all, if you view the Caribe Hilton as a 3.5 star hotel and not a 4 star hotel, you shouldn't be disappointed.

They failed to warn us that the ocean views were obstructed by construction, unless you stay in the higher floors. I must admit though, the bed was comforatable and the pillows were wonderful. We spent some time laying in the sun and watching families swim in the hotel's cove, only to learn from the local news later that evening that there was a city-wide alert warning people not to swim in the waters near the hotel that day due to a health hazard having to do with raw sewage being dumped into the ocean water nearby. We were surprised that the hotel chose not to limit access to the cove by its guest. Finally, when we were checking out of the hotel, we noticed a charge was posted on our bill titled Voluntary Contribution to the Children of Puerto Rico fund or similar. There was nothing voluntary about it. Apparently they conveniently slip this charge into the room bills, and unless you happen to notice and dispute it, you pay it. I told some Puerto Rican friends about this and they found it humorous that the hotel would attempt such a thing, assuring me that the funds did not get used for that purpose. So, for the next time I stay at the Caribe Hilton, I would like to thank them in advance for the \"voluntary contribution\" of a comfy fluffy Hilton pillow my luggage, as my wife so happens to be a former Child of Puerto Rico.

I think it could use new carpeting. The bathroom was updated recently. We had a great view of the ocean and the beds were very comfortable. Make sure you get a topsheet on your bed. We did not and asked for one. We ate breakfast downstairs at the Hilton Honors free breakfast. It was perfect for our family as it had bagels, cereal and fruit and sweets. There is soda and water available all day at the Honors room and also had free appetizers at night. Lunches we had mostly by the pool/beach area. We found the food to be fresh and good. Dinners on property we had were, Madrid-This was just okay. I would not return although the waiters were very nice, the food was pricey and very mediocre. Il Giardano-The italian restaurant was our favorite. I would gladly go back. I had the veal parmigiana and it was excellent. We also ate twice in the buffet restaurant for dinner called Palmeras. The roasted meats night was a good variety and we enjoyed it and found the price reasonable. The lobster night was expensive and disappointing. I would not go back for that. The grounds are large and have everything for a relaxing vacation. We were truly spent much of our town at the resort. The beach is small, but the ocean was calm enough for the kids to swim and enjoy. There was very good snorkeling around the rock areas and my husband learned to scuba dive next door and swam just past the rocks with the scuba group. He said this was the best experience and highly recommends it. We would definitely go back to the Caribe Hilton. I think some rooms are older and more worn than others.

The lobby was nice. The bell men were cute and the rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Our first room had some leakage problems and we were promptly relocated (with help) and given a $100 credit. After realizing all the taxi rides were going to cost a small fortune, we chose the bus. Only $.75 each way! The bus goes everywhere from Old San Juan to Isle Verde and even the airport. Old San Juan is nice and perfect for tourists. We found a little shack by the port that served the best Marlin pastelillos, the manager, Andres is really nice. We also caught the ferry over to the Bacardi plant for free drinks!!! The souvenir shops definitely weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as cheap as the Bahamas. The clubs were okay. Too many young people though. Senior Frogs has a great atmosphere but leaves something to be desired in the food department. We decided we wanted to get away from the tourist spots and wanted to rent a car. The Hertz desk at the hotel wanted $40 a day!!! So I went down to the business center which is open 24 hours a day and booked a small compact car using Hotwire for $12.95 a day. The total for the day was less than $20. The only bad thing is the $14 parking fee at the hotel is ridiculous!!! We rode the bus to the airport, picked up the car, and hit the highway. There are small tolls as you drive up the highway, the most expensive one was $1.50. We drove up to the El Yunque rainforest, which was only a 45 minute drive. The tours from area hotels range from $40-$50. So we were expecting an entrance fee of some sort. Well to our surprise it was completely FREE. We walked the trail to the La Mina waterfall.

We also had dinner at Cafe Puerto Rico in Old San Juan, which was great but very touristy. Tamarind Steak and Seafood had exceptional food and great service too. Also, if you purchased an executive-level room, you were given access to the Executive Lounge, which provided breakfast, appetizers, and desserts. Good buy! We went horseback riding at the base of the El Yunque Rainforest, which is the only rainforest in the US National Forest Registry. The tour guides were funny and playful, and the horses were active and fun. We stopped off at a swimming hole and swam a little and then continued on to a mountain restaurant for drinks. Very quaint. We also snorkeled daily in the private beach, but I do recommend bringing your own snorkel equipment. The hotel charges $10/hour but you can purchase for approx $30 at the store. I enjoyed the Pina Colada at the Hilton, but the one at Barrachina in Old San Juan (both claim to be the birthplace of the Pina Colada) was better. They didn't use ice to chill the mix, leaving it thicker and less watery. It was also sweeter and had more of a pineapple taste. Old San Juan has beautiful architecture, old churches, old Spanish forts, art museums, and cobblestone streets. It also had mainstream shops and a lot of touristy shops, all with the same items. Not to mention, a lot of pigeons! Don't worry about not speaking Spanish - most people speak English and most all places have English and Spanish translations. All in all, it was a great place to visit and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNice stay\u201d", "Author": "Luv2TravelNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR7343257", "Content": "We recently returned from a 6 night stay at the Caribe Hilton (3/30-4/5).

Only ding on room was there was no bathtub (instead a very large shower) which prefer for the little ones. As mentioned in prior reviews, the grounds are very nice. I found the staff on the whole very friendly and accomadating as well. Our package (booked through a travel agent) included complimentary breakfast. The breakfast buffet was one of the better ones I have seen compared to other hotels in this class and price range. The Lemongrass restaurant located on the property was outstanding. As a comparison, we stayed four years ago in PR at the Marriott Stelaris. Would give the Hilton higher marks on grounds, pool and private beach. Marriott's main advantage is that it is right in the heart of Condado so you can walk right out the door and hit restaurants and shopping.

The beaches of San Juan are comparable to those of southern (Miami) Florida, with nice sand and clear water. We experienced some of Puerto Rico's prettiest beaches on a day trip to the offshore isle of Culebra, which has little to recommend it other than its beautiful sand and waters. San Juan's history -- especially the old Spanish fortifications -- is interesting, if a bit underwhelming. The nearby rainforest of El Yunque National Park was certainly beautiful, though not quite as spectacular as I had expected. That said, both old San Juan and El Yunque offer quick, easy, and interesting diversions if you do not want to spend all day at the beach. The people of Puerto Rico were very kind and accomodating and one young man gave us a friendly and free ride back to San Juan from Fajardo (1 hour +) one disastrous evening (long story). When my husband and I travel without children we stay at the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental hotels, so we are accustomed to good hotels. However, when we travel with our kids we try to stay at hotels that have nice pools, good activities and a lot of space. The Hilton El Caribe was wonderful on all counts. The rooms themselves are best described as perfectly standard and good business-class hotel accomodations. Our room -- a King Garden Suite (# 843) -- consisted of two connecting rooms. Each room had its own entry door, work area, mini refridgerator, safe, telephone, television and balcony. The main room had a king-size bed (quite comfortable), a full bathroom (standard), and a spacious and separate entry foyer. The second room had a full-size, pullout sofabed and a half bathroom. Pleasantly, our rooms had views of the old Fort San Geronimo (on site) and the ocean, and importantly, we experienced absolutely no daytime or evening noise. The El Caribe's grounds are quite lovely and especially fun for kids. There is a large main pool, subdivided into separate pool areas with waterfalls, or a basketball hoop, a bar, or hot tubs. The Condado Villas have a separate, more secluded and smaller pool area with its own hot tub. We generally retreated to that pool area to relax at the end of the day. The hotel has a private, man-made beach with fronts a clear, calm and small little inlet. The calm, inlet ocean water has waterslides and you can rent little boats. In addition, the El Caribe's grounds have a large carp, goldfish and koi pond. There are basketball and shuffleboard areas. There is a small children's playground. There is a pier where you can feed and observe fish in the open the ocean day or night. There are chessboards and other outdoor games scattered throughout the place. For adult relaxation, there is a nice health club, outdoor morning yoga classes, three outdoor bars, lounge chairs everywhere (on the beach, by the pool, facing the ocean pier) and hammocks in a lovely grove of palm trees. The is an onsite rental car agency (Hertz), and travel tour company (didn't use it). Finally, the El Caribe has many on-site restaurant choices (though we usually went offsite), including the truly good and relaxing Lemongrass, as well as a Starbucks coffee, Morton's steak house, Madrid tapas, and a standard hotel restaurant which hosts a breakfast buffet (kids are free) and dinner every day. The hotel's location is convenient, fifteen minutes to the airport and five minutes to Old San Juan. In short, the Hilton El Caribe -- opened as the El Caribe in 1949 -- is as good a place to stay in San Juan as any, especially with children. I would certainly stay there again if I ever return to San Juan.", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cOne star room in 5-star surroundings\u201d", "Author": "staceyglow", "ReviewID": "UR7276761", "Content": "First of all, I will state up front that I booked this hotel room through Hotwire. Because I know I am paying possibly the lowest rate in the entire hotel (which was still quite a bit of money), I don't expect the best room they have. However, I do expect to have a room at the quality level that they have promised Hotwire (which was 4 stars). I have used Hotwire on quite a few other occasions, and this has never been a problem before now. People reading this review should know that I am not one of those TripAdvisor members that appear to be chronic complainers; I don't like to let minor annoyances or inconveniences ruin my vacation, and this is the first negative travel review that I have ever written. My family and I arrived at the Hilton Caribe and I was extremely impressed by the gorgeous grounds and the beautiful lobby. An employee offered us complimentary chilled bottles of water as we checked in. I made a mental note to tell my father, a Hilton Honors Diamond level member, that this might be the place he may want to spend some of his accumulated points. Then we were shown to our room. My jaw dropped. This is a four-star hotel room? Frankly, I have had Motel 6 rooms that were nicer. The seams in the carpet were raveling. The curtain rod for the sheers had pulled out of the drywall and was hanging cock-eyed. While the view contained some lovely tropical plants, it was primarily of a side of a building covered by rust stains and dripped paint. Even though the square footage of the bathroom was rather large, it only contained a tiny, fiberglass modular shower unit (no tub) and a stand-alone single vanity. Both of them looked like very cheap Home Depot cash-and-carry fixtures. If were were staying more than one night, and my family hadn't been exhausted from our travel, I would have asked for a different room. I joked to my husband that this was probably not the room Paris stays in when she visits this hotel! I should also add that my room was accross the hall from a room that had the ice machine and the service elevator. The door to this room had extremely squeaky hinges (do they not have WD-40 in Puerto Rico?), and all night long I was treated to the loud squeaking of the door hinges and the dinging of the service elevator whenever it reached our floor (which, being the main floor, was often.). Let me say that the facilities are beautiful. This hotel is out on a nice point of land, and they have a gorgeous pool area and a beach that has a reef further out that calms the waves before they hit the swimming area. Besides the Starbucks(for breakfast the next morning). the only meal that we ate there was lunch at their outdoor bar and grill. Warning: if you are watching your budget, pay attention to your beverages. Our family had a meal of 3 chicken tender baskets, a hot dog, 2 pina coladas, 2 virgin pina coladas, and 4 soft drinks, and the bill before tip was $92.00. Turns out that that the virgin pinas were $7.50 each (they only charge you a buck more for the booze) and the cokes were $3.25 each . I realize that this is the typical prices one pays at a big-city Hilton, but they were the highest by far I had paid for drinks anywhere else in the Caribbean. I guess that going forward, I am going to have to decide whether to look cheap and ask the drink prices ahead of time or just order with my fingers crossed and hope for the best. My advice? This looks like a nice place to stay if you get a good room (I'd ask to see it first, and make sure it is in one of the newer buildings) and you can afford it.

Super room with fluffy pillows, and NO MOLD (!!) & a lovely view of the lagoon, old fort, and city. Since we were starved, we ventured down to the bar in hopes of getting a few peanuts; we were greeted by a lovely young lady who suggested a club sandwich, hot wings, & salad to share with a cold, cold beer for my husband and a yummy pina colada for me. At midnight, this seemed like filet mignon; it was quite good. What a great relief! While the food at the hotel is pricey (you won't find MacDonald's prices, but what do you expect!! ), it was always good quality, no matter which restuarant. Our favorite was the Lemongrass restuarant; plan ahead & make a reservation. We loved eating on the terrace, enjoying flora, fauna, & the swans in the lagoon - especially at sunset! Even though we ate several times in Old San Juan (@ El Pescador (!), Marmelade, El Convento, Panzo, & Parrot Club) , we purposely wanted to eat 2 additional nights at the Lemongrass. A meal can be made from just the hors d'oeuvres. An excellent drink, not on the menu, is fresh mango juice with Chopin vodka, straight up. There were 3 different conventions last weekend, but they were not noisey (Boston Mutual, Psychiatrists, and a retail association). We saw very few children, and very few college students on vacation. The experience at the Caribe Hilton was very positive and enjoyable - The Caribe Hilton staff were very professional and pleasant. Their English is impeccable and they were mostly (see note below) exceedingly helpful. My only criticism of the hotel lies with the Concierge service. If you are not already booked through a convention for reservations to local events/tours, then forget it. Whenever we tried to talk with them, neither my husband nor I, nor the other couple (who also stayed at the Caribe Hilton), could get the concierge to help us! We were given an \"I don't know,\" or an \"I can't help you\" (and a look of 'don't bother me'). They obviously missed the training class for personalism & positive demeanor when dealing with guests. [Then WHO IS at the hotel to help individuals?] If the general manager of the hotel reads this review (not likely!), I would suggest that he/she fire ALL of them & start again with 2 different desks - ONE DESK for conventioneers, & the SECOND DESK for individuals & families. Fortunately, the four of us are seasoned & adventurous in making our own plans, even in broken Spanish.

I later found out that they will sell an executive level room to anyone that is willing to pay an extra $100 dollars and then stick you in a normal room with access to the executive level lounge. The room that I was given on the 6th floor was noisy, dirty and quite old looking. The bathroom had rust stains all over the bath tub, walls and plaster falling from the ceiling.

There must have been 150 people in an executive level lounge made to hold 25 people at the most. In addition to that there were plenty of screaming kids running around making lots of noise (I thought this was supposed to be an executive level lounge not a day care center). The breakfast selection was lacking. I also later found out that the complimentary beverages during happy hour are no longer complimentary (Cash Bar). This is the first executive level lounge that I have ever been in that charges you for a beer. The pool area is probably the high light of this hotel. Nice large pools and a beach area. The only downside is a million screaming kids. Service at this hotel is definitely lacking. The staff is very slow and makes no effort to help you.

Your best bet for a relaxing vacation is always choosing the best room you can get. (remember this resort is one of the oldest in san juan...so new areas have been built some rooms upgraded and redesigned...you can have a low floor, high floor) I think the rooms can vary at caribe hilton this can sway your rating....our room was great with great view 2. Your in san juan area if your looking just to stay on el caribe premisses that have a little built up laggon area, a number of pools, a shopping plaza with a starbucks, clothing, shoes....so if you really want to stay put you could....but most people I would believe want to venture ot to old san juan or condado area....to see the scene or possilbly to go to a casino....in the neighboring area of condado...most of those hotels have them...el condado, marriott...etc...you could actually walk there but the bridge that connects caribe hilton area with condado area is a little dark at night to cross...i would cab it 3. food there is a mortons on premises....also hilton breakfast buffet...was ok......if you not a morning person ...you can just goto starbucks...but if you plan on eating breakfast everyday try to get breakfast included...could be pricey if you don't. 4. the hotel staff were excellent and there advice ...right on the money....they told us to go to a place for seafood named aquaviva in old san juan...when we were about to go exploring...the place was yummy...cerviche great...so were the oysters rockafeller...we even got to see an equestrian street show (just happened to be going on the weekend we visited) hole thing was delightful...we stumbled on a place called ropa vieja while walking in condado...was a great dinner!!!! 5. the pools were clean and beautiful....be careful who you sit next to though....one women was on her cell loudly...talking about her stupid haphazard posting of her CV on monster.com...yap yap...and how she was getting job offers...new york ...penn....NJ...if your reading this and this was you....women you got to learn to be discreet...you were too...loud...we didn't need to know your business but man we had no chioce....lol... (sorry I got off track :o) back to my review): 6. Bar areas.....very nice.....even to just check out....big screen tv indoors near main lobby...great......live music....great>>we didn't mind paying for our liquor (were from NY and bars can be pricey) BUT so people doing this (tip: drinks expensive: Get plastic cups from bar (buy a drink, keep cup) then store bears liquor in your room that you bought from airport or from shops, groceries stores (not many in the area so try to find some when your getting there or out and about otherwise you will need transportation to get to a place that has it at a good price). 7. Great location-If you stay in isla verde where a majority of the hotels are....you will have to deal with the noise of the airport...very very loud I saw reviews where for a couple of seconds you can't hear your own conversations......caribe hilton was in a perfect location....further away from airport.....only heard prop planes from small airport in the area and that was occasional. 8.Room service -yummy 9. history - this hotel has history...thats why the have so much grounds becuase they had this area for so long...most hotels don't have so much area---as you can tell by the fort on the premisses with nice views of ocean crashing on rocks...there is a view of the lagoon...there is a small beach area...very diverse...the grounds are well kept and they have a beautiful veranda area with swans...very peaceful This hotel definetly is what you make of it and your trip...If you get a nice room, happen to have great weather and go exploring...youll get the best out of this hotel...

Still, I think we could both see the virtues and faults of the Caribe Hilton (and this was only 2 nights of a 2-week Carribean vacation). We picked it because I have oodles of Hilton points from business travel and we were attracted to the location between Old San Juan and Condado, the two areas where we were considering staying. The hotel gave us a very nice ocean-facing room with a balcony (perhaps because of my diamond status with Hilton.). The room was clean and seemed recently renovated. The beds were extremely comfortable. The A/C was way too cold, and despite changing the thermostat, it only seemed to stop cranking out cold air when we turned it all the way off. The view of the ocean, Fort San Geronimo, and over to Condado was spectacular. The hallways, on the other hand, had a fair amount of peeling paint, etc. Perhaps more renovations are on their way? The setting is beautiful... a scenic beach (on a lagoon, not the open ocean), lots of palm trees, a curvy walkway along the ocean's edge, etc. Adjacent Fort San Geronimo added a nice touch to our view. Too bad it seems to be permanently closed. Despite the beautiful location, the overall atmosphere is way to cruise-shippy for our tastes (shuffleboard, etc.). As soon as the sun came down each night, the bar (located in the open-air lobby) featured a loud lounge singer and back-up musicians whose Vegas-meets-Carribean sound echoed throughout the lobby and outdoor areas). The location--which we had predicted would be a key positive aspect--was in some ways minus. Although it's between Old San Juan and Condado, it's actually a bit far of a walk to either, requiring a $20 taxi (for about a <2 mile trip?!!) to get to most restaurants and nightlife. The sheer size of this sprawling complex--a plus for many, I'm sure, was a bit of a minus for us. It made us feel a bit detached from the rest of the city. The service was mixed. While we were waiting in the long Hilton Honors check-in line, a helpful staff member directed us to another check-in location, at the \"HHonors\" tower (named as an attempt to make us feel special, I suppose). The service was incredibly slow at the bars and restaurants. We ordered food service on our first night. Don't do it! Our chicken quesadilla was late, cold, flavorless, and overpriced. The executive lounge had a great view, but was packed at breakfast and the staff couldn't keep up with clearing dishes and replenishing supplies. They also cleared all of the food out immediately at 11 am (closing time), which we found particularly annoying since we had spent the last 15 minutes chasing down staff to replenish the already near-depleted supply of food as well as bowls and plates to put the food on. The concierge was very helpful in providing us info and restaurant reservations. The turndown service was also a nice extra--not something I've found at most Hiltons. We'll probably pick somewhere else when we return to San Juan, but wouldn't be totally adverse to staying at the Caribe Hilton again to save money by using Hilton points (We were not particularly interested in the other Hilton family hotels in San Juan, since they are all loacted in Isla Verde--near the airport, an area of less interest to us.).

The air conditioning did not work well and there was no way to change it (preset at the high 60's F). The toilet leaked around the base, the balcony door had no lock, and there was a strange wire protruding from the floor by the balcony door. We were given a different room and everything was fine. As noted by others the beds are wonderful. This time the air conditioning (still preset) worked fine. The flat-screen TV was a nice touch. The remainder of our stay from a room standpoint was fine but you shouldn't have this kind of issue with a \"multi-star\" Hilton resort and if we'd arrived later in the day our room options would have been more limited. Food at the restaurant and elsewhere in San Juan is expensive unless you stay away from the restaurants frequented by tourists. You can easily spend $50 per person without drinks. On the other hand, I did grab lunch on the run at the Subway across the street one day for around $8.00. All in all, the location is not bad (a short cab ride into old San Juan) and aside from the initial room issues, I have no complaints.

We were looking for a resort experience with the option to visit Old San Juan easily. While this resort had both of these, it was not special in any way. 1) The room. The room which we reserved was in the Garden Tower. This tower is 8 stories and all rooms have a vew overlooking the birdsanctuary and if you are high enough, the ocean. While the view was lovely, the room was terrible. We should have known there was a problem when we opened the door and it was mildly warped. The room was damp and mildewy. Even the carpet was damp. It seems that our door to the balcony did not seal and the island humidity had gotten the best of our room. The hotel let us switch to the newer Tower that was recently renovated. It still had a view of the ocean but everything was dry and there was no musty odor. I suspect all of the Garden rooms are mildewy and would avoid that area. 2) Restraunts. Not worth it. They are overpriced and the menus are not innovative. We wanted to eat at the resort but everytime we reviewed the menu, we were not inspired. There is so much fantastic food on the island, why waste time at a poor restraunt. 3.) Water. The beach is pleasant enough with plenty of lounge chairs. There is a spot for everyone: the tanner, the relaxer, the family, the stay in the shade. However, don't bother renting the snorkel equipment as what remains of the coral in the area is near dead.

The Caribe Hilton is nice, but don't expect a sprawling resort like you get elsewhere in the Carribean. The resort itself consists of the buildings, a small garden, a nice pool and a small beach. It would probably take you only 5 minutes to take a tour of the whole place. It's surrounded by other large hotels and resorts. There's not a lot to do at the hotel due to the size. The beach is nice, but crowded, the pool was chilly and the hot tubs were jammed with kids. On our second night there my entire family ate at the buffet. They had a salad bar, taco stations, and desserts. At 4am the next morning both my brother and my neice woke up with horrible cases of food poisoning. We're not sure what they both ate, but we think it was the salad bar since my neice is a vegetarian and my brother is not. They both were completely incapacitated the next day. We alerted the hotel and they denied all responsibility. My mother had to call a doctor because they were both so ill. The doctor came to the resort and said he was stopping by numerous rooms to treat people with food poisoning. The hotel continued to deny all responsibility and made us pay the $300+ doctor bill. My mother requested a late checkout for my brother's room so we could take him straight to the cruise (we didn't want him to not have a bed and bathroom for a few hours) and the hotel gave it to him, but charged us. They even charged us for the dinner that made everyone sick! Once on the cruise we met several other groups who had the same situation at the Caribe Hilton. My neice recovered in a couple of days, but my brother was sick the entire week.

The feel was that of any generic chain resort in Florida or South Padre Island Texas, except that it cost 2-3 times a much, making Florida a much better value. We stayed there six nights around New Year's, and will not repeat the experience. It was like being on a cruise ship full of pushy tourists aggressively trying to squeeze out the maximum bang from their buck (imagine hordes of people tripping frantically over each other at 8AM to bag lounge chairs at the beach/pool area ... let's dump one shoe on this chair, one on the next, a towel on the next one, a magazine on the next, the guest services directory on the next ... you get the picture). As Gold HHonors members we had access to the executive lounge, where it was like pigs at the trough ... everytime a new platter of desserts or fruit or sandwiches came out, everyone rushes in to grab what they can. The front desk, belldesk, guest services, and concierge staff were totally disorganized (concierge put us on hold indefinitely on three occasions), harried-looking, and not too friendly (the last being totally uncharacteristic of the island). In fact, the local staff seemed to have had their Puerto Rican charm completely beat out of them, as if they were told to be as generic and robotic and culture-free as possible (like to give the impression of \"this is just like Omaha, honey!\"). The food at the restaurants was also completely generic, with precious little island flavor, and all the so-called \"local\" dishes we tried were completely watered-down versions (to quote Barbara Ehrenreich, like \"your regular Ohio cuisine with a tropical twist.\") We ended up \"escaping\" into the city at regular intervals in order to avoid getting completely disheartened by how far this property is from everything that Puerto Rico represents (and also to meet some real locals and eat some real food). I think any of the hotels in the Condado or Old San Juan area would be much better bases for a tropical vacation with more Puerto Rican flavor ... the Caribe Hilton is as removed from the island as a cruise ship would be. Never again. Granted, the beach and pool area are nice, but one can get better beaches and better pools with far less crowds and at a fraction of the price in Florida.

The hotel is not really within walking distance of anything except a park and a few storefronts. Cabs are readily available. The port was a 5 minute cabride. After identifing ourselves as HHonor Club members, we were moved to the Hhonors Club counter and checked in. They had us reserved for 2 rooms w/inside views (aka construction site) and two double beds. I asked if they could give us 1 room with a King. (The rooms were booked through a bidding website for cheap!) They agreed. Although our king room wouldn't be ready for at least 4 more hours, when it was- we had a beautiful view of the ocean and a nice balcony in the Towers. The room for the boys was ready immediately so we stored our luggage and headed for the pool. Our room was on the same floor as the boys but not next to them. The rooms were beautifully appointed, the beds extremely comfortable. They were still doing construction on our floor but it was quiet in the evenings and never inconvienced us. The rooms had safes in them which were in excellent condition and worked easily without any problem. As this was the home of the Pina Colada, we went to the pool bar and ordered some, Over a light (but not inexpensive) lunch of Pina Colladas & appetizers we watched an iguana climb a tree and listened to the surf break. Later the kids toured the grounds and my eldest son apparently lost a fight with a hammock. The prices of the food on the property were pretty high: a Cuban Sandwich was $14. However next door to the property is a little food joint that sells them for $4. There is also a small liquor store for water & soda as well as a Subway Sandwich franchise 1 block away with employees w/great personalities! It is actually closer to the towers then the restaurant! The Starbucks inside the hotel was excellent. Conceirge & Bellman services were superb. In fact, the bellman that welcomed us when we arrived always greeted me by name throughout our stay! The Hhonors concierge was both pleasant and helpful, as were the servicce techs that retrieved my son's cell phone when he dropped it off our balcony onto the roof 4 stories below. The lobby was open and housed a loud cockatoo and green amazon parrot with a cute vocabulary. Plenty of pool toys and lounge chairs. Some good live music too! Giving that we got such good deals on the rooms, we felt we recieved excellent value for our money. The only incident that prevents me from giving this hotel an excellent rating was on our last evening in the main bar area where they have a limited menu. A group of 8 of us ordered a round of drinks and dinner at about 11:00 (just returned from the Biobay tour in Fajardo). The waiter disappeared and didn't return for 1 1/4 hours!!! We tried to order more drinks...tried to talk to other waiters. They wouldnt talk to us. Or find our waiter. In fact everyone in our area had empty glasses and no service. One gal was out and out rude. We went up to the bar to get our drinks and the bartender was very nice, but didn't know what happened to our waiter. Finally my son went over and talked to the manager who then delivered us our drinks. Our waiter finally showed back up with food for the entire section. Seems he went to the restaurant to place everyones order at once and stayed there til all the food (and his break I am assuming) was finished. By the time we got them, they were cold. The manager comped us the last round of drinks. As we were finishing they turned the house lights on. Honestly, that was our biggest gripe.

I've been told there's absolutely no chance of upgrades when booking on Priceline and that I would be given the worst quality room. Luckily that wasn't true, and when I arrived I was given a room in the Condado Lagoon Villas. I was traveling with my mother, and she was shocked at how nice the room was after my repeated warnings that this may not be the greatest place due to what I paid for it. The room was large, we had a great view of the lagoon, and she took numerous pictures of the bathroom because she wants to model her own after it. The grounds are beautiful, and there is plenty to do on-site. The restaurants all sound and smell good but are a little pricey. Some menus don't have prices, the Italian restaurant averaged about $30-$40 for an entree, and Madrid-San Juan seemed the most reasonable, but of course it is a tapas place so most likely has small portions. We were very tired and didn't feel like getting ready to go out for dinner, so we ordered room service. I had the house salad, she had the Caesar, and we shared a margherita pizza. The house salad did not have croutons as described on the menu (I eat salad for the dressing and croutons, not the healthy stuff), and the croutons on the Caesar were tasteless and mushy. Other than that, the salads were very good. For some reason the pizza smelled like donuts, but it tasted like pizza and was surprisingly tasty. I also got the guava cheesecake which was fantastic. None of these things seemed too expensive on the menu, but after taxes and the automatic 15% gratuity, the total came to $56.39 which seemed a lot for what we got. But whatever. The main problems I had were in the bathroom. I turned one of the sinks on and left it running for a minute while I went to get some soap I had left by the bed. When I returned, the floor was covered in water due to leaky pipes. When I wiped it up with a towel, the towel ended up covered in brown dirt. I started checking other parts of the bathroom, and it seemed it was rarely cleaned. Also, throughout the room, there were black marks all over the floor and walls. It looked like crayons or scuff marks. Finally, there was a digital scale in the bathroom that didn't work! Now I certainly don't expect or care if there's a scale in my room, but what is the point of putting one in if it doesn't function?! Overall, the hotel, including the room I was in, was very beautiful, and the staff was all friendly and pleasant (contrary to what I expected from some of the reviews I've read), but they really ought to work a little harder on keeping the place clean and maintained.

The room did smell a bit moldy when we first came in - like the a/c filter hadn't been cleaned in a long time. But it went away after keeping it on for awhile and opening the window. The room was otherwise nice and clean, and the mattresses extremely comfortable- slept VERY well. But you shouldn't stay in your room- the Caribe has some wonderful facilities. The pool area is fantastic, with multiple levels. There is a pool bar that is interesting, but the drinks were so-so and a bit overpriced. The Caribe also has their own private bay and beach which is fantastic. My favorite part was all the hammocks under the palm trees- I took a nap there. That was heaven. Also a nice promenade that is right on the ocean. For eating, we tried the Spanish restaurant on the premises. I thought the food was quite good, but don't order cocktails- opt instead for a good Spanish wine as they don't do cocktails very well. The breakfast buffet is also very good and I liked the exotic fruit juices they had. Eat outside on the patio and watch the geckos go by- inside was a bit too cold for us. I wish we had tried the other restaurants, but ended up eating at Ramiros, which was highly rated but we found disappointing (except for the wine). Seems like a lot of people have problems with the service. We had none. In fact, I found the staff was very helpful and courteous and always available to answer questions. We also used the on-site tour shop to go to the rain forest. It was well run and we had a good time. However, we were at the Caribe in August which is off season. My feeling is that when the East Coast crowd shows up it takes on a different character. I can see if that place is packed with families how it could take on a more stressful atmosphere.

We went down to the pool for two hours and when we returned, found one of our wallets on the floor. Upon investigation, we discovered that we were robbed of approximately $300 in cash--from my friend's wallet hidden in a phone book in a table, my wallet in my purse, my pants pocket, and the small change and bills we had lying on the table. Hotel security conducted an investigation, including a door key computer printout, and said they would send the results. We had to BEG the manager to come up and give us new room keys and told him we did not want anyone to enter our room for the remainder of our stay. After waiting almost two months to hear from anyone at the hotel, I finally wrote to hilton and my letter was forwarded to the hotel. I received a letter from the assistant manager of security basically telling me too bad, so sad, we're not responsible. Oh, and that their employees are all monitored and have a security background check. Oh, and if I want to come back, they'll give me a room upgrade or a free dinner. A free dinner would have been nice after the theft occurred, but nothing was offered at the time. Because a couple of people entered our room while we were at the pool, they cannot pinpoint the thief, and therefore, no one is held accountable. So, if you don't mind an employee rummaging through your clothes and taking what they please, by all means stay at this hotel. I am a diamond member of Hilton, and a travel agent, and this is the first time in over 30 years of travel that my room has been robbed.

Indeed, many of us were surprisingly disappointed that a hotel bearing the Hilton name was such a let down. It was only after our stay did we learn that Hilton does not operate all of its hotels and some, including the Caribe Hilton, are run by other entities who are permitted to use the Hilton name. First, with respect to the quality of the rooms, you would expect more for what you are paying to stay here. A lot of the rooms were damp, with the sheets and walls feeling wet. There was also an odor- probably related to the dampness. Another issue was with the indifferent hotel staff, from the front desk to management. We had an incident with one of our guests' ring being stolen from their room, and after getting the runaraound, we were left with an uncooperative security personnel whose attitude was pretty much \"oh well- too bad.\" One of the biggest peeves was at check out. If you choose to stay here, be sure to get in writing what you will be charged up front. We never had the situation before our stay here where, on top of our regular room rate, there was such a siginifcant amount of additional daily fees tacked on on top of the regular taxes and fees you would normally expect. for example, the Caribe Hilton tacks on a hefty fee for transporting luggage to your room, EVEN IF YOU CARRIED YOUR OWN BAGS TO YOUR ROOM. They also charge a daily cleaning fee, a daily resort fee, and automatically add a \"donation\" to a charity you never heard of. Going over the final bill was quite a frustrating experience realizing that after having tipped all the hotel staff for their various services throughout the stay, we were being charged on top of that for their services which any normal person would assume is included in the rate (i.e. maid service, a resort fee for hanging out at the pool, having your bags brought up).

For these reasons, I would advise you to stay elsewhere. We requested a nonsmoking room with two beds and confirmed it twice. Instead, we received a room that smelled of stale smoke, was on a floor with no \"non-smoking\" signs, and had just a single (king-size) bed. I was hesitant to request a room change, because from my experience, there can be a punative component and the replacement room is quite often worse. The service is poor. The valets and bellmen don't come out to greet you when you drive up, and the valet service takes a very long time to retrieve your car. The concierge is curt and answers most questions with a pre-printed sheet of paper. The driving directions that they handed out actually had an error. The paper handed to me a checkin listed the incorrect location for the breakfast area and executive lounge. Internet service is $15/day, but even if you want to pay, it doesn't work. The number to call for help connects to a support person in Warsaw, Poland (really). The phone in our room stopped working one day.

For all practical purposes, people that rated their stay perhaps had a bad stay because of their own false expectations.

They also gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries (though I did have to remind them twice before they brought it up, but hey free is free). We frequented the Starbucks a lot, didnt eat a any of the other restaurants, but they looked nice. The bar was ok, although I ordered the same drink each night and it somehow came out differently each time, sometimes good and sometimes bad. The pools were amazing, overlooking the ocean. They had a gameroom which was small but nice to have. The location was ok - we actually walked to Old San Juan, took about 25 minutes each way, on the way back we tried to get a cab but none passed, and it was quite hot. It was also a 15 minute walk to the Wyndham hotel with a casino, and the birdge which we needed to walk over was rickity.

I LOVED THIS HOTEL! When I checked in I told them I was a woman alone and asked for a room in a busy area of the hotel. They upgraded me to the executive level in the main building. I was able to go from my conference to my room quickly and always felt safe, and the executive lounge is fantastic! They have a free continental breakfast with more than just donuts (toast, muffins, cereal, fruit, yogurt). They have free drinks and hordeovers from 5:30-8 pm and mini desserts and cordials at night. Troughout the day there is free soda, water, coffee, fruit and little ham sandwiches which I ate for lunch rather than spend $20 for lunch at one of the restaurants. It allowed me to splurge on some really great dinners---twice at Madrid, the spanish restraunt, and once at Morton's, the upscale and pricey steakhouse. The Executive Lounge also had a computer with free high speed internet for checking email, printing boarding passes, etc. as well as 2 wide screen TV's and daily newspapers including the NY Times. Does it get much better than that? I heard the tower building rooms were better than the main building, but I was thrilled to be in the main building. The location is closer to the beach and pool, and my room was one of the largest and most comfortable I have been in. Although it did not have a balcony, it did have a HUGE picture window with an oceanfront view. From what I could tell the balconies on other rooms were very small so this was fine for me. I moved the comfy arm chair and ottoman right next to that window and felt like I was sitting above the sea. The a/c worked well and my room was always cleaned early, with turn down service too! The linens were upscale and the room was very attractive with a LARGE closet, marble bathrom, etc. When I checked in there was a flickering, buzzing lightbulb in the bathroom. One phone call and it was fixed. The bathroom had Crabtree and Eveyln toiletries. Nice! The pool area at this hotel is lovely, though it seemed a bit crowded when the hotel filled up on the weekend. I never had trouble finding a lounge chair, quiet area or shady spot. The beach is small. The water is calm, clear and clean with no rocks or yucky seeweed areas, but it is not the crystal blue water I love in the Caribbean. Again, plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas. The garden area is gorgeous and a great place to relax in the shade, read a book, etc with lovely flowers and even a couple of swans along the lagoon. I visited the SPA for a refelxology massage and must say this was a big disasppointment. The SPA itself is lovely, but they must have assigned me a beginner. Either she knew nothing about reflexology or she was really bad at it. I should have complained on the spot but I didn't. My final criticism is that the banana daiqeries at the pool bar were really lousy. I was surprised they didnt use real bananas but instead just a mix. Blech. For such a nice hotel they should really improve this. This hotel caters to families and business travelers. I would not go there for my honeymoon, but next time I go for business I will bring my family (if it was just vacation I might pick a place with a more expansive, white sand blue water beach). It would have been nice if there were some more moderately priced dining options, but I guess thats good motivation to leave the hotel. BTW, there is a Starbucks in the lobby which was great for a less expensive dessert. I have travelled extensively in the Caribbean but this was my first trip to PR. This is a top notch hotel.

She too was paying $199 but had a VERY different room. Mine was dark and outdated with worn furnishings and a bathroom in need of renovation. Hers was bright, airy and newly renovated.

The room air conditioning was great (freezing if you wanted it to be) and that was OK with me, because it was pretty hot outside. There's also a good bar/lounge located next to the lobby with some live entertainmment most nights. The rooms have a small refigerator and mini-bar, hair blowers, and iren/ironing board, although our room's iron was missing. Not a big deal, I called down for one and they brought it up right away. A plus with me was the hotel internet access in the rooms. Several clothing and other stores are located in the lobby/ground floor area. The main advantage to the Hilton is its central location near Old San Juan with its historical sites and museums, the Condado area on Ashford Avenue just across the Dos Hermanos Bridge, and the easy accessibility to Highway 26. Be prepared to take plenty of photos, bring plenty of SPF35 sun protector, and buy yourself a hat for protection from the sun. Anytime you're away from the beach or the pool, it's going to be very hot. We got a bargain through Hotels(-) at $161/day room rate. Lots of great food and drink, especially if you know where to go! I would definitely stay again. Don't gamble on anything less than a 4 or 5-star hotel. Anything less gets seedy and you get what you pay for. My second choice in that area would be the Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino just across the Dos Hermanos Bridge from the Hilton, or the Ritz Carlton. Negative: The only thing that really bugs me in Puerto Rico is that the hotels charge extra or separately for parking. You are a paying guest at the Caribe Hilton and yet they charge you $15 a day extra to park. The good thing about the Hilton is that they add it onto your room bill when you check out. At some others you pay as you go on a daily basis. It's just a pet peeve of mine that I think if you're a paying guest you shouldn't be charged for parking, but virtually all the hotels in San Juan do it. Somebody should complain to the tourism bureau or something. Tip: Parking is HORRIBLE in Old San Juan, so be prepared to park somewhere along Ponce de Leon Avenue (around La Casa de Espa\u00c3\u00b1a or the Taxation Building Hacienda), then walk straight into La Fortaleza Street in Old San Juan. Ponce de Leon Avenue turns into La Fortaleza Street from Plaza Colon (the square with a fountain and a tall statue of Christopher Columbus) onward.", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weston, CT", "Title": "\u201cHad a wonderful time ....\u201d", "Author": "CateW", "ReviewID": "UR5182226", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from 5 nights at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan.

However, I reasoned that you couldn't beat the price for a Hilton (we paid $170/night for a standard room on the pre-paid plan, 5/11-5/14) and the location seemed to be ideal (halfway between Condado and Old San Juan - we determined true walkability when we got there). We arrived around 1:30, and I checked ahead of time to see how booked the hotel would be during our stay and it appeared to be not more than 50% occupied. Nonetheless, we were told we would have to wait two hours to check in, which was fine as we were more interetested in drinks than naps at that point anyway. Had a bite and a few drinks at the Atlantico pool bar. Service was friendly but slow, hamburgers were pretty poor and not necessarily beef (as evidenced by our upset stomachs later on), but drinks were tasty and welcomed. Prices very high for the quality on food, acceptable for drinks ($11 cheeseburger, $8 pina colada, $7.50 Corona). Finally checked in around 4pm to Garden Wing room 753. Room was spacious (even bathroom, contrary to other reviews) and the view was amazing (fort, ocean, other two wings). Evidence of a few leaks in the ceiling that were roughly patched up, but not terribly offensive. Dinner first night in Madrid-San Juan restaurant on the property. Great selection of wines, tapas, and true spanish entrees. Sat at the bar; Luis, the bartender, was very helpful in advising us which menu items to steer clear of (\"tortilla espanola is not fresh! not fresh at all!\") and in picking out where to go and when from a tourist perspective. Slow service there as well but we were in no rush so it was fine. Food was very good and very reminiscent of northern and southern Spanish cuisines; prices were very reasonable (dinner was actually cheaper than lunch). Glass of house wine (very tasty) is $10. The next few days were delightfully lazy. There are several areas in which to sit around the water (big pool complex off of main building, smaller pool/jacuzzi area off of Garden Wing, small beach closer to the spa). Lunch from the health bar was tasty but expensive ($27 for two wraps and two cans of soda). No complaints about the pool (aside from your usual noisy families making their way through); comfy chairs and towels, ideal water temperature and generally spacious deck areas. Tried the walk to Old San Juan; probably should have brought a map as it was longer than we expected, and it takes you through some shady areas if you don't know the way very well. Cabs will take you there for $15 but you can (and SHOULD) negotiate with them, as they'll do it for as low as $7-$10 (it's a 7-minute ride). The tourism department has schedules of ridiculous fares for various rides (including airport to Hilton) but they're way out of line and, apparently, always negotiable. Old San Juan is quaint, pretty, and almost exactly what its name implies: an old spanish town, now teeming with jewelry and tourist shops in the daytime. At night, it's your typically metropolitan hot-spot, with its fair share of \"urban chic\" bars, nightclubs, and lounges. All reasonably priced, great atmosphere, and a lovely mix of locals and tourists. Condado is a shorter walk with a less thrilling atmosphere. More of a \"strip,\" with pockets of visitor-friendliness scattered about. Ajili Mojili was the recommended restaurant, and rightly so with its well-prepared truly Puerto Rican cuisine. We were underdressed, even for mid-day lunch, in shorts and t-shirts but service was nonetheless friendly and attentive. The most important aspect of my review is our final night's dinner at Lemongrass in the hotel. This is one of the greatest dining experiences I have ever had, home or abroad. Atmosphere, service, food, and overall ambience was absolutely amazing, and I'd never go back to Puerto Rico without going back to this restaurant. It was priced appropriately for the quality, and it was the perfect ending to our vacation. Can't stop raving, and won't attempt to disparage any aspect of it by detailing any other aspect...I'll just say it was really, really great. And I'm usually very picky about great restaurants. I've been going to Bermuda every year since I was 2 (I'm 23), and this was a new experience for me. It's not the classiest island, but it's not trying to be. It's more like a very spanish version of Miami, as my boyfriend aptly described it. It's clearly thick with tourism, construction, political dissention, and entertainment.

The property is confusing - upon checking in they didn't tell me there was a difference between the main building and tower rooms, so exhausted after flying in, went up and down the wrong elevators dragging my suitcases trying to find my room... My \"oceanview\" room in the tower had a view of an ugly building roof, with a small glimpse of the ocean in horizon. When I went to open up the sliding glass door, the handle fell off the door. When I went to call for service, the phones didn't work. After complaining, they moved me to the main building, which had a view of the ocean and fort, and was acceptable, though the bathroom is small. Room service was prompt, fairly priced and acceptable (a veggie burger for $10). Here are where the problems begin...my keys deactivated 4 times - twice in one day, once when I was hand-carryying the key to the pool. I had to wait on a long line to renew my keys four times - and the manager insinuated that I didn't understand how to use my key correctly! They finally switched the lock out, but maintaned that it was my fault for deactivating keys. They \"comped\" me a free lunch which was nice - the seafood buffet was excellent - very, very good hotel food. Upon checking out I learned about all the hidden fees. I was chared an extra $19.50 \"resort fee\" for each day. When I asked about it and told them I hadn't agrees to it, they said it was impossible to take it off. I've since been dealing with Hilton corporate, who still maintain they can't take the charges off. They claim the charges cover the coffee in the room, access to the beach and pool, a local newspaper, and access to the fitness center. Last time I chacked, these were standard ameneties at all hotels! This hotel will nickel and dime you to death. There are additional charges for practially everything. I'm suprised they didn't charge us for ice. The service was mixed - sometimes we had the most freindly, professional service, and other times, we were made to feel like an imposition to the hotel. There is not much around the hotel - so it is a $10 cab ride each way into Old San Juan. I'd stay there - I've stayed at Hotel Milano and Westin - at least you can get out and walk there.

Just a short walk over to the spa and workout area and this is a super place to grab lunch and take back to the pool area to eat.

Check in was smooth, but the bell boys or whatever you want to call the guys that hang out on in front of the hotel to help, are useless! The room was okay. Does it need a fresh coat of paint, yes, but who cares. Do the hallways have that humidity stench, yes, but why let that get you down! I was never in the hotel room or the hallways all that long during my stay and to pay double the price for a fancy room was not necessary (at least in my case). The pool and the beach were magnificiant. My sister-in-law warned me about the beach before I left, because when she stayed at the El San Juan, she claimed the beach was not that nice there. The beach here was beautiful and clean, but it was only for the Hilton hotel guests, so they cleaned it every night. The pool was a bit gross at the end of the day, but that is to be expected with so many kids in it. The pool was cleaned every night and I saw it with my own eyes and in the morning it was beautiful. They are defintely a bit short hand for help and are a bit slow by my standards, but friendly. So, I did not let it aggrevate me becasue I was on vacation. Other times, the help was very quick. It varied. There is no night life really and you have to venture out to eat unless you want to eat at the Hilton every night. We went into Old San Juan for two nights, Condado one night and Isle Verde another. Basically it was the same everywhere. We ate walked around a bit, nothing was opened and then went back to the hotel. You are not in walking distance of anyhting. We went to restaurants that were recommneded by the cab drivers or Hitlon employees. They were ALWAYS GREAT restaurants and cheap because they knew the area very well. If you are looking for night life, I can't help you because we did not see much or hear about much. The hotel could have done better in regards to the nighly music. It was okay, but if you had some good dancing music, I would have went to the hotel lobby area after dinner and had some drinks. We did two excursions, the rain forest and snorkling. I would skip the rain forest, but the snorkling was a lot of fun! Bottom line I expected the worse, and had a great time.

A short getaway from our 2 children. Given the range of reviews we lowered our expectations & were prepared to have a good time regardless. Arrived at 2 on Friday. Lobby was hectic & crowded. Tried to check-in at the HHonors counter, but no rooms were yet available. Had to wait until 4, plus we had to insist on a king bed room. We had upgraded our package for a king deluxe ocean view. After a 4 hr flight from Newark we went straight to the pool bar for lunch. By 4 our room was open. Garden wing 847. Room had a wonderful ocean view, overlooking a tropical garden below. Small balcony w/ 2 chairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just enough to stand out and gaze at the ocean or hang your bathing suit on the chair to dry. Room was a bit dated - new contemporary furniture, but old carpet (had cigarette burns) & the walls needed to be repainted. No doorstop on the room door so there was a large hole where the door knob smashed into the wall. No attempt at repairing the gaping hole, but someone cleaned up the floor. Expecting a deluxe bath with a rain shower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mentioned by others, instead it was less than typical. We had an old tub w/ a partially working showerhead & a defective stopper. As I said we were expecting deluxe, but rather than complain & change rooms we decided this was fine. At checkout, we confirmed that we were in a king deluxe oceanview. Which means the regular rooms must be in pretty bad shape. Best asset of this hotel is the protected beach. Beach located in a cove with a breakwall so the ocean waves were very gentle lapped right up to the chairs. Beach was also private as the resort surrounded the entire beach. Plenty of chairs and someone can place an umbrella for you. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother with the pools given this nice beach. Waves were so gentle in some areas that small children were sitting in the water playing. Life guards circulated among the pools and beach area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though not always present. Pools were also nice, including a walk-up bar in the pool with stools in the water. A few specialty shops in the hotel, including a gift shop selling water, sodas, munchies, etc at reasonable prices. Nothing around this hotel though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Subway shop, a few bodegas, but no other restaurants. Need to take a taxi into Old San Juan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was close, but at least 10 minute ride. Package included two drinks daily, which we took as pina coladas - which we great - whether at the beach or at the bar at night. Breakfast was buffet at Palmeras - excellent hot and cold food, great fruits, eggs prepared to order & juices. Staff were very friendly & attentive. Best to sit outside. Lunch/Dinner at Palmeras was very typical fare and a very limited menu. If you are looking for a special lunch/dinner I suggest you leave the hotel. Atlantico Pool Bar & Grill for lunch. Excellent ocean view from the outdoor grill. Staff attentive & friendly. Expecting seafood or local fare, but instead the menu was burgers & chicken w/ fried plantain chips. Still tasty though. Servers also delivered food and/or drinks to the beach & poolside. Dinner in the hotel included: Morton's Steakhouse (attached to hotel). Typical Morton's. Great steaks, $120 for two adults, no drinks. Very busy on Friday nights. Need reservation and appropriate dress. Lemongrass (attached to hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c located in the tropical garden spot). Pretentious pan asian. Sushi just okay, entrees (scallops & sea bass) tasty, but of low value. 4 sea scallops for $30. Outdoor restaurant so be careful of the mosquitos. We eat regularly in Manhattan restaurants (incl sushi) & this was expensive & disappointing. Three other restaurants on the grounds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Italian, Spanish Tapas and a Spa restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c none which we tried. Other dining spots we visited in the area were: Mohito's (Located in Old San Juan) - best calamari ever eaten. Small family-owned restaurant, simple decor, local cuisine. Tried mofongo w/ chicken - plaintain bowl stuffed w/ chicken. Reasonably priced and staff very friendly, attentive and helpful to tourists. Barrachina (Located in Old San Juan) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice atmosphere, Puerto Rican art, good sea food for lunch. Located in a nice area of OSJ. Metropol (across from Ritz-Carleton). Connected to a rooster fight arena. Menu mostly seafood and local dishes. Very nice, but distant from the resort area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unless you are staying at the Ritz. All in all, the Caribe Hilton was a fine resort. Staff were attentive and friendly in the restaurants, bar and lobby. Room cleaning seemed fine and consistent. Grounds were open to the public, including access to the hotel rooms. Security were present in the lobby, but no one stopping you from touring the floors.

Our room was great also. Everything was clean and everything worked. My only one complaint with the room was the shower, more specifically the water temperautre.

I would definitely recommend paying extra for the executive lounge privilege. The cocktails in the evening were also nice and a good place to stop off before dinner. The staff on the executive floor was terrific and in fact the staff everywhere was top notch -- they got busy for a few days when a convention was in town and it was clear they were strained, but other than that they were great - helpful and incredibly friendly. The cleaning staff too was wonderful - friendly to our children and did a great job. The pool and beach were beautiful and nicely situated if you were with kids or without. The proximity of the hotel location to Old San Juan was also good and we could easily take a taxi there for dinner or otherwise - we did not feel trapped at the hotel by any means which was nice. It would have been ideal to have had a few more non-hotel restaurants in walking distance though. While the hotel was great for kids and families and I never felt too restrained in that regard (one reason we chose this hotel over the Ritz which might have been too nice for kids at my kids ages (1, 3 and 5), the kids activities were not anywhere near as good as billed and the kids' club was not open in March. They did have one night of free babysitting that was great but I would have liked to have had the option to drop my kids off a few mornings in a kids' camp - it would have made my vacation! I researched this vacation extensively and the reviews on trip advisor almost convinced me to stay elsewhere - I am glad that I didn't as I think that overall based on location, pools, staff etc, this was the best choice for our family with kids this young in PR and I think we will stay there again if we take childcare with us.

We were skeptical based on other reviews of the hotel but had some Hilton Honors points we could use for 2 free nights which helped us make our decision. First I will tell you that I have done a fair amount of traveling and have never met people nicer than the locals. The staff at the hotel especially, are exceptional and willing to go out of their way to make sure you are happy. Upon our arrival at the hotel a \"VIP\" was checking into the hotel in front of us. Wen it was our turn to check in, the women at the desk treated us no differently and as a matter of fact took their time to find us a wonderful room with a tremendous view. We checked into our room #1070 and were left speechless by the view. The waves crashing outside our balcony, a view of the fort and Condado, it was amazing. We then checked the room out and although it was \"a renovated\" room in the Towers, we could see why some people would complain. Some of the work did not look professionally done (sloppy grout around the tile, a 3 inch hole in the tile under the sink, doors not repainted, etc). We found the room to be decent but not 4 star quality. We decided we would rate the room on average a 3 star. In my opinion, the view from the room and the grounds at the hotel made up for any shortcomings in the quality of the renovation. The pool area was beautiful. There are many places to relax, never a shortage of lounge chairs. You can relax by the beach, the pool or anywhere in between. There are palm trees if you need some shade and some hammocks in a quiet shaded area as well. We ate lunch at the pool side restaurant twice. You have to try the Mango Daiquiri at the pool bar-delicious! The food was decent but expensive. There is a Subway right outside the hotel which we tried one day. Saved may be $4 but the food wasn't as good. As for the other restaurants on site, we tried the Italian place-don't bother. We had drinks at the Tapas place which was very nice and we were told the food was great. We generally found the food everywhere in San Juan to be expensive, definitely on par with Boston prices. However it was worth the extra cost in most cases, especially the Churrasco steaks at most restaurants. The location of the hotel was decent. You can walk to some parts of Condado including a casino. The cab to Old San Juan was $10-12 each way depending on where you go. The cab to the airport was $21. One thing we found out is that there are no meters in the cab, everything is a set price by the government. We thought this was a good idea. Overall, I would definitely go back to the Caribe. It was nice to have a beach/pool and be on the ocean and then only be a short drive to OSJ and other locations. There is alot of construction going on around the hotel. Hilton is builiding a new tower and movie theater, restaurants etc so I would guess that work will be going on for some time. We never heard any noise from the construction nor were we impacted in any other way by that.

Unlike the Marriott condos, there is not a single fork, glass, dishrag, pan, or anything that might be helpful in preparing even a simple snack (a picky thing, but even the trash can was too small for kitchen purposes). This coupled with the lack of food markets within walking distance of the hotel made the kitchen pretty much useless for us. We only used the fridge for food that we we brought with us from home. The rooms are indeed nice and spacious though some things are lacking such as comfortable (and abundant) seating in the common room. Also, we had trouble with all three of the toilets even though this is a very new complex. It is a long-ish walk to the main pools and the beach though there is a small but not so fancy (it looks like a backyard pool) pool adjacent to the villas. A nice touch is the staffed towel stand at the villas pool. If we had it to do again, we would probably do a private rental of a similar unit at the Westin, some of which cost much less for similar or even nicer units. I might also consider using Priceline and getting three connecting rooms for basically the same effect -- two bedrooms and a common room.

The beach is by far the selling point: the water is beautiful. Not a problem getting a beach chair. Ive stayed at the Water Club, the El San Juan and have been in the Intercontinental. I don't think that either of those hotels are any nicer than the Caribe Hilton although they are atleast $200 more a night. The only thing to complain about here is the service - a couple of times we sat around waiting for a waiter to come by to give us menus, to take our order, or deliver the drinks for more than 15 minutes. Management seems to be part of the problem. We noticed alot of people just standing around chatting with each other while guests clearly waited for service. The workers seemed oblivious. Of course we just (--) to ourselves, and had a laugh. We were really there for the beach and if we were paying more per night we would have been really pissed, but at $210 we overlooked the bad service. Food at the pool bar is fine grill food (burgers, etc). The prices are the same as at any hotel pool bar. I wouldn't eat at the hotel restaurants given that there are many better and cheaper restaurants on the island (in old san juan and condado). And finally, this place was completely gay friendly.

We began our visit with a 3 night stay at the Hilton Ponce. While there we visited a coffee plantation, the Serrales Castle, El Yunque Rainforest, and the town of Ponce. We then rented a house near Cidra which was a beautiful rural setting in the mountains. Our last three nights were spent at the Caribe Hilton. As a Diamond member of Hilton, we have stayed at Hiltons everywhere. At $355 a night I expected a lot more for our money. The room was in the Towers but the quality was dissapointing. The toilet paper holder was broken, there were some scary stains on the walls, and the maid broke the doorhandle to the balcony when she tried to close it. While a maintenence person did come repair it, it was an obtrusion of our time and privacy. The walls in the hallway were also marred with stains. On the plus side, the bed was heavenly. My husband did have to wait ten minutes every morning for hot water in what was otherwise a beautiful shower. The beach is ideal for traveling with a family - protected from the pounding surf of the bay, the lagoon provides a gentle play area for children. The hotel provides sand toys at no cost. The pools are beautiful but there is only one hot tub. It looked like there were two but the second wasn't heated. There are additional activities posted although they don't always offer what they promise. My children were dissapointed when the posted sand castle building activity wasn't held. My biggest complaint with the hotel was the service. It seems the Caribe is catering to convention travelers. The hotel was crammed with two seperate conventions during our stay. When we made any inquiries the staff was generally rushed, haried, and even on ocasion, rude. If I were there on convention paying a reduced rate, or enjoying a stay at the cost of my company, this wouldn't be such an issue. However, as a guest paying premium rates, this level of service wasn't acceptable. Other guests I spoke to voiced the same concerns without any prompting.

I was last here as an adult in 1999. We went back again on jan 14, 2006 for 7 days. I hate this place now. This could be any cookie-cutter hotel in south beach. Neon everywhere. What does Bright Neon have to do with a tropical resort anyway. I felt like I was on a Carnival Cruise Ship, instead of a 5 star resort. They removed the most famous lobby bar in puerto rico and replaced it with this bright neon area. Remember, This is where the Pina-Colada was invented by a bartender here in the late 50's. All of the tropical feel has been removed. The \"terraced\" tables and the orchastra area have also been removed. There is no more 30 piece orchastra anymore, just a 3 piece trio. There is no puerto rican tropical atmosphere here anymore. Rooms: We booked a 1 bedroom suite in the main bldg. This room, while it had a magnificent view, was old and not very well taken care of. Upon arrival, we had small red ants everywhere in BOTH bathrooms. They sent up a maid with a can of ant killer. This is how thay took care of this. I am paying over $ 800.00 per night for a room that has thousands of ants, and the best they can do is send up smoe poor maid with a can of Raid! I felt soooo bad for this maid having to breath in those fumes. Now the both rooms smell of ant killer spray. There were many cracks in the wood fixtures in the room. The door to the TV cabinet was falling off. The bed had a wood block under on of the legs to keep it up. Another wood block under the night table stand to keep it level. The mini bar had an 2 opened bottles in it. One was water, the other was coca-cola. Both were opened and put back into the minibar. This is a club-level room. I went to the club level receprion and very nicely and calmly complained. I was told that there was nothing they could do. Can you belive this. I have a room in this condition, and there is nothing they could do! Pools/Beach; It seems that they now sell passes to local residents for the pool/beach area. Everytime we went to the pool, we were asked to \"sign-in\" this got to be a hassel after the first few times. It is not only when you use the pool/beach, you must give your room number everytime you step out the door to the pool deck area. The pool deck area is VERY loud. There are local kids running everywhere and screaming at the top of their lungs. This is not what I paid for in a vacation. The pool/beach area is beautiful, but the atnosphere is horrible. not relaxing what so ever. Food: The food is good at every place we ate. I really do have high marks for the food/wait staff. I just wish they could be in a better hotel/resort that this newly refurbished hilton. We arrived on saturday. We spent saturday night and sunday night here. I woke up monday morning and realized I had enough of paying so much for this and not getting anywhere close to what was promised. I checked into the availability at the El Conquistodor. I was told that they had plent of rooms available. We checked out of the Hilton with 5 days left in our vacation and checked into the el conquistodor. This was the best decision we made. The el Conquistodor was beautiful. EVERYTHING was as it should have been: Beautiful hotel. beautiful room Great food Lots to do Not day passes for locals with screaming children. I know that this sounds snobbish, but when you are paying over $ 6,000 for a 7 day vacation, you just want it to be right, not to be disappointed at everything you thought it was going to be. Believe me, I am a person who \"over reasearches\" every place we go. I have never complained about a vacation in my life. My feeling is that\"I am on vacation and I'm going to have a goo time no matter what happens\". I was compleatly blindsided by the Caribe Hilton. The changes thay made must have been done by some corporate exec because they took the tropical Puerto rican feeling out of this place. It might as well be the \"Fontainbleu\" in Miami.

When I arrived at 5:30 on a Sunday, the front desk gave me their standard check in card saying the room would be ready by 4, or perhaps earlier: they then told me it would not be ready for an hour. I finally got a room at 7:30, with no explanation, no upgrade. The room itself was on the 7th floor of the tower. It was large enough, but quite dated. The TV was small and set into a cabinet on a side wall, so you had too look sideways from the bed, and if you sat in the easy chair you were all the way on the other side of the room. There was no light by that chair, so you couldn't sit there and read in the evening. The bathroom fixtures were sort of dirty and not well made; the toilet also tended to flush itself at odd hours, quite loudly. The view was of \"the lagoon\", which was just a small lake with construction going on. The phones in my room were faulty, as often you could not hear anything, and sometimes they would fail in the middle of a call, forcing me, once I realized that the other party hadn't heard me for awhile, to call out again. It took 2 days to get them to replace the phones, and that brought another problem. They charge $1.25 per outgoing call. I went to the front desk to ask them to take off 2 of those charges, as they resulted from the hotel's phone failing in mid-call and my having to recall; if their phones worked correctly, I wouldn't have had to recall and incur the extra expenses. The front desk woman flat refused, arguing that I had made the calls and the charges were the charges. I eventually called (after I got phones which worked) the head of communications, and after several calls and messages she agreed to deduct the unnecessary charges. At my group business meeting the lights didn't work correctly, and after several days of trying to get the hotel people to fix it, our group organizer gave up.

My husband is a Diamond Member of Hilton Honors and this stay was reward travel with HHonor points. The Caribe Hilton was not our first choice, initially we booked our reservations at the Cancun Hilton Golf & Spa resort. The Cancun Hilton informed us in November that the resort would not be operational by mid-January after Hurricane Wilma had damaged the area and resort. Upon reading many of the mixed reviews here, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure we had made the best decision and our expectations were not too high. We arrived mid-afternoon and were pleased to discover when we checked in that we had been upgraded to the Condado Lagoon Villas. We were told we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into our room until 4:00 pm, so we checked our luggage with the bellhop, walked around the grounds a little bit and finally headed up to the HHonor Executive Floor for a snack. The concierge on the Executive Level was incredibly hospitable. She welcomed us, told us a bit about the hotel, the area, including Old San Juan and Condado and checked with housekeeping a handful of times to check the status of our room and finally advised us that our room was ready. The room itself was acceptable, there was nothing exceptional worth noting, though the king size bed and pillows were very comfortable for a hotel. The air conditioner was incredibly loud, to the point you could barely hear the TV over it and the ceiling fan was rather rickety. Both of these problems could easily be resolved with routine maintenance. The bathroom was very spacious and nicely appointed with both a decent size walk-in shower and a large soaking tub. There were double sinks and the toilet itself (& bidet) was in a separate room, which is always nice. The room featured a small balcony, large enough to stand on, but not large enough for any patio furniture, etc. but did offer a fabulous view of the water, the San Geronimo Fort and Condado. Be advised that the rooms in The Villas do adjoin and you can often hear what is happening in the room next to you, especially if there is a child that raises his or her voice or a parent correcting them. If you are a Gold or Diamond Member of HHonors I would definitely encourage you to take advantage of the Executive Lounge on the 9th Floor of the main hotel building. We aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t big breakfast eaters, so we were content with the complimentary continental breakfast that was offered daily. Other offerings throughout the day include soft drinks and cookies / fruit in the afternoon, cocktails and crudit\u00c3\u00a9s / small appetizers in the early evening and finally cordials and dessert after 8:00 pm. We found service from the staff to be exceptional. The bartenders and servers we encountered at Atlantico, the pool bar & grill where we ate most lunches, were wonderful and we had two fabulous servers when we ordered Room Service. The Housekeeping Staff was also quite accommodating. A handful of times they arrived before we had left for breakfast or the pool or we came back mid-day and they had not yet finished our room, they were always polite and happy to come back 15 or 30 minutes later to give us the time we needed. In addition, the nightly turn down service was very nice. The bellhops were always pleasant and helpful too. Again, the Concierge staff on the Executive Level was very helpful. We also visited Las Olas Spa for massages and had good service there. I wish the same could be said for Management at the Caribe Hilton. As I said, we stayed at the hotel for one week, after our first night there we awoke to find a bill and information about express check-out had been slipped under our door. The front desk staff apologized for the error and confirmed they did, in fact, have us staying for one week. Several morning we did not receive a newspaper after trying to resolve the issue with the front desk, we spoke with the Manager on Duty who was less than helpful and simply stated that he would, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look into it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Concierge desk in the main hotel lobby was hit or miss, twice we received excellent suggestions for restaurants off-site, but one staff member in particular was quite rude and flippant. When my husband inquired about taking a small plane or helicopter tour of the island (both of which he said were unavailable, which is odd, considering the HHonor Executive Level Concierge said they would be happy to arrange it for us, seems like the Concierge in the lobby was simply unwilling to go the extra mile) or possibly going skydiving he replied, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go sky diving on Fifth Avenue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obviously we understood that San Juan is a city and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go skydiving in the middle of it, but his response was inappropriate rather than asking if we meant somewhere outside the city limits. One day prior to our departure we paid for the bulk of our stay (resort fee, room charges, etc.) with Traveler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Check. To date, 3 days after our return home, the accounting department has yet to credit our bank account for the over $600 in erroneous authorization charges despite the fact most our bill was paid in cash. While this is already an inconvenience, it becomes even more annoying since the hotel does not offer a toll-free telephone number and we are forced to call Puerto Rico repeatedly to resolve this matter. The last night of our stay we called to arrange a late check-out for the following day. Check-out is at 12 noon, we were requesting one additional hour, we were told that they could not accommodate us. When pressed they said that our room was booked for the next day; while I understand that housekeeping needs time to clean and turn over a room, I find it hard to believe that allowing us one extra hour would create that much of an inconvenience when they are very strict with not allowing anyone to check-in until 4:00 pm. We dined at both Morton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Lemongrass onsite, neither are owned or operated by the hotel. Both meals were fantastic, but be forewarned you can not charge the meal to your room. Of course this is not a big deal, but good to know in advance. Speaking of not being able to use your room charge, you can not use it in the Sundries shop, Starbucks or the Cigar Shop, which can be a bit inconvenient if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know ahead of time. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCigar Shop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if you can call it that, was basically a hodgepodge of everything with a small humidor / cigar selection. One night my husband wanted a cigar, but discovered the Cigar Shop was closed. The Concierge informed him that Morton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sold cigars and he discovered that their cigars were less expensive (by almost half!) and was pleased with their selection. Very convenient should you decide you want a cigar in the evening after dinner. Of course you can use your room charge at the restaurants operated by the Caribe Hilton. As I mentioned, we ate lunch at Atlantico almost daily. Yes, the food is a little overpriced as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen people complain about here; but it goes with the territory, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at a hotel! If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever traveled before and / or lived in or worked in a major metropolitan area, the prices shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a surprise. One rainy afternoon we had lunch at the Oasis Bar, the same holds true. We did not dine at any of the other restaurants on premise, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on them. Also, please note that the Oasis Bar is currently being remodeled and is only partially open at this time. The grounds of the resort are well maintained and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any difficulty obtaining a chaise by the beach or the pool. The pool can get a little crowded, but it was never so bad that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a seat. All in all, we would return to San Juan, but not to the Hilton.

Our check in was very painless since I had called ahead and requested a room in the new tower. We had our bags taken upstairs while we enjoyed a light dinner in the bar area.

After inquiring about what was going on, we learned that a highschool graduation was taking place in one of the ballrooms. Our room was located on the 16th floor. We had partial city and bay views, which were quite nice. The room was spacious and clean, with plenty of closet space and a nice balcony with chairs. The bathroom was the best part I thought because of the beautiful marble in the shower. The shower itself could hold a football team it was so large! I took advantage of many of the ameneties and services on site at the hotel. I enjoyed a great workout in the gym and an emergency manicure at the spa.

We made reservations on-line and paid for our room at the time of booking. Both couples upgraded to the highest room -- king deluxe. We had a really mixed experience overall. Check-in took forever. And I mean 30-45 minutes. We even joined Hilton Honors so that we could get expedited service. When we finally arrived in our room, it was immediately clear that we had not been given a 'king deluxe' room -- the furnishings looked like they were from the 1970's, the view was of the gardens (and not the ocean, as promised), and the bathroom was completely unrenovated (i.e., no rain shower). It was in the tower on the 6th floor. There was also a strong mildew odor. When loud construction started on the floor above, we immediately went back down to check-in, waited another 15-20 minutes in line, and then had to argue with the clerk about the fact that we had not been given the room we paid for. Finally a manager came over, realized the mistake, tried to upgrade us, but found there were no more upgraded rooms with king size beds. By that point we were so annoyed (and kind of hot, considering that we were still wearing our cold weather clothes) that we agreed to take two double beds, as long as the room was upgraded. And then the manager told us that it wouldn't be ready for another 60-90 minutes. So, we checked our bags and met our friends for a drink at the bar near the pool. We finally made it to our room (which was indeed a deluxe, though with two full beds) and it was a huge improvement. It was definitely worth the money to upgrade. (Incidentally, our friends were checked right into a deluxe room. But they had no hot water for the first two days -- a valve had gotten turned off -- so it all evened out in the end.) The outdoor facilities at the Hilton -- pool, pool bar, restaurant -- are top notch. The beach is small, but private, which is a big deal. (Though there are nicer stretches of beach in Condado and Isla Grande they are very, very public.) The beach at the Hilton is basically a lagoon, which makes for very peaceful swimming. The bars (one inside, one outside) were both terrific. Pina Coladas were great. We ate at Morton's and at the restaurant where breakfast/brunch is served. Both were fine, but pricey. (Though coming from NYC the prices were not such a problem.) The pool was the best part of the resort. The hot tubs (basically small pools with very hot water) were open only on and off while we were there due to some maintenance issues. Things got much quieter on Sunday and Monday -- the number of kids plummeted.

I cannot believe how rude the hotel staff was at the Caribe Hilton. It started at check in and continued for my entire stay. The HH check in line was unbelievably long and the other staff who serviced the non-HH patrons simply stood and watched. When it was finally my turn to check in, both of the check in staff members simply walked away and left me standing there for another eleven minutes. I timed it because I was so shocked by their behavior. I did get a room with a view but they put me in the older portion of the hotel and my sliding glass door was so rusted it took great strength for me to open it. The robes were ragged and torn. I asked for another one and it took two phone calls and two days to receive another robe. The next extremely terrible experience was that someone kept calling my room and hanging up. One night a man came and banged on my door and demanded I open it. Of course, I did not open my door. (I am a woman business traveler and I give great care to my personal security). I called security and explained that someone is calling my room and some just banged on my door. They said if they try to come in your room give us a call. I asked if they could have someone come up and check the hallway. The security office told me, point blank, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that! Finally after bad service and a stalker of some kind, I called the HH concierge and complained. He decided to give me a free dinner at the buffet restaurant. (Which I didn't want) He made my reservation and when I arrived the hostess looked at me and didn't say a word. So, I said \"I have a reservation\".

After reading some of the negative reviews posted, I hesitated to book at the Caribe Hilton. I took the advice of several friends, however, who had stayed over the past few years and loved it. We had such a fabulous four day weekend! Let me start with the few negatives, just to be honest and get them out of the way: 1. When we arrived, our room was not ready. We came back 45 minutes later, and our room still was not ready, but we were given a free drink coupon for the bar for both of us. When we arrived for the third time, our promised room was still not ready, but we were offered an upgrade to the executive floor. I balked at first, because I specifically asked for a room in the new tower when I made my reservation (thanks to the advice of many who posted previously), and the upgraded room was in the main building. The woman at the front desk assured me that if we were not satisified with the room that we could come back and we would be placed in the new tower. While we were a little disappointed with this entire experience, the hotel really made every attempt resolve it. To make a long story short, while our room was not as \"modern\" as the new tower, we had the best view of the ocean that we have ever had, the room was extremely clean and modern enough, and having use of the executive lounge was so worth any sacrifice of the amenities that we may have had in the tower rooms. 2. We were only given an additional hour when we requested a later check out on our last day. We felt that this was a bit unfair considering how we had been so understanding at our arrival. It was also a Monday, and many guests had checked out the day before, so there really was no issue of the hotel being booked. Now that those two small negatives are out of the way, the rest of this review will focus on what a great experience we had: 1. Again, as stated previously, the ocean front rooms have some of the best views I have ever seen, and much better in the main building than the tower. 2. Very, very clean and excellent maid service. 3. The previous reviews about the inside bar versus the pool bar were right on the money! Manuel, who was at the bar for most of the weekend, pours strong, generous drinks and has a great sense of humor. He took excellent care of us all weekend. 4. Executive lounge is the way to go! Happy hour every night from 5-8, free drinks that include good wines and top shelf liquor (okay, so maybe we like to drink a bit!)and hours douvers. Breakfast every morning and dessert and cordials every night. Having a private concierge was a plus, too. 5. The beach was very clean, but very average. My husband and I are really \"pool people\" anyway, and the Caribe has a fabulous pool. 6. The location of the hotel was perfect. Far enough from the hub of San Juan so that you felt that you were in the midst of this wonderful tropical island, but close enough to Old San Juan to take a 25 minute walk. The cab ride was $10, and the bus was twenty-five cents and comes every 10 minutes. 7. Service was excellent all around. Of course, tipping well is always greatly appreciated, and the people at the Caribe work very hard and appreciate the recognition. Finally, I want to say a few things about Puerto Rico itself. This was one of the best vacations I have taken to the Caribean. The restaurants in Old San Juan were wonderful. We at at Barrachina'a and Aguaviva and both were excellent. Aguaviva's was what I would describe as Latin Fusion, while Barrachina's was more traditional Latin. The shopping was also great- beautiful arts and crafts, a Coach Outlet (where I did some major damage), and a great mix of high end stores with funky, inexpensive places as well. Old San Juan was as beautiful a city as I have been to, and reminded me of some of the places that I visited in Europe. The people of Puerto Rico were friendly, and almost everyone spoke English. There were many New Yorkers, who chose to go back to PR for a more relaxing lifestyle, and we had fun talking to them about New York (since that is where we are from). We felt totally safe at all times and would not hestitate to go back. I know this was long, but I hope that some of you who are planning to visit will find it as helpful as I found the reviews that I read posted before I took my trip!

I read the many \"mixed\" reviews about this hotel and others before making our reservation. There were positive and negative reviews for almost all the hotels we considered. Based on the negative reviews of some of the older rooms at the Hilton, I called the hotel directly and reserved a renovated room in the Tower. We were thrilled with the room....ocean and lagoon view, fabulous walk-in glass enclosed shower, king size bed). Our package included the daily breakfast buffet (fantastic), plus free access to their nice fitness center. We rented a car and thought the location was great (it's the closest resort style hotel to Old San Juan) and also has easy access to Condado. The Hilton has beautiful grounds, a wonderful resort type pool and private beach....but don't go to San Juan expecting fabulous Caribbean beaches...you would need to go to resorts in other parts of Puerto Rico for those beaches. The meals at the hotel were good but pricey. We had dinner twice at Aqua Viva, a seafood restaurant in Old San Juan, and loved it! We also found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful. The original part of the Caribe Hilton was built around 1950 and has a nice history...one of the first major resorts in the Caribbean....and hosted stars like Frank Sinatra....they also invented the Pina Colada here. Although extensively renovated over the years...from some of the other reviews...it sounds like some of the older physical infrastruture is showing its age. Evidently Hilton originally leased the land under the hotel from Puerto Rico....and finalized an agreement a few years ago to actually purchase the land. They are building new condo's on the hotel grounds which will be part of the Hilton. Next to that....as you look toward downtown...will be an upscale urban mall/shopping area, a casino....and eventually a \"river walk\" along the lagoon leading downtown and to the new Convention Center. We loved our stay at the Hilton and would definitely go back. A friend of ours always stays at the Ritz Carlton (near the airport) which seems (by the reveiws) to be the nicest hotel in San Juan.

I highly recommend the Caribe. The rooms we had were beautiful we stayed at the Newer tower some people have posted pictures here and that helped me to know before we checked in. In some cases it may be an extra fee but well worth it, I offered the plan to the parents and some took it and others didnt but they were all pleased. The showers are beautiful and roomy. The rooms are clean and well worth it to get the ocean view. If you plan to vacation you should always either work overtime or save those bonuses so you can enjoy your trip we sure did. The pools are big and beautiful they also have a hammock area which I wasn't able to get too but geesh there are plenty of them to enjoy. Peacocks are beautiful and walk up to the pool area not bothering just looking. The secluded beach is great and take those water glasses so you can see and swim with the fish. The food is great in the restaurants and sure its pricey but well worth it. Drinks are also expensive but hey your on vacation what the heck! We rented cars and vans since we were playing baseball but the taxis were expensive so we either took the cars or walked or rode the bus once. It was worth renting the car but not too many parking places. Old San Juan was fun to shop and the prices are great for souvenirs.

I agree with another post here that said the pool area is very nice. It really is. That is the only outstanding thing about this hotel. This was my first trip ever to Puerto Rico and I was really looking forward to getting out and experiencing the culture of the island. Not possible at this hotel. There is nearly nothing within walking distance except a Subway sandwich shop. The sky-high prices of the food in the hotel ($18.95 for breakfast buffett), made the fact that there was nothing else around even worse. A taxi to Old San Juan runs about $15 from the hotel. You can catch the bus though, for a quarter. The \"beach\" was a joke, in my opinion. Any beach in Florida would have been better. It's nothing more than a small lagoon, separated from the sea with a wall of stones. And they rent snorkeling equipment! For what?? The lobby is nice - I loved how it was open, from the main desk all the way through the bar and out to the pool & sea. Speaking of the bar...can you say outrageous? $8 for a drink (every drink) and $6.75 for an imported beer. My room was run down, but clean. The balconies are a weird wedge-shape and since I was on the 4th floor, I had a lovely view of the rooftop of the 2nd floor lobby below me. The drone from the rooftop air conditioners drowned out any hope I'd had of listening to the sea. And air conditioning! My room was like a freezer the entire week. I slept with my head under the covers, shivering, for the first couple of nights. I kept turning the air down, down, down, but the room would not warm up. I finally had to turn the thermostat to \"off\" to get comfortable. I had the air set as low as 80\u00c2\u00ba and it still would not stop running. Of course, within an hour of shutting off the AC all together, every mirror and window in the room immediately fogged up. The reservation process was a nightmare. I had to call 4 separate times to get my reservation right, and when I got there, it STILL was wrong. There were four of us in my group who travelled together, and it took the desk clerk an HOUR to get all 4 of us checked in. He assured me that my reservation really was for 5 nights instead of 1 (that was the problem I had called 4 times about to try to fix) but the morning after my first night, I had the \"express checkout\" papers slid under my door. There is a mandatory $4 \"bellman charge\" added to every reservation, as well as a .50/day \"maid charge\". They tried to tack on an additional dollar a day for an \"in kind donation to Puerto Rican KIDS\" (some charitable thing), but we were able to get those charges taken off. Not that I wouldn't have donated a dollar day to a kids' organization, but I really did not like it being added automatically to my bill. I was lying in the bathtub one morning (at about 8:00) and all of the sudden this horrible racket started. I wasn't sure if it was from the room next to me, or the room above me, but they were obviously working on the plumbing somewhere. They were banging and clanging, and then I'd hear plaster falling down the wall. It scared the you-know-what out of me. It sounded as though they were going to come right through my wall. This happened 2-3 more times during the week. They were painting the hallways, and the exterior walls. The hot tub was closed \"due to renovation\". The convention facilities were outstanding. If you're looking for somewhere to hold a convention, this place might work for you. Ok, so this hotel might be good if you're taking your kids. The walled-off beach would be great for little ones, and since there are little to no waves, you could let them play worry-free. And like I said, the pool is really awesome.

I was prepared for the worst when I arrived at the Hilton Caribe, and instead of the expected nightmare stay I had one of the MOST pleasant hotel stays ever. Let me preface my review by saying that we are avid travelers having visited over 25 countries and we always stay at upscale hotels. We (my husband and I) stayed at the Caribe for a week in August 2005. Check in was fast and without hassle. We were originally assigned a room in the main building, but having read on here that the new tower is nicer, we asked nicely to be moved and were promptly given a room in the new tower. Check out was also fast (5 minutes) and our bill was accurate and we had no problem about the $1/day they charge for a charity (I just don't understand why people willing to pay $7/drink complain about such a petty thing!) The room was as is advertised in pictures on the Hilton website. It was a good size, with with a lovely bed, and a gorgeous view of the ocean as well as old San Juan. The bathroom was very nice- two sinks, huge shower etc. Unfortunately, I forgot to take pics of the room, but just saw that another reviewer recently posted some pics of his room, and mine looked much the same. There was no smell, the carpeting had no stains and was very well taken care of. I met the cleaning lady a few different times around the elevator and she would always say hello and was very pleasant. She did a great job of leaving the room very well cleaned, and the sheets were changed daily (someone else had posted on here that this wasn't the case?). One day the shower drain was blocked and I called housekeeping and it was fixed within a few hours. The grounds are very well maintained and clean- the pool was nice but we spent most of our time on the beach. The wave breakers make the water much calmer and more pleasant to swim/float in. The water is quite clear and the sand is white. We have been to many beaches far more beautiful, but then no one comes to San Juan expecting amazing beaches. For what I saw around SJ, I think Caribe has the best beach in the area- also the fact that it is private makes it much more safe and less crowded. I LOVED the hammocks- they are under coconut trees with nice view of the ocean and a great reading spot! During the weekend the hotel/pool/lobby were very busy and quite bustling (there was a local senatorial event going on as well) but during the week it was much more quiet and more conducive to relaxing. But even on the weekend, though the pool area was noisy, the beach area and the hammocks were still quite peaceful. The location was a tiny bit inconvenient. There is a Subway sandwich a few minutes walking distance from the lobby as well as a local food shop (a must try- their cubano sandwiches were delicious.. one day I ate the rice & beans and chicken and it was so much more yummy then that which was served at the posh puerto rican restaurants- I never saw other hotel guests at this place, mostly locals- but I would definitely reccomend getting a cubano take away from here for the beach)... The lunch options at the Caribe are not great- we got sandwiches/salads for the beach twice and the food was expensive/bland... You can walk easily to Condado for more dining options- I didn't get the sense that the area was dangerous at all. We walked to Ajili Mojili (10 minutes max) as well as other dining options. To get to the Marriott area of Condado, might be advisable to take a cab. As I was with my husband, I felt safe walking this area even in the night time, but if I had been alone as a female, I would not have chosen to walk this strip alone. We one day walked to Old San Juan which was not a bad walk at all- a bit hot but there were sidewalks all along the way. Most definitely not a good idea in the dark, but in the afternoon walking on a road alongside the ocean was beautiful. In general we found local people to be very nice and helpful- cab ride from the airport was a standard $16, plus 50 cents for every piece of luggage. The trip from Caribe to OSJ was $10. Also to note is that it is worth signing up for Hilton Honors on their website. There is a lounge where HH members can enjoy breakfast (7-10AM) as well as a cocktail hour (5-7pm) for free. The breakfast was cereal/fresh fruits/croissants etc) while the cocktail hour had wines/rum punch/snacks/fruits/cheese etc. As the lobby was empty when we checked in/checked out, we did so at the reception. However, I noticed that HH members can check in/out in this lounge as well- might be useful during times when reception is busy. This hotel is ideal for couples/families. If you are singles/young looking to party, this is not really the hotel for that. There was not really that kind of scene at the Caribe- there were many young people (I myself am 26) but they mostly seemed to be couples. I have absolutely no complaints about my stay. If you normally stay at the Ritz, the Caribe might not measure up, but it was comparable to Hilton hotels elsewhere. Also, the local culture seems to be very much about taking it easy and being respectful- anything that we requested with a smile we almost always got. We saw some people being loud and red faced and obnoxious and they ofcourse were mostly ignored by the staff. I would most definitely reccomend the Caribe and would myself choose this hotel in the future if I were to return to San Juan.", "Date": "August 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, NM", "Title": "\u201cHope this isn't a typical Hilton\u201d", "Author": "Waldobman", "ReviewID": "UR3767954", "Content": "This was my first stay at a Hilton and my third trip to San Juan.

Check in was a little bit of a mess... We checked in, and they gave us a room key for our room. When we tried to open the door, it wouldn't open, and we soon realized from the yelling inside that the previous tenants didn't leave the room.

The decor is very up to date, nice marble counter tops in the bathrooms, very clean, and well kept. The air conditioning in the rooms was fantastic, and so was the balcony and our view of the ocean and pool. The buffet in the restaurant downstairs was great - a little pricey at about 25-35 US dollars a person, but very well put together. The Italian place was little too pricey for just pasta, and being an italian myself, the food was much less than authentic. It's about a 20-30 minute walk to the rest of Condado, where the night life is, and all the shops. The area feels very safe - we walked almost everywhere even late a night, and there are always cops patrolling the area. The drivers there are nuts - please - take a taxi. Don't be brave and think to rent a car. The locals understand how they drive - leave it to them - trust me - it's worth it. Plaza del Americas is a must see - it's huge and beautiful!

Overall, we had a great time at the Hilton, but definitely expected a little more from what Hilton desribes as a 5 star hotel. Because we used our HHonors points for the entire week, it was hard for us to complain as we weren't paying for the room. The staff at the Hilton wasn't overly friendly, but they weren't rude either. Upon checking in, we learned that our reservation was incorrect (they had us checking out a day later than we had made our reservations for - something we were able to fix with no problem, but a little concerning nonetheless). We stayed on the 11th floor of the tower and had a nice view of the ocean, Condado and construction. The major problem with the room was the musty smell. By the end of the week I had almost gotten used to it, but it was still a shock each time we returned to our room! Our bathroom ceiling did leak once. We called maintenance, but I don't know if they did anything about it or not. The restaurants and bars at the Hilton were priced as you would expect them to be, so that was not a problem for us. We drove to Old San Juan and Condado for dinner most nights. There is one really good restaurant within walking distance of the hotel - Restaurante Escambron. I'd highly recommend it. The pool/beach area was great - especially for kids. There were 2 playgrounds and a smaller pool for the kids. It was really nice that the beach was private - you definitely felt secure. All in all, I'd have to say that we had a great time on our trip, despite the smelly room. I would have complained to the management if I had been paying for the entire week, but seeing as we had the week for free, I kept my comments to myself.

This hotel is NOT for those who need to gamble (no casino, and the latest I heard is that none is planned), or who need a short walk to shopping and inexpensive restaurants. It is, however, a great place to unwind, enjoy the beach / pool, and the myriad other activities offered. If you are up to it, the walk to Old San Juan is safe to do (entirely on sidewalk) and takes about 1/2 hour (dress for the heat, and bring a bottle of water along). Is the hotel \"perfect\", no, but I have yet to visit one even for twice the price that is. We paid $225 / night for a \"deluxe plus\" in the tower (1265), and were thoroughly pleased. Note: The newest restaurant \"Lemon Grass\" is now open, but we did not dine there; we mostly dined at Palmeras this time.

When the room was ready I was pleasently surprised that our particular room looked exactly like the pictures on the website and I honestly could not find one thing to complain about. The room and bathroom were clean, the AC worked great, the bed was very comfy, and we experienced no bad odors at all. We went to Old San Juan for dinner which was great but I cannot really comment on the quality/price of food at the hotel itself (I would highly recommend Buru though for great tapas in old san juan) The grounds were perfect. We quite enjoyed laying on a hammock on the beach late at night listening to the ocean while drinking mojitos! On Saturday we got up early and grabed coffee and a bite to eat at Starbucks which was in the lobby and then spent the morning on the beach which again was clean and perfect for getting some sun and having fun in the ocean.

However, I probably would not recommed it to business travelers who may not be taking in the outdoor ammenites that this hotel has to offer. The hotel did not really seem to have it's act together in terms of check-in but it didn't really bother us too much as we were on vacation and were not about to let a delay in getting to our room get us down.

Her room had the best balcony (corner room) great views. Plenty of room in this 3 room villa with 1528 sqft. The Villas have a private pool and jaccuzzi or you can use the pool at the main hotel. The beach was my favorite as the waves are not as large as the rest of the island and easy to swim in. The Hilton added a floting island just off shore which you can swim to and lay on or you can lay in a hammock hanging between the palm trees (get one early). My 3 year old daughter enjoyed both play areas they have and playing in the sand. I liked the privacy of having a private beach and pool. Security does a good job of not being noticeble. The hotels on Condado had public beaches and lots of people on them. The Hilton staff was great with our family, room service was within 30 minutes all three times we ordered. Bell services was very helpful as well as valet (we tip well). Overall, it was a great stay, we rented a car and drove to several restaurants. EL Metropol was excellent both food and service. La Tasca is great for Paella. Mike Benitez is the best for a charter for deep sea fishing. I caught a Marlin and it was 200 pounds.

There were a few minor maintenance issues with some of the wood trim looking like it had water damage. One thing I did not like was that the hotel automatically added on a $1 per day charge to your account for a donation to a children's charity. Not that I mind donating to a good cause, but I don't like the principle of it. I felt like it was forced upon me and in my rush to check out I didn't want to take the time to get the charges removed. Another similar issue occurred when I ordered room service. On the room service menu it stated that there was a $2.75 delivery fee and that the suggested gratuity was 15%. It clearly said \"suggested\" and never mentioned that the 15% would be automatically added on. When the food was delivered I signed the receipt and handed the delivery person a $10 cash tip (which was 20%) of the total bill. When I later examined the bill I noticed that they had already added a 15% gratuity to the bill. I was upset. I called room service and told them I felt they needed to convey that a 15% gratuity would be automatically added. I told them that the service was excellent, but not worth 35%. They offered to deliver breakfast to the room the next morning for free, but I declined as I wasn't looking for a freebie. The grounds, restaurants and pools were all top notch. There was an excellent swimming beach right outside the pool with umbrellas and beach chairs, and the grounds were beautiful. Everyone I spoke with was extremely friendly.

Buses (fare: 25 cents)? Both times I tried the bus: stood at bus stops minimum of 45 minutes (including in front of Hilton). Forget it. So conceirge desk pushed renting a car ($30 a day -- bring your proof of insurance from home or you'll have to add $10 a day). Hilton adds $15 a night to park your car. But why get a car? There's not really anyplace to park in Condado and Old San Juan anyway, so having a car is a hassle not a help unless you're going outside San Juan entirely. And the traffic jams up incredibly in Old San Juan and Condado. So here's what I did: took a taxi to Walmart ($20), bought a simple, fully assembled bicycle and lock ($60), and used it for 5 days (total cost $16/day including taxi to Walmart). Then I gave it away to a stunned kid on my last day (with a note to his mom assuring her it was not stolen). Biking to Condado took 8 minutes; to Old San Juan 12 minutes. Nothing worse than getting to a place and not being able to get around at a reasonable cost. Next time I'll stay in Condado (though Hilton itself was nice -- just horrible location).", "Date": "June 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitestone, NY", "Title": "\u201cI liked it!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3530952", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for 2 nights, I thought the room was very nice clean and a great view of the ocean.

We are two single girls who just completed our master's degrees and wanted a week of complete relaxation. We were very impressed with the hotel. Our room (in the new tower) overlooked the harbor and was clean and comfortable. We had great service and enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. Compared to other hotels in San Juan, this is a great option. It is afordable, conveniently located to many great areas, and beautiful. There are several restaurants in the hotel--we enjoyed the swim-up pool bar, the Italian restaurant, and Palmerra's for brunch and breakfast. Room service was also great. They delivered each order with complimentary warm cookies. Skip Morton's. We've been to other Morton's and this was awful. Way overpriced and children everywhere. It was comparable to Chucky Cheese. Terrible. The beach was great. Small, but fine. The water is so warm and clear--fish everywhere. There were definitely enough chairs and the chairs all included padding. Be careful with rafts--you can rent them by the day, but they are about $15 each! It rained for four of the seven days we visited San Juan. There is a great tanning salon around the corner, as well as a liquor store and 7-11 type place which are very convenient and more afordable than the hotel facilities. In case of rain, bring an umbrella and tour Old San Juan and the rain forest. Also, while you are there, visit other hotel properties. We went to the Wyndam and the Marriot and were amazed by how much more we enjoyed the Hilton Caribe. If you do anything in San Juan, definitely have dinner at Tangerine at the Water Club. It is AMAZING!!! So cute and so delicious. Isla Verde is a cute area as well. Old San Juan is cute, but very kitschy. Also, we were amazed by how many homeless people were there. We did not feel very safe, especially after dark. Much better to tour during the day and then stay in the resort for the evening. It was fun to visit the cruise ship docks. Bring cards, games, and books to entertain yourselves in case it rains. Puerto Rico is very commercial and San Juan is expensive and Americanized. If you are looking for a pure beach vacation, look elsewhere. If you are searching for a fun vacation with 'American' food and lots of activities, where you can use American dollars and speak English, as long as you don't care about rain, San Juan is great. We spent lots of time at the beach, read lots of books, and watched lots of pay-per-view movies. We loved the pina coladas and the swim-up bar. I returned with a great tan and am very relaxed.

The hotel is beautiful. The room was average: small imperfections that could be looked over. We were surprised to find that housekeeping does not come to clean your room until well in the afternoon. We finally figured out that it is probably due to hotel guests desire to sleep in and enjoy their holiday without interruptions. The day we were to check out, housekeeping was knocking on the door around 830am. In addition, this may be the reason why guests have to wait on their rooms to be ready when you check in. I didn't mind, it gives you the opportunity to explore the hotel. Make sure that you request face towels, because they were rarely provided without requesting them. They provided hand towels and bath towels though. Make sure you place all of your towels on the floor each morning, otherwise they may not provide new ones. Recommend you go to a local grocer or store in San Juan, because (of course) the hotel charges outrageous prices for water and soda. My cousin bought a 6 pack of soda (which werent full 12 ounce cans) for $6!!!!! I bought a large bottle of water for $3!!! Food is also on the high side, so dont be afraid to ask the concierge for a local eatery. They suggested La Bombonera in Old San Juan for breakfast. My breakfast was less than $6. A Subway and Sizzler is within walking distance to hotel. Pools are okay for just wading considering the fact that not one of them is over 4 ft deep. However, the swim up pool bar was my favorite spot and we stayed there until they shut down everyday of our vacation. By the way, the pool bar closes WAY too early (6pm). There is also the private beach which I loved and an area with about 4 or 5 hammocks. GREAT place to relax and enjoy the wonderful ocean breeze. Anywhere you order a drink expect it to be a REAL drink. They dont believe in watering your drinks down nor are they cheap. Expect to pay about no less than $7 for a drink.

We split our time between the Caribe Hilton and Rincon Beach Resort on the West Coast. My wife and I went with a single mom and her three children, 14, 10, and 8 (they never complained about being bored). I had read many of the reviews of the Caribe and like others, I was somewhat nervous. In the end I relied on a friend's review of her 2004 stay. Upon arriving, I was awed by the view from the open air lobby, whereas you could see the pools, and ocean. Like many others who commented, our rooms would not be ready until after 3:00 P.M. It wasn't that big of a problem because we were able to change and head to the pool/beach area. This area was very beautiful and busy (we were there over Easter weekend). Even though it was packed, we were able to find some free chairs and enjoy the pool and the surroundings. Staff was able to accomdate our request of having rooms close to each other. We were actually next door, rooms 752 & 753. The view was excellent. We could see the garden and the ocean. Even though we were on the 7th floor, you could hear the ocean water, always very relaxing. Rooms themselves were very nice and large. There were some signgs of wear but overall I was impressed. Water pressure was good, the only problem was the cold water never got cold, so we couldn't get any cold water for drinking. Hotel and area seemed very safe. If you are looking for the safety of an all-inclusive that caters to only Americans and European's this may not be for you. There were a lot of locals at the hotel and in the surrounding area, which my wife and I loved. I personally don't like the captive feel of an all-inclusive hotel. We went running several days into the Old San Juan area. It is very beautiful and old world. Regardless if you stay at the Caribe, if you are in the area you must go to Old San Juan and visit one of the forts and go to some of shops. Regarding food, we didn't eat at the restraunts at the hotel because there were so many others around the area. The family that we were with ate there a couple of times and said the food they had was pretty good. The three that stand out are the La Dorado and Ikako(?), and El Hamburger for the best burger in Puerto Rico. Get there early because they get packed minutes after they open the door. Downsides: Except the concierges, the staff was somewhat nonchalont about answering questions and tending to issues. The family we went with had a leak that was not really taken care of in a timely manner. I do agree with others who have said that they could use some work in this area, especially for the price of the rooms. There were a couple of times when there was a sewer type smell in the lobby. Not sure what that was about but we didn't spend much time there so it didn't really bother us. Location could be a bother for some people. Cab rides are $10 for either Old San Juan or Conado, where all the action is. My wife and I walked several times and you're looking at about 35 minutes to either which wasn't a problem for us.

I had a very disturbing experience, and I question the safety of the guests at this hotel, and thought you should know. On Saturday, March 26 at 6:45pm, someone walked into my room, having used a key. I was changing, and I was faced away from the door. As soon as I said \"Hello - who's there\" (I did not turn around immediately as I was finishing getting dressed), the person walked out of the room. I then walked into the hallway, no one was there. When I turned the corner, a bellman was there. I asked him if he had walked into my room mistakenly, he said no. I immediately went to the front desk, and alerted them of the situation. Ricardo, the desk manager on duty did not believe me. I requested the general manager, who then came over. Genero (the general manager), assured me that he would have security at my door immediately, to download the information from the lock as to what keys had been used in my lock. I then went to dinner. When I went back to my room, an hour and a half later, no one had been there. Security finally came at 10pm - 3 hours after I had talked to the manager. The manager left a voice mail at 10:30 saying the only other keys used in the lock besides keys issued to the room were housekeeping, and that \"I should be safe\". Housekeeping was not on my floor when the break in occurred, there was no knock prior to the person entering my room, thus I do not believe it was housekeeping. I truly believe someone - not housekeeping - got a hold of a key to my room, and used it, and only turned away when they found someone in the room. Thus, I question the safety of the guests in the hotel. I also think the manner in which management responded to my complaint was extremely poor. To wait 3 hours to get security to my room is abominable. To assume that \"it must have been housekeeping\" and consider the case closed is extremely lax security.

There was no mold anywhere in the room (as other reviews I read said they had terrible mold in the room). I thought the hotel was pretty...lobby and all. The grounds were just wonderful - just like a mini paradise. The only thing I was bummed about is that there was no heated Jacuzzi which I think should have been there considering the prices! We had a 4th floor room in the tower. Like a dummy, I left the sliding glass door open all night thinking that mosquitoes don't fly up that high...wrong! I was eaten alive.

My advice: please, please be nice when you're checking in/requesting service, etc. These guys must face hundreds of surly New Yorkers every day, and it's quite refreshing to them to have nice guests in a while. The lady who checked us in just hung up (read: slammed) on a previous guest when we appoached her.

First off, the tower building is very far away from the lobby and there is NO security there, anyone can walk in off the street and have access to the floors above. There is an \"eye in the sky\" type device in the lobby. Opened my door one evening to find a couple milling about, they saw me and hurried away towards the stairs , not the elevators. The beach is nice, as well as the pool, until you realize that a fairly large amount of the people there are locals who have no business being there. An older boy approached my 7 year old son ( he was 14-15) and said he was there with his mother and was staying at the hotel next door. He asked him if he wanted to leave the property if he wanted to go see the pool \"over there\" When my son asked permission, I approached the mother and they hurriedly took off. I had read in the paper where there is an epidemic of kidnappings in Latin American countries, with children being sold into slavery, and heres my kid about to leave the property (lured?) When I complained to the manager, they ignored me and said that there is a private club that the local people can belong to and that there are members there who are locals. When I persisted and told him that i would notify the police, he dared me to go ahead, \"this is a private matter the police wont get involved in\" Other incidents occurred and they are too numerous to mention. And this is only in one week! The bottom line is that for this amount of money ( 385 night, plus 20 percent taxes) they should take security a lot more seriously. Someone is going to get raped or kidnapped one of these days! THIS is not a place I would take children to nor would I feel comfortable as a single women being here alone. If you are a married couple and you stay together the whole time, than I guess its ok.

Based on some previous reviews, we were prepared to spend the three conference days at the hotel and then move on to another property/island to spend the rest of our vacation week. We ended up deciding to spend the entire week at the Hilton because it was better than we expected. We arrived at about 8pm as a result of our earlier American flight being cancelled out of Miami. Check-in went well; the person at the desk took quite a bit of time trying to find us a good room. We were given room 1569 in the main tower (as opposed to the lower and older garden tower). There is an executive club lounge on the 9th floor of the garden tower that is free for Hilton Diamond members or $35.00 per day for non Diamond members. Our room had a king bed, balcony, and nice bathroom with a beautiful walk in shower (no bathtub). Overall, the condition of the room was good. High-speed internet service was outrageous at $15.00 per day (more about fees later). With only about 6 rooms along our hallway, it was incredibly noisy during the day. The service people seemed to make a lot of racket and talking in the hallway. Our room had a beautiful view of the ocean and coastline. The rooms on one side of the garden tower look out over a huge roof that covers the ballroom-not the view that anyone would want to have. The pool, beach and gardens were very nice. Keep in mind that this is an older property with a lot of convention business. This hotel is celebrating its 55th anniversary this year. Our room's base rate was $200.00 per night but they add a lot of fees on top of that. There was a bellman's fee of $4.50 on the bill (never used them), maid fee of $1.00 per day(we tipped them $2.00 per day on our pillow), resort fee of $16.00 per day and a \"kindness\" charge of $1.00 per day (it is the hotel's children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charity that they sponsor).

Room was large, very clean and comfortable. Maid service replaced used towels twice a day and did a superb job. Room service was always on time and meals were as ordered. We ate at all 4 of the hotel's restaurants and enjoyed them. Morton's was our favorite but the Spanish one and Italian one were very good. The Palmeras was our least favorite for dinner but the buffet breakfast was a great treat with wonderful fruit and great cooked to order items. Thought the $18.50 price to be reasonable for the value received. The grounds are especially beautiful with a great pool with swim-up bar and loads of grounds to stretch out for a wonderful tan. The Hilton has the only private beach in Puerto Rico and it is well protected from large waves by a man made barrier that is a about 200 feet out from the beach area. It is safe and clean; I noticed hotel employees making rounds daily and gathering up clumps of seaweed and other items to assure a clean and safe area. Anyone with little children would appreciate the beach area. The common areas are well kept and attractive. While the first floor lobby area is open, I never saw a bug (flying or ground type) in there the entire week. In February, the hotel is not exactly inexpensive but for a winter retreat from the snow-belt, it was a bargain to us. The location is good. It is between the congested Condado beach area and Old San Juan. Both are a $8 cab ride or, probably, a 30 minute walk.

The hotel is somewhat set back from the road, with very nice landscaping, the lobby has no doors, so the breeze was enjoyable while waiting on the long line. When you get the chance to check in, it was fast, but there was a reasonable line. We stayed in a \"Garden view\" room, which i am not sure if it was the oldest section, but it seemed that way. It was a decent size, two double beds, but we had some complaints. Our phone was broken, and after a couple of calls to the front desk it still wasn't fixed. The lighting in the bathroom was horrible, the closet door didn't close, both the toilet paper holder and the soap holder (in the shower) were broken. Around all the edges of the entire room and bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a long time. The air conditioning vent was clogged with dust, it only made me think of what we were breathing in, not sanitary. There were stains on the rug, dirty windows and occasionally the TV would flicker. All along the halls, they have a molding that comes halfway up the wall, the molding was falling off and we saw a sworm of tiny ants, right in front of our door. The view was nice if you kept your head straight up, but if you looked down there was construction. If you are a light sleeper, you would have been woken up by the drills and the machines, and also the Peacocks. Most of these things aren't horrible and i hate to sound picky, but when you pay $400 a night for a room, the little things should be fixed. The grounds were very nice and clean, tons of staff, if it is possibly they should clean the lagoon, there was tons of garbage floating around. Everything there is way overpriced, breakfast buffet is $18.50 a morning. Your \"waitor\" comes to the table, asks if you want coffee and you don't see them again. When the bill comes, there is a little saying on the paper to tip your waitor the suggested 15%. Im sorry but i am not paying someone any extra for saying 5 words, and that is it. If you don't tip them, they don't seem very happy either. The same thing goes for all the bartenders, the taxi boys, valet and everyone there that is wearing a shirt. Not to mention when we recieved our bill at the end of our stay, the hilton charged us a dollar a day to donate to their foundation, without permission, so be aware. We never had a problem finding a taxi, yet again overpriced, my problem with this hotel, is the location. You have to take a taxi everywhere, and there is nothing around the hotel. A taxi is at least $10 for about 5 minutes, it is a drive everywhere, we walked near the marriot one night and it took 45 minutes. If i could suggest to stay anywhere it would be the Wyndam Condado Plaza, or the Marriot, it is ideal if you don't want to spend every waking moment at the hotel. There are restauraunts and clubs accross the street from the Wyndam and the Marriot, more ideal location. We went horseback riding through the hotel, overpriced, but had so much fun, we went snorkling at the hotel, and there isn't anything to see except cloudy water, we ate at the italian restauraunt in the hotel, and spent $84 on two people, not including drinks, wayy over priced but the food was excellent. The outdoor eatery is all fried food, we had Mortons one night for desert and it took 30 minutes, and it was average. All in all, this hotel has no night life, but a lot to offer during the day, when you have a hotel so secluded a larger nightlife should be necessary, the rooms were below average and the grounds were above average. Like I said, if you are comming here to stay in the hotel to whole time, it is nice, but if you are looking for something to do, not the best place.

This was reported, but never fixed. -We could not close the doors over the TV and screws were falling out when we tried, so we left it open. -The carpets were way past cleaning time.

Pretty nice idea if you want to check out other hotels while you visit. -Room service was quick and good and a good value.

The hotel itself is ideally located adjacent to the Condado Lagoon, half way between Old and New San Juan. Hilton promotes the fact that there is an old Spanish fort on the San Geronimo grounds. This was somwhat misleading as the fort, at that time, was fenced off and appears dangerously located on the rocks and coral. That being said, Caribe Hilton had several benefits. The staff were friendly and the rooms clean. Our view overlooking the San Juan coastline was absolutely breathtaking. It was very relaxing and beautiful. There are approximately 4-5 restaurants on-site including Morton's of Chicago where my wife and I had one of our best meals ever. While the exterior facade appeared somewhat dated, the management spent considerble time and money renovating the lobby/atrium. It looks really nice when you enter the building. Having visited both the Wyndham Condado and the Marriott Stellaris, I am glad we chose the Caribe Hilton in that both Marriott and Wyndham have casinos attracting a noisier, more eccentric crowd. Another nice aspect of Caribe is a private, man-made beach with a large pool with swim-up bars. All in all, this is a four-star property. Unlike other resort stays, you will probably spend a great deal of time away from the property. Old and New San Juan have many fabulous restaurants, bars, and shops to explore.

Some of the elevators did not work at times, so we had to use the service ones. It was better that the stairs from the 15th floor. The hotel does show some signs of its age, but they are making an effort to refurbish it. But, things are done a little slower in PR than the states. It's just a fact. We would stay there again, but I would try to get a better rate. It you want high service and cleanliness, go to the Ritz. That is what we did. Instead of having a disappointing vacation, we leveraged our time. We stayed at the Hilton for 3 days and the rest at the Ritz. Yes, it was a little more, but it worked out just fine.

The grounds are beautiful, the pools are nice and the service was good. We booked the vacation package through Liberty Travel and was surprised that when we got to the hotel that the buffet breakfast and one drink was free to us. Now for the not so nice things about the hotel. One day we were out for several hours sightseeing in Old San Juan. When we got back to our hotel room our door was open. It was not wide open, but open enough for anybody to walk it. I called the front desk and they said that the maid must have left it open and to check to see if anything was missing. Luckily nothing was missing. But that gave me an eerie feeling. Anybody could have just walked in and stolen everything. We did keep our valuables in the safe though. Another thing deals with the shower. We had a separate shower stall in the bathroom. The drain was really clogged to the point where none of the water was draining down. When my niece opened the shower door all the water came crashing out of the shower onto the floor as well as the carpet outside of the bathroom. We went to the front desk to report it and they said that they would have someone to look at it that night. Since we were going out that night we asked if someone could come the next day. The person at the front desk assured me that someone would be there first thing in the morning. When no one showed up by noon we called the front desk. Apparently someone put down that it was already fixed. They did send someone to fix it though. Someone from housekeeping was supposed to dry out the carpet, but the day we left the carpet was still wet. So much for that. The nightlife in the hotel stinks. There really is nothing for you to do and going to Old San Juan every evening gets stale after a while. The hotel had this woman singing at night in their bar. At first we thought it was Kareokee night her singing was that bad. If you want to do nothing at night I recommend this hotel. On the weekends it seems that local comes to the hotel to stay. It gets rather noisy in the pool area. Also, I might add, the sand on the beach is dirty with cigerette butts and other things that people just throw on the ground. It isn't very well kept up. If they spend less money on the grass outside of the hotel and more money on renovating the place it wouldn't be such a bad hotel to stay in. We were in the Tower section. The bodega to get the bottled water and other things is not too far from where we were staying. I doubt that I would ever go back to PR, but if I do I will not stay at the Hilton. One more thing. If you go to the Conserge to ask for places to eat or menus beware of a place called Bon Appetite. It is a service that will get you any kind of food you would like and deliver it to you. My niece and I wanted Chinese food. We ordered three things and the total was over $50. The beef with broccoli was over $17. Don't use this service if you can help it. We wound up ordering Domino's pizza instead. I hope this helps someone.

I definitely think you could do better elsewhere. There are two major concerns: 1. OLD FACILTIES WITH POOR UPKEEP. The main building, which I stayed in, dates back to the 1950's-- and you can really tell. Everything in my room had some little problem with it: two of the lamps didn't work, the door couldn't be closed without slamming it, the toilet didn't flush all the time, my key kept not working, and one of the elevators (there were only 2, for hundreds of rooms) was out of service frequently. Overall, none of these were huge issues, but it meant lots of little hassles, that added up to not as pleasant of a vacation! I think poor housekeeping, as some other writers have suggested, was probably also part of this issue. For instance, the small red (dryclean-only-type) decorative pillows they thoughtfully placed on the bed had suspicious whitish stains on them. All I could think was, yuck! 2. There is noisy construction right next door! (as of June 2004). On whole side of the hotel (the side facing the historic small fort) now overlooks a concrete-and-iron, half-finished, condo building, with bright yellow porta-potties decoratively placed right on the beach waterline, where your eye is naturally drawn. I guess in the past this must have been an attractive water-and-greenery view, so people who stayed here in the past probably had a better experience. The construction noise wasn't really that loud, but it was constant--7 days a week including Sunday, and starting early in the morning. I really didn't end up using the balcony because of this issue. (of no view plus noise) Overall, again, this wasn't a huge issue but it did detract from the overall experience. Overall, the Frommer's guide makes this place sound much nicer than it is. I think I read there that it had \"one of the nicest beaches in the area\"--and while I didn't visit all the other beaches, I was really surprised that the Caribe beach was supposed to be a great beach. It was really very small and had lots of rocks once you got in the water. If you want to walk along an expansive beach you will just end up going out on the street to get to one of the public beaches (which, by the way, were perfectly nice!)

The only complaint that we had was the housekeeping, they didn't pay much attention to details.

We complained about this the following morning and the hotel manager offered us a garden suite. We went to see the suite but decided that our 13th floor room, which was newly renovated, was much better for us even though smaller. The manager offered us another room on the 16th floor, which was identical to ours, but still the trouble of moving three floors was not going to gain us anything especially having a small child with us. So the manager gave us a $75.00 credit at the Palmera's restaurant. That was very nice! There is one aspect of our visit at the Hilton that left a lasting impression and that was guest relations. The night we arrived one of our friends felt sick and was about to pass out (diet issues), and right away one of the hotel staff saw that we were having problems and called for security. The security personnel dressed in a suit arrived with a first aid kit and oxygen. They also phoned for a doctor (which by the way will charge $120.00) but we had them cancel the doctor after our friend was feeling better after drinking a soda. Two days later another friend of ours was swimming with me out at the reef barrier when he stepped on a sea urchin which stung him in nine different places on his foot. We swam back to shore and my wife approached one of the hotel staff members who was sweeping the sidewalk and told him that our friend had been stung by something in the water. He immediately dropped the broom and literally ran to get help from the lifeguard. The lifeguard arrived with a first aid kit and after examining the foot sting, he recommend that my friend go to the hospital and have the 'splinters' removed. The Hilton security gave us a ride to the local hospital. After we were done I phoned the hotel and they picked us up and drove us back to the hotel.

We liked the private ocean front beach, that you can snorkle in (but buy snokle gear as the resort charges $10/hour). Cheap snokle gear costs about $10 at Walgreens or similar.

For breakfast, go to the Normandie Hotel, which is about 50 yards from the Caribe Hilton. Their buffet breakfast is $12.95 vs. $18.95 at the Hilton. While the Caribe offers more food choices, the restaurant is fly infested and makes the food less than delectable (it's an open air/open door to the outside restaurant, but still flys are a problem.). For lunch, get a sandwich at the outdoor pool bar area. Burgers and sandwiches are still pricey, but not bad ($7 burger and fries). For dinner, take a taxi to the Marriott in Condado. It's $8 each way, but around the Marriott on Ashford St are many local restaurants and a few national chains (chili's, starbucks, dunkin doughnuts.). I recommend the restaurant Hermes (out the Marriott and take a right, about 75-100 yards down on the left. Excellent steak, fish and Mofongo (a local dish served with chicken or shrimp). Say hello to Alexandria, a beautiful young lady who works there as a server, but doesn't speaks decent English.

There is a general store across the street from the Caribe Hilton. Cokes are $.75 and they have chips, beer, rum, wine, etc. Our room was in the Tower and was recently updated. We saw other rooms that were recently updated. Overall, service in PR is not as fast as in the states, but you're on vacation, slow down and enjoy it. Beer and mix drinks are expensive at all hotels.

I assume that it functions principally as a business hotel (though I doubt it functions effectively at all). The reason that I am pointing out the misrepresentation in the classification is because we relied on the hotel's characterization as a resort when we made our vacation plans. I think the first clues to the low level of service at this hotel were the phone calls that I made prior to my arrival to find out about services and amenities. I am convinced that the hotel staff members moonlight as prison guards in a maximum security facility. Their responses range between rude and hostile. When we checked in, the front desk personnel didn't inform us of any of the hotel's offerings. She started to put us into a room in a lower category than what we reserved. If my wife hadn't specifically inquired, that would have been something that we would have had to correct after we got to our room. Even when we got our room (after the correction), it looked out over a building top that led to a big construction project. It would seem that you would reserve the lousy rooms for those times when you're straining against capacity. Now, on to the next issue: the food. I think the food and beverage staff must go dumpster diving at the other hotels to make their menus. The food was horrible! the couple of things that we ordered we inedible, and we had to give up any prospect of having decent food here. We did eat breakfast at the buffet, because it was included in our package. The buffet was the least cared-for presentation of food that I have seen in a long time. The shoddy restocking of the food items made the entire thing look like last call at a soup kitchen. And, if the poor food presentation wasn't enough to engender your displeasure, they also made sure that they didn't clean the tables between diners. Next issue: the room. Our room had this weird wood paneling that gave the effect of a low budget porno set. There was nothing appealing about the room at all. You could find a more appealing room in practically any budget hotel anywhere. I could go on and on, but you get the point...Don't ever stay here!!!!

If you eat at a premium steak house it is going to be expensive. Room service is the best deal. They give you a lot of food and the quality is very good.

Before leaving, I had read the overwhelmingly negative reviews, but this was our first time in San Juan and we were not sure whether we would be comfortable commuting between Hilton and other hotels on the island, given the island's crime rate. That was a huge mistake, this hotel should'nt be a Hilton or be rated as a Deluxe or 4 star property. The rooms were moldy, with dirty carpets, dirty walls and an awful bathroom which ran the danger of overflowing anytime. Our room was in the garden wing, when at first we complained the guy at the front desk Dominic, told us very rudely that since we only paid $179 the deluxe rooms were not available to us. This was the conference rate and never said anything about inferior rooms, and we later found out that quite a few people attending the same conference and paying the same rate had rooms in the tower.

My room was 762 and it wasn't bad at all. The staff at the front desk, Mortons stake house, bar and grill place were very nice. The staff at the Ilatian and Spanish restaurant were ok not kind just seemed boring. The food is over priced. Do not go to Mortons steak house unless you are willing to spend about $90 for two people to eat dinner. Save money and go to the grill by the pool or to the Palmeras restaurant. This hotel loves to charge people for everything so be careful because I was charged for consuming drinks and food that are in the room when I didn't even touch the stuff. But when I told them about it they kindly took the charges off. Also if you want to buy something to drink or some chips to eat go to this little store that is right outside the hotel they sell suff for about half the price the hotel sells it for. The pool and the beach are very nice. The room was a little worn like other reviews said but I didn't care because I was never in the room and the only time I was I was sleeping. They offer snorkeling trips at the hotel I recomend going on the east wind which was $73pp and the cheapest one offered it was a lot of fun. They also have two parrets by the name of Koko and Pancho. Koko loves girls and is a sweaty, Pancho is a thief and will steal or break your watch if your wearing one. He broke mine and bit me.

We gave our name to the check-in clerk and he kept insisting that we had ALEADY checked in the hotel. We argued, showed them our confirmation, my letter, etc. The clerk would just keep saying \"why are you checking in again, you already checked this morning?\" After about 20 minutes of this, we were finally given the key to our OCEAN FRONT room (our friends were to be just above us). Just upstairs from the lobby, we open the door to our beautiful room and...there are two adults in our bed! Boy, were we ever embarrassed and so were they! Back down to the lobby where we waited another 20 minutes to figure out the problem. No explaination, no apologies! We were then given a room in the tower (a Priceline room this time) near the construction. Our key would not work...back to the desk to get another...the second key doesn't work...a maintenance man let us in the room. We later found out that the couple in our original room had a similar last name to ours and they were given the wrong room. We checked our bill very carefully before we left. We were also afraid that the other couple might get some of our charges. Although the new room was nice and spacious, it was a little dated and miles apart from our friends as well as everything else. There was construction going on in the room above us that didn't stop until 7:30 that night. We did enjoy the grounds, beautiful view and pool area. Morton's Steakhouse was great but way over priced. The portions were also too big. My husband and I shared a small steak and got one side each. Along with the wonderful bread and a salad, we couldn't eat our entire dinner. Split your meal if you dine there. Not too crazy about the surrounding night life. We tried to find the store that has been mentioned for buying alcohol and it was a very scary adventure. We waited until Sunday morning to venture out again. Our friends had great difficulty when they tried to check back into the Caribe after the cruise. They were told the rooms were not ready. After 3:00, they were still not ready. Our friends said that dozens of people were waiting in the open air lobby (during a horrific thunderstorm) for their rooms as well.
