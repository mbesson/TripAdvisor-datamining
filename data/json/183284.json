The value was great and the shuttle service was fabulous. The room wasn't the cleanest and a little tired but we didn't expect much for what we had paid. The hotel is in close proximity to the airport and the shuttle service to and back from the airport was perfectly executed. The free parking deal ended up being a real steal! Unfortunately our 2009 Venza was stolen from the hotel parking lot while we were away. The parking lot is not secure (no fence) or monitored by security cameras as indicated on the Sleep-Park-Fly website ad for this hotel. The hotel is not tracking the presence or absence of your vehicle while you are away despite putting your name and license plate on a tracking list -- they didn't notice that our vehicle was gone before our scheduled return. If you drive a newer SUV, crossover vehicle or expensive car don't park it here or at any other hotels near the Montreal Airport. The police officer that filed our stolen vehicle report that night indicated that very high tech car thieves are regularly targeting parking lots at hotels near the Montreal Airport. They are literally \"shopping\" parking lots for vehicles to steal. Our car had modern anti-theft features but that didn't matter they stole it anyway. Most of these stolen vehicles are never recovered as they are being shipped out of the country as fast as they are stolen to be sold to someone in some other foreign country. The shuttle service was great but we had no vehicle to return home in once we arrived back at the hotel after our 2 weeks away. None of the car rental companies at the airport wanted to rent us a car to go home to Ontario in; they were more worried about getting their rental car back to Quebec than to help out stranded travelers. It has all worked out but don't let this happen to you! If you have a choice park your older vehicle instead, pay extra for valet type parking at the airport (police said Park-N-Flys are not totally safe either -- thieves pay and drive out with your car -- the guy at the gate doesn't check that the driver is the car owner), or have someone drop you off at the airport and leave your car parked safely at home.
