Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as part of our Cosmos tour. The room was an adequate size for a twin, clean with modern fittings and comfy beds.

The rooms are also noisy, you can hear all the pipe works every time someone flushes the loo and when people are having a shower it sounds like water is going to come through! No noise from the station though!Breakfast and dinner were included and were of an average/poor standard, however if you have a walk around Signa about 5 mins from the hotel we found a lovely restaurant which was very popular with local people and it was very nice.

BUT, by train it is just 23 mins and costs about 2-3 euro for a pleasant journey. By the tour bus it takes 1 hour to Florence cos of traffic. Rooms are no longer noisy(as mentioned in some earlier reviews), we had a room right next to the train station facing the platform but couldn't hear a thing...window glass is good at shutting out the noise, air conditioning works, rooms are clean, bathroom was large and airy, room was a decent size. Tour group breakfast was not bad with boiled eggs available and some great fresh pineapple , freshly squeezed juices and the usual coffee/tea and breads. Try and wake up a little early because the brekafast room is small so people end up queing up if they arrive even a minute after the start of breakfast time.My advice - Florence has plenty to see and do and shop for plus many great restaurants. The train is cheap and quick, so skip the included dinner which we heard was quite average, spend the extra 2-3 euro on train + 6-8 eur on dinner and enjoy extra time from 3pm to 9 or 10pm in Florence. Your group will have to leave Florence by 3pm and then spend 1.5 hrs in traffic and then sit in the hotel in the lifeless little town (shops were always shut and NOTHING to see or do in Signa) until 7.30pm when dinner is served at the hotel itself. If you don't like the dinner offered to you, there are no other places to fill up on either since the hotel is in Signa and there are no eateries nearby other than a gelato place behind the hotel.Train station is literally on the doorstep of the hotel so we were comfortable returning here at 10.30pm without worry. Florence is alive and active and a buzzing city so catching a train from the busy Santa Maria Novella in Florence after dark is fine too. TIP 1: Buy your ticket from the fast ticket vending machines with coins rather than queing up at the manned counters. It has many language options so you can be 100% sure you bought a ticket to the right place + you will be sure of the train departure time. At the counter there is always the risk of the Italian counter staff not understanding your Italian or your not understanding his/her English. This vending machine method is fool proof since you type in your destination SIGNA.TIP 2: Always keep some 50 cent and 1/2 euro coins handy for paying for tickets and washrooms through your trip.BEWARE: Some trains in the direction of Signa don't stop there, so check with the info desk and then reconfirm with the train driver before boarding the train that it does stop at Signa. Some folks in our group got the wrong train(an express) and went past Signa without stopping and had to come back from the next stop.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR138587835", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ArmchairGypsy"}, {"Content": "Good hotel and excellent value We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at the start of our holiday to see Florence without staying in the City. We booked for convenience with it being so close to the station. We had a great stay, we found the staff very helpful and accommodating. The room was a triple and a good size with a long balcony/veranda area. The bathrrom was small but had plenty of toiletries, ample towels and an excellent hairdryer. The airconditioning was the most effective and controllable we had in any hotel during our weeks stay in italy! Breakfast was included in the price and was buffet style with a good choice , the breakfast waitress was especially pleasant. We expected some train noise but to be perfectly honest we hardly heard them The convenience of being within 20 minutes of Florence combined with being in a small hotel, with little noise and a good veiw, means that we will definately be returning. I would like to mention that the pizzaria opposite the hotel is worth a visit we had a good meal again with very accommodating staff who found us a table on a particularly busy night.

We know in advance that the hotel is well far away from Florence, but the train station is right there. When we arrived there the first afternoon, we went to the Information kiosk right in front of the Train station, the lady gave all of the info, we then went to the Bar right on the left of the hotel to buy the tickets, its really inexpensive to get to Florence, you can buy to go and to return ticket in that bar . To go to Florence, take the line 2. Once arrive to Florence, right outside of the train station you will find Cabs park there, you can ask them to go to the Duomo, it's only about 2 miles away, and it will cost about 5 Euro. From Duomo, you can walk around : very close to Porta Rossa, Piazza Signoria, Ponte Vecchio etc...The last train is at about 11pm, so you can have the diner around 7pm, after that you can try to walk back (get the map from the Information kiosk or from your tour Director). We follow the map and it took us only about 10 minutes to walk from Duomo area to the Train Station. REMEMBER: the train to Signa is on line #2, same line when you arrived to Florence. When you look at all the line, you will not see it, but just walk all the way inside the train station, after ,5 and 4, and 3 you don't see it but continue to walk ahead, you will see the line #2.The Hotel is OK, room look clean, bath room look clean but there is a kind of smell like stale. Anyway you only stay there to sleep so it's not a big deal.

You opened the fridge and handed your drink over and she merely took the top off it and gave you a glass.Also, there seemed to be a lot of ne'er-do-well's charging around on those annoying little scooters trying to impress the local totty.

We knew what to expect, so we booked the optional Tuscan Flavours excurtion. (Great fun!) Others on the tour, were not so fortunate. They stayed behind and took the train (10 second walk from the hotel) into town. Get a map from the little brown kiosk between the two hotels. Make sure the train is not, or not going, on strike. The rest of the gang took the train in to town, return tickets purchased at station, only to find out the rail workers were on strike. Apparently this happens quite oftern without notice. It was a pricey cab ride, 30 euros, back to the hotel! Breakfast typical 'Barfay'. Stock up on picnic stuff, and eat it later as brunch. Fruit is fruit, take rolls, cheese, whatever you can wrap in napkins or baggies. You payed for it, take it. If you don't like church bells ringing all night, take earplugs and gravol. It is a long way from town, but you get what you pay for. Some liked the nearby pubs, but we chose to have a glass of our own wine out front of our hotel.

Like others who wrote reviews, I stayed here as part of a Cosmos tour. They are correct that it is not a luxurious 5 star resort but my take is that it's not supposed to be. Like the other hotels on the Cosmos tours, this is a good value and is what I expect to see from a European budget place. After all, the hotel is just a place to sleep. I actually liked the fact that the hotel is located in Signa, away from the bustle of Florence. The evenings were quiet and relaxing. My wife and I took a short 10 minute walk and found a lovely restaurant that was a local favorite spot where the friendly staff were fluent in English and excited to show us how a traditional Italian meal should be. The train is literally steps away from the front door and runs regularly giving easy access to downtown Florence. So, if you want black tie concierge service and pretentious little chocolates on your pillow....go somewhere else. If you want a nice, affordable place to stay where you can experience a little Italian life without feeling like a tourist, this is a great place. Of note, we loved our Cosmos Tour and were surprised by how many people on the tour complained about the european style accomodations. It's value travel! We did an entire trip for two of Italy and Greece, including airfare, hotels, meals and all the excursions we could do for less than $5000.00 total...and we never felt like we were getting a bad deal.", "Date": "Apr 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR131859770", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JayandLin"}, {"Content": "An uncomfortable night I rate this the worst hotel I have stayed at.
