Unbeatable. Lobby/ common areas very comfortable and elegant. Room was spacious and in generally good condition although is starting to show its age versus the newer top-end 5 star hotels of comparable price. Stayed in a street facing room on a mid/higher floor and had no problems with street noise. Would recommend an outside room for tourists as being able to look out onto Vendome/Parisian street-scape is well worth it, plus the outside rooms are much brighter. However having to pay extra for Wi-Fi seems a bit much given the hotel room rate. Not the money per se but it takes away from the 'feeling'. Breakfast was superb and matched by the quality /attentiveness of the restuaurant staff. The Gym was disappointing, very cramped and a low level of equipment. Certainly should be improved. Service overall was good but I was not as overwhelmingly impressed with the Concierge / Doormen as some of the other reviewers. Majority were helpful and professional, but we also encountered some that seemed to be just doing the job and lacked a level of warmth or sincerity. We suffered a significant error and the initial response was not particularly sincere or 100% honest. It was only resolved properly and professionally after escalation to more senior staff, but it should have been handled much better at the outset.

From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, the staff could not have been more helpful. Our room was beautiful and the hotel made an extra effort to do the small things that really do make a difference, like providing a robe and slippers that fitted perfectly - my wife is quite petite and very very impressed not to have a robe that drowned her, although being over 6ft myself I did put it on by accident on our first night and quickly realised I had the wrong one on :) Every member of staff was extremely helpful and polite, they made an effort to address us my name on almost every occasion and even though the food and drinks are on the expensive side, the quality, service and atmosphere of the hotel make it worth it. My only feedback to improve the hotel would be that the internet tended to drop off when using it and I would have to reconnect. This was not a huge problem but think it would be good to address.

As seasoned Paris travellers we always had wanted to stay near to one of our most favoured squares of Paris, the Place Vend\u00f4me. The Park Hyatt Paris is really an exquisitely designed and tastefully decorated place! We had already known the hotel from an earlier visit to the bar, but we were once again impressed by the sheer elegance of the site. We had booked a special offer, namely \u201cRomance at the park\u201d including breakfast and a fine bottle of Champagne, which was in our opinion reasonably priced. We had a Park Deluxe Twin Room going to the courtyard and were very satisfied with our choice. The room is spacious and well-appointed and the bathroom even more so. We twice had breakfast at Les Orchid\u00e9es and indulged in the extraordinarily delicious dishes; we travel a lot and stay often at upscale places but rarely did we enjoy a breakfast that much! And the best was the staff, not only at Les Orchid\u00e9es but all over the hotel. Everyone was very friendly, warm and professional. In my view, they couldn\u2019t do any better. As I noticed when I was scanning other reviews this has to do with the policy that Hyatt pursues with its personnel. I honestly admire such an achievement because I haven\u2019t encountered such a perfect performance at any other hotel yet. But enough praise now, there is also one negative point to mention and this concerns the prices. Whilst the rooms are adequately priced, this can\u2019t be said of all the other things. We didn\u2019t go to the hotel\u2019s prime restaurant le Pur because we considered it as much too expensive. The same applies to the bar but we went there because we like the ambiance and the drinks are really superb. We didn\u2019t use the spa and the fitness centre so we cannot comment on them but I\u2019m sure we wouldn\u2019t have been disappointed. On balance, we experienced such a high level of hospitality at Park Hyatt Paris that we had thought was not possible to achieve, my congratulations!", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cSimply Amazing\u201d", "Author": "CardinalRK", "ReviewID": "UR125569898", "Content": "My wife and I spent the weekend here in May.

Park Hyatt is my favorite brand and i am beginning to discover that there are wild differences in the standards and the service, this is definitely the worst Park Hyatt i have stayed at. The pros: Good Location, clean and modern hotel with comfortable bed and nice bathroom even though the standard queen room is tiny by Park Hyatt standards. Breakfast was nice and staff were polite enough although very fake and snotty in the old Parisian way which tends to lose it charm after a while. Check in was smooth and very efficient. The cons: The room was old, worn out and in desperate need of renovation, the carpets were worn out and dirty and in need of a serious change (not Park Hyatt standard at all) There were almost no power outlets in the room and none near the working area which seems a bit weird for anyone wishing to work. The internet service was a DISASTER and kept dying on me ALL the time, it seems that this is a long running issue at this hotel, luckily as a Platinum member i did not have to pay for it otherwise it was 19 euros a day which is a rip off, everything else at the hotel is outrageously priced, i had to pay 130 euros for breakfast for two??? It also seems that unless you are a Gulf Sheik or a Russian or Chinese oligarch, then you are treated by the staff more as part of the decor than anything else, they simply have NO time for you, i was constantly stopped on the way in or out and asked if i had a reservation (and this is to sit in the lobby for Gods sake!) . All the common areas (restaurants and bars also) attract affluent Parisian clients that simply take over the place for breakfast, lunch and dinner during the week particularly and the hotel clients are totally marginalized because of this. I had to argue with one lady only because a colleague and i wished to sit in the lobby for a short business meeting and there were no places to sit, since all the table were set up for lunch for the external clients. This is really a serious issue that management needs to reconsider since the usual practice is for the hotel guests to have priority and not the other way around. The moral of the story is that for $800 a night (not including anything) you can find much better in Paris, i will definitely NEVER go back to this hotel, and very luckily a new Mandarin Oriental has just opened close by.

First, the location is just excellent. About two blocks form the Palais Garnier - Opera, which is convenient for using the Air France bus to and from CDG (cost 10 Euros). Lots of luxury jewelry stores and other shops along Rue de la Paix, incuding the Ritz hotel. I went for a late night stroll both nights (weather in late February was surprisingly nice, a little brisk but not cold). The Place de la Concorde is a few blocks south west, and I got to see the Eiffel Tower twinkling through a slight layer of fog. Back to the hotel - I am a Diamond member with Hyatt, and I was upgraded from a junior suite to an executive suite, which was really nice - basically two adjoining rooms, with a living room area on one side and a bedroom area on the other side. And two full bathrooms. Also, received a nice bottle of Bordeaux and a small box of 4 chocolates;aas a welcome amenity. Internet was free for Diamons members, but is 19 euros per day otherwise. Had breakfast both mornings. Had the American breakfast / buffet in Les Orchidess one morning and had breakfast in my room on the second morning. Breakfast was complimentary as Diamond, but otherwise is 48 euros. The room was a little too warm for me, and even with the heat turned off, I slept with the windows open both nights. My room opened to a couryard below, so no street noise at all. The bathrooms are really nice - all marble, with a decent sized tub and a separate shower area. Actually the shower and a vanity is behind a glass door and both are adjacent to the tub - basically a wet area. Very nice thick towels and nice size bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel. Towel warmer was a nice touch. Robes, slippers provided. Also an umbrella was available, but fortunately I didn't need it during my stay. Mini bar has a nice variety of drinks and a small number of food items, and is very expensive - 12 euros for a coke or a beer (33 cL), 6 euros for a small can of pringles or a regular size container of TicTacs, 12 euros for a small container of nuts or candies. There is a lot of staff at this hotel, and all are very friendly and professional. Everyone speaks perfect English and even understands my high school level French!

The hotel's rooms, restaurant, and lobby are, indeed, elegant - five stars. The entire hotel is tastefully and beautifully designed and decorated. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The restaurants are excellent. Every reasonable request is granted. And, very importantly, the Park Hyatt's General Manager is highly dedicated, professional, and extremely responsive. So, what then is the Park Hyatt's one major weakness? None, if you are want complete anonymity and do need to be greeted and/or assisted on occasion by seasoned and knowledgable employees. However, if you are someone who travels frequently to the same city and likes to always stay at the same hotel, the Park Hyatt may not be the best choice. Here, then, is what appears to be the management and business model of the Park Hyatt Paris - Vendome: Hire extremely attractive and very intelligent young men and women between the ages of 23 and 27 fresh out of a university and/or with little or no experience, keep employment costs down, and use the Park Hyatt Vendome as a training center for hotel career development. The average age of the Park Hyatt Paris - Vendome employee is, literally, thirty years (a fact learned from management). And, the only reason the average is thirty and not twenty five is because of the significantly older housekeeping and maintenance staff. Also worth noting is that almost the entire staff at the Front Desk, Concierge Staff, and Restaurants are not culturally diverse. One has to wonder why the Park Hyatt has placed such importance on the way its employees look as it would seem to be no accident that almost every young man and woman looks like they stepped out of a fashion magazine. Does one have to be beautiful or handsome to land a position on the lobby floor of the Park Hyatt? Would an average looking , highly intelligent person somehow detract from the decor of the hotel? I think of my daughter. Despite her proven academic excellence, maybe she would not be attractive enough to work in an entry level position at the Park Hyatt if she had an interest in hotel management. The real problem, though, with having such an extremely young staff is that their intelligence, politeness, and well manners is no substitute for experience. Equally important, it was obvious that all of the young people working at the Hyatt are following such strict Hyatt rules that they are very afraid of making any mistakes. The result is an uptight and unrelaxed staff that is too nervous to be themselves and to be, naturally, friendly. Youth also contributes to an understandable lack of knowledge and often wrong advice on Metro directions and distances to reach a location. Were this a four star or lesser five hotel with a large bar and/or a night club, the hotel personnel would be perfect for a Starwood W Hotel. All of the above may not matter to the one time visitor. But, I would think the lack of experienced hotel employees undermines repeat guest visits. In this respect, Hyatt is penny wise, pound foolish. There is no substitute for experience and this is where the Park Hyatt's business model undermines its potential for being one of the truly great hotels of Europe. What is needed at the Park Hyatt are, at least, three to five older and necessarily experienced individuals, in positions of mid level management. Hiring more experienced individuals will not only provide better training and mentoring of the young staff but will provide a more relaxed and friendly environment which guests on business rate as an extremely high priority. The most beautiful hotel structure in the world is no match for a five star hotel with an experienced staff who will remember repeat guests and who, ultimately, become the single most important reason why guests return time and time again on business to the same hotel. Given the average age of the Park Hyatt's staff, turnover, by necessity, will be significant as one young person is promoted through the Hyatt organization or joins another hotel management company, and is replaced by an even younger and less experienced individual. In summary then, the Park Hyatt is a true five star luxury building where the first time visitor should be pleased. Every young Park Hyatt employee is well meaning, polite, intelligent, and helpful. But, they are also very afraid of making a mistake and appear alway on-guard to be sure they are not deviating from the Park Hyatt rule book. The resulting ambience of the hotel undermines the potential for the Park Hyatt Vendome to be the hotel of choice for the frequent visitor to Paris.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel, excellent service.\u201d", "Author": "Will58", "ReviewID": "UR123588198", "Content": "This Park Hyatt has a wonderful calming feel about the place - from the warming signature fragrance to the luxurious but minimalist decor.

Unfortunately, there should be more to an excellent hotel than the physical. The check in process was exceedingly slow. I have no idea what was the problem, but it took forever for the front desk to give us our room keys. It truly was one of the longest processes I've gone through. But once completed, the front desk person did take us to the room and show us around. The room, a Park King Suite, was gorgeous. The bathroom was luxurious, complete with a heated floor and a mirror in the shower for shaving. There was plenty of hanger and drawer space. However, there is no coffee maker in the room. I'm one of those people who cannot function before his first cup of coffee, so I was not thrilled. I was told they will get them over the next few months... and they could not provide me with one until then. Internet Wi-Fi service was spotty. Luckily, I didn't have any real time constraints in what I had to do online, but it was frustrating to constantly lose the ability to connect. And, of course, there's an additional 19\u20ac charge per day. Throughout our stay, the staff was, for the most part, courteous. However, we never felt special or unique. I expected more from this level of hotel. We were totally ignored by the breakfast hostess for over 1 minute while she spoke on the phone... Not so much as a glance at us to let us know she knew we were there or she cared. We finally walked by her and beckoned a waiter to seat us. Unfortunately, that morning it also took a long time for someone to take our breakfast order (and the restaurant was fairly empty). Mind you, I hadn't had my coffee yet, but even taking that into account service was slow. And ultimately we were charged an extra 3\u20ac because I wanted milk for my coffee. Really? As I said, the hotel is very nice. My complaints have to do with the level of service for the price. It may not be much, but a token nightly snack in the room would have been a nice touch... We didn't even get a chocolate on the pillow. I was also surprised that I didn't get a bill to review prior to checkout. We had an early flight to catch, so in my pre-caffeinated condition, I was reviewing our bill for the first time at checkout. I found an error which was quickly corrected. Providing the bill the night before would have been easier and less stressful. Finally, I felt that the hotel overcharged (gouged would be a more correct word) for any of the extras arranged through the concierge. The car service markup is astronomical. A 10\u20ac taxi ride from Gard Nord to the hotel would have cost over 100\u20ac for a car and driver. The trip to the airport (60 - 80\u20ac by taxi or numerous other car services) would have been 240\u20ac through the hotel. I'm sure it's a very courteous driver and lovely Mercedes, but it's not a helicopter. A 300% markup is just plain greedy. Bottom line is that it's a very nice hotel in a lovely part of town. But I don't think the level of service matches the price, and frankly I resent the gouging for the services through the concierge.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cAnother fab Park Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "Jan_ATL", "ReviewID": "UR123389751", "Content": "A really lovely hotel right in the heart of Paris.

The room we stayed in was gorgeous, nothing we could fault about our room! I've posted some pics below. We opened one of our 2 windows, climbed up onto the ledge and out of the window onto the balcony to find a wonderful view of Place Vendome.

However, when this was raised with the front desk, the response was more than adequate and sets an excellent standard for managing guest concerns. A last minute request for a dinner reservation at the hotel's restaurant, Pur was not a problem and well worth it - a fantastic experience.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cStill an emotional favourite, but simply a rip off...\u201d", "Author": "galatas0410", "ReviewID": "UR120811732", "Content": "I love this hotel.

Continuing on a positive note, this hotel certainly has the most exceptional and accommodating staff anywhere with special recognition due to the concierges as a whole. Our ten day wedding 'anniversary' celebration stay here was memorable, but.... It is a relatively young facility with decent sized 'deluxe' rooms for Europe accompanied by generously spacious washrooms. The rooms are well appointed with two sinks and a large closet in the bathroom as well as a large shower and soaker tub, but appear to have been neglected in terms of maintenance. (I attach pictures of the room and the bathroom as well as cracked floor tiling, cracked drywall and torn drapery.) This level of deficiency is completely unacceptable in a five star facility charging $1,000.00 per night. The stained carpeting was for lack of better terminology, \"Gross!\" It is a shame to see a room deteriorate to this level when initially so much detailed effort was obviously expended in creating a splendid environment. The deficiencies continue with a damaged and scratched main entry door as well as broken bathroom door and malfunctioning toilet and ripped silk drapes throughout.... Aside from the aforementioned, the room was comfortable and well equipped and with proper upkeep would definitely be worthy of a five star seal of approval. As a polar opposite to the room, the common areas were impeccably maintained in the most perfect of conditions and upkeep. The daily morning breakfast was superb with a level of service and quality beyond expectation and all standards. Similarly, the hotel's Michelin rated restaurant, PUR also provides an exceptional dining experience in both food and service. Pristine! I cannot reiterate enough just how absolutely exceptional the level of service was in the entire establishment from the bellmen to the restaurant servers to the doormen to the concierges to the chambermaids, etc. Literally each and every evening as we left the hotel for a dinner outing, the concierge rushed to our side sending us out to our destination in the hotel's complimentary Mercedes 'S' Class limousine service.

Asked for a room with a view and actually got one, facing the front on the first floor. The windows open which was a nice touch, and gave a great view of Rue de la Paix. Noise wasnt really an issue as the street gets pretty quiet after midnight, but the sound proofing wasnt great so if you're a light or early sleeper best avoid the rooms facing the front. The room felt bigger than 26-30 sqm, so they made very good use of the space. Bed was comfy as you would expect although I wasnt a big fan of the small square pillows, and they were also rather soft. The colour scheme gave the room a rather dark tone and the sculptured light fittings are an acquired taste . The entertainment system was great, decent TV with a blue ray player and plenty of channels. The bathroom was decked out in marble and \"gold\" faucets, but tastefully done. Wasnt a big fan of the Blaise Mautin stuff they stock but there was plenty of it. There's a business centre half hidden in a nook right before reception which gives comp internet access, and the PC on the left actually matches the english keyboard layout while the other one doesnt. There are only two machines however and plenty of folks wanting to use it. Charging for wifi on top of the high tariff is a little rich. Quite a few business travellers at the hotel, so there must be some rather generous corp expense budgets that survived the GFC. The reception and common areas were pictures of understated contemporary luxury. Its a very nice hotel but for some reason seems to lack a bit of charm and character. Im very low maintenance so cant really comment on the service, except to say that the concierge was friendly and professional, and most of the staff were friendly if a little stiff/formal - given the clientele however thats probably not surprising. The location is fabulous, there are plenty of cabs out front at all hours, and its a short walk to the Opera district where you can find upmarket department stores like Galeries Lafeyette and speciality food shops like Laduree and Fauchon. The metro is about 5-10 minutes away, depending on the line. Plenty of tourist traps in the area but also a few nice cafes in the laneways behind the hotel where the locals go for a good feed at a reasonable price. Its a 10 min walk to convenience stores in the area so be prepared to walk or brave the minibar if you get thirsty. The only downside is that everything is horrendously expensive, and you dont really get what you pay for.

It is easy to walk right by it though, because the signage is directly on the wall in between the black store canopies of Van Cleef and Arpels & Mont Blanc which are more prominent than the hotel sign itself. Rooms are very clean with comfortable beds. Even though our room faced the street side, it was very sound proof and quiet. The rainfall shower and waterfall bath faucets are a elegant touch, but the scratchy thinner towels that are not very soft and stiffer toilet paper may damper the mood for North American guests who are expecting a totally luxurious experience in a hotel like this. Front desk staff are very helpful and polite. If the buffet breakfast plan is not included in your room rate, it is 42E. per person. No hot entrees are included in the buffet itself, but you can order them for an additional charge. Overall the buffet is very delicious and I would highly recommend the little round pastries with hazelnuts and pistachios on top of them. The buffet consists of good variety of pastries, breads, cold cut meats, cheeses, fresh fruit, cereals and yogurt. Coffee, tea, juice is included and served by your waiter. Although the service overall is very good, two things bothered me about the waiters. One is that some take the liberty of reaching right across your plate while you are in the middle of eating without saying \"Excuse me, may I take that dirty dish for you?\" beforehand. Plus, it is inexcusable when I see our waiter chatting up a single woman customer and french patron for much longer time periods and giving them much better service, while we are waiting for more coffee with totally empty cups for ten minutes. There was only eight patrons in the entire restaurant at the time and we had no problem getting our coffee cups refilled quicker when the restaurant was totally full. If you are on the run to see all the sights of Paris you can grab a sandwich at the Brioche Doree near by. There is charge for Wifi service, but there is also a business centre with two computers behind the front desk off to the right which you can use for free, if need be. The french keyboard has a different alphabet layout compared to its North American counterparts, so you will not be able to type out a fast email without making spelling mistakes. Paris traffic jams can be brutal, so if you don't want to take a taxi to the hotel during rush hour, consider the Roissey bus (10E. per person) which goes non-stop from CDG airport and drops you off about four blocks away from the hotel.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clinton", "Title": "\u201cA great area to stay when you are in Paris: So close to everything\u201d", "Author": "readyreader", "ReviewID": "UR119672797", "Content": "We are Hyatt members and they have easy ways to earn free nights, so we used free nights to stay when we were in Paris.

I'll be upfront and say that the only reason we stayed here is because I used Hyatt points to book the room. I say this because there's no way I would have paid what they charge for a nightly stay. Not because it's a bad place, it's just that in Paris there are some many options and alternatives. Room: Top of the line. I think that since I used my Hyatt points we were sort of relegated to a lower tier room, but we didn't mind. Our room was on the second floor facing the interior of the building and actually had a pretty fair sized balcony, which we used occasionally. We were able to look down into a garden/restaurant that was pleasing to the eye. The room was pretty fair sized with a huge bathroom (almost as big as the actual living space of the room) and all of the high end electronic items you'd care to mention (DVD, Flat-Screen, etc....) Service: No complaints of any kind. Everybody we dealt with in the hotel was exceedingly polite and friendly. We checked in quite late at night and the reception clerk actually gave us a tour of the hotel and walked us to our room. In addition, since we had a late night flight back home, we were able to leave our bags in the hotel for the entire day with no problem and collect them just before we went to the airport. This was great because it allowed us to get one more full day of sightseeing without having to schlep our suitcases all over the place. Location: Unbeatable in a word. At the end of the block, you've got the Paris Opera and the Metro stop. Fifteen minutes in the other direction and you're at the Louvre. Also, we felt very safe walking here at all times of the day. We would start early and get back really late and never had anything that could be remotely considered a problem. Regrets: Just that we don't see ourselves staying in a place this classy for a long, long time.

I loved the bathroom. This particular room's bathroom was as large as other rooms I've had in Paris. There was a ton of space with a great shower and bath area. I really like the bathroom amenities. The hotel provides complimentary Evian water. If you are a Hyatt Gold Passport member, you can order morning coffee or tea that's complimentary.

If you want an old traditional hotel with lot's of character, this isn't the place for you. While the building is quite old, the interior is very modern. There's modern sculptures in the room that is not for everyone. The hotel is located on Rue de la Paix close to Place Vendome. If you like to window shop or have very deep pockets, this is a great place. The hotels in the neighborhood cater to an upscale crowd. The Park Hyatt clearly fits in well with it's neighbors.

Did I just mention the complimentary business center with unlimited access? Cons: The concierge sometimes doesn't deliver the same unequaled service. A very unpleasant surprise to have my purchase delivered to my own room by a valet with a \"look\" after a long stroll along the St. Honore. And I did not see the Parisian enthusiasm or the typical Parisian style in most of the staffers, though they were so achingly helpful, and incredibly courteous and motivated to deliver the service. The entire air of the hotel is a bit too American to me, along with the edgy and whimsical Tuttle's interior desgin in rooms and part of the public area. Conclusion: Through a special manner that I booked my room with a gorgeous price and thus I will definitely return. Or I'd still recommend hotel junkies with the budget to 800-1000euro for a room to remain at the old dames steps away (Hotel de Crillon, Ritz, Le Meurice, or Le Bristol) or to try either the Royal Monceau by Raffles or the about-to-open Mandarin Oriental, which is also steps away. A few words to the manager(s): You have done superbe job in terms of the management, and guarded the brand in a perfect manner. But I'd like to see definitely more character in this charming estate. And also, the rug-lined corridor on the guestroom floors might have looked chic in 2002, but it looks so dated and is continuously releasing the smoke it had absorbed from 2002-2005.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallahassee, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Conan8540", "ReviewID": "UR112890510", "Content": "My wife and I just stayed with our two teenage children for 4 nights.

The attention that was paid to all the small details well exceeded any of the other hotels I have stayed at. Room service seemed to be at the door the second we hung up the phone with them and the concierge was very helpful in helping us coordinate activities in Paris.

No big deal, mistakes happen, but the way it was handled makes or breaks a hotel. In my view it was poor - with the 'we're full' (so what do you expect me to do?) excuse being rolled out for the first time'. Not once did PHV admit we'd been given the wrong room (blatantly obvious as astartign palce to rebuild confidence). Painfully slow La terrasse drinks service - again 'but we're full' (So what? staff up to meet demand) Breakfast - at E90 I 'm fine with that - but the servcie and food needs to match. Manadarins, Four Seasons can do it (well), this hotel can't. No crockery at times, cutlery ran out (in a modestly busy service, which should have been predictable if the hotel was full) food ran out, ordered omlette (which was pretty poorly prepared and cold on arrival) turned up just as were finishing. So about 3/10 for breakfast. All in all, still a well located hotel I have used many times before, but based on this experience, management have lost the plot. Being full should not be an excuse for slapdash bad service. Here it is THE excuse all the satff seem to use. Perhaps the hotel's very arabic/nouveau russian money clientelle are less demanding.

The staff were all very helpful and most all had good English skills. Very professional and courteous without being overly \"friendly\". Before arrival, we had requested champagne and strawberries to be sent to our room one evening at 8 pm. As it turned out, we ordered room service that night at 730. The staff seemed surprised that I should even ask that they bring the champagne with the room service. Sort of a \"why wouldn't we bring them together, we aren't stupid\" kind of response. The staff knows what they are doing. We sampled most of the food options available at the hotel. The breakfast buffer is very large and the food quality was excellent. We had drinks in the bar one night and again the quality of the service, beverages and snacks were all top notch. Forgive the cliche, but we ordered onion soup from the room service menu. It was BY FAR the best onion soup we have ever had anywhere in the world. You might say, \"of course they would have good French onion soup, duh\" but let's not stereotype ! Everything about it was perfect. The onion soup at the Park Hyatt is on my Top 10 list of foods I would gladly get on a plane to have. We also ate one night at their 1 Michelin Star restaurant, Pur. The food quality was excellent (no surprise) but two aspects of the evening were a little disappointing. First, the flooring in the restaurant is wood. This made for a surprisingly noisy environment, principally from the staff moving about. Secondly, there were two larger parties with small children. The parents did make an attempt to control them, but the parties were louder than we were expecting. The location is excellent. Reasonable walking distance from the Louvre, Galaries Lafayette, the Opera House and easy cab rides or Metro to everywhere else you may want to go. Lots of shopping throughout the surrounding streets (clothiers, glassware and more). The spa is very good, but seemed to be underutilized. Overall, the Park Hyatt is an excellent hotel.

Having stayed at many hotels in Paris on previous trips from mid to high range, we used goldpassport points to stay for 4 nights at the Park Hyatt. I usually only stay at the Hyatt hotels in asia and tend to prefer boutique hotels in Europe however this choice made our last trip for us. What a fantastic place. From the common areas, to the room, the great room service and courtyard restaurant, everything was perfect. The brunch in the courtyard is highly recommended. I lost count as to how many Hermes bags I spotted at the tables, but you are never made to feel like a second class citizen if you don't have one. It was a great way to while away a few hours on a Sunday after we arrived. The rooms are a great size with dressing room (walk in robe) and large bathroom with separate bath. Every creature comfort is accounted for. The only thing I found highly unusual was the bar with the electronic monitor system, which registered usage as soon as something was moved and prevented you from putting your own drinks in. Very very strange for a high end hotel. You tend to find this in budget places. I guess this was their way of making you drink the ridiculously expensive water and drinks in the room (8 Euros for water!!!!) As a hyatt member, you also received a wine and chocolate welcome gift and free daily breakfast and internet (if you are a diamond member). The room service breakfast was excellent, though we only had it once as you otherwise cannot eat a thing during the day. These were lovely touches and it is so nice to be rewarded for loyalty to a hotel group. The location of the hotel is amazing. Right next to the Ritz and Place Vendome, with all the high end jewelry and clothing designers. It is also so close to Galleries LaFayette and their tremendous food hall. It is also easy walking distance to Champs Elysees, Louvre, L'Orangerie, Seine and pretty much anywhere on the tourist trail.

Although we had to use two rooms worth of points, we were pleasantly surprised when we shown to our room. Basically, we were given two rooms that were connected with a salon in the middle. What a amazing surprise! In the past when we were told that we would be \"pleasantly surprised\" by the room that we were being given, the opposite was true because it invariably ends up that we got a tiny room. The reception's idea of a cruel joke - in fact, this happened at what is now the Westin Paris near the Tuilleries Gardens (was Intercontinental when I stayed there years ago). Not on this visit, though, so kudos to the Park Hyatt! The suite was amazing, starting with the salon which had a large flat panel TV, a dining area and living area. Instead of coffee makers, the salon had a Nespresso machine with different options for coffees, plus an electric tea kettle and traditional tea pot! Our master was very spacious with a proper king-sized bed. Our bathroom was out of this world large that wrapped AROUND the room. We loved the rainshower AND the heated toilet/bidet - what a fun way to sit on the throne! The second bedroom was large as well with two twin beds. The service at the Reception and Concierge was excellent! Everyone was helpful and friendly. For a hotel this size, I was pleasantly surprised by how personal the service was. With 3-4 concierges, I always felt like they knew what was planned for us once I gave them my name even over the phone because we were out and about. The one gripe I have about the hotel is the doormen. They were completely useless, especially the main doorman (bald fellow). I felt like he really picked and chose who he thought would tip him best when seeking to help folks. Getting a taxi was a trial because he never bothered to help - on one evening, it was so bad that a security detail actually went out to hail a taxi for us when he saw that I tried to do this. I did offer this feedback to the hotel via their survey and got a response back. What a poor representation of such a classy hotel. Other things to mention is that we had breakfast in bed - very tasty and no more than your standard hotel. We didn't try their restaurants. The location is pretty convenient because it's close to most of the tourist attractions like the Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, etc. but it's a bit off the beaten track. It is class to nice shopping streets and some great shops (like Hermes!) - just a 10 minute walk. I don't think that I could stay anywhere else in Paris after staying here - it's really spoiled me for other hotels. On the next segment of our trip, we stayed at the Trianon Palace Versailles (a Waldorf-Astoria Collection hotel). Although it was nice, it was just such a letdown after the Park Hyatt. I will post that review shortly. One last thing - those creepy sculptures throughout the hotel are soooo creepy! Seriously, why?!

I've spent a lot of time in Paris while I was a student many many years ago, so this trip was mainly for some shopping and relaxing in a good hotel. I think this hotel is quite nice with some minor gripes. I had a smallish room (for a 5*) with a big queen bed , but it had a quite nice dressing room and a good bathroom with a separate rain shower, a separate toilet and a bath. The room height is several meters, so it didn't feel too tiny after all. The inner courtyard was pretty and quiet. I was not too keen on the several Rodinesques \"figures\" in the room. Weirdly, the hotel does not have pay movies (you can go the the reception and choose a dvd from a folder). In general the service was impeccable with one exception, a young waitress in the lounge hardly looked at me while serving my afternoon champagne. No matter how much time I spend in France I never get used to this attitude.... Otherwise the lounge is really nice for a quick bite or a drink, it seemed to be frequented by elegant locals as well. Speaking of which I think the hotel should impose a dress code, I saw several persons walking around in the evening in shorts and sports shoes... Also, I found it annoying when some guets let their child run around in the lounge. I can't tell you much about the food, I'm a vegetarian and I have to say that what was on offer was not much and not very impressing (pasta with tomato sauce, anyone?). I tasted a couple of different wines, they were quite good. The breakfast was included in my rate, so I had the buffet. It's ok, but nothing spectacular, loved the compote, tough. Three things I'd like to suggest for development: a better assortment of cheese (it's France after all!), the little baguettes are cute, but very hard, and it would be much more hygienic if the utensils on the buffet table had little plates where you put them instead of putting them in the bowls.

I spent four nights here recently, and originally booked this particular hotel because I simply wanted a nice, hassle and mishap-free stay. It turned out to actually be a highlight of our trip. This Park Hyatt has the nicest, most helpful, and most resourceful staff of probably any hotel in which I've ever stayed. When we checked in, our room wasn't ready and the front desk staff comped us a bottle of water while we waited probably no more than 5 minutes. It was a small token, I know, but still much appreciated. The concierge cheerily booked us dinner reservations at local restaurants on a regular basis because of our poor French. Also, on our last day a bottle of wine mysteriously showed up in our room. I'm not sure if this was because the staff had seen a few empty ones in our room over the course of the stay, or if this was the doing of the concierge staff (one of which asked for my room number for no reason I could discern at the time), but however it happened, it was a wonderful touch. As for the room, it was fantastic. The huge bathrooms are certainly anomalous among Parisian hotels, and the sink within the shower was extremely neat and surprisingly useful. The service staff are very vigilant about maintaining the room in the mornings and afternoon turn-down. My only very minor bone to pick is that the ice bucket in the room is so small that you cannot fit both the ice and a bottle of wine in it at the same time. I had to crush our ice in the sink and scoop it into the ice bucket around the bottle. Perhaps they have separate ice buckets specifically for bottles of wine, but I would have felt like a bit of an idiot calling down to ask that question. That said, I wouldn't have been surprised if they'd miraculously appeared with a larger ice bucket had I asked. To top it all off, I was extremely happy that in spite of booking this stay as an award using Hyatt points, we were treated as well as we were. Considering the average nightly rate here, I half-expected to be treated as a second-class citizen.

We're diamond Hyatt members and decided on our stay at the Park Hyatt. There is no Diamond Club Room, but they do offer complimentary Breakfast for Diamond members. This hotel is one of the most luxurious for European standards. Service = A+ Park Hyatt Vendome has won numerous awards for superior service, and rightly so. The staff speaks perfect English and did not appear insulted when we tried to use some French. They were very patient and helpful. Ask the Concierge for recommendations on where to go for Dinner and Sight-seeing. Our Concierge recommended \"Rue du Cler\", a little, non-tourist 2-block road with the cutest little shops and side cafes. Go to the Olive Oil store, and try their 12 year old balsamic vinegar that tastes like a delicious port wine. Fitness/Spa = B+ The Fitness center has state-of-art equipment. But, it's very small. 2 treadmills, 1 bike, and 1 eliptical. They supply water, headphones, TV, and apples. All equipment's in excellent condition, but very small. However, Paris real estate is in high demand, so I didn't expect it to be large. Spa is also very nice. Comfortable surroundings with jacuzzi, steam room, and sauna. Rooms = B+ The room size is great. We had ours facing the away from the noise, and can see the tops of the Eiffel Tower and Opera House. Rooms are very clean and new. Not as Modern as many has said - the designs seem more based on Rodin's Bronze sculptures. I only gave B+, because there were a few things I would change about the room. One is the ceiling. Some of the ceiling areas were sloped - so we hit ourselves on the ceiling a few times. The shower was also not very hot. We turned it all the way to 50 celcius, but it was still just lukewarm. The showers in the Spa room were at the right temperature Breakfast = A The food is pretty basic: fruit, cereal, bread, salmon, cheese, danishes. You can order eggs on the side. My husband had the eggs benedict, and I had an egg-white omelet with salmon. They were the best we ever had. Eggs included fresh herbs, which made all the difference. Breakfast is all about service. You get the best Illy coffee, and the eggs made on request. But, it takes a very long time to make the eggs. Expect to relax and spend about 1 hour on breakfast. Breakfast costs about $50 Euros a person. Location = A+ Walking distance to the Louvre, Musee d' Orsay and the shopping centers around the Opera House. Conveniently located to several Metro stations. There's a bus that takes you directly to Charles de Gaulle airport in 30 mins for about $10 Euros.

We were fortunate enough to be able to stay for three award nights. The hotel would normally be more expensive than what I am usually prepared to pay. However, there is a reason for the high price. For a start, the location of the hotel is just fantastic, on Rue de la Paix mid-way between Place Vend\u00f4me and the Op\u00e9ra, you are pretty much close to almost everything. That was great. Furthermore, the standard of the quality was great, rooms are (for Parisian standards) relatively spacious, large beds, walk-in closet and a great shower with separate shower, bath and toilet. The rooms hold designer B&O-televisions (although a bit small for today's standards), dvd-player and complimentary Evian water. Staff was awesome, spoke a good English (of course with a charming French accent) and were extremely helpful and friendly and not in the \"give-me-some-tips\"-imposing kind of way. Absolutely perfect, and probably the best staff I have met at any hotel around the world. The spa is a nice feature of the hotel with a small fitness centre, which feels nice to use in spite of its size, a large jacuzzi (for both men and women, so remember to bring swim suits), steam bath and sauna. I pretty much had it all to myself, which was also pretty nice. Massages and other treatments were also available, but at a pretty high cost (160\u20ac for a 1 hour massage). The same also goes for the prices of restaurants and mini bars. A bottle of coke from the mini bar would set you back by 12\u20ac. That is ridiculous. It is ok to charge high prices for the mini bar, but 12\u20ac for a coke, that's just out of this world. The restaurant, which by the way as far as I know holds a star in the Michelin guide, was also very pricy, and (full) breakfast costs 48\u20ac per person! With so many other nice options for breakfast just around the corner, we decided to skip this. I was told that it is indeed very nice, but again - it better be for 48\u20ac. Apart from the price level, the only thing missing here are the views. Most rooms will not have a view of anything but a tiny courtyard. Maybe a swimming pool would also be nice for a hotel of this standard. All in all - I warmly recommend this hotel to anybody able to spend bonus points here or travelling on an expense account.

Luckily we had daily breakfast buffet included with our room rate, which made it worthwhile.

As my room wasn't ready yet, he prepared my paperwork and took my luggage for me then asked if he could call me when the room was ready (unfortunately I didn't have cell service in France). When I returned several hours later (after a nice walk around the area), Marc took me directly to my room where my luggage had already been taken and showed me around the room. He pointed out the recent changes to the hotel and even mentioned that they were planning on doing some upgrades soon (yes, the flat screens are coming soon for those who are looking for them). The room, although not as spacious as the last time I was there was still very nice with a great bathroom (rain shower head and soaking tub) and a nice walk-in closet (almost as big as some hotel rooms in NYC!). The spa was nice----while I didn't take any treatments, I used the exercise room and co-ed sauna/whirlpool and was pleased. Only issue I had was that the attendant came in at 10pm to kick me out even though it said they were open until 11pm. Oh well, that's the French for you! Didn't try the restaurant but it looked good (pricey, but it's a hotel restaurant). Location is great especially if you want to see the Louvre.

The outside courtyard is open at least to 1 AM and you can easily hear the guests. So, while the hotel was nice, I'm not really sure it was worth the price - around $750 a night. For that price - I really was expecting this amazing room (decent size, new technologies, spotless, etc)- and that wasn't the case.

We managed to have enough points for one free night, which made the lowest-grade Park room barely affordable--we booked late this time due to schedule difficulties with the trip (a business trip for my spouse) and the rates were no bargain via Hyatt: 650 euros. As always, the concierge staff were extremely helpful before and during our stay. We used email in advance to secure restaurant reservations, although once again we were unable to get into Jules Verne. During the stay, they were helpful with directions. a museum pass for me (see trip report at http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k1998211-Paris_report_summary_of_a_fast_paced_trip-Paris_Ile_de_France.html) and in tracking down our delayed car on the departure day. All the staff are very young and chic, but not haughty or unfriendly, even when I showed up lugging my Monoprix shopping bags. I tried to balance looking bedraggled in white sneakers after a day in the museums with looking better and carrying my gold Ferragamo bag to dinner, but actually they treated me well no matter how un-chic I appeared! The hotel still has its signature fragrance in the halls and in the room. Our room was quite nice--they upgraded us a bit so we would not have to move, I think (the free night was supposed to be in a deluxe room). This room was smallish but was right on the street with the great view up to Opera and down to Place Vendome. I will attach photos to this review in a bit, once I get them loaded onto my computer, so please check back. The room was excellent, well kept (only a few carpet scuffs and a couple of loose threasd on the bedskirt corner). Despite having been there previously, I still have not mastered the complex light switch functions. Another constant--a design feature, not a bug, I am sure--is that water drains unpredictably and repeatedly from the shower head after use, sometimes in the wee hours of the morning. They have added additional TV channels, more in English now. Room service breakfasts are expensive (35 euros) so I was thankful for t he free coffee for Gold Passport guests, also delivered by room service. This is the latest in spring we've stayed here, and for the first time it was warm and the courtyard was open for drinks. It has a very nice atmosphere and excellent wine by the glass selections to choose from. The little dish of olives, nuts, and crackers served with the drinks is perfect. There is wifi in the rooms. We did not bring a laptop (my husband had ues of one where he was working) so I used the complimentary laptop/web access in the small room next to reception. I still am not used to the French keyboard, so please excuse the typos in the restaurant reviews, which I wrote there!

It is a great location for any tourist, and there's of course a taxi line for business people that need to be whisked off somewhere else. I think people that travel to Paris frequently will find contemporary designs for their rooms actually quite welcome, and that was how we felt about the room. The area around the bed is a little tight, but the bathrooms are amazing. The shower has a rain shower head and also there is a separate sink for shaving inside the shower area, and a place to sit if you like. The doors for the bathroom are clever, two perpendicular sliding doors that can be used to wall off the bathroom area. The food at the hotel is terrific - we were both surprised at the quality of the room service onion soup, for instance.

After looking into a number of hotels, including the classic palace hotels, we decided we wanted to stay somewhere with a little more modern chic. The staff was extremely helpful throughout our stay; from the moment we arrived through checkout, their service factored heavily into a most unforgettable stay. When we checked in, we found our suite faced the courtyard. Although the room was comfortably quiet, we had thought we reserved a room with a view of the street. When we asked if we could switch rooms, we were told that there were no street view rooms available. I was visibly disappointed but understood. After I returned to my room, about 30 minutes later we received a complimentary bottle of champagne and a bowl of fresh strawberries. We thought it a great effort on behalf of the staff to make up for the lack of street view room available to us. We had reservations one night at a restaurant that required us to reconfirm within 24 hours. When we didn't call the restaurant, they called our hotel as they were informed as to where we would be staying. The concierge took the liberty of reconfirming for us and slipped a confirmation note under our door. We appreciated the fact that they took care of that for us as we completely forgot we had to reconfirm. On another evening, we went to Le Bar in the hotel. The table side service and pouring was excellent and gave you that vintage cocktail bar impression. We also found the bartender to be a wonderful mixologist as he created drinks so delicious, we just had to order several rounds in order to try a few of their specialty cocktails. With regard to the hotel's dining options, unfortunately we did not eat at any of the restaurants. However, we ordered breakfast in the room several times. Basic American breakfast with your typical poached eggs, sausages and bacon. However, the bread basket we ordered additionally was fantastic. We felt that the in-house hotel bakers that made our mini baguettes, chocolate croissants, etc., could rival the best stand-alone boulangeries in Paris. One last note: I've read in other reviews about what has been said about the designer scent that permeates throughout the hotel corridors and lobby. Some guests tolerated it, while we, eventually, absolutely fell in love with it. When we first arrived, we found the scent to be like a little nudge that would not stop. After a day or two we got used to it and sought to buy it from the hotel in eau de toilette form to take home, but it was not for sale. However, all of the toiletries in our bathroom were of the same scent and we took those home instead. Now once in awhile, when my wife uses some of the hand lotion, the scent always reminds us of our honeymoon stay at the Park Hyatt Vendome.

My only complaints are rather minor. (1) the roman-style shades didn't block out the light in the morning and let the morning sun stream right into your face on the bed. I propped a pillow against the shades at night to close up the space. (2) the housekeeping would move all of my toiletries around to clean up the bathroom, even repacked them into my toiletry bag.

The hotel is very modern and our room was overlooking the Rue de la Paix which I loved. It was noisey with the windows open but it is Paris. We loved the sounds of the city. If you want more quiet, you can ask for an inside room. We asked for one facing the street and I loved that we could open the windows. Our room was quite large even by American standards. They upgraded us from a queen room to a king. The closet space was the best ever in Europe and maybe even in the U.S. We had plenty of room to hang all of our clothes and drawers as well. The bathroom was especially nice with heated marble floors, bathtub and a separate walk in marble shower. The service from the staff of the hotel was truly exceptional. We were very impressed with how nice and accommodating everyone was. I felt very safe walking by myself in this lovely area.

The location is great- quick walk to Louvre and the Tuileries etc. Only complaint-- while we were there a guest on a higher floor caused a fire in his room. Firetrucks were there for hours. The smell was noticeable in our room-- 4 floors beneath the fire. I was surprised that the managment did not slip a note under all of the guests' doors- explaining what had happened.

In my opinion, there is absolutely no comparison between the 2 hotels. The George V was excellent in every way, but that's another story. I'll stick with the Park Hyatt for my review here: Arrival: We arrived at the hotel and arrived to the ambivalent doormen. I believe they were fairly full due to a conference, but this is no excuse for having our bags quickly taken away without even a smile and quickly asking for our names. We were then just pointed quickly to the check-in desk and told they would take care of us. Check-in: Again, quite indifferent. Just a \"Here's your room, let me show it to you.\" When we got to the room, another \"here you go\" and nothing like \"Is this satisfactory?\" or any other issues. Again, not a huge deal, but for them to claim to be in the same category as other top of the line hotels in Paris- unacceptable. The Rooms: Nice and large and well-equipped. However, quite a bit too modern for my tastes and the air conditioner would not keep the room very cool. A little too dark also. Not a big problem with the overall room, as again it was quite nice, but not exactly my cup of tea. Room service: Good food. Timeliness was an issue though and they never really seemed to have their act together with regards to how many people were eating. Twice they set the table for 1 as my wife ordered a salad only so they thought that was my side dish even after I told them that it was for people. Had to have them return both times with addtional place settings. Business Center: Terrible. The good news is it's free but is is basically a cramped area behind the check-in desk with 2 PC's smashed close together. If you're working with someone else in the same room at once it gets very crowded. Overall I wasn't extremely disappointed, but for the hotel category they claim to be, they have some kinks to work out particularly in the service area. Would I return? Probably not, the main reason I would stay there is for the Hyatt Gold Passport points.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennington, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cThe Finest Hotel in Europe\u201d", "Author": "jackfurlongesq_123", "ReviewID": "UR5494239", "Content": "I purposely omitted a review of the Hyatt Place Vendome, for fear that gushing reviews only attract more people.

Spent a weekend there last summer before touring Provence, Venice, Lugano, and Geneva. Perhaps sorry to say, our first weekend in Paris was the highlight of the trip. The hotel is immaculate. Staff are peerless in their courtesy and accommodation (and being an American in Paris ain't the easiest these days). Junior suite was capacious, sleek, modern, well-arranged, and hundreds of Euro cheaper than George V or the other first-tier hotels. Steam room was free (a vanishing perk these days), restaurant and lounge were relaxing, and the location is easy walking distance to the Louvre, Seine, and Left Bank. We arrived at 9AM from an overnight flight and they booked us into our room immediately.

I had booked a standard room but upon check in the front desk informed me that they had several other categories of rooms available. I was shown a couple of rooms and decided to upgrade to a full suite. The standard room was small but had a nice bathroom. The suite I checked in to was priced at 1800E normally but they offered me the room at 980E. Overall the room was layed out nicely with several french doors opening on to a small terrace- very nice views! The room had a fireplace that the staff lite every morning and it automatically shut itself off at 200a. This added a lot to the overall feel of the suite. I was surprised at the hard wood floors throughout the suite. They definitely were showing their age with cracks and wear. The carpets (on part of the floor) were clean and fine. The bath was outstanding and incredibly large with 2 separate areas including a large shower and tub. The suite number was #540. I would recommend it for the location alone. The terrace was amazing. I would not pay the regular rate though of 1800E. I think that is way overpriced. I used the gym every day. It was small but nice. The steam room and mens changing area was imaculate and I cannot recommend it enough- Very Nice. The staff was professional and throughout my stay seemed very friendly. I had no problems with anyone. The bellmen were great too! I read in a couple reviews on this site that said all they did was smoke and act apathetic. I did not experience this attitude or treatment.

You do not expect from and international five star hotel to be clean: It is a given. It is hard to believe that doormen are busy smoking cigarettes in the afternoon. After all, they live from the tips. I stayed at the hotel at least half a dozen times and never had I to wait longer than a couple of seconds before being checked in. They deliver faxes promptly. Good internet connectivity. Businessmen and women did not vote the Park Hyatt to be the best hotel in Paris because its staff seems consistently bothered by any request. I do agree with one thing. There is no alarm clock. To be honest, who needs one in the age of gadgets like PDA, BB and mobile phones. The Park Hyatt is my hotel of choice. For leisure and business.

The two doormen were busy smoking cigarettes and seemed rather bothered by my arrival. The lone front desk agent was arguing with the guest in front of me when I arrived in the afternoon and tried to check in. After several minutes a second agent came out and rather than helping me she joined in the argument that was still going on. After several more minutes the first agent checked me in and told me that they remembered me from my prior stay and were very happy to have me back. Of note, I had never been to this hotel before. In any event, there were no rooms ready which was odd given that it was the mid-afternoon and the hotel was not fully booked. I waited an hour until a room was ready and it then took forever for my single bag to be delivered. The room itself was nice but not exactly set up for someone like myself who was travelling for business and it was not as clean as I would have liked. I also found it odd that there was no alarm clock in the room. I did not spend too much time at the hotel since I had to go to meetings but I did find that the staff, with the exception of room service which I used for breakfast in the morning, seemed consistently bothered by any requests I made.
