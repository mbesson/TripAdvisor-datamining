I did notice people in other rooms moving around early in the morning. There were no extras, no iron, hairdryer, coffeemaker etc.and I noticed that there was no waste bin in the room, just in the bathroom. The shower was excellent, lots of hot water though. The breakfast that was included was just cereal, croissants, toast and jam/peanut butter and coffee or tea. Enough for a quick start but not for a nice start to the day. The main advantage of this hotel is if you want to explore the Plateau district. It is a multi-ethnic and quite trendy area with lots of restaurants, bars and interesting shopping. One evening, we watched people practicing their tango dancing outside in one of the little squares that can be found in the area.

I searched for hours on the internet for the seemingly impossible combination of a great deal, good location, and comfortable yet simple accommodations. Finally, I came across this hotel and it completely lived up to my expectations, even exceeded them. In February, Montreal is rather cold and this weekend it even snowed a few inches, but we got an amazing nightly rate. We spent three nights at about $45 American dollars per night for a big room with a king-size bed, private bathroom, and free wireless internet... that's insane! Staff are very very friendly. Housekeeping probably thought we were so annoying, as we were never out of the room when they came by. But on return to the room in the evening - fresh towels were there. The woman who checked us in had great energy and answered all of my questions. I was so nervous that maybe our reservations were not received, or that they would stick us in some gross tiny room with no windows and a single bed. Not the case at all!! Everything went so smoothly, our room was exactly what we wanted. King-size bed was very comfortable (and I'm picky about beds). I liked the little chairs set up near the window. I generally hate hotels, especially huge commercial ones, but my boyfriend felt uneasy about a bed&breakfast type accommodation for this trip - Hotel Plateau Royale is the perfect happy medium. It's relatively small and homey (welcoming, informal and intimate), but we still had a satisfying sense of anonymity and simplicity. We actually spent a lot of time downtown, as we were visiting friends and doing specific activities there. The weather was at times frigid and parking short-term (although in warmer months the hotel has parking available at a fee) so we drove to most local destinations, in better conditions this hotel seems a nice walk to rue Ste-Catherine. But we did find a cute and relatively inexpensive local bar on Avenue du Mont-Royal (Est) called Le Boudoir (nice local art and free used books!) , as well as some nice shops and coffee spots. I hate feeling too touristy, and this hotel is within a cute, somewhat trendy, neighborhood that I wish we had had more time to explore! ONLY minor \"dislike\": I would have liked a fridge to keep juice, wine/beer, or minimal food items, but only if we had stayed longer (so we never asked about it).

When we arrived to our original hotel, we discovered there was an involuntary error on their part regarding our booking. Due to this mistake, they kindly assisted us in every way possible to find suitable accommodation as soon as possible. The receptionist on shift searched for a hotel in the immediate vicinity and found that Plateau Royale Hotel had vacancies with a pricing of $132/night for two. She also showed us the pictures with the pricing of this type of room we needed. She contacted the person in charge and was given confirmation that they did have a room available for that price. When she transferred me to the lady in charge, the lady sounded extremely polite and obtained my information right away trying to know the correct spelling of my card and number immediately. Once we arrived to the hotel, the lady in charge, a beautiful woman with dark hair and blue eyes was waiting for us with the bill ready to be signed. When I saw the price, $546.42, I inquired why if the price quoted on their website was different. She explained that it can't be because it's Grand Prix weekend and there must have been a mistake on the website. She also said that Room 18 was the only room she had because an Italian client had called to cancel his booking at last minute because there were problems with his flight. She sounded very convincing saying that I will have difficult to find places everywhere else because hotels were full, etc. I decided to sign because I felt I had no alternatives. When she gave us our key, we went to find our room and we were shocked! It was a dusty room in the basement. It smelled of mould and the window was facing what could be called half of a wall. There was no light and the place was awful. We got really angry and of course we decided to leave. We also had the receptionist of our original hotel called the lady to tell her that they had to rectify this immediately. She also told the lady that they had agreed as to what our price would be and sent her the link with the information. When we went to reception, the lady said that she did understand our frustration. She said she wanted to make us happy and understood that our original hotel always gave them referrals and she wanted to keep things that way. She seemed to have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a room on her computer, opened a drawer full of key passes (not that they had no rooms?) and sent us to room 52 saying that she would be looking for the link because she was too busy that moment. We were able to see lots of nervousness in her because she did all the talking and almost gave us no chance to talk. She constantly repeated, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You came here, I did not bring you here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We went into the room and it was not a room worth $546.42 at all. The sheets were clean, but the covers had stains inside and were a bit smelly. The bathtub also had debris with the traces of an old mat. I do have pictures of what I saw. When we went downstairs to ask for the original price we saw initially or a refund, she said that she could not do that because she was only an employee who earned $10/hr and she could just not reverse the transaction and then pay from her pocket. I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How come you credited a client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Credit Card and debited her debit card.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said she did it only because the client was paying anyway. She repeated again that we went to the hotel and she did not bring us there. Then she said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You think that the rooms in the other hotel are better? I will not say anything but \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather not say anything about the rooms in the other hotel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The worst part is that she said that the link that we saw did not open. When we called the receptionist of our original hotel, she said that she believed this woman changed it because she could not open it any more herself. It just cannot be that three people saw visions when we saw the web site with the pricing on it. In the end, when I asked to see the lady's supervisor to get a refund, she said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the supervisor.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She insisted that it was in their regulations because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grand Prix period and repeated, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You came here... We did not bring you here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, I was not shown any papers to this effect and I in fact think she is the owner of this hotel. It also did not seem to be full at all because it was fairly quiet. My question is, how come our money was so welcome and not us by the sound of her message saying that we went there and she did not bring us there?

Upon returning that night, the room was warmer - but still not too warm. Also, when I went to go take a shower that night, I realized that there was no warm water. The sink's faucet gave luke warm water sometimes but the tap in the tub stayed ice cold the whole time. I did not consider this a big deal at the time and so did not mention it to the staff. I regret this now as I could have possibly warned them of an underlying problem with the plumbing that may lead to the future ruin of the hotel and the owner's family structure. In conclusion, this hotel is great for the price. The staff are unusually helpful; it's located close to downtown and right at the bottom of Mont Royal; the room are nice and clean - quiet too; beds are comfy with even comfier pillows; and the only downside is the lack of hot water (which it didn't say IT HAD so I guess maybe I shouldn't expect it). Also ask about the supposedly offered \"free breakfast\" because nothing was mentioned to us about it once we were at the hotel.", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel\u201d", "Author": "99Red", "ReviewID": "UR10799668", "Content": "Spent three nights at the Plateau Royale Hotel.
