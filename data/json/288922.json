We have often stayed at the Harbourview and until recently I considered that the Harbourview had the best views in Sydney. I now pass the 'best view' mantle to Harbourside Apartments and will recommend this accommodation to anyone, with a couple of caveats. We stayed two nights on 19 & 20 August. Reception - Entering the grounds has a strong wow factor . Initial impression is strongly positive but then we enter the Lobby which is microscopic and realise that this is self catering apartments not a hotel. Reception is friendly and professional but limited. There are only one or two staff and if you have a problem they may not be able to fix it right away - fortunately the system worked for us and we arrived in our one bedroom apartment on the 14th floor without incident. I was able to secure the last car parking space on the grounds. Apparently they have undercover parking as well but I never learnt how to access it. The immediate reaction when entering the apartment is .. \"oh my God! Look at this view! It certainly would be hard to find a better outlook in Sydney. Fixtures and fittings were slightly worn but functional - ditto the kitchen. I was quite happy with the instant coffee sachets provided but my wife thought that the trendy, London labelled 'fair trade' tea tasted pretty bad. I had to pull our bed out from the wall and plug in one of the bedside lights that hadn't been plugged in (or more likely unplugged by some inconsiderate guest using electronic equipment in the bedroom and not plugged in again.) Bathroom was small but clean. Toiletry products offered were of a good standard. Water pressure was quite low although not bad enough to warrant a complaint. There was a small flat screen TV that we never turned on and heating from a couple of Oil column heaters that was more than adequate. Guest information provided would be helpful to those unfamiliar with the City. There is an internet facility as well but once again we didn't use it. Bed was very comfortable and linen was of high quality. We found the many eateries of Blues Point offered a good range of eating and drinking options. Much better than the soulless concrete canyon that is North Sydney after 7 pm. Good points The view!! The location - ferry at your door Good bed Quiet Not So Good No frills service - if you want hotel service it's probably best to stay in a hotel. You will need to bring food and drink or go out to eat and drink. They have a breakfast hamper available but I'm not sure that it is great value. Price - we paid $478 for a 1 bedroom harbour view apartment for two nights and this is the cheapest time of year.

We were there for a week in October 2010 and again for 4 nights in November, in studio apartments with harbour view.

Although initially somewhat concerned about the ground floor location (especially as it's right near the ferry stop), the complex is generally secure and I felt perfectly safe at night. I've stayed in three North Sydney hotels and the facades are generally dated. The interior of my apartment at Harbourside was also dated, but highly functional. I had everything I needed and the apartment was very comfortable. The lack of frills (read: self-catering) was perfect for me as I enjoy the change from room service meals when I'm away for work. The location is great for leisure, but unless you're driving, bussing or taking cabs, it's an uphill walk to the North Sydney CBD. This didn't bother me, but it should be taken into account. I've always been a fan of McMahon's Point, so the location was perfect for me - a vast improvement on the relatively soulless North Sydney CBD (especially after work hours). Restaurants and shops are a 5-10 minute (uphill) walk. The complex has a pool, but no fitness facilities. That said, there are several walks you can do and given the spectacular location, they're highly recommended. The setting is lovely - you're right on the harbour. I was able to step out of my apartment and take in the wonderful views. Even though I travel to Sydney often, I can never get enough of the beautiful harbour. The ferry is nearby and a fifteen minute walk (or five minute cab or ten minute bus trip) will take you to North Sydney Station.

The queen size bed was comfortable but when I went to open the cupboard doors to hang some clothes up, there was a very musty unpleasant smell so decided against using the cupboards. The bathroom was clean and the shower was very good - excellent water pressure out of the nozzle!!! There was a full self-contained kitchen with stove, oven, microwave, fridge, toaster, kettle etc and complimentary tea/coffee/sugar/biscuits but we didn't use it.

There are openable windows, but if it's a noisy weekend night at Luna park, you might not want to keep them open.

The blind in the bedroom fell down when I moved it and it looked like a generation of guests had had it fall down on top of them before delicately balancing it back.

Why to do I pick it, well the views are stunning and cannot be obtained by any other hotel in Sydney. The apartments are situated on the north side of the harbour and as previous reviews have stated you are some what isolated. I dispute this somewhat for a number of reasons. 1. A bus service runs up to North Sydney every 15 mins (7am to 6pm Mon to Sat) from McMahons point, a 1 minute walk from the apartments. 2. You can walk up to North Sydney in 15 mins, uphill on way up but great views and a lovely walk. 3. Small local shops and restaurants are dotted all the way up with larger supermarket type shops once your in North Sydney 4. The ferry service is excellent, frequent and on time so getting over the the main city is not only easy, it's great fun and a noval way to travel every day. I stay in a harbour view room, it costs extra but worth it. Cannot rate the other room types. Have had a 1 bedroom a 2 bedroom and this time a newly refurbished studio room. Note that not all the rooms have been done but they do need it as they are a little tired. So check when you book! I have placed pictures on the site so you can see what it looks like. On the plus side the apartments are clean, tidy and quiet at night. You can make use of the outdoor pool from 7am to 10pm each day or have a BBQ in the recreation area. Neither of which I have done. On the downside watch out for the old woman that mans the front desk very early in the morning. She needs to learn some customer service skills. I had a run in with her over the vending machine not giving me a drink when I put in my money. She was very rude and said that it did not belong to them and she could do nothing to help me! It was the way she said it and acted that got me upset! The internet usage fee is also a but of a rip off. $22 per day (not wifi) or $100 for a week there is also a limit on downloads of 80mb a day. There is no air conditioning in the rooms, they do have fans. This may sound like a big issue and could be on really hot days but remember you are by the water so it cools down very nicely at night.

We wouldnt stay again as we prefer something more up market when on holiday.", "Date": "March 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queenslander", "Title": "\u201cWow! this place is a winner\u201d", "Author": "PearlerQueenslander", "ReviewID": "UR6902735", "Content": "Sydney Harbour in your face all day and all night.

We found the hotel on a web site \"wotif\" and had a resonable rate for our stay there. Our 2 bedroom appartment was on the 7th floor with big corner windows which looked out at the harbour bridge and opera house. That was pretty amazing. The rest of the rooms were ok, with a small bathroom. We had a car so it was very good for parking( no charge) and we used the ferries to get to town. It did get very cold in the evenings as the windows are thin and no central heating, although we did get a radiator from the staff there. We would stay there again as it was convenient and easy to get around with the ferries which is great fun in Sydney.", "Date": "June 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "roma, italy", "Title": "\u201cunfortunate stay...with buggs\u201d", "Author": "claudiocastelluccia", "ReviewID": "UR4314664", "Content": "dont stay in hotel...bugs in room and bed....gardener rude e noissy.....view and brochure looks good...dont belief...rest terrible..furntiure old and tired....terribkle time", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "GaryColeman", "ReviewID": "UR4298808", "Content": "I stayed at Habourside apartments for 4 nights in December 2005.
