{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Serendipitous stay at Tokyu Stay Shibuya Shin-minamiguchi When I had to attend the Tokyo international Bookfair, I intended to stay at the Washington Tokyo Bay Ariake Hotel (which i reviewed here last year) right across the Tokyo Big Sight convention center on Odaiba. Unfortunately, no single rooms were available. Instead, I looked up the Tokyu Stay website on the recommendation of a friend who visited Tokyo often.E-mail booking was easy. Access from the airport was via the dependable Ariport Limousine Bus service plus a very short cab ride. Was pleasantly surprised by this apartment hotel. The room was well-appointed, the staff a bit reserved but helpful. And since it was so close to the Shibuya station:1. moving around Tokyo was a breeze2. and the proximity to so many eating places and food shops (some of the best under Shibuya Station itself), I was able to indulge and cook a beautifully marbled Kobe steak and some enormous mushrooms at a fraction of the cost in a restaurant.Oishi!For more details and photos of my room there, you can go to myblog at [---]", "Date": "Dec 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR258469866", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "indioink"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d1115748-r22667356-Tokyu_Stay_Shibuya_Shin_minamiguchi-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1115748", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
