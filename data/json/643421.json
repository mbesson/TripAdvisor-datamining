I liked the photos and booked 1 Comfort Apartment for single use for 7 nights. And when I checked in yesterday the hotel staff who barely spoke English demanded me to pay 100% upfront, and I paid as I trusted in Booking.com! And then she brought me to this tiny room at the end of the corridor! It was a tiny tiny room with a single bed and a tiny tiny living room! It wasn't the promised Comfort Apartment with spacious bedroom with a double bed and a nice big living room! So here I am stuck in this terrible hotel, the hotel staff are very rude and barely speak English... I don't know if it's Booking.com who provide people with false info or if it's this Central Inn hotel who cheat people! Avoid Central Inn!", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cOverall Pretty Happy\u201d", "Author": "fearlessbobfunkhouse", "ReviewID": "UR123589242", "Content": "Certainly not the best hotel I have stayed in but it was clean and in a good location and good value for money.

I would recomend it. Good ration price-quality. I was asked to pay when I arrived. I paid in cash. The biggest advantage is the location of the hotel. It's very close to Central Train Station (walk cca 10 minutes). Bus stop is located in front of hotel. I was accommodated in a single room with shower and WC. They changed towels every day. Room and bathroom was clean. Only wifi signal in the room was weak, but worked.

The room & the bathroom were spotless. We paid the extra 5Euros a person for the breakfast (available on the weekend) from the restaurant attached and it was great - breads, marinated vegetables, scrambled eggs, cereal, among other things - not what I was used to getting from typical German breakfast.
