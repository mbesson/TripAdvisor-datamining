The room was a standard size for a city centre hotel room. the room is more than adequate for a short stay and the toiletries included toobrush and paste, shoe shine, razor and cream, soap (hand), shower gel and shampoo. (Read recent reviews for the mini bar), hairdryer ok, slippers, bathroom, safe, okay, a quick word regarding the shower/toilet....it is a glass wall into the 'bathroom' area, the shower and toilet are seperate cubicles and have smoked glass. ***my partner and i have been together for a long time and therefore the lack of privacy whilst using the bathroom/toilet wasn't an issue but i wouldn't recomend this hotel if it was your first romantic weekend away together. There is a mechanical blind for the glass wall to offer some privacy! Breakfast was varied and plentyfull, it would have been nice for the coffee dispensing machine to have distributed coffee when i pressed the coffee button but the hot chocolate was reasonably tasty alternative and after 2nd day i gave up and pressed the espresso once and topped up with milk button, personally i would have liked an option to have an english breakfast but we were in spain and if i wanted english breakfast that much i could have gone to London!!!! The convention centre was next door and saturday night had a music gig on so was a bit loud until early hours of the morning but it didn't spoil the stay As with previous posts don't bother with a taxi public transport very good, if you arrive at barcelona (el prat) walk to the train station where you will find ticket machines, buy a T10 card (9.50 euro's) this gives you 10 journeys, catch the train into Passeig de Gracia train station (only 1 train you can catch they run every half and hour or so and can be busy walk to the far end of the platform) get off at Gracia and find metro (red diamond with M) and your looking for L4 (yellow line) take the line to LA PAU get off at El Maresme-Forum and the hotel is out of the station turn right and its about 250 yards. Gothic centre, olympic port/ marina all on L4 line. Once you've entered the metro you can travel anywhere on the tube for no extra cost in zone 1 even if you change lines. We travelled on the tube at 10.30pm from baceloneta and felt safe travelling on the tube that late. Same advice as ever in a city centre keep your wits about you and you'll be fine. There is the shopping centre next door to the hotel and it has all the usual international eateries (mcdonalds, burger king etc on the 3rd floor) and supermarkets and shops on the lower floors, there are restaurants out the back of the centre on the hilton hotel side. Barcelona has a lovely beach with deep golden sand its worth a visit, and is reasonably close to the hotel. I would agree with the other reviews regarding service but i like being left alone and not fussed when i'm away. All in all hotel is good and apart from the usual mini/minor gripes i would stay here again.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nicola C", "ReviewID": "UR128076282", "Content": "Amazing hotel.

It is surrounded by Barcelona\u2019s skyscrapers, the natural museum (\u00a37/person including botanical garden \u2013 in my view not quite worth it but it could be good fun for children) and Barcelona\u2019s beaches. Positives The hotel has 26 floors. We asked when booking for a high floor not quite knowing how high the hotel was. We had a 20th floor room with stunning views of the city. Especially at night it was simply beautiful. The rooms are 5 star rating with everything you would need (except bathtub \u2013 compensated by an excellent shower). The rooms were clean and well equipped. The mini-bar (1 beer, 1 coca cola, 2 bottle of water and a soft drink) was free. Bathrobes and sleepers included. In the price of the room we had 50 minutes free massage at the hotel\u2019s spa. The hotel has 2 pools, one of them at floor 23 with stunning views of the Mediterranean Plenty of choice at breakfast including fresh fruit and vegetables Good location near the metro, buss to city centre and taxi station. It is also great location for running or walking along the beach. The beaches are in walking distance. The taxi (station across the road) to the airport takes about 20-30 minutes depending on the traffic and it costs around 25-35 euros. It is worth it as there is no direct link for the airport via public transport. Negatives What was missing from the room: wireless internet (you needed cable to connect \u2013 not sure if chargeable) and team-making facilities. The pools (level 3 and level 23) are small but this was compensated by the views. No wireless access in the hotel (apart from reception) Staff was probably the main complaint. In short I did not feel welcomed and I found the staff attitude to be cold and not very helpful. At breakfast the story was the same, the only interaction with the staff was just to be asked the room number. After that we were left to our own devices in a very big and crowded restaurant. The breakfast staff laughing, whistling and humming around the tables was also not great either. At the restaurant at dinner, the food was superb but pricey (expect to pay 60-70 euro for two with drinks and a desert). Our bill was mistaken and we were overcharged 25 euros. Fortunately we saw the mistake in time and the mistake was rectified. The massage was good but the phonic insulation of the two massage rooms was inexistent and it was a bit difficult to relax during the massage. On the day we left out flight was at 5PM. The checkout was at 12. We asked the hotel for a late check-out (2 hours). We were told that was not possible as the hotel was full the next day. However, if we choose to pay half a day accommodation we could stay in the room until 7PM. We explained we only needed 2 hours but we were told that unless we pay 85 euros we cannot have the room as the hotel was full. Do I need to say more? Overall, the hotel is great, comfortable and in a good location. The staff was not great and they were not very keen to help. Would I recommend it? Yes, for the views and location not for a great overall experience. Would I go again? No, I wouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBarca getaway\u201d", "Author": "loughton09 Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126972126", "Content": "Stayed for 5 days.

The location didn't bother us, yes it does take about 20 minutes to get into the center but the sites/museums etc in Barcelona are so spread out that no matter where you stay you will have to travel around. Wear sensible and comfy shoes. The tram stop is closer than the metro station but runs every 8-12 minutes during the day so you may have to wait a while. Luckily the number 7 bus also goes down Av Diagonal towards the metro and the bus stop is right next to the tram. I' recommend figuring out where you want to go and then timing with the different transport options - or throw money at the problem and take a taxi. The hotel is definitely not 4 star (sup) which I'm assuming stands for superior. There are some nice touches such as robes and slippers in the room, free minibar and (wired) internet in the room. Breakfast was nice lots of choice but some of the fruit looked sad and the quality was just slightly below par. If a hotel claims to be superior to 4 stars then I arrive with certain expectations. There was a leak from the bathroom above and we asked to be moved to another room. Their preference was to call maintenance before we move but we insisted - there was a stream of water dripping from the ceiling! The room we moved to didn't have a shower curtain or screen. As we were only staying one more night we didn't mention it to the front desk - we decided it was better to put up with that than cart our bags to another room. The pool on 23rd floor was nice, heated and more so than the smaller pool on the 3rd floor. we were the only people there but I can imagine that it would not be as enjoyable with more people there. The hotel has over 300 rooms and pools, gym and saunas really aren't big enough to accommodate that amount of guests. The jacuzzi was cheap, not hot enough and looked like it was bought for someone's back garden. One of the lifts broke and wasn't fixed over the weekend - when the hotel was at it's busiest. Overall, the Barcelona Princess was good value for money as long as you don't expect quality or service above a standard 4 star hotel.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cGood but disappointing\u201d", "Author": "Muriel D Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126047458", "Content": "A work a fantasy for the architect but in reality nothing much than a 3stars hotel of this category.

My tips are, buy a 10 trip ticket from any of the ticket machines for about 10E. can use then on tram, metro or bus. Catch the tram to \"Glories\" and catch the metro red line to Catalunya square and begin your sight seeing. Or you can get the yellow line from \"Forum\" close to the hotel, but a bit of a long round about trip to get to the square. Anyway, would recommend this hotel for sightseeing or business.

Only downside to the junior suite was the large square, hard, uncomfortable pillows which meant we did not sleep as well as hoped and the AC wasnt great.

Breakfast had lots of fresh produce however the advertised full English breakfast consisted of only mini sausage, bacon and scrambled egg in the breakfast hall. We had breakfast in our room on the last morning which was much better and consisted of everything advertised including beans, fried egg, bacon, sausage and toast with English tea; with a supplement of 6 euro. Evening meals from the room service menu are reasonably priced and very tasty and well presented with various free condiments available plus no tray charge. Hotel facilities were nicely kept and both pools were open and heated to a lovely temperature.

A mixed bag of pros and cons..seemed to me that some people are just moody and expect too much. The literature was impressive and it was close to the city, it would surely be fine.. Unfortunately, it was not. * Top floor pool 'Out of Use' * Top floor bar closed * Bar on third floor closed (apparently both of these bars are only open in the Summer..would have been nice of them to tell me that on their website before I took 3 trains, 2 flights and bus- 12hrs in total- to get there) * The jacuzzi was lukewarm, half-full and after a while the chemical disinfectant started to cling to my skin. On top of that, I had to ask reception to send someone up to switch it on on my first day there..that was after I'd hunted out the phone which I'd been directed to by the masseuse. It was also only half working, with sporadic jets, broken drains and rusty bolts. * The sauna gave a burning smell which meant I had to leave after a few minutes. * There was not one iron to be had in the whole hotel. I was offered a laundry service at \u20ac13. Now, the lady was extremely pleasant and done a great job, but \u20ac13 to iron a shirt, within an hour or not, is ridiculous. How can you call it a 4* hotel and not have an iron? * The minibar consisted of 5 drinks; two soft, two water and a beer. It was nice, and pleasant, particularly when there was such a nice view to admire. But no nuts, no crisps, it's not a 'FREE MINIBAR', it's a few drinks. * The breakfast at \u20ac19 was massive and nice enough..but you can't justify charging that price for a breakfast. I sat from about 7.15 to 7.50 and I was literally the only person in the huge dining room. It could have fed 30-40 easily. It just didn't make sense. * It's not cable TV, it's a mixture of free to view and some prescription channels. On the upside everyone I spoke to was extremely pleasant, the view from the room was fantastic, and the interior and design of the rooms was impressive and very comfortable. They did cancel the laundry charge and offer me a free breakfast, after some pressing and their insistence that they didn't have any authority to, and that the duty-manager who wasn't on duty didn't either and couldn't speak English anyway, but all in......this is not a 4* hotel..and if they are advertising features which they do not offer..people who invest time and money on perhaps honeymoons, anniversaries, family holidays or like me just looking for a relaxing break will be disappointed. It's a shame because it is run by friendly people and could be what it claims..but they don't seem to be able to, or have the will to, provide it..and that is simply not acceptable.

But then, there was sometimes an odd smell in the general area (if you're flying into Girona Airport, it might smell like the middle of a farm!!) If you want to be in the middle of everything then this is not the hotel for you. But it is so easy to get to 'action' from here that I don't even see it's location as a negative.

We were given a room on the last floor (26th), the bed was huge and confortable.

That said, if you're not in town to attend the conference centre, I'd give this location a miss. It reminds me of London's Docklands area; it's soulless and lacks any of the colour and energy that Barcelona has to offer. The Good The hotel looks quite lovely. The bedroom has an open plan design - there's a glass wall separating the bathroom from the bedroom and within the bathroom area the toilet and shower areas are separate frosted glass cubicles. There is a large blind that can be pulled down to create some privacy in the bathroom, should you wish to have that. All the surfaces in the bathroom and the sinks are made of glass too. The result is a pleasure to the eyes and creates a wonderful sense of space. The room's not small, but not the most generously sized room I have stayed in. The bed was firm and had nice crisp linen and a duvet. The TV worked perfectly well too. There's also a free mini-bar int he room which has complimentary soft drinks and beer. There's Internet access, but only via a cable connection (so annoying if, like me, the iPad is now your travel PC!). The wardrobe includes slippers and a robe. There's also a small desk and chair in the room. The not so good. Most annoyingly (for a business hotel) there's no iron in the room and, as mentioned above, no WiFi (two things I consider essential for a business hotel). Whilst there's a nice amenity kit (with toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, soap, shower gel, and shower cap), they didn't bother with a razor or body lotion. Summary This is a nice hotel that is wonderfully designed. Unfortunately a few essentials have been missed, but that's a minor quibble. The one thing that lets the place down is the location.

The hotel isn't in the best location for exploring the city, but I would much prefer to stay in luxury and make the effort to travel in than be ripped off with a dump hotel in the prime tourist spots. We had a beautiful room on 16th floor with a sea-view. The hotel has everything you'd expect from a modern business hotel - bathrobes, multi-jet shower (which yes, did leak - but that's the cleaner's problem!), electric blinds, huge beds, mini bar (soft drinks were included in our deal). The pools, gym, sauna and jacuzzi are also a nice bonus which you rarely get in a city centre hotel. Transport links generally seemed pretty good, we used the tram and metro during the day (although we didn't realise there was a metro station right outside until the last day!) and taxis in the evening which cost about 10 euros to get into the city. A few minor negatives with the hotel.... it has two pools: roof-top and 3rd floor pool which are both nice but both pools are positioned so that they only get the sun in the morning. So don't expect to get in from a day of exploring the city and sit in the sun round the pool. Taxis could be a bit of a nightmare at peak times ie. Friday and Saturday night. There is a taxi stand outside the Marriott opposite but rarely any taxis in it. We asked the hotel to order us one on a number of occasions which they did for us. Breakfast in the hotel is extortionate at 19euros pp and there didn't seem to be much else around the hotel in terms of cafes/restaurants so would advise trying to get a deal with your booking or travel into town for something a bit better value for money.

My husband and I were checking out early in the morning and asked the give up a packed breakfast. We were unpleasantly surprised to find only 2 sandwidges and a pack of chips in a huge breakfast box. Very bad image for a hotel to give a pack of chips as a breakfast for guests. Pool on the 3rd floor is nice but it's location on the 3rd floor is awful !!! Jakuzzi is located on the same floor and it's opened. Lot of dust and noise from the street and people from the hotel opposite, can see you sitting in Jakuzzi, and you have a feeling that you sit in Jakuzzi in the middle of the street. There is a 2m wide swimming pool on the 23 floor but we didn't use it because my husband used sauna as well and it was only on the 3 floor. Sauna was always very cold, only +70C, but I think you can ask to put it up. We simply didn't bother. Rooms with the sea view don't worth paying extra. The area between the hotel and the seashore is very ugly and looks more like an indisrtial area. View over the city is much better, expecially at night. The rooms are of good size and design, except that of the awful glass wall separating what supposed to be a bathroom from the room. There is a black shutter to pull it down but I still felt very uncomfortable as there is no door in the \"bathroom\". Beware, that the rooms have to tea/coffee facility and no iron. I took everything with me as my husband drinks a lot of coffee and it's more convinient to make your own any time you wish rather than calling room service. The location of the hotel is good, only 10 min walk to the nearest beach, huge shopping mall with nice restaurants is next to the hotel.

The staff all spoke English (most very well but some not so well). We weren't very impressed with the beach nearest the hotel. There was a lot of debris including broken glass and a knife. The sand was also not very nice it had a lot of small stones in it. The beach at the Olympic Port was much nicer and had a better crowd. It was quite easy to get there using either the underground or tram. The tram from the hotel terminates at the Olympic Port. It is then about a 5-10 minute walk from the underground and tram stations to the beach. We were pretty impressed with the hotel until the penultimate day when a pair of pyjamas went missing from our room. We reported this to reception who said they would check with housekeeping to see if they had collected them by mistake. We checked with reception later that day who after much difficulty trying to explain what had happened, contacted housekeeping only to find no-one had been in contact with them. The reception staff took our details and advised we contact the next day to see if anything had turned up unless they contacted us in the meantime. I actually left if 5 days. It took four days for the hotel to respond only to say they had been unable to locate them. Disappointed with the response I replied to the hotel suggesting that they could compensate me for the loss. After 10 days I had not received a response so I contacted the hotel again. I received a reply almost immediately to say that it takes time to contact people because everyone is away on holiday during August but they are not able to help. This is not the sort of customer service you expect from a four star hotel and this has now completely soured my view of the hotel so much so that I would not recommend people stay.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, close to beach, well out of city\u201d", "Author": "liamr", "ReviewID": "UR117417095", "Content": "I will start this review with the hotel location; it\u2019s in the forum district, which is a long way from the city centre of Barcelona. If you really like being in the middle of things this hotel is not for you. However the metro and tram system\u2019s are right outside the hotel making it very easy to get into the heart of things in 10 mins from leaving the hotel, the metro system is very good and frequent. Taxi\u2019s to city centre are about \u20ac10, to airport about \u20ac30. Both hop on/hop off bus services also leave from outside the hotel as well making it a very accessible hotel even though it is so far away. Onto the hotel, the free mini bar is a nice touch, breakfast was ok, not brilliant, wouldn\u2019t pay extra for it. Our room was on floor 20, the room was very good, pillows were bad and the bed was ok. View of the city from here was amazing. Didn\u2019t really try the pools as they are small and claustrophobic, you feel like you are in someone\u2019s back garden rather than a hotel. The rooms are well laid out, automatic blinds block out the light and the sleeping area is enclosed, limiting noise from the hall. Air-con & shower were great as well. The staff were brilliant and a delight to deal with, every request greeted with a smile and a helpful response. I can\u2019t say enough about them, check in and check out were fast and when I asked for late checkout to allow sometime to recover from a bout of food poisoning (not hotel related) the only issue they had was they could only give me the room until 2 as they were fully booked. There is also a shopping centre and huge supermarket inside so all manner of things can be gotten there, wouldn\u2019t eat there but good for supplies. One bad note is there is a smell outside the hotel (some sort of processing plant close by) which is one of the worst smells I have ever encountered. Avoid heading straight across the road for any reason as it\u2019s just beyond the event centre. If going to the beach walk to the Hilton and cross the road there, the smell doesn\u2019t seem to make it down to the beach but makes walking outside a daunting task. Overall given the price we got the hotel for which included breakfast and the ease of using the public transport this hotel is well located for beach access and a quiet retreat after a night in the city.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "Cathy B", "ReviewID": "UR117416858", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona for a short break.

The hotel is a bit out of the way if you only want to site see. I am the type of person that likes to experience the city for more than the tourist traps. When I booked this hotel it was a toss up between it and the Hilton(right across the street). I decided to go with the the Princess because it provided free internet. The internet works great if you are using a laptop that has the ability to accept an ethernet connection. If you don't you will have to go to one of the common areas to use the free wifi. Most hotels in europe do not provide free internet, so the Princess gets major points for this. When we arrived to our room we were greeted by a bottle of Champagne with a small assortment of deserts. The breakfast at the hotel is pretty good, and the staff was very friendly. The tourist site seeing buses stop right outside the hotel, and if you would prefer to catch a cab they are posted up outside of the hotel. If you skateboard, inline skate or like to run the hotel is located near the beach and there is miles of smooth pavement to utilize. Some bad points: The elevator is a bit of a pain because there are so many people that need to use it. The pools are really small and I almost felt rude to get in and swim because the people sun tanning around the pool acted like they were to good to have a little water splashed on them. The hotel did not have any irons in the room or for use anywhere else. The rooms did not have face cloths. The dinner selection is limited, but if you walk across the street you can dine in the Hilton's restaurant !!!

Indeed, it is modern compared to the 16th century buildings in Las Ramblas but it had a weird 70s dated feel with a lot of wood paneling. That being said, our room had a neat glass wall separating the bedroom from the bathroom (which my husband promptly closed citing his need for privacy) and our view included the roof of a history museum and water in the distance. For us, the \"king\" bed was the deal breaker. It was really two beds somehow taped together and during the night the beds would split in two if either of us rolled the wrong way. It was uncomfortable and inconvenient. Despite our dissatisfaction with the room, the staff were pleasant and went out of their way to be accommodating. Word of caution: in order to get anywhere you have to take the nearby metro or a taxi. My husband and I were coming out of a metro when a guy \"pretended\" to drop his keys. I was slightly ahead of my husband so I was able to see the entire incident. He bent down to grab his keys and pushed my husband backwards. His affect was so odd that I told my husband to check his wallet (which was in his back pocket). Sure enough, it was gone! The guy had been working with another guy who stole my husband's wallet while he was being distracted by the first guy. I cried out and started after the guy. Everyone stopped and AMAZINGLY the second guy gave the wallet back (and all of my husband's credit cards were still there). I suspect that he flipped the wallet open and saw that it contained no cash and decided to give it back instead of cause a scene.

One woman told us how to get to the airport (after a grilling from me asking specific questions) but she omitted to tell us important facts like changing from the underground to the overground requires a 15 minute walk and you have to re-stamp your card. The only information I could squeeze out of her was specifically what I asked for (\"how do I get to the airport using the train did not cut it - I then had to specify \"which train, how much, how often etc etc) and this was not the only instance. They are very slow, carry on with personal conversations and do not seem bothered about you.

The pool is on the 23rd floor overlooking the sea and amazing views to the city. The pool was a delight and heated so perfect after a day out walking about the town. The hotel also has a gym and sauna and another pool on the lower floor - very immpressive. The subway is only a few mins walk and takes you into the centre in about 10mins. We ate out most nights at the shopping centre which sounds crazy but the restaurants are amazing you can sit out in a lovely court or eat in. From chinese to spanish they have everything to choose from. The beach is only a ten min walk away and is really worth it with a lovely promenade, clean and trendy is what comes to mind. You can walk a further 30 mins to the marina where there is plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from.

Last year, I had the trip from hell. Lost luggage, scandalous taxi rides, hiking with luggage through about 5 m through the BCN ghetto in the middle of the night, landlords who were 2 hours late letting us into our first apartment - you name it, if it was bad, it probably happened to us. After getting really sick of the lack of response from our landlords at the apartment we rented, I rented this place on the last day of our trip, sight unseen. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised. The establishment was much more than we expected. Albeit, being from Detroit my standards aren't sky high. I don't expect to get something for nothing, but I do expect a level of cleanliness, cordiality, functionality. When we arrived, we were greeted by a smiling clerk and bellhop, who kindly arranged taxi service to the airport for us the next day. The taxi was on time (which is impressive since almost everyone in Barcelona uses desai time)! After we made it to our room and tooled around with the gadgets like automatic shades, 0 depth shower, etc., we went to the mall attached to the hotel to get some souvenir stuff for friends and family. The the mall isn't usually my favorite place to go while I'm on holiday, but I can see how this would be very convenient for a traveler whose luggage has been routinely mishandled by BCN. The beds were comfortable, but I didn't get any sleep due to the stress load accumulation from the other parts of the trip. The pool is very nice, but a little small. I absolutely love that the sun deck faces the ocean. The room service is impeccable! The only downside is that this is on the northeast end of Barcelona, by the olympic port, so it is out of the way and cab rides are pricey -- like $60 USD for the airport. However, it is a nice change to be an outlier when relaxation is a priority because \"downtown\" (Ramblas, Barri Gotico, Barceloneta, Eixample, Placa Catalunya) is very, very loud. We are staying here again on our vacation in 3 weeks, and I can't wait. We are also staying a few days at the Hotel Silken Diagonal and the Hesperia Tower for the night before our departure.

This hotel was stunning, the staff were helpful and efficient, and it was a pleasure to stay there. Mum and I requested a city view which was amazing. It was deceptive though as the sights look a lot closer than they actually are! The metro is clean and efficient (london could learn a lot!) and is also accessable for those less able as there are lifts at every station and no step into the trains. The trams are good but i wouldnt want to go to some areas after dark as they looked a bit rough. These were well away from the main city though. If you are travelling independantly it is worth investing in a day ticket as this covers bus, tram, metro and train out to the airport too. If it is your first visit to Barcelona i would recommend the tour bus which you can join from outside the hotel. It has 3 route covering most of the important sights. Stopping at the MNAC building is a must as is a visit to the Olympic Stadium. The la Sagrada Familia is also a must. Although it can feel crowded with tour groups, the architecture is amazing. There is also a museum underneath that is worth a visit too. Although the food in the hotel may seem a bit expensive, i can recommend the salmon sandwiches from the corner bar! They are well worth the money. Breakfast is on a buffet style and is always well stocked no matter what time you arrive down. The swimming pool on the 3rd floor is really only suitable for lounging in. The one on the 23rd floor is much better although you can spend so much time looking at the view out to sea you may not actually get any swimming done!!!

The next morning I enjoyed a swim in the heated pool (at the right temperature which is not always the case in wintertime). If you're looking for great value for money, this is the place to go to!

I took one look at the 'jaccuzi' and walked away very upset... its a tiny pool with luke warm water, outside on a balcony in the wind.. the 2 swimming pools also had luke warm water and were quite small. I did change my mind about them however, and did later go back to take a dip in the pool. they are ok, but do not make this the deciding factor 4 ure holiday. Sauna was very nice, but small also. Anyway, staff were very friendly, and helful and spoke english.. room was nice and clean, but not as spectaculat as I thought it would have been.. a simple double bed, clean sheets and a nice city view (24th floor)... electrical window blinds and curtains which were quite cool.....shower was amazing though, with very powerful hot water, and massage effects.. the room was clean with a lcd samsung tv ( i brought my HDMI cable just incase and this worked fine so could cnnect my laptop and watch my films on the tv) free mimibar and safe, with a bottle of beer, coke, water and lemon juice for free in the minibar... everything in the room was fine, except the toilet started to smell the 2nd day of sewege.. not nice, but could only smell it inthe toilet..I tried to connect my internet via wireless, but no signal, so simply called reception and they asked me to come down and get the internet cable, and this worked straight away no problem- and was free... Breakfast buffet was $19.99 pp very extorinate, considering i didnt eat too much of it.. a variety of juices, runny scramblled egg, very nice potent saussages, pizza typed things, yougart, fresh fruit, yougart, bacon/ham slices, fresh bread... that was the most of it.. it may have suited the tastes of others, but not my self, and it is probably best to eat somewhere else and to get more for you \u00a3 also , definetly.... The hotel is not far away from the city (Cantaluyna* / las Ramblas at all).. its about 6 stops, and then one change for one more stop and ur there.. takes about 20/25 mins on the metro, and the metro stop is right accross the road from the hotel which is fab - about 30 seconds walk..so nice if you dont want to stay in the city, but i would definetly prefer to next time. especially as there nothing close to the hotel at all, just a few tiny cafes.. there is a mall right next door though, with Zara and primark etc in there.. but i dont figure you would go in there as it is not a 'spanisy tourist place' more like a standard London / americian shopping mall. The tram also stops right outside, and the beach is supposed to be nearby but we didnt go as we didnt really have time, and it was a bit windy.. We got to the hotel from Barcelona airport by getting a transfer bus from terminal 1 to terminal 2 where we could get a train , which would then take us to a metror stopp, and we then got the metro to the hotel station stop.. station workers will tell you what stops etc to get off at etc, and definetly most of them spoke good english so it was simple to get around.. that journey to the hotel took about 2 hrs almost!! very long.. but on the way back we decided to take the Aero * bus which leaves La Ramblas and goes strait to terminal 1 for only $5.05 very quick, taking about 25-30 mins.. definetly should have done that on the way there - simply then taking the metro form la ramblas to / from the hotel. Over all, hotel was fine, but more like 3* to me, clean and a very nice building though.

They kindly accommodated my request for a room on high floor with sea views. The building is split into 2 towers, one with 26 floors, the other with 23 floors and a rooftop pool. Some rooms face suburbs, some old Barcelona, some the sea. Only three glass elevators serve all those rooms, so give yourself an extra 5 minutes to check out. The hotel is about 6 metro stops away from the center, (for example, Las Ramblas or the 13th century gothic cathedral). I would have preferred to stay in the Gothic Quarter to skip the Metro altogether, but this hotel is only one block away from bus stops and the yellow Metro Line 4 @ Forum stop. There are a few suburban restaurants and bars directly across the street, if you'd rather pay one euro for your coffee instead of 3 at the hotel lobby/ bar. Hotel is next to a shopping mall. Also directly in front of the hotel is the Tram which you can board with your Metro card. I stayed on the 24th floor, and was very pleased with the relaxing sea view. Window practically runs floor to ceiling, but you cannot open the window. We called the front desk to get it opened a crack, but they shut it the next day. The window shades were run down, but the bed was the most comfortable I experienced during my two weeks in Spain. I had to be vigilant that my door to the hall shut properly. We couldn't get the t.v. to work but didn't really care. My companion was quite irritated that we could not get the Wi-Fi to work anywhere - yes we did complain twice to no avail. There are two computers behind the front desk, on the second floor of the lobby, and they're often occupied. The shower stall has a fancy shower head that blasts so much water I nearly flooded the bathroom. Of course if the water had drained more quickly there wouldn't have been a flood... There was only one towel / bathrobe hook. No bath tub. They supplied most toiletries, but you'll have to bring your own hair conditioner and wash cloth. There's a mirror near the sink, and the closet door is a full length mirror. There is a small desk and one chair near the window. There are about half a dozen light switches. Two switches to control window blind and shade, and one to control the bathroom shade that covers the glass wall separating the bath area from the bedroom. There is a wonderful free mini bar with Cokes, waters, one juice and an Estrella beer bottle, refilled daily; such a treat. Bottle opener included. The staff at the front desk was always quick to approach when we walked up to it. We were able to check in half an hour early, get transportation info, a map, and get a loaner plug adapter easily. I did not try the gym.

Overall I would rate that stay as solid 4 (on a 1-5 scale with 5 being the best) - the staff is friendly, nicely decorated/designed rooms are clean, spacious enough, breakfast was very good - lots of choices and fresh stuff but there are a couple of things that caught me by surprise (at least I wouldn't have expected them from such relatively expensive place): 1) there are no irons in the hotel WHATSOEVER! So imagine yourself arriving in the afternoon and trying to get ready for business meetings tomorrow. Now you can forget about searching the room for hidden places where iron with ironing board are stored or calling to front desk to get those gears to you. The only choice is to get express laundry service (to get a couple of shirts pressed) which will cost you 50% over already expensive service (e.g. next day service to press shirts was ca.7 EUR a piece). So the advice is - either get ready for huge laundry bill or have your portable iron with you when you come to Barcelona :). 2) Don't expect that if you request something at the front desk over the phone, you'll get that immediately. It took me about 3 call to front desk and 6 hours for handyman to show up and unlock the safe box which was locked when I checked in. I frankly hope that this just the case with that particular hotel shift in that particular hotel on that particular day, but just in case, have your level of expectations set properly and be prepared to follow up. 3) The number of elevators is not enough to service all guests of that multi-store building - whenever you call the elevator, it can take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes until car arrives. So slow down your pace there as well and account for 5-7 minutes just to get to the lobby from your room.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "Dijon39", "ReviewID": "UR84518589", "Content": "Stayed there in June, great place the rooms are just amazing great towels .

If all you want is an HONEST review (bear in mind that I am a little fussy & do not like dirt/bad locations/bad service etc) - here it is: Went with my boyfriend for 6 nights for a little getaway. On arrival the hotel was in a great location, right next to a big shopping centre & metro & bus literally over the road. Staff were professional & check-in was efficient, answered all our questions. The room was brilliant with a quirky design & electric blinds etc, quite a dark finish but fine because of the huge window that lets in so much light. Please note that the shower is a little crazy & some water does seep through the bottom of the door, but it's actually really fun!The bathroom is visible from the bedroom through a glass divide but the toilet and shower each have a door & you can lower a blackout blind so no one can see (if you're prudish). The view from the lifts of the hotel are actually breath-taking, you can see the Sagrada Familia & Mount Tibidabo etc! The free minibar is also a great added extra, who cares if there is not much selection - it's free!!! Some tips - take advantage of the shopping centre next door (sometimes we actually went to the supermarket in there to bag a very cheap baguette for lunch - 1Euro 60cents each). Buy a T-10 travelcard from the metro which you can use on bus/train/tram/metro throughout zone 1 (which is all you really need). The metro is so quick into the city centre and is not jam packed like the Underground!!! Also if you choose to go on a Tour bus, check out the Red unofficial ones which have a 'green route' which actually stops right near the Princess hotel, it's about 30 Euros for a 2-day ticket which is hop on, hop off as many times as you like when the bus is running. Don't bother getting a taxi from the airport, get the aerobus (5Euro each) and then get the metro from Passeig de Gracia to El Maresme Forum (right near the hotel) with your T-10 ticket. My ONLY criticism is probably the pools, the one on the 3rd floor is overcast by the building and did not look that well maintained as did th jacuzzi (I didn't swim in either) and the pool up on the 23rd? floor is very pretty but very very small so get out there early if you want a sunbed. However I did not go to Barcelona to sunbathe or swim, there's SO much more to do, and there's always the beach if you want to lie down all day!

We tend to be pretty easy to please but were initially disappointed by the first hotel because of it's location and lack of out door pool. We were glad we weren't staying there the whole time and were looking forward to getting to the next one....now we wish we had stayed there! The location of The Hotel Princess was good, we were close to the nice beaches, shops and metro. There were lots of nice restaurants and bars about half an hour walk along the beach or a short ride on the Metro which is easy to use and pretty much right outside the hotel. The first hotel had been more within the city centre apparently, but the surroundings weren't very nice to look at. When reaching Hotel Princess the check in was fine, very efficient. We were on floor 11 which is not what had originally been quoted to us on our booking (we should have had 20th floor), when questioning this we were told the hotel was fully booked. The room itself was fine but lacked a personal touch. It was quite small and pokey, very dark and the window wouldn't open. We were told the window had to remain locked for security reasons i.e so no one fell out or got in and robbed the place. We thought this was a bit ridiculous...yes the hotel is obviously very high but I have been to loads of high hotels that have balconies, or at least windows you can open a few inches!! We liked the free mini bar however you don't get much (which to be honest we expected with it being free) and also everything is obviously put in there cold, but warms up through the day as it the fridge itself isn't cold! They put some ice in there but by the time the evening came and we came to use is it, it was dirty water. There were no nice touches like tea and coffee making facilities or an iron and ironing board, or bath robes, which you tend to expect in most decent hotels. We had all of these at the first hotel which was the same price....I don't think it's much to ask when you've paid this amount of money! The main disappointment was the non existent spa area. Our first hotel, to it's credit had a lovely spa, really relaxing. The hotel Princess had two very, very small cold pools. We knew they were going to be small from the photos, but the photos actually make them look bigger than they are, in reality they are tiny. There are only about 5 sunbeds, however the view is nice from the one on the 23rd floor.... The jacuzzi was nothing more than a hot tub shoved in the corner and it was disgusting, so dirty. We were really disappointed by this as we came for a relaxing break. Over all I wouldn't recommend this hotel as you can probably tell....it is a business hotel at the end of the day and nothing more. It's fine for someone on a business trip who needs a half decent, clean room. From this review I probably sound like moaning old woman, but me and my boyfriend never complain, we are usually happy with a few simple, personal touches.

We were very impressed with the hotel, check-in was efficient and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. We asked to have a room next to each other and they happily obliged. Rooms were nice and clean, the bathroom was modern and spotless, nice touches of free bath goodies, and a free mini bar. The power shower was amazing. However we did not have one in our room so we used the one next door as we booked 2 rooms. Now the negatives, location was not the best, however if you don't mind public transport then staying here won't be a problem. We arrived at the airport and didn't book a transfer to the hotel so just a warning, do not ask how much it is to the destination as we made that mistake and were stung with a 40 euro fare which we stupidly accepted. taxi to hotel should be around 25-30 euro tops. Buffet breakfast was very expensive we paid around 19 euros each which in my opinion overpriced. the cooked food was not good, the egg was like powder egg, just avoid, but it is a must even if you do go once as the views and variety of food was good. There are 2 swimming pools in the hotel, one on the 3rd floor and one on the roof top, both were constantly busy as they were very small, there were not enough sunbeds so we ended up laying towels on the decked floors. Big fluffy towels were provided for use on the beds which was a nice touch. We didn't get a chance to use the rooftop swimming as it was crowded everytime we went to check. Gym area is small but adequate. There was 2 computer for use, but very slow and always occupied. The shopping mall next to the hotel is very convenient, there is a massive supermarket on the ground floor to stock up on drinks etc. There are loads of restaurants and fast food areas so you wouldnt have to go far for something to eat. Overall a very pleasant experience, would definitely recommend this hotel as we enjoyed our trip and would return here if we ever had the chance.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suva, Fiji", "Title": "\u201ca fijian in europe\u201d", "Author": "JasmineA3", "ReviewID": "UR76725106", "Content": "the service and staff were very professional. i was impressed by the views and clean environment...definitely on my wish list of future visits.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northants", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "hmiller99", "ReviewID": "UR76524855", "Content": "We stayed here for a long weekend over the bank holiday period and had a fantastic time.

We were in Room 1812. We had stipulated when making the reservation that we were traveling with our daughter, and thus we expected a cot for the 3rd person. We confirmed our needs at check-in and were assured that they would be met. However to our initial amusement, the hotel provided a crib for our 14 year old. Amusement turned to frustration when the hotel manager indicated that there was not a cot in the hotel, nor a sofa, so she would need to share our bed in our 166 euro room for 3 nights. The manager pleasantly and politely insisted that any European hotel would assume that a \"child\" would fit into a crib, although this is not our experience in many many trips to Europe. The hotel is flashy but poorly built. We were not pleased with the public-washroom type toilet in our room, providing little privacy (since sounds were not muffled and the stall door would not completely shut). The pools are tiny. The food is good and most of the staff are very pleasant. It got worse. The first night, I thought that water was dripping on me in the bathroom, in my hair, on my face and clothes. To my disgust it was sewage from the room above, from the shower in the unit above us. We complained to the desk and they sent someone who opened the ceiling and stuffed white hotel towels into the ceiling space. The second night after midnight, our upstairs neighbor took another shower. Waste water poured into our bathroom again, so loud it woke us. The hotel sent a worker the next morning who spent a lot of time in our unit and the one above. Unfortunately he left the towels from the ceiling, soiled with dark brown debris, on our bathroom floor, and I had to push them aside to take a shower myself before my meeting. I did not feel clean! The staff did clean the bathroom thoroughly later. The third night - AGAIN the water pouring and dripping through the ceiling awakened us. Unfortunately there was also a large loud live concert in the nearby Forum after midnight until about 4AM, and these rooms have poor sound insulation, so we got little sleep. At checkout the next morning I lodged my 7th complaint with the front desk, but got little sympathy.

The Hotel is lovely. Clean and modern and so close to the metro station and shops. We had the bed and breakfast option, which I reccommend booking, as I can remember the price of the breakfast was very expensive (people were coming then turning away due to it). The room I can safely say was the best hotel room I have ever stayed in to date. It was so modern, and the full body jet shower is very impressive! There is even electric blinds, operated by a button at the side of the bed, so you don't even have to move to open them in the morning! :) And the room had a free mini bar, stocked up daily which was an added bonus! The metro is easy to follow (easier than the London Underground even), so it doesn't matter that this hotel is just out of the main parts of the city as the sights are not hard to get to. I am a bit afraid of heights, if you are, make sure you keep your back to the back of the lift as I did (it is just glass!) The pools are pretty small, but on a city break, thats not really what we were there to do so it didn't matter to us. The 'spa' is not much of one, and we had to have someone come and put more water in the sauna, as the facillities there are pretty much left unattended, and also on the downside the jacuzzi was a very odd colour, and not warm at all!

My room on the 17th floor had a city view which I requested following the reviews on Trip Advisor, and it was fab, I could see right out across Barcelona and La Sagrada Familia. The breakfast was good & varied plenty of fresh fruit though I don't know the cost. The gym was small but adequate and always empty and their two pools were very nice.I liked the free mini bar, which was re-stocked every day and thought the shower was fab. I did have to order room service one night and this was pretty basic and expensive, I had a very lame ceasar salad for EUR17, so do not recommend this unless its the last resort.

When we arrived at the hotel, the staff were friendly welcoming us during checkin, but we didn't get any information at all. We'd booked a junior suite for our stay with a kingsize bed. When we got to the room, the total size of the room was good, but half the suite turned out to be a room we coudn't really use (just one bad coutch), so it was more like a normal sized hotelroom. The bed wasn't nearly as big as a kingsize bed, and neither the AC nor the fridge for the minibar worked at arrival (but both were repaired quite fast).. The TV in the room was very small, and they only had 3-4 channels that weren't spanich. We also had to ask for connection to the high-speed Internet, which were only available with a very short cable. The view was nice, but the room was very dark (unlike the other rooms), with black walls and ceiling - very different from what the pictures indicate. We were supposed to have 25 minutes of free massage for one person pr day with our room, but no information were given about this, and we had to argue with the hotel management the second day to get it - we only got two days with massage out of 4... The minibar was also rather lousy - they announce a free minibar, but all you get pr day is 1 beer, 1 CocaCola (200ml), 1 still water and 1 sparkling water (both also very small).. The breakfast were OK, but extremly boring with the same, small selection every day. The hotel restaurant where lousy, and the food was not of high quality.... The two swimmingpools at the hotel were OK, but small.. The cleanliness were good, but the last day we only got one bathrobe and one towel.... Also the hotel employees kept coming into our room several times pr day, wich were rather annoying. The location of the hotel was not to bad thoug, lying on top of a nice, rather modern mall, we had axcess to food and shopping within a short distance.

I have just returned from Barcelona on the 24th after spending three nites in the Princess with my 3 sisters and can confirm that this is a beautiful hotel with lovely contemporary spotless rooms with all mod cons. The only small comment I could make is they need a mirror near an electric socket for us girls! The staff are extremely helpful & friendly & do an excellent job in this hotel with regards to customer service. The breakfast room was really lovely and the selection & presentation of food was a pleasure to come down to in the morning. The location of this hotel maybe an issue if this was your first time to Barcelona as you are out from the main tourist attractions but the metro station is in front of the hotel behind the red brick building and a 10 journey pass on costs you 8 euros and takes you to Passieg de Gracia for shopping, Las Ramblas for the experience & the Barceloneta for the port, marina & beaches. (L4 line) Although the hotel states that it is near the beaches at the moment there are ground works in progress so to acess the beach it is a good ten minute walk from the hotel. We all had a massage whilst we werethere and the bath robes & slippers provided were really useful for this. There are two pools the one on the 3rd floor is lovely but was in the shade most of the time whilst we were there. The one on the 23rd floor is small and made for swimming lenghts but it is in the sun most of the day. The bar makes fantastic cocktails & they are no dearer than anywhere else & a lovely way to end the evening. Beside the hotel is a really good shoppin centre with lots of shops to choose from. The food court is on the top floor but there are also restaurants on the roof of the building which can be accessed from inside the shoppin centre or via steps from the outside Top tips: At the Barceloneta try Zahara, a great little bar that serves lovely simple food at a great price with a great view and friendly staff. On Las Ramblas (facing the entrance to the food market) is a little bar that serves 3 tapas & a glass of sangaria at the bar for 4.90 euros. This is a real spanish experience with happy staff that wont break the bank. All & all we really enjoyed our stay at the Princess & I would book it again.

The rooms have a design set up in where you basically enter and have the bathroom just where the hallway is and it's connected with the living room. I did personally not really appreciate this design as I would feel a distinction in between the living room and bathroom has its advantages, especially for reasons of privacy. I found the quality of the room good and the design as mentioned very modern and the room was spotlessly clean but what disturbed me was an awkward \u201cbody\u201d odor in the room from previous guests that had stayed and left the smell behind I guess and I am sensitive to this. I have to call out that the whole experience of the room was negatively impacted by the uncomfortable odor. The hotel should start using odor neutralizers while cleaning for sure, it makes such a difference. The breakfast was very nice and basically offered all you could wish for and a lovely selection of the tasty Spanish sausages and ham, really something to look forward to every morning. The staff at the hotel (front Desk, Room Service and the Restaurant staff) were very, very professional and super friendly. This is for sure a plus! I loved the location in the area of the convention centers and just a few subway stops away from downtown. There is a huge shopping center just nearby with lots of dining and shopping options. I ordered room service one night and was a bit surprised I did not get any salt or pepper to accompany my meal, a little detail yet important I think. One thing that is just crazy and we all talked about this is they don\u2019t offer iron and ironing boards for the guests to use. This I have never come across before and was negatively surprised by this. I had two shirts I had packed that needed to be ironed and the only way to do this was to pay them 8 Euros per shirt and wait for one day. Also, the hotel has a free minibar with some water, coke and a bear and that is very generous however they don\u2019t offer coffee or tea facilitates and I have not in the last 15 years stayed at a 4 star hotel that did not offer this. That was surprising. The bathroom amenities were very nice and from the American company H2o+ that also caters to the Walt Disney team park hotels. So to summarize: Stay here if you like modern hotels with a good location although not downtown and with great and friendly staff, superb breakfasts and if you don\u2019t bring clothes that need iron and don\u2019t mind a slight odor in the hotel rooms :-)", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, but far from city center for tourism\u201d", "Author": "Chaymaa", "ReviewID": "UR63775609", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel because we organized a conference just in the front building where the big conference center is.

I travelled by train and metro from the airport with had no problems at all and the whole trip taking about an hour. Check in was very quick and after reading reviews on the great views surrounding the hotel I had requested a room on the highest floor possible and was given a room on the top floor (26th floor). Luckily it was a room on the corner overlooking the pool on the 23rd floor so I had a view of both the sea and the city which was impressive enough during the day but at night was amazing! We were lucky enough to be there while a month long festival was taking place just across the road so at night we were treated to all the lights from the biggest mobile fair I have ever seen. The fair went on until the early hours of the morning each night but with the window closed you could not hear it and could get a great sleep on the very large and comfortable beds. The rooms were quite spacious and with the blind lifted on the all glass bathroom it definately made the room feel even bigger. The shower was very nice with 3 different spray settings, although every now and then the temperature could be a little unstable but nothing too alarming. The room has cable tv and I was very pleased to have some english speaking channels which were not just news channels (BBC1, Channel 4 and E4). The rooms also come with free Wi-Fi Internet access, but if you do not have your laptop there are two computers on the first floor where you can use the internet and printer for free. The hotel has two pools, one on the 3rd floor and one on the 23rd floor. The 3rd floor pool is the larger of the two but is quite shallow at only 0.85M deep and because the hotel towers above it after about 2.30-3pm it is covered in shade making it quite cold. The pool area on the 23rd floor is great with amazing views while you soak up the sun. Both pool areas were kept very clean and were always stocked with clean towels. There were about 5-6 sun beds in each area and with the hotel being quite quiet we never had a problem getting a seat however with 300+ rooms I could imagine it being pretty busy when the hotel is full. I read in some reviews that the location of the Barcelona Princess was quite isolated, and this is not totally incorrect. However I found the metro ride into town quite a nice experience, and the metro line which is just across the road from the hotel (Line 4) connects to a lot of the main areas of Barcelona such as La Ramblas and the Marina without any changes. One thing to note when travelling on the metro around Barcelona is that if you are changing from one line to another you can expect an epic walk so you should try and keep any line changes to a minimum. Overall I had a great time at the Princess hotel and it really made my first trip to Barcelona very special.

The location was good, 2 minutes walk from the metro linking straight to the center, taxis available and very close to the beach. There is a shopping area right next to the hotel with everything ranging from food, entertainment and many shops which was handy if you do not want to eat in the hotel. To conclude for the price i would definately not recommend, it is an average hotel charging too much for what it is worth, however if you are not interested in the pool or other extras then the hotel should be quite nice.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall, UK", "Title": "\u201cStandard business hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sully001", "ReviewID": "UR62495266", "Content": "Nice hotel, fantastic helpful staff. Was very pleased with my stay here, but it was for a business conference. Hotel facilities are great, swimming pools, basic gym, sauna, bars...etc. Great view from swimming pool at top. Great shower in bedrooms. Well equiped rooms. If you are asked, ask for a room with a city view (not beach!). Was lucky enough to be on 17th floor with city view and could see whole city (and the sites). Beach view is building sites! Air-con was broken in room, but that was just unlucky (i just opened the window instead!) There is no beach near-by. It is all under development, so go else-where if you want the beach. Not much in this area (couple of cafe's near-by). Metro/undergound is 5mins walk and will take you straight into centre (2euro's single). There are several hotels round this area and if you had to choose one for its location for conferences (e.g CCIB) this is definately the best. If you are on a city-break, would strongly recommend getting a hotel in centre. Metro is convenient but does take 30mins or so getting in and back from centre and stops at 1am. Plus no bars near the hotel. Overall: Great hotels with facilities. Great choice for business.

Brill! We caught the aerobus from the airport to Plaza Catalunya (8.65 euros each, return), & then the local no.41 bus (1.40 euros each) which stops a few paces from the hotel. Stay on the local bus until the end of the route. From departing the aircraft to entering the hotel was one & a half hours. Check in was efficient & views to take our breath away as we whizzed up the outside of the building in one of the 3 glass lifts. We had corner junior suites on the 'Wellness' promotion on 20th & 22nd floors. The views were amazing be it daytime or night time. The suites were spacious with a sitting room with sofa & easy chair & clear perspex occasional table. The bedroom was spacious with floor to ceiling windows, double bed, bedside units, table & chair & built in tv unit . The mini fridge was very useful & free mini bar fantastic. Every day we had complimentary bottles(1 of each) of still water, sparkling water, lemonade, coca-cola & beer. The balcony was wonderful to admire the views over the sea or back towards Barcelona itself. We could have sat there all day. The bathroom was very clean & again very spacious. I like a magnifying mirror on a bracket from the wall but there wasn't one - minor detail. The breakfasts were excellent with a great choice every day & empty dishes & tables very promptly cleared. The waiting staff at breakfast worked quietly & very efficiently & were always very pleasant. They removed used crockery & cutlery on a trolley with a cloth placed over it, as it should be done. Thank you. Our promotion included a massage for each room. We had interpreted this as one massage per room per stay but in fact, it was one massage per room per DAY, & excellent 50 minute masssages they were too. We all really enjoyed the saunas & jacuzzi too. It was so hot for a couple of days of our stay, that we were able to enjoy the pool on 23rd floor & admire the views at the same time. We didn't use the pool on 3rd floor but we could have done. The 2 free computers on the mezzanine level were really useful to check emails & check in for our return flights & there was a printer to print out our boarding passes. Really liked the funky lips red sofa! We ate in the hotel restaurant one evening & it was a lovely meal. We enjoyed the attentions of a New Zealand waiter (can't remember his name, sorry) who was very efficient, friendly & courteous. He made our evening an evening to remember for all the right reasons. When he learnt that we were celebrating our anniversary he produced a bottle of Cava & 4 glasses. Thank you so much for making our evening even more special than it already was. We ate a late lunch one day in the bar & it was very good, again with good service & pleasant staff. If you are there at a weekend or holiday do visit Tibidabo because the views are spectacular. Also the Magic Fountains (free) but check what evenings & the time as it depends on the winter or summer schedule. We used the buses & metro with no problems & always very efficient. Buy a pass that suites you as it certainly saves money.

On arrival we were greeted warmly by the Reception staff who gave us the option of a room overlooking the sea or the city. We took the advice of the Receptionist and opted for the city view and were allocated a room on the 17th floor which was wonderful. We could lie in bed at night with the whole of Barcelona lay twinkling before us. Three glass lifts on the exterior wall of the hotel give great views as you ascend to your room. Our room was clean, comfortable and of a modern design; lots of glass, orange and black colour scheme. A window seat with desk/table unit gave us the opportunity to look out and admire the city landscape. The bed was large and comfortable. Storage was a little limited with wardrobe space and 3 drawers. The separate toilet and shower area was well laid out and the shower was a powerful one with range of jets etc. Toiletries, bathrobes and slippers were provided and there was a free safe available. The TV picked up BBC 1 as well as a few other English speaking channels . The free mini bar allowed us one beer, one coke, one bitter lemon and one water each day. We were a little disappointed by the breakfasts. There was quite a range of foods on offer but sometimes staff were slow to replenish various items so you took what was there at the time. We loved the orange juice - not the usual bland hotel quality. Dining room staff were helpful and attentive. The internet area was free to use which was great although the Salvador Dali design with the plastic lip sofas was exactly that...design NOT comfort! We didn't use the hotel bar but sat in reception which is next to the bar: it is very retro, very 70s style orange with the furniture showing some wear and tear; perhaps in need of some refurbishment. There is a porter on duty at the entrance to the hotel but he was more like a 'bouncer' than a doorman. He didn't meet and greet in a friendly way but just looked menacingly! The location of the hotel is quite a way out of the city centre but we did walk it a couple of times as the weather was sunny. The walk took about an hour and allowed us the opportunity to see the five or six beaches leading into Barcelona. There was a lot of construction work happening on the beach closest to the Barcelona Princess but an accessible and suitable bathing beach area was within a 10 minute walk. Metro station,tram and bus stop were all close by and the Bus Turistica (hop on/hop off) stops immediately outside the hotel. We used the swimming pool and spa one afternoon as the weather was good. My husband loved the sauna and although the pool is very small, it did allow us the opportunity to lie out on a sunbed and soak up the rays. The Diagonal Mar shopping mall is adjacent to the hotel with a good range of shops, food court, restaurant terrace, large Alcampo supermarket and cinema complex.

We got a good deal on last minute for rooms and breakfast and stayed there for 5 nights. Positives: A smart, clean hotel. Rooms are comfortable and clean, the buffet breakfast is excellent. The hotel was pretty full but food was replenished quickly and regularly so even if you turned up 15 minutes before closing you could still have your pick of fresh fruit/cooked breakfast etc. There were plenty of staff working and I must say I haven't witnessed an as efficient \"buffet\" operation anywhere else. Big plus. There is a subway station around 7 minutes walk from the hotel and a shopping mall down the road if you need to buy anything you may have forgotten, plus Starbucks. We quite enjoyed the area as it was a quiet place to come back to in the evening. The open top bus stops just outside the hotel (we didn't take this as this was a return trip.) Negatives: A bit far out from the town centre and the airport so we had to take a long subway ride everywhere. For anyone not familiar, Barcelona's tube stations go on and on underground so what looks like a short stop or one stop on a map may mean walking for 15 minutes underground, up and down stairs to change train etc. Room service selection wasn't great, but we didn't need to use it. This may be a point for Barcelona in general but someone tried to mug us on 2 occassions. Once on the subway escalator a man had his hand in my mum's shoulder-bag and we caught him. The second time 2 men posing as police accused us (2 elderly people and a heavily pregnant woman) of purchasing drugs and insisted we handed over all of our cash. I was surprised as Ive travelled all over the world on business and for leisure and haven't been in a situation where someone is quite obviously trying to rob me. Just a warning to be very vigilant.

This meant that we had views out over the ocean and also down the promenade. We also had a balcony. The bed was superkingsize. The bathroom was in a wetroom style. No bath, just one of those multi-head showers that \"pebble-dashed\" you. The bathroom was mostly windows and no wall but there were pull-down blinds in case you were worried about your modesty. The week we arrived the temperature went up from 12 degrees to 28. However, the air con in the hotel wasn't set to come on until later in the year. Although, the staff were really good and they complied with our request that the windows be left open every day...this meant it was nice & cool when we came back in the evening. TV was much better than we expected. We had a fair smattering of the freeview channels from UK including C4, ITV, BBC1 and E4. The breakfast was superb... the fresh fruit and home-baked (or should that be hotel-baked) breads were among the best I've tasted anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere. We got the train from the airport & changed to Metro to get to the hotel. DON'T DO THIS. It's much easier to get the bus from the airport to Place de Catalunia, then get the 41 bus. When we were there, we got the 41 bus outside the Hard Rock Cafe. But double check this when you go, just incase they change the bus routes. The bus lets you off 10 steps from the Hotel entrance. There is a large shopping centre next to the hotel and the usual mall type eateries on the top floor. The Ramblas... what a tourist trap! Overpriced and over-rated. The only thing worth going down The Ramblas for was the fantastic St Joseph's fruit and food market. Please beware in The Ramblas we saw numerous teams of pick-pockets at work.

The bellman spoke very well and helped out a lot with info on the Metro, HO HO bus, etc. Some negatives are that the bathrooms have no towel bars... there aren't enough elevators for the size of the hotel - only two - so you usually have a wait... and the location isn't near any of the sights. We knew about the location when we chose this hotel and wanted to make use of the metro, which worked out well. The hotel is attached to a modern shopping mall. The hop-on - hop-off buses stop across the street and run until November 1st, after that they switch to winter routes which are shorter and don't include the Diagonal Ave. We ordered room service one night & it was quick and good. We ate in the restaurant the last night. We were the only ones there so were a little worried but the food and service was great. We had the front desk arrange for a cab to be waiting for us to take us to the airport after checkout (6:30 am & they were waiting for us at the curb). This is an unusual hotel with all of the glass.

The rooms are very clean with great views and extremely helpful staff. Our original room had an odour coming from the sink, but we were shown a number of rooms to choose from before we moved. Try to get a city view and you can see La Sagrada Familia in the distance. The blackout blinds give you a great nights sleep and the free mini bar is a nice touch, a beer, lemonade, water and Coca Cola each day. Some of the showers do flood, but put some towels down! Avoid eating on the Ramblas you WILL be ripped off, if on the Ramblas go to Carrer Del Carme, it is a street off the Ramblas and then go into 'Fresco' salad, pizza, pasta, drink, desert and coffee for less than 10 euro, you can eat as much as you like, and they let you go back for more. McDonald etc are all more expensive on the Ramblas. Be careful of open bags, someone tried to get into ours once, they seem to see it as sport! The AA Key guide is a great book to use, and get a Barcelona card to get discounts into museums, free travel and a lovely free boat trip!

Superb shower, which took a bit of fiddling with to work out but has now made me want one of these at home! The rest of the hotel was just as sumptous. The views from the lifts and the top of the hotel are unrivalled. The pool, hot tub and sauna on the 3rd floor were lovely, with plenty of big clean towels to use. Surprisingly, they were never too busy either. the best part of the hotel though had to be the 23rd floor pool. The pictures you see on this website and others really don't do it justice.

Breakfast was included with my room and it was terrific. They served breads and pastries, cold cereals with milk, fruit, cheeses, breakfast meats, grilled vegetables, eggs, yogurt, coffee and assorted juices. For lunch and dinner, a quick food option is the large food court on the 3rd floor of the Diagonal Mar shopping mall next door to the hotel. There were many choices of interesting restaurants for asian food, pasta, tapas, sandwiches, as well as the usual Burger King, Subway, Ben and Jerry's, etc. There was also the Al Campo grocery store located within the mall for other food items. Although some previous reviewers mentioned signs posted about not bringing food back into the hotel, I didn't see any signs during my stay. Maybe the management has relaxed the policy. The room was a nice size, with room-darkening shades, as well as a shade to cover the bathroom area for those who mentioned the see-through glass partition. I was traveling alone, so it was not a concern for me. The free mini-bar had Coke, beer, a carbonated lemon drink, and two bottles of water. There was no mention that the mini-bar was free, but thankfully I read the reviews on this website before I traveled. I would tend to agree with the other reviewers that the staff could certainly be more helpful and friendly. There was no mention of breakfast when I arrived, no mention of the free mini-bar, no warnings about pick-pockets in the area (they are rampant). I was OK, but many of my colleagues at the convention were pick-pocketed. I also agree with others that the elevator was slow. A couple of times I took the stairs down from the 4th floor, but the stairway was very dark and had a large table blocking one of the landings. It's clear that the stairway is not meant for everyday use. I was on the 4th floor, but took a trip up the elevator to the 23rd floor for a fantastic view of the city. There is a pool there, as well as on the 3rd floor. For those interested in using the internet, there is wireless available in the lobby and business center on the first floor, but it is extremely slow. There are two desktop computers and a printer in the business center so that you can check in and print your boarding passes for your return flight. The server went down once during my stay, but eventually came back. The Metro stop is close to the hotel and it's a short trip to the downtown areas of interest. You can purchase a 10-trip ticket, which was very useful over a period of several days. The beach is a short walk away from the hotel. All-in-all, I enjoyed my stay there.

Tip: get a T-10 card from the tram stop for cheap travel - ten trips for 7.70 euros which you can share between two or more - just validate the ticket in the machine as many times as you like. You can change stations (tube to tube, tube to tram, etc.) and it will count as one trip, as long as its done within 75mins. Wish London had as efficient a system. Back to the hotel - it was extremely busy when we were there; the hotel has nearly 400 rooms and was pretty full - there was a queue for breakfast (great quality, lots of choice, replenished frequently by friendly, helpful staff), then a queue for the lifts (just three lifts to serve all 26 floors).

Cons (minor): slow elevators, cigarette smoking in neighbor's room made my room smell like smoke, no personal irons anywhere in the hotel (you need to send out/pay for any pressing you want done). The hotel staff was very friendly - checked me in right away when I arrived at about 9:30 a.m. on a Monday, answered my silly American questions (how do I turn on the lights? oh, put your room key in the slot by the door! is there an iron?) and sent someone up immediately when I accidentally blew a circuit in the room at 11 p.m. I was in my boss' room at the Hilton down the street and overall that seemed like a nicer hotel, although the views aren't as nice and my colleagues' rooms mostly had twin beds.

Rooms are lovely with fantastic view and have both blackout and normal blinds as well as blinds for the bathroom area. Shower only leaked if the door was not closed properly so as long as ensured this was done we didnt have a problem. Slippers and dressing gown provided as well as minibar which included water lemonade and beer and was restocked daily. Plenty on offer for breakfast though wouldnt have paid for the breakfast if hadnt been included in the price of the room (\u00a3230 for 3 nights).

Ate in the food court in diagonal mar (the mall next door to the hotel) the first night where there are plenty of different restaurants to chose from and were still busy past 11 on a sunday.

Didnt want to pay this much but though it looked spectacular on the website. We had 22 floor, which was good for distant views but the side of the hotel we were on overlooked an industrial factory with chimneys and several building sites. The area smelt of drains, possibly sewage and even on the roof top pool you could smell this. Quite overpowering when walking outside. The pools were not heated, had some dead flies in them and it was not possible to swim in them due to extreme cold temperature. User the spa 'jacuzzi- which is a 3 person portable hot tub. Sauna was fine, at 80'c. The lifts were such a pain in the morning that one day i took the stairs up 22 flights of stairs instead. My legs went number and i felt sick. I thought my girlfriend was going to wait for lift but when she didnt show i had to go down the stairwell and found her eventually panting and exhausted. As for the room. The shower in our supposedly top of the range suite didn't fit its frame and so didn't close. We had to wedge towels up to close it but there was a huge flood which not only sent waves into the entire bathroom and toilet cubicle area i had to spend the hole morning mopping it out of the adjoining bedroom too with all four towels and both our dressing gowns to make the room safe. This really annoyed me and made me angry that i paid so much for this room. I didn't have time to complain when checking out as we were in a rush to get transport. The breakfast was ok but personally disappointing as no omelettes. On second day there wasn't even croissants. The shopping centre was right next to hotel with many clothes, electrical shops, food serving places. No supermarket though. Cheapest sandwich was about \u00a35 each and average food was \u00a310 each so not cheap really. Hotel had a sign that seemed to appear on second day saying that we'd be fined an extra charge if we buy food elsewhere and bring into the hotel. This was very unreasonable so we ignored it and luckily had no extra charges applied but were subtle and careful. There was no in room Internet connection which was annoying as i took my laptop abroad and never got to use it. I just kept getting message ,limited or no internet connection. Again a poor lack of expected facility. Pool bar could have server warm snacks like fries etc but it did not. This was annoying. Overall I wish i'd stayed somewere cheaper as i could have booked a deal for a third of the price but was prepare to spend more for what i thought would be a real luxurious stay. Also the barcelona bus trip was extremely expensive. It worked out about \u00a340 for two people and the recorded commentary was so dull that we never really knew what it was talking about so gave up on it. I would have expected to pay about \u00a35-6 each but \u00a320 was very steep for a simple bus ride. Barcelona -Girona bus service was good value for an airport transfer.

Check in lady could have been a bit more pleasant but she was ok we were in room 2207 so that meant 22nd floor if you dont like heights this is not the hotel for you! Our room had a seperate sitting room/dressing room and the bedroom had the door out onto the balcony it was a wraparound one so we had a sea view as well as a city view very nice. The bathrrom was very modern glass sink etc but no plug for when my partner was shaving , The bed was comfortable tv and fridge ok dont forget contents of fridge are free so use it and they will re-stock each day only thing i missed was not having tea/coffee in the room but i rang room service 1st morning and they bought up to large pots of black coffee and 2 cups for 6 euros. That first night we walked to the shopping mall next door where there were several places to eat we chose the italian which was just ok nothing to write home about. Breakfast next day was a good choice of cereals,breads,cheese,ham, fruit juices only prob was i found the things that were supposed to be hot not very hot at all, scrambled egg,bacon,sausages etc: but overall as i said very good choice something for everybody. That day we took the tourist bus from right outside the hotel if you want to do all 3 coloured routes then you do need to start early we only managed the green and blue but we did get of at la rambla and walk the whole way down to the marina where we sat and watched some of the luxury boats come and go. That night we caught the metro (come out of the main entrance of the hotel cross straight over the road and tram lines walk past the corner tapas bar then 50yds on your left is entrance to metro) takes 2 mins max buy a T10 ticket one go through then pass back to the other this is allowed we asked. You get to use this 10 times for around 7 euros good value. we got of in town and took the side streets to find somewhere to eat we found an Argentinian steak house my partner had the entrecot steak which was excellent i chose the special meat and realised with all the pictures of horses on the wall this was probably what i was eating bit tough as well but it was a set menu inc bottle of red we paid 45 euros for 2 couses which in this city looked to be quite reasonable. Next day we decided to walk to port olympic my god it was a long way but stopping at the beach bars all the way along for a cold beer did help! on arrival at port olympic we had a bottle of cold white wine for 8 euros again good value. Yes we did walk all the way back and yes my feet were killing me! That night we took the metro this time back to port olympic where we visited the casino which was really good lots of slots and many table games down stairs (dont forget your i.d.) it was a very populer place if you dont gamble just go to see the sights (and just how much money people are prepared to loose) I was lucky on the roulete table starting with 60 euros and coming of with 150 (i know when to quit) we took a cab back to hotel for 10 euros . next day our last day we were able to store our bags at the hotel as we had a late flight back that night . We again took metro and walked round lots of other sites parks etc all very nice. Before we collected our bags from the hotel we ate at that tapas bar opposite the hotel entrance we asked for a selection of tapas we had 2 beers 6 different tapas and 2 coffees for 20 euros and we were stuffeed.

I take the comfort in saying that I am so glad the place was my pick for our trip to Barcelona. Though the place is of 4*, it in fact deserves to be a 5* hotel. The hotel is located in an area where many other major hotels are. This is also the area where conventions and fairs take place as it seems (more like the business area). You should take the train from the BCN airport to Passeig de Gracia (this I believe is every half an hour), then change to metro L4 (Linea 4 / Yellow line) going in La Pau direction and get off at Maresme / Forum estacion to finally get to the hotel. This whole thing takes about an hour. The hotel is not located in what we would really call downtown, however, you can simply take the metro to make it to such major landmarks as La Sagrada Familia, Las Ramblas, Passeig de Gracia and Montjuic. The travel time would be around 15-20 minutes. The metro system in Barcelona is overall well arranged; do not forget to ask for a map of the city and metro system at the hotel reception. Moreover, the hotel is located right by Diagonal Mar, a shopping mall that may be of interest to those who are into shopping. Our room on the 23rd floor, very stylish, clean and well maintained, had an impressive view of the city of Barcelona including the famous La Sagrada Familia. One can also opt for a room looking onto the Mediterranean should they wish. Among the facilities the hotel offers are two outdoor swimming pools (one on the 23rd and the other on the 3rd floor), jacuzzi, sauna and a fitness center (all located on the 3rd floor). I unfortunately did not get to utilize the pools due to the season, on the other hand, the jacuzzi was a great alternative anyhow. We also enjoyed the breakfast which offered a fine array of all breakfast items. Furthermore, you can enjoy the drinks they place in your room everyday for free, this is a very fine gesture all hotels should think of offering to their guests.

The robes, slippers, free mini bar (replenished free of charge every day), toiletries (including toothbrush and toothpaste, comb, nail file etc) were very much appreciated and the included breakfast was second to none (everything you could possibly want...and more). I took advantage of the included free massage (1 per day if you want it - 1 hour for 1 person or 2 half hour sessions for both) which did wonders for my back and my boyfriend tried out the hot tub/jacuzzi and sauna.

All of the above contributed to a very pleasant stay. I would rate this hotel as a very good 4 star if not a 5 star (and it's a very close call).

Although the Princess is further than most hotels from both the airport and the main attractions of Barcelona, it's proximity to a tube station, a major tram route and various bus stops meant that we benefitted from all of the advantages of being away from the hub of the city with very few disadvantages. Also, it is right next to a mall with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants should you not feel up to travelling back to the old city or to the Ramblas for dinner. The staff were courteaous and very helpful; we spent our first night in the hotel bar conversing with staff who were fluent in English and only too happy to tell us a few local secrets.They were also invaluable in helping us find our way around, even getting us a map to mark out places of interest, and the preferred routes to get there, on it. The room was beautiful and, up until then, and since, I am yet to stay in one with such a spectacular view. And we were only on the 14th floor. The shower was an experience in itself with 3 differant shower heads. The hotel was always a cool and refreshing welcome from the unrelenting heat of the day. The pools, although small, were uncrowded. Again, the views from the pool on the 27th floor were astounding. Obviously I am gushing now so I think it is time for the very few negatives: 1) the double bed was 2 singles pushed together and this can be annoying when they begin to move apart. 2) the bathroom is glass and although the cubicles are frosted glass it can still be a bit daunting to use the facilities woth another person in the room. 3) the amazing shower is more suited to someone of normal height. Thsoe alot smaller than average may find alot of powerful water jets heading straight for their face of the back of their head instead of their body. 4) The pool on the 4th floor received very little sun during the day and, owing to the hotel's proximity to the sea, it got a bit chilly, even in August. 5) The hotel had a policy that no food be brought into the hotel which was a bit annoying when you took into consideration just how expensive the hotel restaurant was for food.

Check in was easy and we were upgraded to a junior suite. Our room was a great size with free mini bar which was replenished every day with water, coke, lemonade and a bottle of lager. The room was very clean and we were provided with clean towels, robes and slippers daily. We didn't book for breakfast and it was expensive to add on. However, we found lovely cafes in the centre to have a lazy morning breakfast so didn't miss it. The pool at the top of the hotel is long and very narrow but perfect for a short dip after all that sight seeing. There is also a second pool on the third floor with a lounge and bar area. The hotel is situated a bit out of the city but the hop on hop off bus stops right outside which makes travelling very easy. There is also a metro stop very close by and the trains run quite late, again making it easy to get about. We work in London so are used to the tube system, perhaps others might not want to use this mode of transport late at night, although we felt perfectly safe. It was only a 20 minute journey on the metro so a taxi would be quicker. There are also regular buses if you can figure them out! The hotel is perfect for the beach, just a short walk away. The beach, although man made, is brilliant. A perfect contrast to the busy city. Next door to the hotel is a huge shopping centre with lots of shops, including a large supermarket in the basement. As part of the centre there is a selection of restaurants which are outside and in a pedestrian area. They are great for eating, drinking and watching the world go by. Nice alternative rather than going back into the centre. The food here was better than that in the hugely touristy areas. Every visitor to Barcelona must get on the hop on hop off bus tour - as city tours go, it's the best I've been on. There are 3 routes and you can chop and change as much as you want. They visit all the must see sights of Barcelona and it gives you an opportunity to rest your legs!

The hotel is ideal for people looking for a comfortable stay away from the hussle of the city but close to the beach. The location for the beach in the summer is fantastic, only about a 5 minute walk. And although outside the city center a bus stop right outside the hotel means that this problem is solved within 10 minutes. We booked into the hotel late in the evening and were quickly allocated a room. The room was spacious without being too big. The minibar was well stocked with drinks and the bathroom was very impressive. We also had a balcony which overlooked the main road into the city, i had expected it to be noisey but the car traffic 15 floors below really was not noticable. The hotel features a pool which was my only complaint, the pool on the top floor was reasonably warm when the sun was on it but when the sun went over at about 4pm the pool quickly cooled down and really was a little too cold. Also the top floor pool section has limited seating and we found that all the seats were quickly taken by about 8am. The pool on the 3rd floor was even worse, i only ventured into it once and it was really unbearably cold (this was suprising because the outside temp was 28 - 35 Oc. This meant the pools in the hotel were a bit disappointing. The jacuzzi was pleasent and usually there was space to use it. Only on 2 occasions it was full. The sauna was the best part of the hotel in terms of ease of use, they have 2 seperate saunas and they were always empty meaning a nice relaxing 30 minutes was more or less guarenteed. The food in the hotel was pleasant, not too pricey and had reasonably big portions. The drinks at the bar at the front of the hotel were quite expensive but my god! 8 Euros for a jack daniels and i think he gave me the whole bottle!!

Barcelenta has some good restaurants by the port, particulalry if you like fish. Some quick tips? If your going to use the public transport, purchase a T10 ticket at any of the metro or train terminals. This costs about 7 EUROS and lasts for 10 journeys on any of the public transport options.

We arrived at the hotel about 9.30pm and were literally in our room unpacking by about 9.40pm. The reception staff were efficient and welcoming. 2. Rooms. Yes they are not huge rooms but ample room for a weekend base. They were very modern and extremely clean. The beds were one of the most comfortable beds I have stayed in with plenty of room & the pillows very comfortable. The Shower DID NOT LEAK at all into the main bathroom area. We were on the 22nd floor and had amazing views over Barcelona. The air con worked well and the black-out blinds are ideal for cutting out that early morning sun that wakes you up!! 3. Pools. In fairness we spent most of our time at the beach (a pleasant 10 min walk). We did however sit by the pool on the 23rd floor on our final day. Yes there are limited beds but the decking and pool area are very clean. I would say that the only negative was the breakfast and the cost (we were room only). Most mornings we either went into the shopping centre next door (which by the way is great and has the usual shops Zara and Mango and a lovely supermarket) for a coffee and croissant or went to the cafe opposite the hotel and sat outside for breakfast. Location wise the hotel is great. You are 10 mins from the beach as I mentioned and 5 mins in a taxi to Port Olympic and the Hotel Arts (which by the way is worth a visit for a few cocktails). You are also only 10mins taxi to Las Ramblas.

Room 18 has a balcony but if you have young children, I would not recommend letting them outside on the balcony without an adult. There is a CD player in room 18. Room 17 has a bath with a shower. Room 18 has a shower with jets which, is really nice and relaxing to use but unfortunately, the water leaks out all over the bathroom floor and I don't mean drips, I mean a lot of water so you have to shower really quickly and then use 2 or 3 towels to soak up the water. We had a view of the sea from our rooms. The drinks in the fridge in your room are free. Water, coke, lemonade and cheap beer. On Friday night, my husband and I got woken by really loud music and some guy talking really loud on a microphone. This was around midnight. The music did not stop until 6am. The music was coming from one of the buildings across the road. To put it into perspective, my husband never has any trouble sleeping where ever he goes so for him to be kept awake, well you can imagine! I went to reception the next day and asked the lady behind the desk if the music we had heard on the Friday night was a one off or did it happens every weekend. She looked at me blankly and said that it had not happened before and must have been a special occasion. On Saturday night, the music started to build up from 11,30pm and again did not end until 6am but this time fireworks were also let off. My husband and I could not believe it. Wherever you stay in the hotel, you will not be able to avoid the loud music or the guy talking on the microphone. My husband went to complain the next day. The receptionist advised him that the hotel have complained to the Council regarding the noise but have been told that there is nothing they can do, There were a number of people complaining in the hotel regarding the noise experienced. I am not sure if it is a regular occurrence i.e. if it is a nightclub or it happens every few weeks. On the second night, we even wore ear plugs but could still hear it slightly. The loud bangs from the fireworks woke my son up and not even the ear plugs could shield us from that noise. AC hotel and the Hilton hotel are close by. The AC hotel is even closer to where the music was coming from than Princess hotel! The pool on the 23rd floor was from what I saw mostly for sunbathers and adults. The other pool on floor 3 was shallow and more suitable for children. The water in both pools was very cold and we only managed to go swimming once as he water was freezing. In my opinion, not suitable to swim in. The hotel should have the water heated in the pools. We went to take my son into the Jacuzzi as the pool water was too cold. The Jacuzzi was absolutely discussing. It was a slimy dirty yellow colour. If the jets were on, you would probably not see this and get into the Jacuzzi, god knows what germs and bacteria you pick up! The gym is located on the 3rd floor in a room just off the pool, it was small but adequate. We put a do not disturb sign on our door but the maid still went in and did our room when we were out. On 2 separate occasions, she forgot to put duvet covers on our duvets. The beds are quite comfortable and are on wheels. You can put the brakes on the bed to stop them moving, something we did not discover until our third night. There is a tourist bus which takes you all around Barcelona. This costs around 19 Euros for 1 day or 23 Euros for 2 days. You are provided with earphones and can listen in various languages to interesting facts regarding sites around Barcelona. You can get on and off the tourist bus as many times as you want. You are provided with city maps and a discount booklet. Children under 4 go free on the tourist bus. Be sure to ask what time they stop running. I think it\u2019s around 8/9pm. The metro and tram are also very easy to use. The shopping mall is right beside the hotel. There are various stores and a big supermarket. If you take any shopping into the supermarket, be aware that you have to place it in a plastic bag and seal it prior to entering the supermarket. There is a table with the plastic bags and a machine to seal it in the supermarket. There are a number of nice places to eat in the mall. The sea is about a 10/15 minute walk away from the hotel. There are no sun loungers on the beach or umbrellas. You can purchase straw mats (2.50 Euros) and umbrellas (4.99 Euros) from the supermarket in the mall. The beach has soft sand and showers to wash off sand when you are finished. In terms of taking food back to the hotel room, we never had any problems with this, we kept ham, butter, yogurts and beer in the fridge and crisps + water on the side.

Given the amount of money we spent on our stay, I can honestly say that it was not worth it. If the price had been half of what it was, perhaps I'd be giving it a slightly better review. To begin with, the hotel is decorated in a very trendy--and therefore often very impractical--way. The front lobby has seating that looks sleek and modern, and that feels very awkward and uncomfortable. The bedroom had a great view (we were overlooking the Mediterranean) but was VERY SMALL and cramped. I don't even know how they expect people to be able to work at the desk that was against the window because the space is so cramped. What upset me most is that we booked a king-sized bed and when we got to the room they had pushed two beds together and figured that wouldn't be a problem (it was our honeymoon for crying out loud). When we complained, they had little to say to resolve the issue. They also don't have an iron and when I requested one, they told me that I needed to purchase one from a store. No iron? Come on. When we were there, one of the saunas was broken and there were problems with the elevator, which is a big problem when you're staying on the 22nd floor. My husband dined at the restaurant there one night (he arrived one night before me) and said that the food was mediocre at best, the portions were tiny, and the price outrageous (which was my impression of lots of places in Barcelona, to tell you the truth--my least favorite thing about the city is the cuisine and its cost). The bathroom is very modern but, again, very cramped. The hairdryer was ridiculously heavy by any person's standards. As for the positives, here they are: 1) The hotel is pretty clean and the maid service is very reliable. 2) The views from the building are beautiful. 3) The train is nearby and very convenient for going downtown or anywhere else. 4) The mall next door is very convenient for shopping for food, clothes, dining out, etc. 5) The Italian bartender (whose name escapes me--sorry!) was a joy to talk to--he helped us with everything, from advice on restaurants, to how to get around, etc. He was a sweetheart and a consummate professional. We LOVED him. Overall, I don't think the Barcelona Princess is awful. It's a decent hotel, but completely overpriced, especially given that it's not downtown. I would say that it's a good place to stay if you're going on a business trip solo and the company's footing the bill, but as a couple going for a romantic vacation--SKIP IT! However, please don't let this review discourage you from going to Barcelona. Its reputation is well-earned as a remarkably beautiful city with lots of things to do and see. The architecture is breathtaking. Definitely go to Parc Guell, La Sagrada Familia, Tibidabo, Las Ramblas, the aquarium, the omni theatre, etc. My husband and I had an amazing vacation in Barcelona regardless of the hotel being less than we had hoped for.", "Date": "July 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cSome Good Some Bad\u201d", "Author": "Ericag", "ReviewID": "UR7712128", "Content": "Booked to stay at the Barcelona Princess Hotel sometime ago and found the reviews on this site quite good, then recently checked again and became a bit concerned.

Not so good Air Conditioning in the room \u2013 very poor. What made it worse was that all power is turned off when you remove your room key, hence no cooling. The Mini Bar is also powered off so the free drinks (nice touch) are not cold. A point to note \u2013 opting for a city view does have the disadvantage of attracting the afternoon sun. So come late afternoon the room is boiling, unless you keep the blinds down, which rather defeats the idea of having a city view. The lighting in the bathroom whilst quite good throws off a great deal of heat adding to the problem. The pool on the 23rd Floor didn\u2019t appear to be heated but certainly cooled your feet down after a day walking around. Unfortunately due to the location by late afternoon the sun had moved completely off the pool. The bar advertised on the 23rd Floor didn\u2019t open at any time over our long weekend as already noted by others. The location of the hotel we found to be too remote, whilst it is serviced by the tourist bus, metro and tram, to get into the city required a number of changes, hence we used taxis most of the time which were reasonably priced, but trying to get one late in the evening can be a bit of a problem.

Gave us handy maps of the city and metro. Our porter bought up our bags and asked us if we needed anything or wanted info on where to go. Brilliant service. Amazing view from our balcony and in the lift going up. The only thing we didn't like that there wa no iron in the room. We found this very poor. Sadly we had to pay 41.80 euros for an emergency iorning service of 2 shirts a pair of trousers and skirt. Either bring wrinkle free clothes or a travel iron (I usually do bring one). Some other things we found expensive and didn't take advantage of. A tiny bowl of crisps in the bar 3.60 euros, and this one tickled me, ice, 4.80 euros a bucket on the 24 hour room service menu. I guess this tries and stops you from bringing in your own drinks. I would recommend this hotel to couples/singles and business people. We had a lovely stay here, it ticked all the boxes for us for our short stay. I certainly would stay again.

The hotel is a bit out from La Rambla area so if you can find a hotel a little closer for an extra 50Euro I would suggest doing so as the hotel itself had nothing to draw you that far down the metro line unless you are penny pinching. On checkin it went fine, the room seemed fine, on the first day the blind did not work so we were up at dawn with the brightness in the room, they fixed this on the second day (we were there for 4nights). On the day they fixed the blind the safe would not open so we could not get our stuff out to start our tourist stuff. He brought back the safe after about 60mins it was so broke he had to carry it away and either fix it or replace with a good one. On the arrival back on the 3rd day the swipe would not work for us to gain access to the room. We were tired as most tourists are after walking around all day and had dinner booked for that night so wanted to lie down and shower etc. Instead we had to go down to reception where the lady who seemed to be around 30 odd yrs old so should have had more sense, she decided to show a younger staff member how to do it, so train him as we waited, so they made a mistake and now they were training the staff. Held my breath and said thanks and went up the 15floors and once again it didn't work, we went down again at this stage we are not happy as we are home 20mins now and going up and down like looneys. She sent up a guy with us with some special universal key, and once again it would not work so down the 15 floors again. He said it would be 30mins before we could get into the room as he had to get a handy guy. I said this to the orginial lady who seemed to have no empathy with our situation I asked what she suggest we do for 30mins considering we have been trying for 20mins to get in at our expense (up and down 3times) she said wait I asked for a drink of wine in the bar she said no. I asked for the manager she said there was none on duty, to that I said who is in charge if there is a fire and she said there is no fire. So rather than making us more frustrated I decided to say no more and go for a walk, we called back at 21:45 and she said \"It was open 10mins after we left anyway\" before we even said anything so we could have exploded with frustration with the receptionist as she was not being constructive or sympathetic. A glass of wine would have kept us relaxed and quiet and you get a complementary beer and coke every day in your fridge (cheap beer) so I can't understand why she was so reluctant to see it from our point of view and give a little. So staff problems with zero empathy is a high chance should anything go wrong. Also it is a bit out making it a pain to go out after touring around during the day and back in for dinner (20-25mins on metro). Also outside of Summer period the upper bar is closed The pool is very cold. So 4Star in my mind means some empathy with residents but this does not exist. This is why I am giving it a trip advisor two stars=Okay but some problems.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cClean and Modern but Lacks in Other Areas\u201d", "Author": "Cage&ZG", "ReviewID": "UR7238069", "Content": "This was our first hotel we stayed at during our Barcelona trip. We arrived after a 15 hour flight and were tired but excited to be in Barcelona. Arriving at the hotel we were greeted with a lack luster attitude at reception but after reading other reviews we were expecting that. (The staff in the morning was friendly and cheerful.) After check in we went to our room and were impressed with the modern decor. The room was fresh and very clean. We didn't have much of a view as we were facing the water and different wing of the hotel. I recommend asking for a room that faces the city because the views are remarkable. Just take a quick trip on the elevator to the top floor (elevator has a window in it) and you will get a sense of the incredible view. The free mini bar is a nice touch but we found the fridge to only work when you had your hotel card key engaged in the room. I found the area not to have much around the hotel. It took me a few hours to explore the neighborhood and doesn't have the history that the inner city has. The Diaganal Mar is next door and has a great food market to shop at as well as a good food court and other amenities. This is a great place to pick up some inexpensive wine and snacks to take back to your room. However, we noticed that there are signs in the hotel that warned of any outside food or drink is subject to additional cost. Absurd! The Tram is right outside the hotel and takes you to the Zoo where you can then take a short subway ride to the city. Since the tram is above ground we liked it because we could take in the views as we heading into town. The business center has two computers with access to the internet and a printer but the printer was out of ink the three days we were there. There was also a conference going on and the elevators were extremely slow during high traffic times. I found myself waiting for the elevator for up to 10 minutes in the morning. Overall, the hotel was average. It had great rooms and spectacular views. We did find that there was not much happening around the hotel, some of the hotel amenities were hit and miss, the ride into town became tiring after a couple of times and most of all the service was average! If you do not mind the commute into town then this hotel does the trick. It has great modern rooms, a mall next door and quick walk to the harbor.

The hotel really is visually stunning! The bathroom has no bath but an amazing shower and sink. The bathroom is separated from the bedroom area by a glass wall which gives the impression of more space than you have. However, if you would like your ablutions to be private there is a blackout blind that can be lowered over the glass wall. The view from our room was spectacular, as was the view near the lifts and on the glass corridor which traverses one tower from the other. beware about the handrail in this corridor though, as both my husband and myself received electric shocks every time we touched it. The minibar contains one each of still water, carbonated water, cola, a lemon drink and beer. This is free and restocked daily. We also got free towelling slippers with the hotel logo on which are quite cute and a nice touch. The toiletries set is the best of any hotel I have stayed in containing shampoo, soap, shower cap, toothbrush and paste, nail file, comb, razor, shaving gel, and shoeshine pad. Noise travels from one room to another. We heard neighbours everytime they flushed the toilet or used the shower. This made us uncomfortable for two reasons. First we were concerned about whether the neighbours could hear our intimate time (!) and second, when flicking through the tv channels, some are very quiet and some are very loud. We didn't do this often though as there were no English channels. The hotel has a restaurant which although is expensive, well worth it. The food is exquisite! The staff in the restaurant were also very nice and efficient. The breakfast room was lovely and the breakfast sublime. They even had soya milk! The staff on the whole were distant and professional. We had no problems with the room or facilities so I cannot comment on how they would handle it. The cleaning staff were excellent. The only negative comment that I would have is that we wanted to buy a cup of coffee from the bar in the lobby and take it to our room. This however was not permitted by the gentleman at the bar.

We booked room only so I cannot comment on the food, although we did have a sandwich in the corner restaurant on the ground floor which was ok. There is a lage shopping complex right next door and there are various cafes and restaurants on the top floor which were well priced. The hotel is outside of the main town, but there is a bus, tram and metro service just yards from the hotel. i must be honest and say that we used taxis most of the time, and they were reasonably priced. The hotel was busy as Liverpool were playing Barcelona while we was there but there was hardly any noise from other guests. I would recommend this hotel, but remember it is quite a way from the center of Barcelona and apart from the large shopping complex next door there is'nt much else in the area.

On arrival it looks an impressive building, out in suburbs with quite a lot of building work going on around the hotel. We had a delayed check in by an hour or so, (system failure) conceirge offered free drinks which was a nice touch. Finally got to room and air-con was broke, took 2 hours to fix. Free Mini bar not replaced every day. Being a smoker in a smoking room you expect an ashtray, NO! Asked at reception and was told to use a drinking glass instead as they don't have them!!!! Room was clean enough with a great view of the city. Watch out for the shower, it leaked under the seal and flooded the bathroom!! Uber modern, or trying to be so not the most functional room you'll ever stay in. The lifts were a nightmare, only 3 and with the hotel being full it took upwards of 5 minutes waiting going up or down at times....badly designed! Only ate breakfast once and once was enough, good selection but the food was lukewarm at best and expensive. Staff in general were efficient if not that friendly except the two guys working in the foyer bar. Both were more than helpful and very friendly, they make some excellent cocktails as well :) Ideal location for business trip, convention centre across the way and superb shopping centre \"Diagonal Mar\" right next door. Good tapas to be had here! About 20 mins from Las Ramblas etc, centre of town. Tram was confusing at first but got the hang of it, trams stops right outside the hotel. Metro at Glorias stop takes you all over the city but be prepared with your map and expect a few line changes. Too conclude our stay we took the tourist bus around the city, excellent value and an ideal way to spend your day. Nou Camp was fantastic as was Port Olympic, good food and night life. Good hotel but as I say, it could and should have been better for a superior 4 star (as advertised). Probably won't stay again but it served the purpose well enough.

SUPER DUPER CHEAP! but remember to \"hide\" it as you're entering the hotel and keep them inside your luggage. since the hotel has a policy where they reserve the right to charge you extra for bringing outside food and drinks. but, buy your water/juices from this mall before you head out to the city. save you tons of euros. GOOD THING abt this hotel: real great value. this is our best accomodation in the entire trip ($100/night budget, 3 countries, 9 cities)... clean. safe. mid to upper-class guests. the maid CLEANS the shower everyday... love that you can get free wireless internet! they have this ultra cool, great pictures, great descriptions guide book in our hotel room that really helps in planning our trip around the city. BAD THING abt this hotel: it is quite far out from the \"central\" of the city. but if you have plenty of time... if you can afford wasting a little time riding the metro, this is the place! it is close to the olympic village where the better food at more expensive price tags are. at night, around the hotel you have nothing... but the restaurants on the top of the mall (since people in spain dont eat dinner before 9pm). THINGS TO REMEMBER: every frickin' mall in spain/europe, in general closed on sundays... so plan your trip accordingly. visit sagrada familia EARLY in the morning... yeah, its a pain to wake up early, but its a bitch to wait in line for 1.5 hours. remember, it takes abt 40 minutes to get to city center by metro... bon voyage...", "Date": "October 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "switzerland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay\u201d", "Author": "worldtravelerz", "ReviewID": "UR5959598", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay.

The third positive thing with the hotel is that you can catch the metro from the station Maresme, only 2 minutes walk. Within 10-15 minutes you can reach Barceloneta, Port Olimpic, Barri Gotic or Placa Catalunya, because the yellow line passes all these great places. The negative part at the hotel was a problem with the air condition, which was very cold no matter how warm we set it.

The shower was powerful and massaging.It was a true pleasure to be in the hotel room and looked forward to coming back to the room. The only negative point i think is the tv which had 30 channels, but the only 3 english channels are CNN,bloomberg and eurosport. The blinds in the room are great, and make the room pitch black and difficult to wake up in the morning, so have an alarm ready to wake you up every morning. There are 2 computers in the first floor which we found always empty and used for the internet, but there is internet available in each room so thats another bonus.

Those same rooms are larger than the ocean view rooms, with a much more unique layout. The spa facilities are filled with young (attractive) visitors on holiday, and the pool itself, at the top of the roof, seems like an ad for Hedonism, with all the sun bathers. Had I not been there on business, I too would have whiled away many hours taking advantage of the tremendous spa facilities. The breakfast is actually one of the best I've ever had. It is, like 90% of hotel breakfasts, a buffet, but the choices are extraordinary. In reading the reviews before choosing the hotel, I had a couple concerns about the attitude of the staff. There were very few moments when I felt the staff wasn't exemplary. One has to know and understand Spain a bit to understand the attitude. No one is likely to get preferential treatment, but everyone is going to get great service. (I was able to check in when I arrived before noon, but I was only lucky.) The only complaint I have is not against the hotel itself. The location is not terribly accomodating if you're on holiday. It's great for the convention center, and it's great if you want to go to the mall. BUT, if you're in Barcelona to experience classic Barcelona, I would look to stay elsewhere.

Was a little bit odd not having a completely separate toilet but the door into the bathroom does close if you're a bit shy.

We bought a 2-day Tourist Bus pass that we used to get around the town as there's a stop on the green line right outside the hotel.

Luckily we were on the 15th floor which was high enough to have a good view but not too high to make each lift journey a nightmare! We visited the smaller pool on the 1st floor but it was in the shade in the afternoon and absolutely FREEZING!

The tourist tickets can be bought from the hotel desk although it's odd that you have to pay for the 5 Euro voucher offered (?) by the hotel.

(But the hotel probably takes a commission !) The free mini bar was welcome, although room service forgot to replenish after the first night. This was corrected when we reported to the desk. The design bathrooms are lovely and the rooms large and nicely designed. Slippres and bathrobes are welcome gesture. The two pools are tiny but adequate. The view from the pool on the 26th floor is, needless to say, splendid. There's a shopping shopping centre next door where you can eat reasonably priced meals. We always ate breakfast there.

From the airport to the hotel you can take a taxi (30 euros) or save your money by taking the AeroBus outside of the airport to Pl Catalunya and from there walk 2 minutes to Urquinaona take metro to La Pau and take off at El Maresme forum. Tip- at the airport, go to information to get map of the city marked with the directions marked. When we arrived at the reception, we were welcomed extremely nice by Christina. Her English was great and after checking in she even recommended us good places to go out in Barcelona (Vila Olimpica metro). Ask for the city map (it's a smaller one, and very good). Our flight back was at midnight, so after doing check-out our bags were stored in special room. As for the hotel. Yeah yeah, as all wrote before the hotel is located 15 minutes (by metro) from La Rambla but the facilities and the view from the window when u wake up in the morning worth everything. The room is super nice beautiful. Very electronic. Very clean. very comfortable. The mini bar was FREE (you get 5 drinks!!!). There are two small but cute swimming pools. Gym (which we didn't see) Besides, the beach is only 5-10 minutes by walk (my suggestion is for you to do it through the buildings so you could see the beautiful neighborhood. If you walk further you'll find yourself in Naturist beach (which was quite an experience). And of course, for those of you who like shopping, one of the biggest malls (if not the biggest) is just outside of the hotel - DIAGONAL MAR. Zara, H&M and lots of food resources are \"included\" in the mall. Recommendations- Go to VIP restaurant for dinner. Don't miss the Chocolata ice in Dunkin Daunts. Tips- Buy the T10 metro card- well worth it. Go to see Barcelona from Parc de Montjuic (amazing view). Don't miss Arc de triomf, Sagrada famillia and beautiful Barri G\u00f2tic Just for u to know, that there is this resturant in barcelona which is called TelePizza and they khave two menus for tourists and for locals (prices are different!!!). Don't give them the pleasure to charge u for more money. Skip the Fonfone club (too small and crowded). You can email me ido8all@yahoo.com for further more information. Would love to help.

The toilet cubicle could be a problem for larger sized people , and for claustrophobic people because the door goes up almost to the ceiling so you have the sensation of being closed up. The toiletry area is outside the shower and toilet cubicles. There is a room safe for valuables. The only negative is the security staff is very strangely adamant about not bringing in any outside food. I had read this on a review before I left, and it was true. My mother was stopped and questionned about her bottled water which I thought was ridiculous. We had a wonderful dinner in the hotel restaurant on my last evening.

We reserved 4 rooms for our group for a three night stay in Barcelona. The rooms were as discussed, beds comfortable and the blackout shades a necessity on the ocean view side of the hotel. The views from all of our rooms was nice. Be warned however that the shower temperature is very difficult to regulate. I was almost scalded several times without ever moving the temperature lever. It seemed to lessen if you turned the water on and left it running for about 10 minutes or so before getting in (what a waste of water), but the temperature was never consistent. We had also requested that one of the rooms have a bathtub. Fortunately, we were able to switch rooms around amongst ourselves to accomodate this need, but there is apparently only one room per floor that actually has a tub. The free minibar is misleading, there is one water with gas, one without, one Coke, one beer and one lemonade, per day period. Another review has noted the guard standing in the hotel lobby. Guests are not permitted to bring any food or drink into the hotel. At all. We found this to be very unreasonable. We drink lots of water. Some of our group were older and in the heat needed to stay hydrated. Needless to say, we found this to be a problem. We were also told that we could get a glass of ice from the bar. That worked on two occasions, on the third, the bartender refused. We were told to call roomservice for ice and they would bring it to our room. We then did so three different times...and we were given two different sized of ice buckets and charged three different prices, the largest being 5 euros. Outrageous for ice. The air conditioning in one of the rooms did not work, it was reported to the front desk. A man came and said that he fixed it, it continued to not work. The second day in the morning it was reported again. That afternoon, it required another visit to the front desk and a reminder that this was a 4 star hotel and perhaps they needed to increase their level of service to a 4 star level, that the airconditioning was finally fixed. In general, only one or two of the front desk staff spoke English, and not well, no Italian and only a little French. The breakfast buffet was complete, but at 17 euros, not a good value. There are several shops, cafes in the mall next door that are just fine. On a positive note, the laundry in the bottom floor of the mall did a terrific job on laundry, and a much better price than the hotel's quoted 4 euro for a pair of underwear price. Nice pressing of the gentlemans' and ladies' shirts and blouses too. Somehow, with them not speaking English and us not speaking Spanish we managed to have a great discussion and get our clothes done appropriately, unlike attempting to converse with the front desk staff. The tour bus does stop outside the hotel, and that was a reasonable way to become acquainted with the city.

The room was even nicer looking than on the pictures, and all features were working perfectly (electric blinds, super shower, etc).

The reception staff was always professional, but I admit they were a little limited in giving informations. Some of them spoke french which was a pleasant surprise for us. We rented a car for one day to go to Torres winery, and they made all the arrangements for us. The car was brought to the hotel early in the morning, and we just had to bring it back at night.

We booked early last year because our stay was during the Spanish Grand Prix. We arrived at the Hotel at 1:30 PM and were in our rooms within 15 minutes. The Clerks were very helpful and friendly. We were given rooms on the 18th floor and had a choice of a city view or a Mediterrean view. We choose the ocean view since we are from the desert. The rooms were very clean and attractive. The only fault we could find was the door to the bathroom was stuck where only a very skinny person coule squeeze into the small toilet room. My wife pulled the door past the rubber stopper and that fixed the problem. I immediately headed to the beach down past the Hilton where on the weekends there are swarms of people enjoying the surf. Do remember once you get near Dela Mar beach the blue barriers indicate the clothing opional area. My wife really enjoyed the Del Mar shopping mall. It had more to offer than I had exspected. We found a bar with frozen mugs so it was really nice to just sit back and drink a draft while the ladies went shopping. Lots of good Resturants in the shopping mall. Our Friends took advantage of the Hop On bus but did find there were certain stops it was hard to catch another bus. The wife and I did a nice walk up the Diagonal to Sagrada Familia. Sure we could have taken the Metro but we both needed the exercise. Very pleasant walk. That night (Friday) there was a band playing late into the next morning next to the convention center which was not a problem for us. We alway carry ear plugs so we can get some sleep on the plane. I did notice the hotel security was paying close attention to the enterance to the Hotel. Saturday night there was another band playing \"Old Folks Music\" this time the music stopped at 11:00PM. The free drinks in the ice box came with 1 coke, 1 beer, 1 Lemonaid, 1 bottled water, and 1 bottled gas water. The only one mix up I noticed was the front desk said we had been included for the breakfast. When we approached the breakfast area we were told we could have breakfast for $18 Euros....we passed. Note: there isn't too much open on Sunday mornings (8:00 to 10:00 AM) We did find a sidewalk cafe across the street that served a really nice breakfast special for around 7.50 euros. For our ride to the Port we let the Hotel Clerks know that we needed a cab at a certain time. The cab arrived on time and we made it to the port in 15 minutes.

Overall we had a great time. Will give a brief description of the good and the bad: THE GOOD: Checkin went very smoothly, we arrived at about 10:30 am and check in was not until three, but we were all in our rooms within the hour. The rooms for the most part were great. The black out blinds make it hard to wake up but very easy to fall asleep We were on the 24th floor so the view was fantastic! The beds were also very comfortable and the mini bar was a great touch as well! The shower was fantastic! It has the spray nozzles that spray out on different body parts! very enjoyable! Being right next door to the shopping mall was great, we ate lunch outside on the roof one day, and that was quite enjoyable, we also got some food and beer for our room from the huge supermarket! That worked out very well! Having the tram right there and the metro one block away was great as well, we were a 10 minute metro ride from Las Ramblas and the Olympic Port, keep in mind the metro stops at 12:00 so you will have to take a taxi back to the hotel. Ok now for the BAD: Two out of the five rooms we had were missing doors, one on the shower and one on the toilet. Now if you are a couple this might not be so bad, but we had two friends staying in both these rooms so it made it quite difficult. The two girls staying in one room, complained about not having a shower door and were laughed at and told that some rooms did and some rooms didn't have doors. Well as I explained above the showers have those sprayers that spray out, without a door you would not be able to use them! They were eventually moved to a different room and everything was fine Now for the REALLY BAD, not altogether the hotels fault!!! The weekend of June 2nd-5th there was a huge music festival across the street from the hotel. It went until 6:00am one night, This made it very difficult to sleep if you were on the side facing the festival. My parents complained several times during the night and actaully checked out one night early to go on to Sitges because of the lack of sleep. The genreal manager was very nice in helping them get moved and offered to pay for their night in Sitges, however since it was booked through Expedia we shall see if it works. However the next morning when the rest of the group checked out no one was compensated anything even though we all complained about the lack of sleep due to the festival. Final word of advice: The Princess has a few quirks to work out but overall we enjoyed our stay and would probalby go back as long as we checked to see if any festivals were going on! Make sure you ask the hotel if any events are planned at the forum during your stay! One other piece of advice I highly recommend for everyone. Right outside the hotel is a bus stop for the Bus Turistica. It takes you all over Barcelona to see everything you would want. you can buy a daily pass or a two day pass. You can hop on and off the bus wherever you want. Great way to see all of Barcelona. We hopped on and off at our convenience and it was great.

Either people loved it or hated it. Well I'm somewhere in the middle and my report will be balanced. The thing that stood out for me above all the rest is that the hotel, for us, was not customer focused. Well certainly not 'holiday' customer focused. From the moment we checked in it appeared that we were 'privelged' to be staying at the hotel and the reception staff were efficient but assertive. We had rooms on the 4th floor overlooking the Forum and this hotel is not on the sea front as a previous correspondent has written. You are a good walk from the beach over car parks and two main roads. There is construction work at an industrial complex about 1/2 mile away which is near the sea front. The hotel is on the corner of Avenue Diagonal, it is number 1. The rooms are very spacious, modern and open plan. There is a complimentary mini bar of four soft drinks and a beer. The power shower is good but when on full blast the drains couldn't cope which resulted in the flooding of the bathroom area. (The same happened in our friends room). There are electronic blinds on the huge window and also blinds between the bathroom and bedroom. There is also a door between the two rooms for privacy. The walls are not too thick between you and next door and with Pete Doherty playing until the early hours of the morning next door to the Forum... there were a couple of noisy sleepless nights. The events of day two are quite farcical and bizzare. Next door to the hotel is a shopping mall, with a host of shops and supermarkets. I purchased some water, fruit juice and some potato crisps to nibble in the room. As I entered the hotel I was stopped by a receptionist who had been instructed by the manager (who was stood at reception). Well my bag was confiscated!! It was highly embarrasing and I felt like a naughty boy in the headmasters office. All the other customers were watching as my bag was taken away to a side room and I could collect it on departure. I could not beleive it. I complained to the manager who stated that it was 'rules' and indicated a small sign at reception. It did say a small fee was payable if you wanted extra items in your room... 50 Euro's! The night after the sign became bigger and was placed by the lift. The reception staff were then placed on guard duty taking bags off people as they came in. It was like going through customs with the 'Goods to declare' channel. Farsical! The confiscated items were placed in a room and when you went to collect them it was a free for all. Bizarre! However some people were lucky enough to get away with the draconian measures and take beer wine & spirits to their room when the staff were busy. Crazy. We got a great rate of \u00a358 per room on Expedia and many correspondents have outlined the transport systems to down town Barca. The price is really half what it should be for the quality of the rooms, as the hotel is just two years old. We did visit the Hilton Diagonal Mar across the street and had a fantastic meal in the Indigo Restaurant. The food and service were first class. The Princess manager needs to visit to see how it should be done... but who am I to say, I am only a customer and I should be grateful for allowing the Princess to let me stay... Shouldn't I :-)", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portlaoise, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA true Princess!\u201d", "Author": "RoryMc", "ReviewID": "UR5299306", "Content": "My wife and I stayed in the Barcelona Princess for 3 nites in late May 06.

The complimentary mini bar is a very nice touch. As with the bathrobes and slippers and also free internet access. Electric blinds on the windows and bathroom were very cool. I agree with other reviews though - you tended to sleep in as they blocked out so much light you didn't realise what time it was! Breakfast was lovely, loads of fresh fruit, yoghurt, breads, cereal, bacon, eggs, grilled veg and a lovely potato quiche/omelette. Breakfast was served between 6.30am and 10.30am which was quite good as other hotels we've stayed in haven't served breakfast so early/late. A bit out of the way but as this was our 2nd visit to Barcelona in the last 12 months, we knew about the metro/tram systems. Taxi from the hotel to the city centre cost about 10 euros. There is a taxi rank round the back of the hotel which meant you didn't have to ask the hotel to call you a cab! The only negative comments we have are that the Bar on the 23rd floor was never open the full time we were there which was a shame as it would have been nice to sit in the bar and look onto the sea.

We were quite impressed with the Junior Suite, and it even had a balcony, at 20 floors up, with a table and chairs to take a late afternoon glass of Cava and enjoy the views.

The breakfast was outstanding, with a wide variety of veggies and hot items for all tastes. Overall, this is a highly recommended place to stay in Barcelona. The only drawback: Location.

The hotel as is the whole city no smoking (apart from a few small bars/cafes) so if you smoke like me you have to go outside, or alternatively theres a nice little bar directly opposite the hotel called la rambla which allows you to smoke and also sells very cheap beer and does food as well.

Taxi Fare would have been 30 euro. We took advantage of a room on the 22nd floor which provided breathtaking views of the city. The room was modern and clean.

We did use the sauna which was again very clean and free towels provided.
