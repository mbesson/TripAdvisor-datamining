{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent value for money Stayed here for 3 nights during our honeymoon and it was brilliant! It was extremely clean. The service was fantastic. The staff were extremely pleasant and accommodating. It is a few kilometres outside of Barcelona city. But Barcelona city is accessible via the trains from Martorell or in a taxi (expensive - 55 euro). It has a beautiful view of Barcelona at night and in the day. Easy to find. Good parking facilities. Excellent restaurant and service. Try the Pan con Tomate. They show you how to prepare it at the table. Two thumbs up!", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR589419335", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Utopiasvg"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d652741-r21287473-Hotel_Les_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "652741", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
