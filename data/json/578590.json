{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not the most convenient location... Although listed as a 5 star hotel, I would peg this hotel as more of a 3.5 star to 4 star hotel. A little tired and frayed on the edges in some places. The Huandao Boya is located right off of the Wanshoulu metro stop (line 1 of the Beijing metro) but is several stops away from the Forbidden City so this is not the most convenient hotel. If a central / convenient location is important, I would consider other hotels in the Beijing area. We stayed at this hotel as part of a packaged tour so my guess is that the rates at this place are less than the competition.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR871997808", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "derekk2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d578590-r20764823-Huandao_Boya_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "578590", "Price": "$316"}}
