We stayed in a king bedroom the weekend of June 10-12 and I was pleased with the overall appearance of the hotel itself and cleanliness of the room. Upon first walking into the hotel, I will venture to say that I was impressed by the tasteful, modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the lobby and front desk, as well as the machines up front to allow guests an electronic check in/check out (no human interaction required). We were checked in quickly and the front desk associate was friendly and efficient. Walking into the room, the first sight is the large, flat screen LCD TV and seating area in the front room. The seating area is separated from the bed by a small, trendy partition which was nice to provide a bit of privacy in the event that you want to change while guests are present (should you be so bold). One downfall of the room was that the bathroom was tiny. You might chop off your leg trying to shut the door if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not careful. I was expecting a bit more with the bathroom given how nice the room was; however, it was a standard bathroom with a tub/shower and toilet. Nothing more, nothing less. In previous reviews, people have noted that the bed is hard; however, I prefer a firm bed so I was happy with it. I was actually happy that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one of those sink-in beds as they provide nothing but back pain in the morning. One thing that was a bit disconcerting was the air conditioning. Now, it is Memphis so it was hot as Hades; however, the air was so bitterly cold (and located next to the bed) I had to keep a blanket and box of tissues handy. You will want to keep your air on considering that it will be hot and muggy in there if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t; however, try sitting in the couch area on the other side. After the air blasts by the bed, it is nice and comfortable on the other side. Since the television swivels, you can simply swing it over to face the couch and your favorite shows will not be interrupted by the blustery cold. Overall, the air was not really a problem for me; however, the Hyatt provides an extra blanket in the room for those who are affected. Something that should be noted is that the location of this hotel is fantastic. It is right next to a ton of eating places (Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Crab Shack is literally 0.01 miles away) and stores. We are talking Target, TJMaxx, Lowes, Ross, Best Buy, HHGregg..you name it. For food, you could find anything from Chick-fil-A and IHOP to the Melting Pot, all in the same shopping center. How convenient and well planned! One thing that I wish they would invest in would be a pool. A nice pool. One that is larger (and more modern) than a road-side Motel 6. Perhaps I was again expecting too much (expecting more of a W instead of a Holiday Inn) but the modern nature of the rooms was misleading. I was looking forward to at least a few hours of sunbathing and dipping my toes in but I may have overlooked the fact that this is family friendly (not adults only) hotel, so once I saw all of the kids splashing around I figured that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be my scene. Despite the rinky dink pool (which I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there for anyway), I still remained pleased with this hotel and would definitely stay there again. The rundown: this hotel is very clean, beds are comfortable (for those who like the firm bed), the room is fairly modern and trendy but the bathroom is the size of a closet. As long as you keep it in your mind that you are not in some swanky NYC hotel, you will really enjoy the Hyatt. Also, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to get out and enjoy Memphis\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsee the Civil Rights Museum and Beale Street if you have a chance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou will be glad that you did.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWORST.

The room was very large, neat and clean, the refrigerator was cold, and the ice buckets and glasses were not plastic....how often do you find THAT? I walked down the hall looking for the ice machine and passed a room with some very loud guests who were apparently having a small party. When I got back to the area of the elevators (still without finding the ice machine), a security guard stepped off. He asked me if I was looking for ice and told me it was on the floor below...strange but not a problem.

Upon arrival, which was later in the evening, we were informed that the hotel was full and that our reservation was given to another client. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND that they were still going to charge us for the room without checking or notifying us. We never informed them that we were to cancel our reservation. This is horrible service, and a true inconvenience. How can one rely on a hotel with such prestige and great service when they treat their clients like this. Additionally, we reserved directly with the HOTEL, and willing to pay the full price, and not some discount online price. So to those who are traveling to this hotel for business which is in a great location, be cautious. Memphis is not a safe city, and when you expect great service for an expensive price, you WILL NOT get that with this Hyatt. Oh and the best they could do was to put us into a Best Western nearby (which is cheaper, and not the comfortable room that we expected, and we were not given any additional coverage for inconvenience). This is not an apology, this is just a way to shove a client like us away. I will not be staying at this hotel again because I expect to arrive to a GUARANTEED RESERVATION without complications.

There are plenty of restaurants in the area including a Joe's Crab Shack (very busy) that is across the parking lot. Also a big plus was the extremely friendly front desk. Dante, the young man who was on duty when we arrived was very friendly and helpful. He greeted us and asked if he could do anything for us each time we walked through the lobby.

The woman who checked us out the next morning was equally friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and in good repair and the bedding was comfortable. On the negative side, the rooms are very small in comparison to hotel chains like Hampton and Holiday Inn Express. Very attractive, clean and well-decorated but with almost no drawer space, very limited closet space, etc. This makes a lot more sense for a single business traveler or a couple. It is just not a good set up for a family of three or four. Also, the in-room air conditioning unit in our room was very loud and cycled off and on all night. It sounded like an outboard motor. Some people may also find it annoying that the television (a large flat screen) is situated in-between the bedroom area and the living room area, so you have to watch it at an angle, no matter where you are.

The most important thing I can tell you is that I would rate this Hyatt Place (and others) as \"4\" (excellent) for a business traveler or single person or maybe even for two people traveling light. But I would rate it as a \"2+\" (inadequate) for families or a couple not traveling light. It seems designed for single or business travelers. There is beautiful contemporary decor; a comfortable bed; a big screen plasma TV; an adequate complementary continental breakfast; 2 fast PC's & a printer in the business center; pleasant lounge; & wireless acess in the room worked fine. However, my husband and I arrived for a 3-day stay with lots of luggage and hanging clothes for several weeks on the road. And, we did not want to leave all our belongings in the car. There were only 3 smallish drawers in our room and a tiny closet. There were no luggage racks in the room or available at all per the desk clerk. So we climbed over suitcases stacked up on the floor for 3 days. The bathroom was extremely small -- with the bath mat on the floor, you can't open the bathroom door. Pillows on the king-sized bed were small. There was no way to leave a light on in the bathroom at night without glare in the mirror or leaving the fan on. A/C was really close to the bed. Room cramped. Fridge did not have any freezer compartment. No micro. Oh yes, don't plan to sleep in -- trash truck empties multiple dumpsters at 6:00 am. The swimming pool was not open even though it was mid-late May, it was hot, and other places we had stayed earlier in the month (St. Louis & Nashville) had pools open. I would not stay in any Hyatt Place on leisure again or if staying more than a day or two. I would gladly stay there again if alone on business for a limited time.", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExcellant Low Priced Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "texaswillie", "ReviewID": "UR31014690", "Content": "This is our first stay at a Hyatt Place and were we surprised with one of the best stays at a low priced hotel we have had in a long time.

Bathroom was one of the largest we have seen even in high dollar suites. There was a couch, computer table, frige and coffee maker. Breakfast was find however it was limited. One could order for a charge more food items. we opted for the continential as there was danish, bagles,Starbuck's Coffee,fresh fruit, etc. Self--free parking. Not a large lobby however who needs to pay for a large lobby. Two elevators with quick service for a six story hotel.

The location is excellent. Very close to multiple restaraunts and shopping centers. It's easy to access from the interstate. It's about 15 minutes to the east of downtown memphis so you get to avoid the AM traffic. The hotels decor was very trendy with 42 inch flatscreen tv's in all room. The staff was very nice and after check in the staff escorted us to our room. The hotel is in a very nice neighboorhood and even though it doesn't look like it was needed the hotel had a security guard in plain sight. The only two negative things I can say about our room is that the air conditioner was a bit loud and we had to remove a tiny spider that had taken up residents in our bed. I didn't report the air conditioner issue to the hotel staff but really feel that if I would have they would have moved me to a new room. Breakfast was very basic but they did have very good starbucks coffee.

The size and layout of the rooms served our purposes very well, and we were pleased with our stay. Grounds and Location The entire Hyatt Place property was very clean and well maintained. The parking area did not have any refuse in it and the borders of the property were mowed and clean. The location of the HP is sort of odd, being at the back of a large shopping complex. If you did not know a hotel was back there, it is not the first place you would think to look. The area is spacious, however, and you are within walking distance or a very short drive from a wide variety of stores. Parking for the hotel itself is rather limited, and on our first night, we had to park in an adjacent parking lot. Staff and Check-in Every single staff person we encountered was very friendly and helpful. We checked in late on a Friday evening right around shift change. Even though this is typically a difficult time for staff, you would not have known it from the service we received. Check-in is somewhat hampered by the size of the lobby / social area. Check-in is supposed to be accomplished by computer, but the system did not recognize our reservations. The staff desk area is rather small and is adjacent to a food service counter, so finding space was rather difficult. The entire lobby area is rather small, considering the purpose it is intended to serve, and 5 or 6 people can make easy passage to the front door rather difficult. Still, this is a minor issue. Room The rooms we had were very nice. Rooms are not opulent by any means, but they are very nicely decorated, clean and very comfortable. The sofabed, while not near being a pillow-top, was much more comfortable than such sofas typically are. The king size bed was a pillow-top and very comfortable. The room itself was spacious with ample space and furniture to accommodate 6 or 7 people without feeling cramped. The room has several little nooks and spaces for storing things, and the bath was very large. Everything in our rooms was very clean, including the shower and tub area. Of special note was the 42\" LCD High-Def television. Not only was the television outstanding, but the control panel that allows you to hook up virtually any electronic device (laptop, DVD player, iPod, etc.) was very unique and quite well designed. Overall, the entire family was very pleased. While the Hyatt Place is not a full service hotel, such a Marriott or Hyatt Grand Regency, it serves the purpose for which it was intended very well.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hyatt Place Wolfchase Galleria", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55197-d1022627-Reviews-Hyatt_Place_Wolfchase_Galleria-Memphis_Tennessee.html", "Price": "$111 - $160*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7905 Giacosa Place</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Memphis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">38133</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1022627", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/19/0e/190e55176377e5703cf33904107bbefd7large.jpg"}}
