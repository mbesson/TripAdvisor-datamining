The hotel has changed little over those decades. That's both good and bad: As other reviewers have pointed out, it's a little threadbare. The carpets, drapes, and furnishings are outdated and worn. That's honestly not a problem. The place is unfailingly clean. The views are great. The staff is supportive. The location is wonderful. The rooms are quiet. The place feels safe. The prices are good.

For a 22 year old on his first trip to New York, this was a great deal, and what I liked about the Beekman at the time was that the apartment was spacious and comfortable - like staying in a home rather than a hotel room. I have stayed in the Beekman twice since then, most recently this past weekend, and I still have that feeling. Comfort is built into the place. The Beekman differs from most hotels is that it was constructed for people to live in rather than stay overnight. As architectural historian Chrisopher Gray says in his recent New York Times article about the Beekman, it was originally designed, back in the late 1920s, as apartments for young professional women: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/realestate/streetscapes-a-residence-for-educated-women.html The apartment that I stayed in this weekend reflects that. It was what they call a Superior Queen. I opened the door to an entryway, a kitchen large enough for proper cooking, a large living/dining area (15' x 18'), a bedroom (10' x 10') with a comfortable Queen Size bed, a bathroom with dressing area, and two clothes closets. The kitchen had plenty of counter and cupboard space, and older but quite decent GE appliances (fridge/freezer, gas stove with four burners and an oven, microwave and dishwasher, as well as a coffee maker and toaster). The living/dining area had a sofa for four with two side tables, a coffee table, two armchairs, a writing desk, and dining room table with four chairs. There were two televisions, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. There was also an iron and full size ironing board in one of the closets. I don't really care about safes, but there was one of those too. My accommodation was spotless and the housekeeping staff were efficient and courteous. The bed appeared to be fairly new. The furniture was older, and the carpets, while clean, really ought to be replaced. The televisions are out of date, but work fine. As the Beekman itself acknowledges, the furnishings could use some renovation. Unfortunately, the current owners purchased it at the height of the real estate market and the cost of renovations was underestimated. If you want the details, do a Google search on Beekman, Timothy Haskins (the promoter behind the purchase) and Allied Irish Bank (now taken over by the Irish Government). Given the comfort of the accommodation, the price that I paid, and the fact that the apartment was spotless, I had no problem with the fact that the television sets are old and some of the furniture and the carpets have seen better days. As for location, the Beekman is a block from the UN in one of New York's wealthier areas. Irving Berlin's townhouse, now the Luxembourg Mission to the UN, is about 1 1/2 blocks away. So is Katherine Hepburn's home at 244 East 49th St., which you can apparently rent for $25,000/month. But realize that this is not the city's most exciting neighbourhood. See it as a base from which to do some exploring. That said, there are some very good shops and restaurants in the area. That first trip to New York 32 years ago led to living in the city for some time, including recently, so here are a few examples just north of the Beekman\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 between 51st and 52nd Streets on 1st Ave, you will find Ideal Cheese and Pisacane Midtown. Ideal is widely regarded as one of New York's two best cheese shops, the other being Murray's in Greenwich Village. Pisacane is a superb fishmonger, in case you get a hankering to bring a couple dozen oysters back to the Beekman. And if you're into flowers, especially orchids, Zez\u00c3\u00a9, one of New York's better florists, is right beside Pisacane. This block is not unique. There are lots of good shops in the area; you just have to do a little hunting or tap some local knowledge. Finally, I should add that the front desk, bellman and housekeeping staff were a pleasure to deal with.

Our suite was a lot larger than most moderately priced NYC hotel rooms, and very clean.

There was a full kitchen, which we didn't need, but would be great for someone who needs extended stay facilities.

Just in case for some reason you are suffering from a rare condition and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything to do in New York, there are television sets in each room. Although the lobby is fairly small (standard for New York), the suite is particularly large. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is gorgeous Art Deco, which provides plenty of old-fashioned charm to this hotel. Lately it has become increasingly difficult to find a hotel that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like every other hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand this one certainly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like any other hotel.

The staff on the desk were always courteous and friendly and accommodating esp with our request to move rooms.

After we checked in just before midnight (as our train had been delayed; and we were exhausted) we were put in a smoking room on a smoking floor. My family and I are all allergic to smoke, we tried to just put it past us but after about an hour we could barely breathe and my sister could not stop sneezing. Just before we went to bed, we checked the sheets and found two brown bugs in the sheets!!! We called the front desk told her exactly what happened. She argued back and told us they could not be bed bugs and told us we were probably seeing things and pretty much called us liars to our faces. She kept telling us there is no other rooms (ya right, people checked in after us and got rooms), and honestly at this point we were ready to pack up our stuff and leave; even though our room was pre-paid. After MANY MANY attempts to beg and ask for another room she finally put us on the east tower into a smaller room with only one bed for four people? As you can imagine it was so so uncomfortable; but we could just not stay in a room with bugs. The lady at the front promised to upgrade our room to the highest floor and a nicer room. With this promise we stuck it out through the night. Well the Next day our upgrade was to a lower floor and a filthier older room. When we went downstairs to talk to the manager he/she was always on a break or never available. When I finally did get a chance to talk to her she was super rude and just told me that we kept changing rooms and when I tried to explain that we can not sleep in a smoking room due to allergies her response was \" we do not ever ask guests whether they want a smoking or non-smoking room, it is not our responsibility\" When i told her about the bed bugs her response was \" you cant assume they are bed bugs u can't see them with a human eye!\" Well excuse me I am a nurse I have had a course on bed bugs, I have had training and I know how to check. Never in my entire life have I ever been treated this way by hotel staff, the worst part is she did not even appologize, or even sound like she cares. If you stay here dont expect much except for rude staff who don't care about your stay or your experience in their hotel. Honestly my opinion is that if you pre-pay for a room, you get treated like crap, why should they care you have already paid?

The beds were super comfy and the kitchen was a real bonus. Also we travelled during a heatwave and were impressed that the AC performed realy well. In terms of location, we found it to be a very quite and safe part of the city. The closest subway was about 10 minutes walk away but we used the M50 bus which stops just on the other side of 1st Aveneue . This provides a frequent service cross town to 5th Avenue and Time Square/Broadway. Also there are plenty of good restaurants and bars in the local area. We were also impressed with the friendliness of the staff. If you are staying for any length of time use the weekly internet rate.

So for a 0.05 discount, you can book your own hotel, choosing exactly which hotel and where. Again, I would highly recommend not to use Priceline. On top, I found out that the rate priceline paid the hotel was $90/night (out of the $120/ night priceline charged me. So doing your own research you might get a deep discount. I indicated in priceline that we were 2 adults. And it booked me a room with one queen bed. Which I think is not acceptable unless you are a couple. I was going with my friend, and wanted thus a king bed or 2 double beds, as I assumed was standard. The hotel indicated me that they could only offer me the room priceline had booked: a room with a queen bed. AWFUL. Getting to the point, once I got to the Beekman Tower Hotel, things did turn around. It was a bit hard for me to find at first, but this was because the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade is being renovated. This hotel is rated 3 stars, but the service is definitely 5 stars! Starting with the friendly staff at the front desk (Yvette and Miguel), to the housekeeping staff, the doorman (Aymen), and the engineering staff. I explained my situation, and at check-in, they looked for an available room to accommodate us better (fix priceline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mess), and they did put us in a room with a queen bed but which also had a pull-out sofa bed, this without any additional charge. The staff does understand and cares about the needs of their guests. Our room was on the 14th floor, and even though the building itself is older, our room was very nice! It was very spacious, it had pretty decorations, it was clean, the furniture seemed relatively new, the bed was absolutely wonderful and comfortable, the pillows were super plush, and the sofa-bed was good. We both slept very comfortably. The shower pressure was alright, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as strong as others (like to knock you against the wall), but it was good. We had 2 big windows, and a thermostat so we could adjust the temperature we wanted. We had a kitchenette, the appliances were not modern ones, but everything worked and was clean. The staff gave us a lot of information about where to go, and all recommendations were well-founded, we had a nice time in the places they suggested. Also, since we were sleeping late, we always put our do-not-disturb sign, and every evening we found a friendly message from house-keeping saying that we could call them at our convenience to make up our room if we wanted, and also to offer clean towels. This is very thoughtful. We did call in for towels, and they were delivered to our room, and we could have as many as we wanted (which is great because I always need extra towels for my hair). Another shockingly pleasant experience was when we asked for sheets for the sofa-bed. Not only they sent the sheets, but sent someone to come and set the bed for us. A very friendly lady came up and made the sofa-bed very neatly and professionally! Moreover, on our second night, I locked my suitcase but left the keys inside. Thus, I had nothing to wear but the stuff I had on that morning. So that night I asked for help, and someone came to the rescue to cut my lock. The restaurant at the top of the tower has an wonderful view, especially the side looking towards the bridge (food, so-so). At check-out, all was very fast and easy. They even got me a cab.

I am not a particularly finicky traveler, and can tolerate many quirks and eccentricities of both new and older establishments in order to have a pleasurable experience. But the Beekman would need to make improvements before I could recommend this hotel. In fairness to the staff and management, I would like to point out the positives of the hotel first. The staff was warm, attentive, friendly ,helpful and professional. This included everyone from the front desk clerk, the bellman, the cleaning staff, the waiter at the restaurant and the limo driver. The location of the hotel is good and the view from the Top of the Tower restaurant is without question, splendid. The size of the suites are large for New York. The mattress on the bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was a plus. The negatives of the hotel, however, made for an unsatisfactory stay and I hope the management will take notes to make improvements. This hotel has all the potential to be a gem but the flaws overwhelm the potential and in my opinion, are the kinds of problems that can ruin a hotel and a reputation. The first room I refused, something that I have never done in all my years of travel. This was because the room was dingy and the carpeting was literally coming up in numerous areas. The overall look was dreadful and depressing. Having stayed in many hotels in NYC, I was stunned at what was offered compared to the photo on the website. The front desk receptionist kindly changed my room but there were still issues with the upgrade . I could not disrupt my schedule to look for other accommodations, so I stayed the duration of three nights. Some of the issues could be overlooked--like the scratchy towels, the lack of supplies considered the norm , the runs and frays and stains of the carpeting, the multiple (and large) scratches and stains on the furniture , the aged and yellowing wallpaper, the bargain basement shower curtain, and the absence of the scheduled 5:30 a.m. wake-up call for a flight that needed to be caught. Those problems, many cosmetic in nature, were not to the standard one would expect of similarly- priced hotels in NYC, but could have been tolerated. What was found to be unacceptable, by any standard, was the mildew on the shower tiles, the dusty and broken mini-blind in the bathroom, the mildew and stain on the shower curtain, and the thick layer of dust on the floor between the tub and the vanity. For these, there is no acceptable excuse. Additionally, the pull-out sleeper sofa was un-usable and cigarette smoke wafted in from a neighboring room and filled the living room with sickening air at night. Travelers need to be forewarned about these problems because some are health concerns. Basic cleanliness is imperative in the hospitality industry and I am hoping that management will address these concerns so that other travelers will not experience similar problems and disappointment.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGood service, Flexible Management\u201d", "Author": "Sam_in_seattle_87", "ReviewID": "UR73982444", "Content": "We stayed here a week ago, for 4 days, and had a good experience.

Check-in was easy and we found our hotel room to be more than what we expected. I'll admit that I was a little freaked out to stay here when I read poor reviews about this hotel before I visited NYC. I found our room to be clean, large, and very comfortable. Sure, the place could use some updating, but there wasn't anything in the room that was hard on the eyes. We used the fridge a lot since we always picked up a few waters across the street before staying in for the night. There was a large mirrored sliding door closet that held our clothes, and another closet close to the bathroom. The bathroom and shower area were fine, and there was even a window in the shower that could be opened up. The view was amazing from our bed and it seemed cozy to come home to after a long day walking the pavement. The only thing I would have liked was for the AC to be a little bit quieter. It was nice and cool in our room, just noisy. The hotel is in Midtown East, which I loved because it was a lot quieter than the hustle and bustle of Times Square. We had no problem catching a cab from this area because there was no one to fight for it. It is pretty much as east as you want to get, but we walked 10 minutes to the subway (we used that a lot), and we managed to walk to Times Square, Grand Central, and the MoMa from our hotel. Maybe we're used to walking quite a bit, b/c it didn't bother us at the time but we were tired at the end of the day. We went up to the top of the hotel restaurant to see the view when we first got there and that was really nice. We also checked out the work out room, which was better than I expected. They even had a his and hers sauna, but we didn't use it since NYC was having a heat wave. Our hotel was cleaned well everyday and we didn't experience anyone knocking on our door early to clean it, like some people had mentioned on this site. We went to Pressbox for beer and appetizers and to watch the World Cup. Nice place and within easy walking distance of Beekman. We also ate at Ess-A-Bagel one morning, along with Moonstruck, which had amazing french toast. We went to Mother's for $2 beer and $3 margaritas after seeing an off-broadway comedy, and wanted to stop in at Mint, a well-reviewed Indian restaurant near our hotel but ran out of time.

We went up to the room to discover we were placed in a room with two twin beds. We immediately called down to reception (very easy to find button on phone and worked the first time we tried - Unlike another poster's comments) and explained that we were there for our anniversary and when we booked with Priceline, I specifically requested a double bed). The woman on reception checked our reservation and confirmed that Priceline had agreed to put us up in a Twin room (despite our specifications) and told me she'd check the system and call us back asap. Within 3 minutes she called back and explained that all of their basic rooms were full and they would only be able to provide us with an upgrade room for $169 per night. Since we had only paid $110 on Priceline, we passed on this and thanked her for looking into this for us. We then went to move our car into the parking garage and when we returned we were greeted by the reception staff and the hotel manager who agreed to upgrade us for free. Our room was very spacious and appeared to be clean. We were only on the 8th floor but the view was still pretty good - Looking over backyards of the condos, not directly into buildings across from us. We had no trouble with water pooling on the floor despite the two shower curtains...We moved them down to the middle/end of the shower and it was fine - No problems with room. Location wasn't bad - It was much more quiet and safe feeling than it would have been in other \"convenient\" areas of town. We bought the $8.25 Metro card each day which was good for unlimited travel on subways/buses for a 24-hour period. There is a bus stop at the front of the hotel which you could use. We chose to walk to the subway station at 51st and Lexington, about a 5-10 minute walk. This was only one stop away from Grand Central and also ran downtown right to Battery Park. It was very convenient and we found that going back to a quieter area of town after a hectic day out was just what we needed. The doorman greeted us every time we entered/left the building and knew who we were. This made us feel very safe as he was very aware who was going in and out at all times. In all, we got a great deal on this hotel, and we would have paid more for it. We are completely satisfied with our stay at the Beekman.

Give 'em a careful read; my conclusion is that the Beekman has mostly solid rooms but also a small inventory of \"bad news\" ones (probably on very low floors and/or the annex that one unhappy guest wrote of). Perhaps these lemons are reserved for lowball stays (Priceline, and perhaps Hotwire) and/or nights when the hotel is genuinely 100% capacity. Since I'd booked a multi-night stay via Priceline, this made me nervous. My solution was to speak very cheerfully with the desk clerk about my desire for an upper floor. (I threw in the request for \"a view if at at all possible, but I understand that may not be possible). A $20 tip might have been involved, too. Viola. By that time, the clerk had pulled up my reservation - and I'd seen a printed card with a low-floor room number. Ugh. Happily, that was changed to something in the low teens to mid-20s, where I figured most everything would be good. And it was. First, this review is adjusted for \"NYC on a budget\" standards. So we begin with dialing down the expectations. In Denver or Cleveland or Pittsbugh, I'd expect a whole lot more amenities and modernness - with a lower rate - before assigning a 4-star value. But in Manhattan, the deal is: Either spend many hundreds a night or expect claustrophobic rooms, \"venerable\" decor, hallway and street noise, surly staff, and either a tiny gym or none at all, The smallest, blandest pool is an insane luxury, and whirlpools and saunas rarely exist even at the 5-star-deluxe platinum card level. So by those measurements, the Beekman isn't bad. The location near the U.N. is too far east to be really convenient for getting around the city by subway or on foot, but it's safe and reasonably tranquil. (Expect the convenience factor to improve if the city every builds the long-planned 2nd Avenue subway). The art deco building is attractive, the lobby is nothing dramatic but pleasant enough. You're in a neighborhood surrounded by consulates and upscale condos and apartments, and there's an overall feeling that you're too far off the beaten path to attract the drunken suburban teens, panhandlers, sketchy grifters and others who crowd Midtown on weekend nights. (By comparison, the scene just outside the Marriott Marquis at 1 a.m. on a Saturday can be a bit crazed. There are plenty of cops, but also armies of inebriated out-of-towners and doubly inebriated foreign tourists wandering through crowds of sour-looking young locals \"hanging out.\" ) The 26th floor restaurant is worth a visit for a drink or a soda - take the opportunity to visit the narrow outdoor veranda/balcony if the weather permits. The East River views are terrific. My room was substantially larger than what you usually get in Manhattan. A bit dated, but nothing bad at all. A double closet next to a breakfast alcove/work space; a kitchenette with microwave, fridge/freezer and oven; a large bedroom with a second closet; and a small but updated bathroom with tub and shower. The windows open a few inches; great if you like a breeze. 1st Avenue is busy enough that you'll hear traffic, but it's not a round-the-clock cacaphony of honking taxis & screeching tires like so many Midtown streets are. $12.95 for Internet access. No dedicated work area (use the small, round kitchen table). An unflashy but reasonably good gym with a few treadmills, weights and a couple of exercise cycles. A safe, ironing board and iron, crazy amounts of bureau and closet storage space. Small TV at an awkward angle to the bed, but I never watch the stupid thing anyway - the nice touch here is that you can just close cabinet doors on that bureau, and the TV is out of view for the rest of your stay. Comfortable bed, old but not objectionable carpet, fairly pleasant front desk and cheerful bellman. Even at Priceline rates, this was north of $120 a night. To me, that's way more than I pay in average markets (God, Priceline has spoiled me. A modern 4-star in Boston or Montreal \"should\" run about $80 a night on my scale). But NYC isn't an average market, and this hotel is a very pleasant bargain. Expect the Waldorf and you'll be disappointed.

Obviously, the owners do not care about guests except as a way to pay off their monetary investment. While it may be \"budget\" for NYC--at nearly $200/night--this hotel is a shabby excuse for even \"low-cost\" accommodations. We arrived in the morning via \"red-eye\"plane, having paid for the room starting the night before .The hotel staff knew we'd arrive in the morning after booking and paying for the previous night. Perhaps this meant we were allotted the worst room in the hotel (because people who arrived earlier got better rooms--first come, first served). Perhaps it was because we booked via Hotwire ($143--no bargain as it turned out) . It was room 3G. Our window view onto First Ave was of scaffolding, dirty cigarette butts swimming in puddles on the ledge, and that sharp spikey wire that is used to keep birds from alighting. We should have taken it as a warning to keep humans away as well. The lobby is dark, gloomy and dreary. Surely you can keep that Retro, genuine 1920s wood panel and beautiful antique clock, with some spiffing up or a coat of light -color paint? This was faded and gloomy, without a hint of charm. One doorman /assistant Henry was helpful , cheerful, and pleasant (quite a challenge in that atmosphere). He greeted a housekeeper , who responded with a scowl. Another doorman was asked by the receptionist to call a cab. The cab never came, and we couldn't even ask if it had been called, as he quickly disappeared from his post in the entry hall. The queen-siae bed was surprisingly comfortable--unless we were so tired after a sleepless night on the plane that we didnt notice. it was a 5 or 6 inch height mattress--the kind that are rarely seen any more (in keeping with the antique look?) . NO bedbugs. The mattress pad was old and tattered. Towels and blanket had small holes in them, but were clean. Check out time is noon. At 9 am we were awoken by pounding on the door. \"When are you leaving?!!\" Perhaps the housekeeper was shocked that anyone would want to stay past the early morning hours. Room cleanliness: kitchenette and bathroom clean to the naked eye. Disillusionment set in once in bed, staring up at a large, black cobweb on the ceiling--the kind that has been attracting soot for some time. As we checked for things we might have left under the bed, we found someone else's things left behind--some trash which had been missed. Room size: minute. NYC is known for small rooms, but this was beyond the norm. There was a small kitchenette but no table or chairs. The only place to eat would have been on the bed. Minimal utensils, but there was a corkscrew-- perfect for the needs of guests ready to hit the wine bottle at the idea of an overnight in Room 3G! Furniture: French provincial style, circa 1960. The mattress and pad dated from that era too, I assume. Bathroom: cute and typical NYC apt size. it would be nice if the owners could spring for one bathtub-size curtain, instead of two separate stall shower curtains which left g a big gap in the middle, No liner curtain, so shower water made a pond on the floor queen size bed barely fit. there was a kitvhenette, but othig to eat on. We went from this hotel to one three blocks away that cost about $35 more per night and was about 30 times better. The front desk staff seem to really care about the guests. There is one young lady who works in the afternoons/evenings and she is delightful. Natasha, in the morning, is calm and professional and attentive. They are rays of brightness in this grey gloomy place. Please , if you are in NYC for pleasure, choose another hotel.

Waiter was not very accommodating, I was informed when making the reservation, kitchen would be able to make me a veg meal, no such thing, waiter did not even offer anything of the sort, infact felt I was ignore the whole evening, was not asked if I wanted main course as there was no vegetarian dish on the menu and he knew I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything, what was worse was he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even ask if I wanted a second drink, however he came over to my husband 4 times to ask him if he wanted a drink! Not pleased with the service in the restaurant. The only downside was the maid would ask us if we would like our room serviced, if we answered yes, we felt like she was swearing at us, we barley go a smile from her! We felt we had to avoid her each morning, run from the room straight into he lift!! She was quite good, except she left us small towels, no bath towels like the ones we had the day we arrived. The replacement maid while the regular one was on leave was no good at all, had one towel between the 2 of us, no hand or face towel either!

Hotel - There are elevators in the hotel, so no problems with access, and a rooftop bar / diner. We went to the bar a few times, the view is magnificent although this building is small by new your standards. Prices were reasonable, but you are paying a premium for the view. Surrounding area - Across the road there are a couple of Deli's (good for coffee, juice and donuts in the morning) There are some excellent bars within a five minute walk to 2nd Ave (For example, The Manchester, The Press Box, etc). Slightly cheaper than those around Times Square, and really welcoming. We had good food in the Press Box. Summary - I have stayed near Times Square and Here and there are advantages to both.

This hotel was rated a 3 star. I booked for 3 people, and got a room with one small double bed and a pullout couch. The pullout couch was in such bad condition that you could not sleep with it pulled out. The couch folded up was not much better. After I booked i saw reviews online about this hotel which stated that the hotel was dirty and there a few comments about mice. I called up hotwire right away and the hotwire associate was unbelievably out of line. I told him about the reviews, letting him know that perhaps the condition of the hotel was not the same as it was when hotwire first partnered with the hotel or gave it its star rating. When I mentioned the mouse he told me \"Look I have watched 20/20 and I know all about how everywhere has mice.\" How can it be acceptable to have a 3 star hotel with mice. This hotel would probably have been great 30-40 years ago in its art deco glory. But there has clearly not been any renovations or upgrades in at least 15 years. I cannot fault the hotel, since with any quick search of the hotel your know what you are getting your self into, the reviews don't lie. I can only fault hotwire.They claim that you will have a hotel with a specific rating, and that it will be comparable to reputable named hotels. This did not live up to the hotwire description. Booking with hotwire leaves you helpless. You have NO power at the hotel to complain about the conditions since you have already paid. This hot is old, do not expect frills. The carpets are weathered and worn, the couches are uncomfortable, the beds are hard. This hotel is also loud. First room was 2H this faces 1st AVE, loud street noise. Then we were switched to 5AII, this room had less street noise but the toilet would run constantly. I would say if you are looking to book a hotel do not book here, I am sure you can find something better. the trip in from Jersey would be well worth it! But if you were like me and booked through Hotwire and did not choose this hotel, but are stuck with it, I saw just be prepared. I made my self sick after reading reviews, hoping they were not true, but fearing they probably were. My tips would be: Do NOT bring ANY food into the room so the mice won't stick around. Keep your luggage zipped up even if its on a table, the mouse in our room was on teh table! Bring ear plugs. Ask to switch rooms, some will be better than others. The restaurant is nice, and they give out free breakfast vouchers to solve all problems so take advantage of that. Good luck and sorry if anyone else gets roped into this hotel by hotwire. I will say that the Beekman staff overall were nice, and really this hotel is just bad so if you book there it is what it is so to some degree i Do not fault the beekman staff.

I couldn't work out what I was more annoyed by - that there were mice in the first place, or the fact that they hadn't bothered to hide the fact by cleaning up the mess! Unfortunately, the hotel was full that night and we couldn't be moved. To the credit of the desk staff, they offered us gratis drinks in the bar at the top of the hotel and moved us the following day, to a room three floors below. The new room was clean and tidy - no mice droppings - but also looked like it had seen better days. The communal areas (apart from the brand new business centre) all needed a lick of paint and new carpets. In the past I've recommended this hotel, but I won't in future.

The shower was great! Everything was clean but the furniture was worn and scratched. The sofa had a slipcover on it that kept coming off and exposed the slightly stained upholstery. We had a king bed which was very comfortable and our daughter slept on a roll-away bed that we requested ahead of time. We didn't try the pull out sofa bed because we've never slept on one that was even slightly comfortable. The restaurant, called Top of the Tower, was very elegant and and romantic . A pianist was playing on a grand piano and it was dark with candles and soft lighting. The view was stunning. Unfortunately we didn't eat there because we had only brought casual clothing. Room service is available. The staff and the doormen were very accommodating and were always available to help. Valet parking was $52.00 a day and you weren't able to access your auto until check-out. That was fine with us because we mostly walked or took taxis. A parking garage down the street was only $2.00 less per day. The neighborhood is mostly residential and very quiet and safe. We had a view from the bedroom of the East River which was nice. One block west on 2nd Ave. were lots of shops and restaurants. We had breakfast both days at Morning Star Cafe which was inexpensive and the food was good but typical diner food. One thing we loved about it was that they serve breakfast all day for those late risers, like us. The burgers and fries looked great too! The other restaurant we ate at on 2nd Ave. was Zarela. The food here was some of the best Mexican cuisine I've had! Not typical enchiladas and tacos but they offered very inventive and fresh dishes. We also purchased some wine at the liquor store on 2nd and brought it back to our room..To get into midtown, we took a cab which was under $10.00. We also purchased Grey Line Hop On-Hop Off tickets and would walk to the U.N. to get on it a few times. Just a hint on driving to the hotel...enter 1st Ave. at 40th St. or below. Make sure you stay in the center lane on 1st Ave. and go through the tunnel. Whatever you do, don't keep left or you won't be able to get over to the right easily to make the right onto 50th St. It's an accident waiting to happen. From 50th make a right onto Beekman Pl. and then a right onto Mitchell Pl. The hotel will be the last building on your right, on the corner of Mitchel and 1st. There are spaces for unloading.

PRO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The price. For two nights with taxes and everything ended up being around $460 Having done a lot of research this was a good deal for a hotel with decent reviews in NY. Size: A lot of people reviewing other NYC hotels complained about the size. The room had a small kitchen and thus was bigger than most other NYC average hotel rooms reviewed on trip advisors. Location: This might be a negative for some but for us it was nice to feel a little away from it all when we finally came back to the hotel to relax. The hot spots such as Broadway and Times Square are a little bit of a walk but my wife and I love to walk so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big deal. Neighborhood: Because the hotel is close to the United Nations the neighborhood has a lot of houses that serve as the office space for different countries missions to the UN. Just by walking around you can see many different countries represented with their flags out front. Around the hotel are restaurants and shops that are fun and a lot less pricey than Times Square or other NYC tourist hot spots. One of our favorites was Zip Burger 3001/2 52nd Street which tasted a lot like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Five Guys\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for those who are familiar with that Mid Atlantic burger chain. Zip not only had great burgers and fries but shakes as well. Service and Staff: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t order room service or have to much interaction with the staff. They were helpful in storing our baggage when we checked out and answering any questions. The hotel delivers a complimentary paper every morning to your room CONS The hotel has a worn feeling to it and yes a small lobby. The rooms are functional but could use a remodel getting new carpet and updated bathrooms etc. Some hotels have showers that feel inviting and leave you refreshed. The Beekman does not. The shower had problems with mold and the bathroom looks very worn out. Tips Getting Around: Not being from NY it took a little while to get the swing of the subway system. The actual Subway stations don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give out free maps. We purchased a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Street Smart\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NYC walking map and were able to get around great. It had all the streets in Manhattan and overlayed all of the metro stops. Little Italy is well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 really little. This was probably our biggest disappointment as we thought that the neighborhood would have at least 4-5 blocks of great Italian restaurants and stores etc. What exists of little Italy these days are only a 1-2 blocks or so of mostly tourist focused restaurants and is not a full \u00e2\u20ac\u0153neighborhood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at all. Broadway Tickets: Like many visiting NY we took our chances and stood in line for half price theater tickets. www.tdf.org We were able to get \u00c2\u00bd price tickets to see Marry Poppins. The show was wonderful and the set was absolutely amazing. Bus Transportation to NY We traveled to NY via the DC2NY bus. www.DC2NY.com Two round trip tickets purchased on the internet cost $80 total which beats hands down driving, gas, parking fees and the NY \u00e2\u20ac\u0153congestion tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to get into the city. The ride up confirmed just about every stereotype you could have about taking the bus to NY. While still in DC the bus was clipped by another car which delayed us. Midway thru the trip the stench from the bathroom was overpowering. The driver finally caught wind of it all the way up front and got on the bus PA system and asked that someone go to the bathroom and flush it so the smell would hopefully go away. Finally the driver had bad directions and missed the exit. Some people on the bus who knew the route well started to flip out. We ended up being about 2 hours late. Those who had Mac\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s could also not use the wireless internet and one girl almost lost it when she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t log on. The ride down was the exact opposite. Fast efficient driver, no weird smells from the bathroom and an on time schedule. So I guess it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed bag with this company depending on the bus, the driver and the bathroom being clean and functioning. Dinning: We loved Serendipity3 www.serendipity3.com It a very cozy unique restaurant that has great tasting food but above all amazing desserts. Because its so small seating can be a challenge.

We liked the many small delis, grocers, pubs and restaurants in the quiet area that surrounds the hotel, particularly SipSak Turkish Cuisine, the Manchester Pub and Buttercup Bakery (all on 2nd Avenue between 48th and 53rd). It's also a short walk to Times Square and Little Brasil (46th between 5th and 6th) and a rather longish walk to Restaurant Row in Hell's Kitchen. The hotel is also only four blocks to the 51st Street Subway station, which I took full advantage of in my explorations. There is also an uptown bus stop right outside the front door and an crosstown stop across the street. Using the metro or buses, you can get anywhere in the five boroughs. Staff - the staff were friendly and helpful. We didn't have any problems with our room, although others who were attending the same event did and they were quickly and politely rectified. The kitchen was nice to have, given the length of our stay. A few groceries from UN Gourmet across the street meant not having to eat breakfast out every morning and cold beer in the fridge at the end of a long day. Room - We were in 18A1 and while, yes the decor is a bit tired, the room was clean and comfortable. Ask for a higher floor when making a reservation. That way you can leave your window open at night without the noise and fumes from the street being unbearable.

Except for the shower head, the bathroom was about 15 years past due for an upgrade but it was clean. The TVs (there were 2) were old but not so old that there were channel change knobs (but close). There was a dining room table large enough to seat 8 which I think was put there to fill the large living room. The couch was something out of a 1950s movie. If the owners put about $2000 into the suite, it would equal or exceed the better hotels of NYC.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cRave reviews for the staff\u201d", "Author": "Almos", "ReviewID": "UR15244531", "Content": "Our daughter is a freshman at Columbia University and we have been experimenting with different hotels in an attempt to find a hotel that we can depend on when we come to the city for visits. The Beekman Tower, which we found from a Hotwire email promotion, has ended our search :) I booked a studio queen for $190/night over a weekend. When we arrived there was some confusion at the front desk because there was a staff person in training and she entered our name without the O', so the printout she asked me to sign had the wrong room rate. The manager on duty, Chris Brown, was hovering nearby and was quick to jump in, help her resolve the problem without embarassing her, and for our \"trouble\" upgraded us to a king bedded suite, with a full kitchen, dining area, living area, two bathrooms.......and a view! I had been kidding him about how we wanted a view, knowing full well that we had gotten an internet deal and were probably going to be relegated to the 2nd floor and he had been reviewing the room availability with the trainee, and told me (before the error) that he could put us on the 18th floor. When the error was discovered, he did not backpedal at all, gave us a great room for the same price...........in fact, when we decided to extend our stay over Sunday night, he graciously honored our discount rate for that night...........and if you've read this website for other hotels before, that rarely happens. In addition to this, the doorman advised us on Saturday night that we didn't need to pay $xxx to park our car in the garage, that the city allowed overnight parking on the street in front of the hotel from Sat until 8 am on Monday( and telling us exactly when he was on duty, so we knew our car wasn't being \"guarded\" the entire time), saving us easily $100......the restaurant at the top of the hotel is just ok, but the view is worth the concession in dinner............unless its your only night, I definitely wouldn't waste a meal on this restaurant unless I had one to spare. We had had a late lunch with our daughter after a track meet so my husband and I went up to the restaurant later in the evening and had drinks and their sampler plate from the appetizer menu, and it was fine. Oh, and did I mention that the doorman remembered our name the next time he saw us, after saving us the parking fee (we did tip him $20 but not enough that I would have expected this treatment) he acknowledged us by name.

The room was for us and three children, so we thought we better call to make sure the room was going to be able to accommodate us all. We called the next day and were told by the Beekman employee on the phone that we currently only had a room with one queen bed reserved, however for an additional $30 per night, we could upgrade to a one-bedroom suite with a queen bed and fold out couch, so we did. When we arrived at the Beekman, we signed a piece of paper at the front desk that said one-bedroom suite, however the room was anything but. It was a tiny room with one bed and small kitchenette and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. Barely enough room for a roll-away. So we went back down to the front desk and told the gentleman there was a mistake, that we had reserved a one-bedroom suite. He said they were totally booked for that night, apologized, and started calling around to other hotels in Manhattan to send us to. Our assumption is that since we arrived at the hotel late at night, they gave our one-bedroom suite away to someone else. Anyway, he gave us a letter that was addressed to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Affinia Manhattan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hotel and $20 cab fare and told us that this Affinia Hotel could accommodate us for that night and to come back the next day and the Beekman would have a suite ready for us for the next two nights. So we took the cab to the Affinia Hotel, only to find out that they could not accommodate five people either. So they sent us back to the Beekman and our only choice was to take the tiny room and deal with it. The Beekman offered to pay for the cab fare to and from the Affinia Hotel, free breakfast the next morning, and the first night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservation free. We went up to the tiny room, they brought us a roll-away and my husband and I slept on the floor. The next morning we packed up and went down to the front desk to have them hold our bags for the day and make sure they really did have a suite ready for us that night and the next. The woman (Heather) was rude, patronizing, and of course we had to explain the ENTIRE story to her, as she knew nothing about the situation, and she was not the least bit empathetic. She assured us we had a suite booked for that night and the next. So we went out for the day, and came back later and sure enough, the suite was awaiting us. This room was much more spacious. We still had to get a roll-away, but at least nobody had to sleep on the floor. Much to our dismay, when we received the bill on the third morning, they charged us for the breakfast, the cab fare, and three upgrade fees at $60 each. After complaining to the front desk (to whom we AGAIN had to explain the whole story) they took off one upgrade fee, the breakfast and the cab fare. We now have a mysterious $16 charge on our credit card that we can only assume is for the roll-away, as we had no parking charges because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t muster up the energy to call about that at this point. We prepaid Hotwire for all three nights, so I am assuming the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first night free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd promise will never materialize. Now, for the rooms: Dirty. Very old and dirty. The bathroom fixtures and appliances were in desperate need of an upgrade, there was mold on the bathroom wall around the window, the floors were dirty and the carpet was bunching up and folding in places (obviously needs replaced), the water was brown when we first turned it on in the shower, just all kinds of problems. The heating/cooling unit was also difficult to deal with. The one bed hotel room (the first night) was especially old and dirty. Hotwire has this hotel rated a three-star. I can only assume the rating is based on the lobby and the location alone. Everything else was a mess. The only good thing about the rooms was the kitchenette. That was decent. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, nor will I ever stay here again. The location was okay, the restaurant across the street called the Nations Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (I believe) was very good and the service there was wonderful. Do not stay here if you have ANY other options, and if you do have to stay here, call to confirm your reservation and get the person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name you speak with.

First things first: the hotel's just north of the UN and yes, there is a bit of a walk to the 51st Street subway. But the M15 goes along 2nd Avenue (inbound) and 1st Avenue (outbound), which was a big timesaver. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a heck of lot right in the immediate vicinity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mostly residential \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it was quiet. We did not make it up to the 26th floor for a drink, but the view from our 21st floor suite was pretty cool. I booked the hotel for two nights after finding a Travelzoo special ($179 for a studio queen) and it was quite a deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a roughly 400 sq.ft. space with a separate, full kitchenette (including a dishwasher, stove, wine glasses, etc.), dining area, bedroom, and private bath. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a convenience store across the street for breakfast fixings; the hotel provides the free NY Times each day for your lingering-over-coffee enjoyment. So what's the problem? Well, I have an allergy to dust mites and haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had a flare-up for over a year. I've since stayed in hotels without incident but for each of the two nights at Beekman, my symptoms kept me awake and unable to sleep. On my second night, NyQuil knocked me out for five hours, but that was about it. I woke up again with the same symptoms. Also, our room was just too warm and the fan/cooler function wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. We alerted the front desk to this and the concierge left a message with the maintenance staff, but as far as I know, this remained unfixed during our stay. Once we found that the windows opened, though, we got around the problem that way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we left one window open about 4 inches during the day, kept it open during the night and things were better. I did not have this issue before going to NYC which leads me to suspect that perhaps the room was not as clean as it looked on the surface. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m reluctant to say that because I could be very wrong and what I experienced was a fluke\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the bed linens certainly _looked_ clean, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m at a loss to explain why my symptoms flared up when they did. (They subsided when we returned home.) Perhaps the sheets were fine but the mattress was too old \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my husband complained of a sag on his side. I know that hotel rooms are never fully clean and it's caveat emptor. But it's too bad because otherwise this is a very good value for NYC.

And before I start properly I should say that a hotel room is fine for me if it is comfortable, clean and functional as we spend very little time in a hotel room when on holiday as we're too busy out exploring. This hotel was just that, functional, comfortable and clean but you can also add : Spacious, with a huge, extremely comfortable bed, great maid service, great room service menu, great hairdryer (at most hotels you usually get some tiny thing masquerading as a hairdryer but not in the Beekman), seperate kitchen/eating area, lounge area with tv, prompt courteous service (I waited around a minute to be bought additional pillows and a hairdryer) and a great power shower in a clean bathroom! (The shower is awesome..insignificant things please me!) The location was fine for me, granted it wasn't slap bang in the centre of Manhattan but we like a walk and you can get a taxi to most places in Manhattan for less that $10 plus tip. It took us ten minutes to walk to the Rockerfella centre and a further five to reach Times Square. It also takes around 10 minutes to walk to Grand Central to take the subway to most places on the island. Side note - if you want a very, very central hotel this might not be for you but if you don't mind a few short walks then it's fine. But nearby there was the UN Diner (opposite) for great value breakfasts as well as a grocery store if you wanted to take any food back to the hotel and an off licence. We found a great little irish bar (McCanns on 1st) which was really friendly and very cheap for a few drinks, two minutes walk on 1st Avenue just up from the hotel - head northwards. There's also lots of nice restaurants on 49th street as you walk towards Rockerfella centre. The best part of this hotel is the lovely restaurant at the \"Top of the Tower\" serves food till 10pm and drinks till 1am. If you like great food and drink, good service, fantastic nighttime views over Manhattan and a great environment then make sure you use the restaurant at least one night if you can.

We booked a stay in the Beekman via an online booking agent, which is where our problems began. The booking had been cancelled by the Beekman due to payment not getting made as of our time of check-in by the booking agent. Not their problem I guess, but the manager we spoke to had to be the rudest person I met in NY all week - we were obviously in a spot of bother, and the best she could offer us was a different (lesser) room, which would have been OK, except she insisted on charging us UPFRONT for the full room rate, plus some. As finding a room at such late notice in NY is next to impossible, we were forced into taking this room. When I tried to reason with the manager regarding the price, suggesting that the rate they were supposed to have been paid by the agent (and which we had booked at) was approximately half of this value, she refused to cooperate. Her perogative I guess, but a terrible attitude in general. The room itself was indeed massive (I think it was one of their \"studios\"), but it was in a different building, with no porter service offered. The room was in a fairly decrepit state (possibly why it was still empty), and not clean enough by any stretch. The sheets on the bed were also threadbare and rough, which is not what you expect when paying over US$450 per night! The only good thing was access to a (very old and broken) kitchentte, and the minimal street noise we were subject to due to our location - necessary as we needed to have the windows open for ventilation as there was no cooling or heating to speak of! Overall, I would not be recommending this hotel to anyone - if you book a few months in advance, you can get a lot nicer in Manhattan for less money.

The bathroom is off of the bedroom and is rather small. And while the bathroom was clean enough, it lacked the nicer fixtures and amenties that Sheratons, Westins and other chains have to offer. The sink filled with water quickly and we had to be careful not to cause a flood. The entire suite was in desperate need of a makeover. The fabrics are dated and dreary, the wallpaper peeling, and the carpet a bit thin and stained in places. It was warm in NYC during our visit and the AC in the bedroom did not work at all. A large portable AC unit sat in the bedroom, but the remote control did not cause it to turn on. We were able to open windows, but of course, the noise of the traffic on 1st Avenue made it difficult to sleep. The bed was far from the comfy \"heavenly\" sort that so many hotels offer these days. And the linens and the \"vellux\"-like blanket were far from luxurious. There was some sort of dried matter on the bedroom blanket--better not to think about what that might have been! The suite had a dated kitchenette with a sticky handle on the refrigerator door and a long dark hair sitting on the countertop--again, not exactly appealing.

The Bedroom was on the small size, but still very nice. The Bathroom was located off of the bedroom and was adequate with the exception of there was only a shower, not a tub (see photo). The furniture and decor was a bit dated, in a traditional style cherry wood, but it was not like it was run down and uncomfortable, just not a luxury, brand new style. I have no real complaints about this hotel as the 1 BD suite was really quite large and we were very pleased considering we paid less than $300 including taxes when booking through Orbitz.

We enjoy taking short weekend trips to Manhattan for fun whenever we are able to get a good price on airfare. We booked the hotel through the Affinia.com website, as this hotel was part of the Affinia hotel group at the time we booked out trip for May. We requested and got a high-floor room with a balcony. The vistas from our balcony on the 20th floor were spectacular - almost unobstructed views of the river and Queensborough bridge. The one-bedroom suite had plenty of space. The bedroom was a little small, but not for Manhattan. The living/dining area was huge, double the size of the bedroom, and had a half bath. It was big enough to house two fold-out sofas, and they both could have been folded out at the same time with no problem. This was a huge room. The kitchen was functional and clean. The location is great, as others have said. It's in a quiet part of town but the walks to tourist and business areas are very reasonable. The things others have said about the furniture being merely functional and a little on the older side are true. That said, we are going back to the Beekman very soon for a two-night stay. We found the hotel to be very clean and comfortable, and the ability to have a child or children sharing the same space without being in the same bedroom with the parents is a real plus for the Beekman (and for several hotels owned by the Affinia group). It appears that the Beekman is no longer associated with the Affinia group, as it is no longer possible to book a room at the Beekman via the Affinia website. We are hoping that the quality of the property is at least equal to the quality when it was an Affinia hotel. I think a lot of people don't understand the Manhattan hotel scene and this gets reflected when they write reviews of Manhattan properties. A hotel suite the size of a one-bedroom at the Beekman (or at the Affinia Manhattan, where we've also stayed) that was decorated to the standard of a luxury hotel would easily cost twice as much on a good day, when you got your best deal. More often, the rate would be three times as much. Check around and you will see that this is true. I would guess the one-bedroom we stayed in at the Beekman was around 900 or maybe even 1,000 square feet total. There are many, many hotels in the same price range in Midtown that offer 300 or so square feet of space for the same money as a large one-bedroom suite at the Beekman.

The location of this hotel is reasonably good (being centrally located north to south, though not as central east to west), with the nearest subway station being a 10 minute walk away (at 53 St. & 3 Ave.). This area is relatively less bustling, it felt safe, and there are fine restaurant choices within a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk. The building is a lovely, 26 story, Art Deco tower, with a bar on the top floor offering wonderful views. It should be noted, though, that those not buying drinks are strongly discouraged from partaking of the views, private parties often render this bar/observatory unavailable to the general public, and just two, tiny drinks will leave one feeling light-walleted by $20. Three elevators in the small lobby yielded wait times of no more than a minute or so. The staff we encountered during our visit were knowledgeable, competent, and rather friendly and courteous (by big city standards).

The kitchenette (roughly 7 x 8 feet) included a small microwave, small fridge, utensils, plates, etc., a counter and two stools, sink, and range.

It's true that the interior isn't designed by Philippe Starck, and no, it's not on Times Square; but what this hotel does offer is space, value for money and a decent location. We were in a room on the fifth floor with a view of another building and the back gardens of some neighbours. The room was a good size with sofa, table and chairs, with a well equipped kitchen off the living room along with a bedroom with en-suite. I didn't think that the decor was that dated, it looked like a number of Marriott's I've stayed in, warm, floral colours, nothing too offensive. As other reviewers have mentioned, the Top of the Tower is a good spot for a cocktail or two, we didn't eat there but we did see the food and it looked pretty run of the mill for the prices being charged. Location-wise it is a bit of a walk into the heart of Manhatten, but we walked to Times Square in about 20 minutes. We would recommend getting a travel pass and using the public transport. A week's ticket was about $26 and gave us access to the bus and the underground. There's a bus stop directly opposite the hotel that takes you straight across Manhatten, easy! Finally it certainly looks like the Beekman's low rates have been discovered by many as when we were there the hotel was fully booked most nights.

(Negative first sorry!) Things didn't get off to the best start when we checked in however. Unfortunately - although I had requested a high floor through the booking agency (lastminute.com), and had emailed the hotel separately requesting the same, we were given a very cold room on the lowest floor possible - floor 2! The suite was nice, but had terrible views (a brick wall one side, and 1st Avenue through a frosted smeared window the other) and the bathroom and bedroom were very very cold - even with the heaters on. I reported our disappointment to reception, who advised that they could not do anything until the next day. Sure enough, we returned from being out the next day to find we had been moved to a new suite - on the 17th floor with a city view! We were very happy and very grateful with the new room, and the way that the reception staff handled the situation. Location of the hotel was fine. On previous visits to NYC, we have stayed in midtown (Waldorf Astoria, Roger Smith, The Carlton), but - although the Beekman is a little out of the way - it is not too bad. The nearest subway station - 51st and Lexington - is not too far (about a 5 minute walk - depending on how fast you are!). This is only a pain if you're tired and very cold and drunk...but then you can get a taxi (as we did)! There is a diner and a grocery store across the road, and a McDonalds(!) and Starbucks a couple of blocks away. The United Nations building is a bout a 2-3 minutes walk away. You're only about 2-3 blocks away from midtown, where everything is. The views from the \"Top of the Tower\" restaurant are great. We didn't eat there, but had drinks/cocktails one evening, which was very relaxed and enjoyable. We did get room service one night (which is from the Top of the Tower restaurant) and the food was very nice. All staff - including doormen, cleaners and waiters - were very professional and pleasant throughout our visit. I never got time to use the gym(!) or any other facilities at the hotel, so cannot comment. Rooms/suites are very spacious, clean and nicely decorated. Ours had a nice big 'living room' complete with sofa, coffee table and dining table, plus a nice size TV. The bedroom was a good size with a very comfortable large bed (and TV), and nice clean ensuite bathroom. 2 good size wardrobes - one in the bedroom and one in the 'hall' - plus an iron and ironing board were also supplied. The kitchen is equipped with a fridge freezer, microwave, coffee machine and coffee, and sufficient cutlery, plates, etc. Although the Beekman is described as a \"business hotel\", I thought it would be suitable for all types of travellers (although probably not best for families with younger children - though suite size could be a plus point for families).

The room was very well aired and as it was the middle of the night and we were exhausted we just collapsed there for the night and then requested it was changed in the morning. The next Day the man on reception said they would find us another room and to ask him about it when we returned after our day out. When I did ask about it on our return at lunch time I was told they had given our room away as we were not packed and ready to move (everything in our rooms was packed up apart from tooth brushes). I was told there were no more rooms so we would have to stay in the one we were in. After I refused to accept that then they found us a non smoking room on a non smoking floor. The rooms were clean and comfortable but there was lots of niggly things that needed fixing in both rooms, they were just old and run down. Loose tiles on kitchen floor, curtains that don't close, broken toilet fixtures etc. The walls were very thin, could hear our neighbours coming in every morning at about 5am and continuing their partying. The coffee machine in the room was great but getting a Kettle to make Tea was a bit of a trauma as well, but we did get there in the end. We had 1 meal in the Top of the Tower restaurant, the view was great and the food was all nice although I did not get what I ordered. There was meant to be a piano player in there all night every night as well (proudly told this by reception when we checked in) but there was not a note of music in there all night. I chose the Beekman because of reviews on here but having stayed there I would not want to recommend it to anyone as there are pleanty of better places to stay in the city.

I booked a Queen Suite through Quikbook. Upon my arrival, they directed me to an entrance down the street - not exactly what I had expected. Then the keys didn't work.

John the bellman quickly took care of getting me a suite in the main building, and he was very pleasant and helpful with getting all of my stuff into the room. The suite was much smaller than I expected. It was also very warm - the AC was not working as well as it should. This became very obvious when my bridal party, hairdresser and makeup person came over and we were all sweating, especially now that the suite was more crowded. We had to open the windows to cool the place off. The day of my wedding was in the 60s and fairly humid. I returned to the room after the wedding to find the AC had been turned off, and the heat cranked up high! It was unbearably hot (and killed any wedding night romance!). The staff promised us a portable air conditioner which never arrived. We had to make do with a fan. We got no sleep and ended up checking out very early. It was very disappointing, as we were looking forward to having a romantic morning with breakfast in bed. The room was very outdated and needs renovations, especially when they are charging $300 a night.

Also, room service will not provide wine or champagne - I had to run to a liquor store to get some celebratory champagne.

However, the bellman (Henry?) saw my predicamant and told me where the nearest Kinko's is. One other point of how unhelpful the desk staff was is that when asked about amenities that were printed in black and white in the hotel guide in my room they treated me like I was making things up. In several places it said, \"Your room is equipped with a printer/copier/fax machine,\" and \"All suites are equipped with a printer/copier/fax machine,\" along with instructions on how to use it. When I called down to ask about this (my room was a suite) I was told both that my suite wasn't big enough to be equipped with one, and that they took them out of all suites a while back.

There was this one bellman who was always extra nice to us. When I left they asked if everything was to my liking. It was nice to have someone be nice to you when it seems the whole city is either rude or very impatient (I had a street vendor in China Town call me \"stupid\" because I wanted to open up his t-shirts to see what they looked like). I know the city is fast paced, but when it seems like no one in New York cares, the Beekman's staff seemed to always smile when we walked into the doors. The housekeeping was great too. They even washed the dishes once for us. The room was very quiet! We were in the corner and I only heard the people next door to us once when they closed the door. Having a room quiet is very important for me. I booked our trip with a well known website and the pictures they showed us didn't look like the room we got. The kitchen was smaller, as was the bathroom. I liked having a kitchen because we bought cereal from a market around the corner and ate in our room every morning. For cost reasons, this is the way to go. The location was nice.....right next to the United Nations and it was mostly residental. I requested a high floor the day before we checked in and I got the 12th floor out of 26 floors. I also took the advice of a previous guest and told them that it was an anniversary and they left us a nice note and some chocolates and Pelligrino water. Nice gesture.

Superb stay at the Beekman Tower\u201d", "Author": "product-of-canada", "ReviewID": "UR4691276", "Content": "I have to say, researching NYC hotels before booking on Expedia.ca really paid off. Because I read all the TripAdvisor Beekman reviews, there were no surprises. These reviews give you a really good idea of what to expect. My wife and I stayed for 4 nights/5 days, which worked out to about $200 Canadian per night. I'll try to summarize some highlights: 1. We arrived at the hotel about 5 hours before check-in time, and yet they gave us a room right away. 2. Our room was quite large. Not as large as some of the other descriptions on this site, but it still exceeded our needs. 3. What a bonus to have a kitchen in your NY hotel suite! (see picture). The kitchen came equipped with a mini-fridge, oven, stove-top, dishwasher, plates/bowls, microwave oven, and knives/forks/spoons (among other things). It was nice to have a coffee-maker as well, which was stocked with ground coffee bean packets. There is even an ironing board and iron. 4. I did not expect to get a room safe free of charge. 5. The lobby makes a great first impression (see picture), and our room was nice and clean. 6. Hotel staff were so friendly and accommodating. Hats off to the door-men and desk-staff, who knew we had questions before we even asked them. 7. I loved the location. The hotel is East of midtown, so you're quite close to many of the major NYC sights. Aside from the UN headquarters, you're close to the Chrysler building (see picture) and Grand Central Terminal (see picture). I don't quite understand other reviewers who say the Beekman is 'out of the way'. Grand Central is about a 10 minute walk away (or less), and no more than 15 minutes to Times Square. It would be even faster if there weren't so many red lights getting in the way. If you don't like lots of walking, then you should reconsider NY as your trip destination. I'm not sure how one could truly experience NY without exploring by foot. 8. Our flight left in the evening, so we inquired about the check-out process. Front desk said they could add a couple of hours to our check-out time, which was nice - but we didn't need to do this. We just checked out early, and had the staff safely store our luggage in the lobby (something I had read about here). I can't really think of anything negative about the Beekman that sticks out in my mind. I will mention that food in the hotel is overpriced, but that's no surprise. They leave a room-service menu in your hotel room, and everything is abusrdly expensive (they add on different charges in addition to the cost of the food items). I should also mention that we were hardly in our room. Typically we left the hotel by 7:30AM, and would be back by 10PM. So if there were other problems, perhaps we weren't around long enough to discover them - but I doubt it. Other tips not relating directly to the Beekman: * There is a free walking tour of Grand Central Terminal every Wednesday at 12:30PM at the info kiosk - it's 1 1/2 hours long, and very thorough. * Go to the ticket kiosk at Duffy Square (which is in Times Square) to get big discounts on Broadway shows (mostly Off-Broadway shows) - we got 50% off Slava's SnowShow and 50% off the Altar Boyz - but you can only purchase for 'day-of' performances. * There are many cheap or free performances at Juilliard. * Try to visit the Empire State Building just before the sun sets - this way you can see Manhattan during the day and at night (the nighttime view is spectacular). * Don't waste your time or money with the CNN studio tour. It is a let-down, and you don't see much of anything (they mostly have you watch a bunch of videos). * If you want to save some money, and your flight is at LaGuardia, you can take public transit. Just look for the M60 bus - it costs $2 per person in change (they do not take bills). Once you're at 125th St., you can get off at Lexington Ave. - head southbound/downtown on the Lexington subway line (you have to pay another $2 each) and get off at 51st St. or Grand Central Terminal. Now you just have to walk East for about 10-15 minutes along 49th street before you arrive at the Beekman. Taking public transit may not be for you if you have a lot of luggage. Also, the transfer you make at 125th and Lexington did not feel like the safest place (it is Harlem afterall). I'm not sure you'd want to be there at night waiting for the bus or subway. And the M60 bus is quite full during rush hour.", "Date": "March 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cconvenient\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4597693", "Content": "There's nothing I can really rave about or complain about when it comes to the Beekman. I stayed over a 4 week period in Jan-Feb 2006 as I was in NY on long business trip. I needed an apartment-hotel and I got an apartment-hotel! The room I had on the 8th floor was huge. It was bigger than most apts I have seen in NY - huge living/dining room, lots closet space, etc. For the price ($199 USD - special government employee rate - I think!), it was well worth it. Having a full kitchen (stove, microwave, fridge, dishwasher, toaster, cutlery, dishes, etc.) was a definite plus. The old green carpet and classic old furniture was ok. Two television sets (one in bedroom, one in L.R.) with a good selection of channels was also pretty good. The service was not bad. I never received a newspaper in the morning but a Newsweek would appear in my room once a week. The cleaning service was done daily and impecably. I just wish they didn't shut the armoir holding the TV everyday - but I never said anything. The front desk service was also ok.

Except the for the sketchy Deli across the street with over a dozen security cameras (there were always a bunch of Asian guys in suits whispering in a corner of the store), there isn't much action in the UN diplomatic area of Manhattan.

It's all really close, yet it's far enough away to feel like you're away from the hustle and bustle of NY. The hotel lobby is decorated in an art-deco style. Fresh flowers and chilled music really added to the ambience of the place, making it feel welcoming on arrival. We had a 2 bedroom suite for 4 people.

A well equipped kitchen area and good sized dining space, plus a good sized seating area and a very comfortable sofa bed in the lounge. There was also an additional small bathroom in the hallway.

Staff were very professional and nothing was too much trouble. Housekeeping was very good (toiletries very nice!), and they were happy to help with anything we asked and were friendly at all times. The complimentary wine and chocolates were also a lovely touch! Other reviewers have mentioned problems with windows and heating. We found the lounge area a little cold, but mainly because it was such a large space! The windows we found fine, although a little stiff, needing two of us to open them. But no problems with noise. The cocktail lounge at the top is lovely, especially in summer, I imagine. In winter though, with the windows closed, not as special as I'd hoped! The cocktails were good, but the menu limited (wine list good though) and at $14 a cocktail, we thought pricey but is apparently going rate in NY (we found drinking expensive wherever we went!).

We had just gotten off of a cruise and decided to extend our vacation and I feel like I got better service from the Beekman than I did the cruise line. It was pretty much a 5 dollar cab ride to anywhere we wanted to go in New York and a reasonable walk to all the major attractions and shopping. I loved the Beekman and will definately stay again when I return in December! The room was large and although promised a King sized bed we received a queen. The room was very large and the kitchen was a great feature that I did use to store ice cream and take home food from the restaraunts. The Top of the World or tower? was delicious and had amazing views! The price was the best part of it all on top of the cleanliness of the room! Overall the best in New York for those on a budget!", "Date": "September 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGrat experience!\u201d", "Author": "Becky1972", "ReviewID": "UR3881239", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Beekman over Labor Day weekend. We had a great experience...the staff was very pleasant and efficient and our suite was very nice. We were upgraded for free to a large suite on the 23rd floor (we had originally booked the smallest and least expensive room available). The hotel is in a nice, relatively quiet part of Manhattan. It's a bit of a walk to the theater district/42nd street area but to me that's an advantage...in my opinion it's better to stay in a quieter, less tourist frequented area.

We stayed at the Beekman Tower Hotel at the end of June/beginning of July 2005 for 10 nights. Having read reviews from other Trip Advisor members, we had high expectations and were not disappointed. We stayed in a one bedroom suite on the 4th floor overlooking first avenue, which was surprisingly quiet. We had a kitchen with cooker, microwave and fridgefreezer, a separate sitting area with sofa bed and a separate bedroom with double bed. The room was very clean and fresh towels and toiletries were provided on a daily basis. The door staff and ladies at reception were very courteous and friendly and after a long day sight seeing and shopping, it was nice to return to the comfort of the Beekman.

Our suite was on the 22nd floor and we had a small patio area and could see the East River and the Empire State Bldg.. Staff was very accomodating and we liked the location. It was very safe and not too far from bus or cabs. (Although on a regular workday don't expect to get a cab between 4-8pm and if you do get a cab, don't expect to move very quickly). It just wasn't that far to Grand Central Terminal -- afterall, you are in New York City and you will be walking. There is a groc /deli across the street and the Nations Cafe across the street that we highly reccommend for breakfast. It is a better value than the continental breakfast at the hotel. We ate at the Top of the Tower and it was great food, but not family friendly. Our kids did not want the full selection included for the meal and they adjusted our bill accordingly.

Nice folks, but be quiet late at night- there's a baby sleeping upstairs! Lots of restaurants nearby- we ate at Lasagna Grill- chosen because it was overflowing with locals.
