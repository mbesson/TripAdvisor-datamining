We had a nice large room, very clean, that looked out onto the river. Claudia at the front desk was incredibly helpful, making sure we had all the info we needed or knew where we were going. As mentioned in other reviews, plenty of free parking. Internet is free, but coverage is somewhat limited. The breakfast buffet was excellent, with a very large choice, with helpful staff. Everyone speaks enough English that our limited German was not an issue! Around the corner from the Tiergarten S-Bahn, but great walking through the Tiergarten to the Brandenburg Gate, if you like to walk. Really recommend this hotel if you're going to Berlin.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Hotel\u201d", "Author": "dannykent", "ReviewID": "UR126883809", "Content": "If you like a hotel with a touch of character, you will like the Hansablick. The modern facade conceals an interesting period building in which there are still apartments. My hotel room was immaculately clean, had high ceilings, comfortable beds and a large bathroom. (By the way, contrary to what a review below claims, this hotel does have an elevator). The staff at the front desk are very helpful and friendly and all of them spoke English well. The breakfast rooms have plenty of tables and are light and airy. Plenty of variety in the breakfast food, ranging from healthy cereals through the usual German cold cuts to scrambled eggs and sausages. Less than 50 yards from the front door is a walking path along the Spree River. If you like walking, you can get to the Reichstag in about 30 minutes on foot with only a short portion on a road. Otherwise the U-Bahn station is a five minute walk.You can get here from the airports on public transportation for less than 3 euros if you are a little intrepid; if not a taxi will be 20-30 euros depending on which airport you come into.

The building itself is a old house with fantastic spaces for breakfast, a drink or just relaxing a bit. It is a perfect place to stay with small children, since it is quiet and rather small. It feels like staying in someones flat. In your imagination you can see the ladies from the 1910-20'ies walking around in their fantastic clothing and feel history coming towards you in this exciting city with it's many sad stories.. The rooms vary a bit in size and especially the singlerooms may seem a bit small, but with the space to the roof it still feels comfortable and spacious. Breakfast is really really good and fresh and you get all kinds of coffee or tea you like. Everything looks fresh and serving plates are never empty. Reception personnel may seem a bit strict, but perhaps typically german! They are, however very friendly and help you on whatever matter you may have! Overall it is a great place to stay since it is quiet but still very close to everything. Ubahn is just around the corner and Tiergarten is right outside the door!

Without a single local contact, we wanted something small and personal, well situated but quiet, comfortable but not too expensive. This is the kind of place where you feel instantly at home. The area itself is residential -- ivy-covered mostly prewar buildings -- but just 1 1/2 blocks from the Tiergarten S-bahn station, which connects with just about everywhere we wanted to go, from Alexanderplatz to Ku-damm to Potsdam. The staff are all pleasant and friendly, while the manager, Peter Prinz, is like a wonderful host, full of information, insights and advice. He drew us maps, suggested restaurants and helped us discover spots not mentioned in guidebooks. The hotel's great location, so near the center, and his suggestions made the city so accessible. And our room was always so nice to come back to: spacious, silent (we heard no gurglings through the walls or street sounds), the bed was perfect, and the bathroom large and immaculate. Our only complaint: the ceiling light wasn't bright enough for reading in the arm chairs after dark. But the two adjoining breakfast rooms were splendidly bright and cheery, decorated with colorful modern paintings as well as some older prints. We couldn't fault the breakfast either -- lots of fresh fruit in various guises, all sorts of breads, cheese & cold cuts, cereals, eggs, etc -- and a nice touch: a bowl of granny smith apples always on the reception desk. The other guests were mainly German -- families, couples, businessmen and women -- with a smattering of Americans -- all invariably discreet and polite. Some reviewers have commented on the lack of a lift. It was under repair this month. And yes, the street is not brightly lit at night, but we never felt the slightest qualm about walking back from the S-bahn. We can't recommend this hotel more warmly.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBasic but pleasant\u201d", "Author": "GB1976", "ReviewID": "UR14510725", "Content": "This hotel is set in a quiet residential area, so a bit scary if you've never been to Berlin before because it feels very far from anything touristy. The hotel doesn't have a lift, so we had to walk up two flights of stairs with our bags. The hallway carpet is rather grotty, with patches where they have replaced a small section with a newer piece, which rather stands out. We booked a 'large' double room, which was of reasonable size and obviously used to be just one room when the whole floor was one large apartment. The smaller rooms have partition walls which aren't too soundproof, and really are very small. Our room had twin beds with individual sheets and a really thin duvet each. The bathroom was on the small side, with just a shower cubicle (none of the rooms have a bath as far as I can tell), sink and WC. The lino flooring was clean but showing some wear and tear. Our room did have a balcony, however, which we didn't pay extra for, shame it never got the sun in March. For breakfast there is a reasonable selection of cheese, ham, salami, fruit juice, cereal, bread, yoghurt and fruit. There is also a self-service hot breakfast section, offering scrambled egg, sausage, and sausage patties. The hot food wasn't very well stocked when I was there, and the scrambled egg had a very strange consistency, like a yellow savoury Aero bar. Solid with bubbles in. For a non-touristy Berlin experience I would recommend this though.", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHome away from Home\u201d", "Author": "Kokko", "ReviewID": "UR10948397", "Content": "Sorry to be so late with this review. I stayed at the Hotel Hansablick for 5 days at the beginning of September 2007. I loved this hotel. It is located inside of a still existing apartment complex , so one feels like one is not really a tourist, but lives in a residential neighborhood. This neighborhood is called Tiergarten, which is located between the Tiergarten and the Spree River. A short walk across the street and you are on the banks of the Spree River, where there are lovely trails to walk. The walking trails along the river will lead you all the way to many attractions. The hotel is also convenient to public transportation (the S Bahn and the U-Bahn). The staff is very friendly; after the second day they remembered that I liked two pitchers of coffee instead of one with my breakfast. The coffee they made was very good, by the way. The breakfast buffet was very diverse. Always plenty of food and a large variety of items. My room was huge; I had a balcony with a view of the Spree river. The rooms have high ceilings and original art. Ladies: THEY HAVE A MAKE-UP MIRROR -- big plus. They also have a nice little cart in the bathroom which fit all of your personal items very nicely. The room was cleaned well. They have a computer in the lobby for all guests to use for free. I'm probably forgetting something, but here it is, for now. I would definitely return to this hotel when in Berlin. Berlin is awesome, by the way. Definitely worth a visit (my 5 days were way too short -- will return for more next time.)", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkeley, CA", "Title": "\u201clow-budget but friendly\u201d", "Author": "Christine_U", "ReviewID": "UR10772982", "Content": "I was a little disappointed with my room at the Hansablick Hotel--there was something spare and dormitory-like about it, and one of our beds was pretty uncomfortable--but there were a number of good things about the hotel. The breakfast was lavish, and served in two lovely rooms, with a view over the canal. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the rooms, although plain, had some of those little touches that budget hotels can lack--box of tissue, shower cap, hairdryer. The building is located very near the ubahn (Tiergarten stop; it's just a few blocks walk)--you can see the hotel sign as you go by on the train. The actual street the hotel is on is pretty, and our room had a view over the tree-lined canal, but some of the surrounding blocks are graffittied and don't feel absolutely safe, so I would use caution at night. I got the impression a lot of students live in that area, but it was quiet at night. The hotel is in a converted apartment house which must have been very fancy at one time--the marbled entryway has the remains of stucco scrollwork all over the ceiling, and the vestigial elevator is charming to look at, although it doesn't work anymore. Tip: if you want a double bed, and get a room with two twins, you can move them: the bedside table between them is modular. You can pop it out of the wall, push the beds together, and pop the table back in.", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Hansablick Garni", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d217906-Reviews-Hotel_Hansablick_Garni-Berlin.html", "Price": "$104 - $169*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Flotowstrasse 6</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10555</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "217906", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d5/1f/d51f1604cda11718fb4a97e4f72ace1f5large.jpg"}}
