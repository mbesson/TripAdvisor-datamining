Upon arrival we were informed that a \"No daily housekeeping\" policy was being introduced, something that we had not been informed of previously. During the proceeding five days, we called both housekeeping and reception on several occassions requesting clean towels, toilet roles, garbage bags etc. On each occassion, we needed to call again because the message just didnt seem to get through. Funny that the reduced services didn't result in a reduced cost for the guest. Heres another good one, they want to charge you $15/day to park your rental car. Fortunately there is free parking on Wainee street if you can snag it.

Fortunately, we didn't want daily service so it worked great for us! Although it would have been nice to know where to get more laundry and dish soap. We had two couples in our group and had a 2bed/2bath place. It was nice and spacious. The table and bar only had 3 chairs each, so we couldn't all sit down in one place and eat at the same time. This wasn't a big deal for us. The kitchen has a smaller size fridge and dishwasher. A microwave and stove. It was supplied with basic stuff. We booked through costco travel and got a great deal. The non-master bathroom had a washer and dryer in it. There wasn't a bath tub, only showers. We were in a room very close to the pool, therefore we were able to access the wireless internet. All other areas have internet access for free, it just isn't wireless. There is a daily parking charge, but they were up front about that. For some reason, our room wasn't ready when we got here but they thought it was. So we came into a messy room. It took another 2+ hours before our room was ready. It was annoying after a long day of traveling. They did compensate us for that though. The location was great, just a quick 2 block walk to Front Street, just under 3 blocks away from a Starbucks (important stuff!) and easy access to the highway.

We booked through Costco/travel.com and received a good rate. Over all we were happy with our stay and felt it was a good value, just a few little things but I feel people should know about. We knew before booking about the parking fee. Before we arrived we had decided to park on the street, but once we arrived we payed the fee. I didn't feel like it was too much, but they should just add it to the cost of the room, most people rent cars while visiting Maui. We stayed in a 1 bed 1 bath room, that was easy to access from the parking lot. It was quiet and comfortable. It had all the recent upgrades and loved having the washer/dryer, more than I thought. We were receiving daily maid service until about the middle of the week, then nothing. I don't mind washing the bath towels, but not getting more bath soap, dish soap was not convienent. I asked the front desk if we could have maid service come to our room and they said they just changed their policy and no maid service would be available going forward for any guest. The front desk woman said they did a survey and the majority of the feed back was to limit interuptions from staff. That is fine, but I feel like they should have told guests about this change and provided us with the information about how to get more supplies, which they were more than willing to drop off in our room when needed. We also had a light bulb out the day we arrived, above the Bathroom sink, we contacted the office and they dropped off a new bulb, which did not fit. So, we called back and they sent the service guys, turned out the fixture was a little loose. I also had to wash the bath mat that was provided under the bathroom sink, it was dirty when we arrived. I do have to say that they need to deep clean the bathroom showers more often. I have read other reviews saying the shower walls are slimmy, yes they are and this isn't just slim but moldy, which can be harmful to guest and employees, the management needs to work on this. I loved the Salt water Pool and spa, beautiful and nice to relax by before bed. We did not use the grills, but cooked most of our dinners in the Condo. My husband is a Chef and was able to cook some amazing meals with the kitchen supplies provided. I love the location in Lahaina. We easily could walk to front street to eat and shop. It was great for our 8 AM Whale Watching trip with Trilogy that left from the Light House, just four blocks away. Despite the few issues, we would stay here again. The value compared with other Condo's on the island is outstanding. It isn't the Luxury resort but it isn't the Budget Inn.

The furnishings and decor are all top notch (and all the same, so you don't have to worry about getting a bad unit) because they were recently renovated. We stayed in a 2 bedroom which also has a pull-out couch in the living room so the unit can technically sleep 6. There are two pools on the property, a saltwater pool and a fresh water pool and they are both delightful and the perfect temperature. There is also a hot tub, and cabanas and comfy loungers around the pools. I would highly recommend staying here rather than at one of the pricey resorts in Kaanapali because you have the entire town of Lahaina to explore and enjoy, rather than being trapped in the resort area down the road.

As for the condo itself it was very clean, in good repair and the very basic cooking utensils were provided. The free WiFi is located near the pools, however wire internet is available in the rooms, but with todays devices iPad and Mac Air and iPhone that is of limited value. In our condo the AC cooled great but was extremely noisy had to be turned off at night. One other note, a rooster on a neighbouring property crowed throughout the night every night we were there, which definitely made it difficult to sleep with an widow open. Generally a good experience, I would stay here again but would ensure that I got a second floor condo.

There was no room to walk around the condo with the bed folded out....so we only spent time in condo when we were sleeping. We also asked when we booked to be by the pool...i believe we were possibly the furthest from the pool as you can be (although at the end of the day it wasn't a big deal). Since we are \"young\" (30's) and active...we LOVED the location. It was perfect distance to shops, bars, restaurants and marina. We walked every from the condo!! Having expedia on site was also very helpful when booking excursions (although you can get the info from the rep and go to the companies website and book direct. most places offer an online booking discount). The big pool was wonderful...but get there early if you want a lounge chair. very limited number of seating (i would guess 15 or so chairs). There is a big TV in the pool area so the boys can watch football while the girls sunned. All in all...nice place. I wouldn't cram too many people in the condo. It's not that much money...when in doubt, rent a 2nd place! oh...and if you are a beach lover...this isn't the place for you!

The public bus stop is just one block away, which allowed us to make the trip to the Maui Ocean Center without renting a car. The kitchen was nicely stocked with necessary cooking utensils and a grocery store is just about a 5 minute walk (as another review noted, definitely sign up for the free savings card to take advantage of additional deals).

The room was small, queen bed set sideways, kept losing pillows onto the floor during the night. the expedia rep helped organize all our activities - it worked Out as the most hassle free option as Lahaina had a lot of places offering to book trips, but they were aimed at American tourists only because most were trying sell them timeshares. They had no real incentive to offer us any reasonable deals as Non USA citizens. However, the range of our activities were great-snorkeling, horse riding on the pineapple plantation, luau,Hana road trip- all were awesome experiences. The galleries were amazing too! We loved the people and Maui totally! If we came back to Maui we would not stay in a OAN studio again. Probably pick one of the larger suites or another hotel altogether.

One of the best and easiest choices I made was choosing this hotel for myself and my groom, and any guests that cared to stay with us. Prior to this visit, we had already stayed at this hotel twice and wanted more....which has to say a lot. Approximately 30 people from our group were staying at this hotel for a couple of weeks around the wedding and everyone was impressed. Let me go over the ins and outs for you: Hotel Grounds: Beautifully maintained, great pools, and Balinese style lounging huts everywhere. BBQs were great too, as most of us would meet around dinner time and eat around the pool area. BTW, there is a large cabana at the larger pool that can be rented out for $50-100 for an evening. This was great for the 'rehearsal dinner' as we had such a large group. The hotel staff were okay with open alcohol too. Rooms: Everything you need in the kitchen, even though it might be small. Comfortable beds, which is needed after a long day of swimming/surfing. Washer and Dryer were great!!!! (My only complaint was that I rented our suite through Vacation Rental By Owner and he did not tell us that the dishwasher was not working, since you are renting directly through an owner, there is no housekeeping so we had to do all of our dishes, which really sucked around our wedding day. It would have been fine otherwise, as we paid $112 per night after taxes and everything for a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom). Location: Walking distance to many restaurants, bars, grocery stores, shops, great surfing etc... Not overly close to the great beaches, but only a 5 to 10 minute drive to some of the best. My Husband and I would usually make a lunch to go, drive to a nearby beach, then return in the late afternoon for a happy hour that we could walk to. Overall, I knew before we left this would be the perfect place for us and our guests during our destination wedding, and it didn't disappoint. Expedia seems to be the cheapest if you want daily housekeeping, otherwise book through VRBO.com because you will get the cheapest rate by far. A couple of other guests booked that way and did not have any problems, it was only us with the broken-down dishwasher.

Stumbled upon this place while researching where to stay. The price was excellent, half to a third of many places on the island, so with the excellent review this place got on Tripadvisor we went ahead and booked. We were over and above happy with our stay. Traveling with two teenagers we chose a 2 bedroom, 2 batch condon. Lots of space for everybody, modern furniture, kitchen with just about everything, flat screen tvs in every room, celing fans and aircondition in each room, beatiful bath rooms with slate tile showers. The pool areas are wonderful with lots of sun. Another wonderful thing about this place is it's location. 3 minute walk away from Front Street Lahaina with all it's wonderful restaurants, ice cream shops, souvenier shops, etc. Foodland grocery store is about a 5 minute walk away. This place truly deserves a 5 star rating, the only reason I am giving it 4 is the fact that the daily cleaning is rather sloppy. Counters in both bathroom and kitchen did not seem to be wiped clean, and whether we got clean towels was a hit and miss even when we followed the rule about putting dirty towels on floor if you wanted new ones. Also a parking fee of $15 per day was an unpleasant surprise. Would we stay here again? Absolutely. What would I do different next time? I would pack a soft collapsable cooler bag, so we could take cold drinks and snacks with us from our appartment. The kitchen comes with tupperware, so it is easy to bring along cut up fruit and other snacks for the beach. I would also pack a small bottle of olive oil and a bit of spices, since the kitchen does not contain any of that stuff other than salt and pepper. So if you like to take advantage of the appartment's kitchen for making dinner think ahead and bring a bit of that kind of stuff. The kitchen truly has just about everything for cooking, and there are great gas BBQs by the pools.

They also were not allowed to use their dive sticks. We saw many people, kids and adults alike, being reprimanded for being too loud or obnoxious, all of which seemed out of line. There are two pools, they should consider making one adult-only, and let the kids play in the other. 2. The bbq grills did not work correctly.

The concierge was very helpful and most of the front desk staff were friendly. We were able to get a late check out free of charge and the housekeeping service was quick and efficient. Being a condominium resort - there was no on site restaurant or room service, but there's a great little pasta place across the street. Parking is also available but costs $15 a night - you could try parking on the street but it looked very busy. The only thing i would recommend was to make sure you don't get a room near the pool room as it was a tad noisy.

My only complaint about the entire place is the the pillows weren't soft, but the couch pillows from the living room were perfect. I really can't find anything else to complain about, and I love to complain. The location is perfect. Just off the popular Front Street in Lahaina, and you can walk down a short alley way to the rear entrance of the Wharf Cinema Center and you come out on the south end of Front Street, right in front of Banyan Tree Park. There isn't a better place to be on the whole island in my opinion. Local Boys Shave Ice is the best we had and it's about one block south from there. They have 2 for 1 coupons on the back of Safeway receipts if you go to Safeway. The pools, grills, lounge chairs and cabanas were all 10/10 condition. The large pool was really neat- an infinity pool that's fresh water- and the area for picnicking or just watching the game near the larger pool was very posh. The full kitchen comes with everything- even tupperwear- so hit up the local grocery store and save yourself some money on breakfast and lunches. I would stay at the exact same place again if we got the same deal. The staff and entire location was epic. Tips: Park on the street. There is ample street parking and for $15/day it isn't worth the fee. We had a four door Jeep Wrangler and never had a problem finding parking. Buy laundry detergent and the like... they give you one box for free but we wore the same thing every day (suit and a tank top or swim dress) and we washed our clothes each night. The washer and dryer actually did a great job and was quiet enough to use when going to sleep. If you are into bang for your buck, go to a Timeshare at Wyndham Outrigger just three blocks north (park in the giant parking lot and they validate).

The grounds are lush, well maintained, and offer two pools and several BBQ spots. You either can rent the one or two bedroom apartments over private owners (cheaper), e.g. using vrbo.com or the Outrigger Hotel. So far I only stayed within private owner apartments and had nothing to complain about since all units are furnished the same and only \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if at all - differ in accessories. Unfortunately Outrigger started to get sloppy with the house rules over the years. The closer the weekend gets the louder your fellow vacationers and some of their kids are getting. If the worst comes to the worst you are facing overcrowded pools with high level screaming kids starting before the official pool hours or adults partying all night connecting several apartments with each other. This might be a huge issue if you are looking for a relaxing and quiet stay away from the crowds. In this case you should take a closer look into Kapalua further north from Lahaina, an upscale but very quiet and small community with rental apartments/homes along golf courses and high-class hotels. If you toy with the idea of staying in areas like Wailea, Kaanapali, Napili be aware of a gapless arrangement of overdone mega resorts and their guests. Nevertheless I still recommend my followers on travelin-mate.com to choose Aina Nalu over any other hotel or B&B on Maui. But I recommend selecting the apartment location well. Stay off the pool areas and only in the second floor, away from Wainee Street where the check-in and the street side parking is located. And finally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay the outrageous parking fees! Save the 15 bucks per night and look for free parking along Wainee Street instead. In the morning and evening after 6pm you should easily find a spot! Lahaina itself is a lovely small village with its center along Front Street and the ocean offering surf and souvenir shops, galleries, and in- and outdoor restaurants, most situated at the ocean with marvelous view towards Lanai. The only downside are the plenty \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvisitor informations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 offering cheap tours and luaus to pedestrians. Taking a closer look those kiosks turn out to be collecting pits for timeshare sales! Their offers come hours of sales meetings! Parallel to Front Street you will find two supermarkets (Foodland and Safeway) and several shopping centers with local and national designers and chains. Lahaina is only 30-40 minutes by car away from Kahului (airport), 1hr from Road to Hana and Haleakala volcano. It has much more charm than Wailea, Kanaapali, Napili and offers next to a great beginner surf-spot, the best snorkel spot on the island and several golf courses.

No, we didn't actually cook on vacation either, but to have a full kitchen for snacks and easy breakfast was perfect, not to mention a place to keep the leftovers from lunch and dinner.

Very modern & spacious, excellent air con in all rooms - but a tad noisy , overhead fans were good & quieter.

The landscaping of the grounds was excellent & gave a lush feel to the place.

There is also 3 hours free parking on Dickenson St by Lahaina Coolers bar if you get stuck mid day or early evening. so save your cash for the luau. Again from other reviews, there is a Expedia Local Expert on site most mornings, did not really find them helpful as they were trying to sell trips from their brochure rather than provide Maui information or recommend other choices/trips. I guess it is their job to be biased into selling their trips for the commission I wanted luau and reading guidebooks could not decide between Old Lahaina, Lele or Drums at the Hyatt, Expedia rep recomended Drums but from speaking to other guests went with Feast at Lele which was really great, a bit costly but good to have table service & welcome lei & free bar.

Also ate at Cheeseburger in Paradise (ok) and as ate in for 2 nights decided to splurge at the Seahouse up in Napilli Kai, 15 minutes away & wow the food, the service, the ambienece & the view by the sea was amazing.

If that is your ideal spot, this place is not for you. We were here for a week in late April. The family of 2 teenagers, husband and me. We booked a 2 bedroom, 2 bath room with garden view. Our view faced the parking lot so not sure I would decribe it as garden view but didn't want the window's open anyway. Beautiful, fragant grounds. Room was clean and nicely appointed. Ceiling fan and air conditioner in each room. Full kitchen, with refrigerator, sink, stove, microwave, dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker and blender. Most items needed for cooking your own food (except we didn't find the baking items in the drawer under the stove until after we needed it). Ice machine near both pools. No real room for eating unless you eat at the counter the seperates the kitchen from the living area. Laundry available in one bathroom. You only get one package of detergent as complimentary, All others are $1 each. They do give you extra pool towels that are not replenished during your stay so plan on doing some laundry and spring for some detergent. They never replenished items like tea or coffee or sweetener so not sure why that was, but no big deal. Location was great, right in town. Easy to walk to all the cute shops and restaurants in Old Lahaina town. Highly recommend you don't pay for parking, there is normally plenty of street parking very near by. Foodland and Safeway are both just north of here so stock up if you don't hit Costco on your way into Lahaina. Pools were very nice, they have 2. A smaller fresh water one and larger salt water one. I preferred the salt water unless I had my fill already that day at the beach. They aren't too crowded. The saltwater pool had four cabana beds and a nice lounge area with a tv. No wifi in the room but they do provide a cable to plugging in and there is wifi at each pool. If you are looking for nice relaxing place, near town and away from the big resorts.

Good- The common area pools were nice, lots of places to sit down and soak up the rays. The pool area also had a tv area that was convenient. Bad PARKING - Once you call to book your room, the front desk informs you that there is NO parking in the area and you would have to pay $15/day at the hotel to park on the grounds. This is a lie, there are plenty of spots to park around the grounds and there is even a secure parking lot across the street for only $12/day. In the parking lot on the hotel grounds that I parked in, there was only had 1 other car in a lot with about 30 stalls. WI-FI. - The hotel will say they have wi-fi. This is a lie. There is no access in your rooms and I had to sit in the front lobby to get any access. Concierge - the concierge is a expedia travel agent that tries to sell you trips, promos, and time shares. It was tough to find someone at the hotel with local knowledge that wasn't trying to sell you a time share. Very uncomfortable to have these salesmen in their office which is located at the main pool area. Rooms - Going to Maui all I wanted in a room was the necessities --- clean room, clean towels, quiet. Although the room was small, I had no problem with that. My big problem was the noise. The paper thin windows do not mask the noise from the highway behind the hotel, hotel employees breaking bottles in the morning, garbage men collecting trash at 5 am, the smell of garbage from the bins, and the constant morning wake up calls of large grounds keeping equipment backing up. A holiday can quickly be ruined by a complete lack of sleep. The most disgusting aspect was the stained sheets!!! This was unbelievable! Almost as unbelievable as the front desks unapologetic response. Whenever our concerns were brought to the staffs attention NOTHING was done, no apologies were given and no excuses were made. It was a \" tough luck \" response. I would never stay at this place again and it is not worth saving a few dollars, which if you do some comparing, is not that much.

We also found Lahaina a great location to many of the beaches we liked to go to (Kaanapali is less than 8 min away) and tours that we booked. While you do not get to stay \"on\" the beach the value you get here gives you the extra money to enjoy lots of tours/events throughout the island.

The rooms are clean and neat and the bathrooms are beautiful. In short, I couldn't find anything comparable in value that could accommodate 6 adults. The master bedroom mattress cover/protector had a gross brownish stain (coffee? or ...) on the left side of the bed, the size of two adult hands put side by side, that only became visible when we lifted the bedsheets as we were about to go to sleep. The stain did not look fresh though, but looked as though the sheets had been washed once but the strong stain remained. I called the front desk the next morning and they said they would replace the mattress cover, but when I arrived late afternoon, the maid was in the room and had already made our bed. I asked her to replace the mattress cover and she said the front desk had told her but she forgot. I wasn't too happy that our room was serviced around 4pm almost every day of the six nights we spent there, despite tipping the maid (same person every day) the first two days. Since our room was serviced late, if we arrived too early, we had to wait for new bath towels. But she did do a good job of cleaning the room (despite the mattress cover incident). The two bedroom suite we stayed in had 3 small air conditioners, one in each room (bed 1, bed 2, and living room with adjoining kitchen). All three cooled the rooms well but the one in the master bedroom was noisy. Parking at the resort was $16 per day, which I declined since parking was free on the street.

We found this option very affordable and were very impressed when arriving at the condo. It is in a great location, close to restaurants and shopping for those that like to be near the action. It's also central to a lot of great snorkeling and beaches up and down the coast. The room itself is recently remodeled and had a king size bed in the master bedroom with an attached bathroom on one side, a good sized and modern kitchen and living area in the middle, and a queen sized bed with a bedroom across from it (not attached) with a washer/dryer in the bathroom. The bathrooms are large with very nice showers. My only complaint about them is they get VERY hot and humid while showering and even with a ceiling fan and open windows it doesn't help. The problem with having the open windows is that people walking along the outdoor hallway to their rooms can hear everything as the windows are right there. There is a lot of sunlight, an air conditioner in each room and ceiling fans though which keeps the place nice and cool. The kitchen is a bit small and hard to fit more than two people but has everything you need and is very well stocked. My only other complaint about the room is that there really isn't a dining area - there are two barstools but it's hard as a family of four to sit and eat a meal together unless you go to the pool area or eat on the couch. Outside on the property are two wonderful pool areas. There is a smaller garden pool that isn't used as much with bbq's and lounge chairs. It's more shaded if you are looking for some shade and peace and quiet. There is a larger pool area with a newer pool and a large open area, covered beds and lots of lounges. It usually isn't too busy (except the day after the tsunami when everyone was there avoiding the water :-D). There is a great outdoor covered area with tables, couches and chairs to relax. We spent many mornings there reading, drinking coffee, eating breakfast and relaxing. The service was great, the rooms were always clean and everyone was very friendly. Do keep in mind that parking is 15 dollars a day - a bargain compared to prices IN Lahaina, but still an added cost. They do an \"orientation\" with some expedia representative that our parents went to and quickly realized it was just a scam to get people to sign up for the activities - they were telling people NOT to drive the road to hana (we've done it twice just fine) and take the tour bus which helicopters you back at the end etc...so if you do attend the orientation make sure you do your research before you book activities, as you may not be getting the best deal and/or tour or activity.

I must admit that I wasn't sure what to think about it as some of the reviews on Tripadvisor were not so positive. In the end we had a great experience and our families loved the condos. First of all if you travel to Maui, Lahaina is certainly a good location. It is a former whaling village and has just the right mix between tourism and local life. Aina Nalu is located within 5 minutes walking distance of the main street with restaurants and shops. The beach is very close to this as well, but unfortunately not ideal for sunbathing. There is also a Safeway and Foodland within walking distance which is perfect if you decide to cook in the room like we did. We stayed with 7 people in one condo. The condos were nicely designed and very clean. They were large enough to accomodate 7 people. We enjoyed the open shower in the 2 washrooms, the large beds, flatscreen TV as well as the \"tropical design\". The open kitchen allows for sitting around on the bar to eat. Very cosy and very well set up! Aina Nalu also has 2 excellent swimming pools and one hot tub which our family used a lot. There are nice sitting areas around the pools with free books and magazines to read. One morning we even had b'fast together in the sitting area next to the pool. The weather was great and the views over the mountains in the back are simply stunning. There is free internet access at the pool area and the central lobby in the middle of the complex. We rented one of the condo's from Aina Nalu directly and the other from a private owner. Our interaction with the staff of Aina Nalu was limited and OK (some staff were not so great but then again, it didn't bother us). The only negative point I can think of is the USD 15 dollar parking fee per day to park your car in the compound. We find this a rip-off and for the price we paid, it should have been included I think. There is parking space on the street but not easy to find and one night we were told a car was stolen right in front of the compound. We also heard of a few bikes that got stolen from the compound.

The kitchen had sufficient cooking supplies. Housekeeping was very good but at times a bit overbearing. Like they wanted us to hurry up and leave so as to clean the room at 10AM. I found the location to be good and close by to everything one would want to do in Lahaina. My main complaint however is the parking fee. Yes it is advertised but $15.00 a night for parking in a lot that barely had any cars in it when resorts of much higher caliber aren't charging for parking is a bit over the top. Renting a car is the only way to really see all of Maui and enjoy your trip. Just budget in the extra 15.00 a day for parking.

We weren't quite sure when we booked it as we thought is to far from the beach but the location turned out to be perfect. As we were honeymooners they have upgraded us with no charge and we had a very nice room. King size bed in the bedroom, 1 spacious living room including a kitchen with everything in it ( incl.dishwasher, kettle, etc ) and we had every day tea and coffee from the hotel. As is not directly as the main street the place is very quiet. It took 5-7 mins walk to the Front street where most of the restaurants, shops, etc are located. What I loved about the place the most are the 2 swimming pools. One smaller with 10-12 sunbeds and bbq places and one bigger. At the small one there were max. 4 people at a time which was great and most of the time you could be alone in the pool. As the beach is not so close ( there arent great beaches in Lahaina ) is great to have good pools. We had to travel 30 mins by bus to get to the nicest beach which is Kanapali. Nice sand but no sunbeds so as the winds are strong the sand is all over you. I recommend to take a helicopter tour with Alex Tours - they were great taking us on the East side of Maui for a 45-50 mins tour above the road to Hana and the crater Halleakala.Great trip for 80USD / each. Also we enjoyed the snorkeling trip on Quicksilver up to Molokai. Nice fish and great crew. Was a nice holiday but is a place to relax not to party.

There is no dinner tables in the apartments. We were there for a wedding and we gathered by the smaller pool for a BBQ dinner. Since there was about 50 of us near the small pool, hogging up the BBQ grilles I know the people with their apartment around the pools can hear the many conversations and laughs. That pool does close at 9pm. But the back bigger pool closes at 10pm. The bigger pool has a black bottom and is design where the ripples of water do not get big creating a calm unique pool. There are bed cabanas around both pools, something like a Vegas pool would have. You can walk to Front street where the only real action at night is Moose's. Remember this is not Waikiki so they don't party all night. There is a snorkle bob's right across the street.

Pick up a cheap styro cooler, fill it up, load your chairs and umbrella and head to any beach within minutes. We drove the entire island starting and stopping at as many beaches as we could. Our favorite was right in Lahaina, Baby Beach. Just a 2 minute drive up Front Street (where there is every type of eating and shopping you may want). Front street is a one block walk from Aina Nalu. We walked to Front Street every night for the sunset and nightlife fun and activity. Very safe anytime of day or night. Now the one big problem we have with the Aina Nalu....parking is $15.00 per day. Ridiculous to have to pay that price on top of your room rental price. Yes you can park on the street, which we did for 3 nights. But on the fourth night and for the rest of our stay we rode up and down the streets for about half an hour until we finally gave in and stopped at the desk lobby and got a parking pass for what we thought was the night only. NOT SO....once you purchase your parking pass you pay for the entire balance of your stay at Aina Nalu. So don't purchase a parking pass at checkin. You might be lucky enough to find a street parking spot that night. If you have to park in the Aina Nalu parking lots, wait until you absolutely have to because you pay $15.00 per night from that day on until the end of your stay.

The friend decided on this hotel due to the presence of a kitchen, as they have a small child and felt this would be more convenient than a traditional hotel room. At first I was very skeptical of the location and wanted to stay at a hotel on the beach. I could not have been more wrong. I absolutely LOVED our stay at this hotel. It was within easy walking distance to all of the great restaurants/bars and shops of Lahaina. It was a very close location to Safeway, where we could buy food/beers/etc. and relax in the hotel/pool rather than going out to eat all of the time. We were upgraded at checkin to a room with a kitchen (apparently the one we originally paid for did not have this) and I would definitely pay the extra money to have the room with a full kitchen and living area. This was more of an apartment than a hotel and very comfortable. Had a great tv in the living area. The pool area is fantastic, very relaxing and well kept. While not near the beach, I didn't miss it at all. The pool area was much more comfortable and relaxing. I do have a couple of criticisms: One, you have to \"check out\" pool towels, which I found to be inconvenient and irritating. The other being that the main pool does not have a BBQ facility. The smaller pool has to BBQs, but none at the big pool. I think it would be much nicer if the main pool had a couple of BBQ's as well. One night we were there, there was a line for the BBQ's. The hotel also charges $15/day for parking which I wasn't thrilled about. You can park for $5 down the road - it's just quick walk. This is a lot of $ for parking considering the lot is completely empty. i suppose they have to charge since the lots nearby charge. They also charge for internet usage which isn't the greatest.

The location is very good as Lahaina is the jumping off point for most of the activities on Maui and Aina Nalu is just 2 short blocks from Front Street.

Parking is $15/day. I have seen others saying don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay and park on the street. No way, parking is big business in Lahaina and chances of finding free parking everyday is zero.

We found the prices ok if you use their club card which we was definitely worth the 30 seconds required to fill out the form.

We were given a two-bedroom, two-bath upstairs unit away from the highway construction noise on the opposite side of the complex. Check in was easy and we experienced no \"attitute\" from the front desk agent whatsoever. And no ants, either. The condo was hot and stuffy when we arrived but after turning on the two bedroom air conditioning units, all had cooled off within a half hour. The positives: -- Great location two blocks from Front Street in Lahaina. Just a quick walk to the ABC Store for odds and ends in the Wharf Shopping Center across from the banyan tree. -- Next door to a Catholic church from the 1860s. We went to Mass Sunday morning and it was a wonderful experience with the local choir and all windows open, scents of all the fragrant flowers outside filling the air inside. Delicious Hawaiian sweet bread sold outside the church after the service as a fundraiser. -- Great pool at a perfect temperature. Not overly crowded and was always able to find a lounge chair when needed. Only used the infinity pool. Did not venture over to the kidney-shaped pool. The negatives: -- No dining table for four people. We like to play cards and weren't able to as there was no table. -- I was kicked out of the pool for using a floatie. I hate lying out and just baking in the sun. C'mon....there was only me, a young father and his son in the pool. And it's a big pool. Beware the private cabanas, however. First day at the pool we settled into one and within an hour, I was covered in bug bites. Was bitten while sitting in the pool pavillion, as well. I should have brought bug repellent and they need to spray! Would we stay here again? In a heartbeat. The Aina Nalu has a lot of bang for the buck. The beds were incredibly comfy, the grounds are beautiful (especially the fan palms) and its location can't be beat. Don't miss the Warren and Annabelle show at 900 Front St. I treated hubby and our friends (I'd seen it before and knew how special it was) and we all laughed so hard our sides hurt for two days!

I was slightly obsessed with ensuring this trip would be perfect...i read every review hoping to be sure I made the best decision. I have to say that my husband is sort of a resort snob, he comes from a family that took lavish vacations at all the best resorts...my family took road trips. I was sort of worried that this wouldn't meet his expectations, even though it fit the budget. I purchased five nights at Aina Nalu and three nights at Honua Kai, one of the newest resorts on the island. Aina Nalu far exceeded both of our expectations, we booked through the amazing team at Chase'n Rainbows, ask for Jill she is the best. We stayed in D208, this is a two bedroom unit and is on the top floor, pick one of these rooms if you are concerned about the room being dark, I saw that on a lot of previous reviews, the top floor has high ceilings with extra windows. First off you notice all the modern finishes, then you notice how SUPER clean the place is. Our unit was close to the \"adult\" pool. We were able to pick up free wifi from the small porch which had a view of the pool. Noise wasn't an issue, the unit was quiet well before the ten o'clock limit. We can't say enough about this place, the front desk staff we great and the unit is so close to everything. Honua Kai was a huge disappointment for all the hype, the front desk was rude and we were often reminded that because we booked through a private owner we were not able to use many of the amenities the resort offers. Aina Nalu was quite the opposite, my husband even found himself missing the unit. For our last three days in Maui we found ourselves wishing we were back at Aina Nalu. My three tips: 1. Get a top floor unit and stay at Aina Nalu for your ENTIRE stay! 2. Pay for parking it IS worth it 3.

We were given an upstairs, one bedroom unit that had a view of Pu'u Kukui, the top of the West Maui Mountains, that I never got tired of. The hotel was quiet, a hidden gem, even though it's only 2 blocks from busy Front St. One exception was in the morning when we had some noise from the highway. We hung out around the pools and in the hot tub before and after our adventures and met numerous friendly guests. So much to do there. It's 3 blocks from the wharf for ocean excursions (we went sailing on the America II racing sloop!). On Friday's it's the Lahaina Artwalk with mindblowing arts and crafts.

The book-in was swift and the young male clerk was cheerful and pleasant. I queried our placement, as I didn't want a room adjacent to the highway (a bit noisy). Our room was a ground level, 2 bedroom apartment, perfectly placed at the far end of the block adjacent to reception and opening to the front car park. We backed the minivan up to the lounge room doors and unloaded our luggage in seconds. The room a/c was already on and the room was nice and cool for our arrival. This was really appreciated, because none of us had slept in over 18 hours, having flown direct from Australia overnight, then bouncing direct to Maui. We quickly checked out the apartment. Kitchen was well appointed with large oven, microwave, large fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker, blender, and the usual compliment of pots, pans, plates, etc. Dishwashing powder and detergent were also supplied. The 3 ice trays were filled and chucked in the freezer. I lurve ice... There is no dining table, but there are 4 comfy stools onto a big breakfast bar. All the bench tops were finished in black granite and the appliances were black & stainless steel. The lounge room featured a 3 seater lounge, plus a separate lounge chair and a large coffee table. There was also a large entertainment unit with a big LCD TV, DVD, etc. A wall a/c unit was fitted in the lounge room wall facing the carpark. We gave the king bed room (with ensuite) to our friends (he's about 6'4\") and they were overjoyed. Our queen bed room was also roomy & comfortable, with both rooms having plenty of storage. Our room had no ensuite, but the door for the combined bath/laundry room was adjacent to ours. Both rooms featured large louvre windows opening onto the carpark area, but shielded by palms & ginger plants. I don't think that these windows offer much of a barrier to thieves, but we had no security issues at all during our stay. Security guards also patrol the site constantly, which is reassuring. Both the bath/laundry & the ensuite featured no exhaust fans, which meant that the louvre windows in these rooms needed to be opened directly onto to the walkway to the apartment entrances. Poor design here. Obvious embarrassment at certain times, if you get my drift. Plenty of towels, face washers, etc are supplied and are changed daily, if required. The usual compliment of soaps, shampoos and salves is supplied to keep any femme happy. The showers are lined in slate tiles and have no screen or curtain. This is no problem for overspray, because the shower are very large. Expect a long wait for hot water, first thing in the morning. Both bedrooms featured LCD TVs, with the king room having a larger unit, with remote. No remote for the 2nd bedroom TV. Both bedrooms also featured fans and a/c units. The a/c was very noisy when cycling on/off in our bedroom at night, so we opted to just open the louvre windows. This was okay, until one night when an early morning departer (3am) accidentally activated his car alarm outside or window, when loading his luggage. His children then decided to drag the rest of the suitcases down the outside wooden staircase adjacent to our room. Clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, etc, then the family all had a loud discussion about their departure under our window. Some people should really come with a fist-activated on/off switch, conveniently situated between their eyes. I sighed and just ignored it for a change. The laundry was a combined top loader washer, with an above dryer. Both worked well and there was a packet of laundry power supplied for a single load. Do note that there is no extra powder for sale anymore at the Aina Nalu, but the ABC stores in Front Street do sell small packets. There are 2 pools and a spa onsite. The smaller pool is directly behind reception and has a large paved surround. There is also a few s/steel BBQs for use here. The larger pool is to the rear of the property and is surrounded by a big lawn area. It is an \"infinity\" style, with no raised walkway. Very nice style, but the lawn area at the entry/exit does get a bit boggy. The square spa is heated and the pump switch is located near the outside shower, some distance from the spa. The area around the large pool and spa also features a few covered daybeds. There is also a large open building with a huge wall mounted TV and several lounges for relaxation. There is plenty of car parking onsite, but they do charge $11 per day. You could park offsite, but I'm sure the local neighbours would not appreciate the extra road congestion as the back streets are very narrow around Lahaina. In summary, I have tried to outline what our apartment & the surrounding property offered us. I have nothing to gain by writing a \"glowing report\", but we've now stayed here 3 times and all have resulted in a great experience. I do see that several people have posted reviews that outline their problems in staying here. This is no 5 star property by any means, so please don't expect it. Although not on the waterfront, the Aina Nalu is a comfortable and convenient option for accommodation. for entertainment, it's only a 2 minute stroll to Front Street through the Wharf Cinema Centre (which has a good bar). The walk itself is very nice, as it passes under many trees laden with frangipani, mangoes, jackfruit, etc. At about $200 per night for a comfortable 2 bedroom apartment, we find that it suits us well.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cgood value but don't rent from owner\u201d", "Author": "thecarsons", "ReviewID": "UR61162478", "Content": "The Aina Nalu was a good place to stay, but we didn't get any housekeeping for 2 weeks.

The unit was tastefully, if minimally, decorated with modern furniture and appliances. There was a flat screen TV in the living room and both bedrooms. My only complaint is minor -- they could use more dresser drawer space, particularly in the 2nd bedroom (I hate living out of suitcases). We had in-unit laundry, which we used a great deal. Note, however that every unit is likely furnished differently due to the time-share nature of the resort. Expect a bit of a crap shoot. The service was very good (remembering that this is a condo, not a hotel). All public areas and the rooms were cleaned daily. The staff was helpful and polite (albeit some friendlier than others) with any requests we made. The unit will be stocked with a single days' dishwasher and laundry detergent packages, with the expectation that you will go out and buy your own when you get your groceries. But if you ask nicely they will likely give you an extra day or two so you don't have to run out right away. I recommend utilizing the services of the Expedia booking agent in the booth by the large pool. Much better experience than dealing with one of the booths on Front Street and they do have a small Ainu Nalu guest discount on most things. The bedroom air conditioner was a bit noisy. Suggest only running the one in the living room when sleeping. Parking at the complex was pricey (about $110 for a week). Some reviewers have suggested street parking as an alternative, but I'm glad I didn't go for that option. The street spots for blocks around were full at all hours of the day. I have better things to do on my vacation than hunt for parking :-) Don't expect any special instructions passed through your travel agency to actually get to the resort staff. I didn't have any but overheard another guest getting cross at the front desk staff about her special written instructions (which exceeded what any unit had available) not being heeded. If you have special requests, I would recommend calling the resort directly beforehand. They were pleasant and as helpful as possible whenever I asked anything. The location was excellent for my needs. You will be driving in Maui if you want to visit most locations, but being a couple blocks from downtown Lahaina meant that a walking was an option for many of the attractions (e.g. submarine and other tours from wharf), a variety restaurants, art galleries, etc. Note that while Keiki (\"Baby\") beach is a good 15-20 minute walk at the other end of town, you will need a car to drive to any of the other beaches (e.g. ones with more surf or snorkelling potential). One of the best beaches on the island is at Ka'anpali, is a ten minute drive north. Being able to barbecue while watching over the kids having a swim to cool down at the end of the day was great. Our unit was right beside the small pool, which meant it was also furthest from the highway (note: almost every form of accommodation in Maui is effectively near the highway, since the highway is near the beach). Units closer to the highway may hear some road noise when they have the windows open. However, walking around that side of the building even at high traffic times of the day did not seem excessively noisy. I couldn't hear the highway over the moderate splashing noises coming from the big pool during the day. There is free WiFi beside the pools. It is not fast but it works. It is very short range. You basically need to be in one of the lounge chairs or you are SOL on signal. You can get paid WiFi in your room. I don't know if its speed is better than the pool WiFi as I decided to live without it. Groceries are expensive in West Maui.

She was disinterested, unhelpful and unfriendly.

I then had the temerity to enquire whether my room was a Garden View room as booked \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All our rooms are Garden View rooms!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she spat.

As for the parking charges, yes they are steep and irritating, but parking isn't always easy on the very busy and narrow streets, so it is a small price to pay. If they didn't charge, no doubt the rates would rise! All in all, it was a great place to stay and explore Maui, I would certainly go again, but my rating reflects the intermittent quality of reception, they were generally better than xyz, but not always and she was there to see me off the premises when I left, her usual surly and 'irritated at the inconvenience of it all' self.

The grounds are well kept and very nice. Unfortuately on arrival we were told that there would be a $15 a day parking charge. We had to accept this as there was no road space that we were lucky enough to find for parking off site. We checked in quickly enough were give 2 keys and directions to our 2nd floor room but no offer of help with our luggage. We had some problems with the key cards and it would take several attempts for the card to work. The room however was a good size and the appliances were great. However, the pull out bed was the worse I've ever slept on. The following morning I checked with reception to see if there was another room or a chance to be upgraded to a 2 bed room and pay extra but were told that the hotel was fully booked. (depending who was on at reception depended on how helpful and how much assistance you got). I then tried ringing housekeeping to see if there was any chance of getting a mattress topper and some extra pillows as there were on 3 in the condo. At 3.30pm as no-one had arrived I rang back through to housekeeping who had no record of my request but said they would send someone along to check the sofa bed. Within 10minutes someone called, I showed them the poor mattress with the springs sticking through and was told that it would be sorted. We were on our way out then but I was assured that it would be dealt with before my return. On returning to our condo I fould that they had left an extra blanket which I then had to put on top of the mattress as well as taking the bed topper of the queen bed and again used that on top of the mattress. Although this helped slightly it was not ideal and would never go back to this hotel unless were able to get a 2 bed room. The other problem was that the air conditioning unit in the living room did not work and although the fan was on this only seemed to move warm air around and did not cool the room. And finally the pools were great but number of sun loungers around the pool for the number of holiday makers were just not sufficient, and if you were lucky enough to get a bed, some of the toppers were a bit worse for wear.

The grounds are beautiful, the rooms are clean, modern and well-equipped, and we left with only the smallest of complaints--which I will get out of the way first: 1. $15 per day for parking on the lot was ridiculous. We paid it because I went with my grandmother and we couldn't do too much walking, but I did so begrudgingly. TIP: there is some free street parking in front of the resort, but if you go during a busy time of year like we did (Christmas) it is always packed. 2. Our condo was a 1 bedroom with a pull-out couch in the living room. Nana took the bedroom and I took the couch. It took me 3 days of sleeping on THE MOST uncomfortable sofa bed I've ever experienced to realize I'd be more comfy sleeping on the couch without the bed pulled out. TIP: If you require separate beds, pay for an extra room. Otherwise, let the shortest person sleep on the couch and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD don't pull the bed out of it. 3. There are roosters & chickens walking around everywhere (no fault of Outrigger's, of course) and because there are multiple males, they crow at inappropriate times (read: 2am when you're trying to sleep). TIP: Bring ear plugs and you won't hear them at all! THE GOOD STUFF: 1. The kitchen is very well-equipped with pretty much everything you will need, right down to measuring spoons! Dishwasher, garbage disposal in sink (for organics), salt/pepper grinders, toaster, kettle, coffee maker, etc. TIP: Don't use the hotel-sized coffee provided because it is gross. Go to the grocery store and buy KONA coffee because it is uber-delish. 2. You have a washer and dryer in the bathroom so you don't have to bring dirty clothes home! TIP: Leave a note for the maid asking for extra detergent or just go buy some, because they won't restock unless you ask. 3. The A/C worked well, everything was clean, and the maid always tidied up well. The condos are excellent, but you cannot smoke anywhere (not even on the balcony) except 2 designated areas on the grounds. TIP: If you're a smoker, ask for a room near \"a smoking area\". 4. If you're able-bodied, most of Lahaina (thus, all the amenities you might need) is within walking distance, including the grocery store. TIP: Before you make your first purchase, ask for a discount card (it's like a Safeway card). 5. The pools are lovely - well designed and set in beautiful atmospheres - and even during the busy season I had no trouble getting a lounger by the pool or even a cassita. However, the larger pool tends to be noisier (kids) so if you're looking for quiet, the small pool GENERALLY tends to be the place to go. NOTE TO OUTRIGGER: you should make the small pool ADULTS ONLY! TIP: The Expedia rep and hot tub are located near the large pool, while the BBQs are located by the small one. Free wi-fi access near pools and in lobby. I don't know what else I could say about this wonderful condo-resort other than, since everything in Hawaii seems to be around 20-50% more expensive than anywhere else in the US, staying in a place with a full kitchen is an excellent way to save some money (purchasing groceries VS eating out every meal).

We are from the oregon coast, and pretty laid back, don't like dressing up to much, and my mom LOVES to walk on the beach. This trip we have stayed at the Ala Moana (oahu) and the Westin as well as the Aina Nalu. I would Choose the Aina Nalu everytime, and wished we could have stayed there the entire trip (actually i am currently in the guest bedroom of the Westin and am longing for the days in Aina Nalu) We Stayed in H108, and booked through a private party, the owner, rather than the company, so i can't tell you much about that. It seemed a very good price, and the moment dad and i walked in we both commented on how we could live there. The Building was a little difficult to find, but once we asked directions it was no problem what-so-ever. I must warn you, parking is not free, rather $15 a day, but we just parked on the street, as did many others for free. This condo had 2 bedrooms, 1 bath with an AWESOME new slate/granite bathroom, 3 t.v's, 2 ipod docs/speakers/radios. A Full Kitchen (i am a culinary student, and the kitchen even suited me) that came stocked with oil, salt, pepper, coffee, coffee filters, Herbs... all the things you will want a little of, but can't buy in that small of amounts. the bedrooms were comfy, with TONS of pillows, a washer and dryer (No Detergant though!) The only thing i could prefer was a dresser set, or at least shelves in the Smaller bedroom, since i had to stack my clothing on the floor when un packing. There is also no AC in this room, so it gets a little...warm. But there is AC in the other bedroom and living room, so if you keep the door open you are fine. The Carpets are BRAND new, as is everything else. The Condo is furnished in a very casual, comfy way, not tacky, but still adding in the little hawaiian touches here and there. So only things i would add are: Laundry Detergant (at least a trial pack), shelves in the guest bed, and internet in the room. Free wifi at the pools/office but not in room. The Grounds are cared for great, the pools are nice (i warn thee with small children, the smaller pools depth is NOT correct. When it said 5' I couldn't touch on my toes (in 5'5) The bigger pool is great for laps, but is the same depth all around. They have more than enough chairs and bed-type lounge huts. Cabana is available with internet hook ups and wifi, lounge chairs, bar-b-q... also, another thing on the side, I forgot my cellphone on Oahu, and had it shipped here. B/c the owner had rejected all resort amenities, they said they would refuse the package. I spent every day for 4 days waiting in the lobby for a few hours for the mail to show up. and the day that it did show up (i could only recieve it if i was waiting for it, else they would send it back) she accepted everything and the guy left without her even looking at the package... but oh well, she was nice enough. Great location to! 1 block off front street and the ocean, a couple blocks from a food store...

It was our first time, so we had a hard time deciding which island and then which hotel. With a 9 mo. old, I was also doing a lot of the searching between naps, etc. Because of my lack of attention when doing some of the searches, we were surprised by a couple of things... 1 - Lahaina is mostly a rocky sea wall with a cute street with TONS of shops and some restaurants along the way. Sort of a cute 'old beach town' feel. I thought it had the most locals hanging around or living there, vs. the feeling I had in Wailea, Napili, etc. We never went to Hana though. It's not where I would consider telling a friend who loves to stay in big hotels on the beach. It's charming, probably has a decent nightlife (the shops were certainly open until at least 8pm), and is great for people with families who need variety each day. Or if you simply dont care about staying on the beach, then this might also be for you! 2 - The hotel rooms are awesome! We were upgraded, I dont think the hotel was very booked, to a 2 bedroom suite (H-207) which had great decor (modern island style wooden furniture and ceiling fans, with old black and white surfing pictures on the walls) and great amenities. Everything was very clean. The only thing I would say about the rooms, since there is a kitchen that most people expect to use... bring ziploc sacks!! It's a tropical climate, so bugs are not uncommon, but all we ever saw were tiny ants. I am impressed that the hotel can keep everything else at bay. The tiny ants were only a problem, and they would definitely come in masses, if you left food out or didn't clean up properly after fixing a meal. If you have food you want to open but not use entirely, keep it in a ziploc sack. Or stick it in your fridge. The other place the ants will be happy, your dirty laundry. Since the units (at least ours did) come with a washer/dryer (they give you one wash worth of detergent complimentary, was very nice!), fill the washer up half way with water and keep your dirty clothes in there. The room was great for fixing meals for our son and keeping snacks, drinks, etc. Beds were comfortable, the rooms were large, and the bathroom was done really well with stone tiles. We were very happy with our room! Remember though, it will NOT be on the beach. It's not even on the water, it's about 2 blocks away. But we didn't find that to be a problem, just a surprise. My lack of attention to detail was a bit of a shock - it's what babies do to you. The 2 hotel pools are both nice, never overly crowded, and clean. The onsite expedia experts, who you're directed to, when you have to-do questions were always nice, although they try to sell you their packages. Just keep them on track with what you want (snorkel beaches you can drive to, places to go hiking, etc), and it worked out fine for us. 3 - The hotel does not have a restaurant! But, should have figured that one with the fact that all the rooms have kitchens. Restaurants are as close as a block away though. 4 - I think this is true of almost all the hotels, but parking costs $15 per day. If you are lucky or early in the morning, you may find a parking spot on the street outside the hotel. But it was pretty crowded and would be a hassle to find each day you use the car. Also important, we had free wifi in our room. Not sure if it was from the hotel though... they said they only had free wifi at the pools and in the lobby, so who knows. Supposedly, they had dial-up in the rooms for a fee. Places we recommend to eat: Pasta Penne (only a block from the hotel, and not very impressive to look at, but VERY good - they also own the famous maui tacos) and Maui Tacos in Lahaina (Kimos has a great deck to eat at or have drinks, and the food was OK), Mamas Fish House in Paia Hope you enjoy Lahaina as much as we did!

The location is excellent as we had little traffic nosie and yet we were able to walk down to the local shops and night life. The attraction discounters are located around the downtown area. Several of them had excellent deals on the touristy items like snorkel adventures and helicopter rides. The room we rented had a well stocked kitchen, but after the long days of adventure and shopping, it was hard not to walk around the corner and take advantage of the local cuisine and the many restaurants in the area. We also found that walking around the area gave us a taste of the local life. The resort is located in a neighborhood area that we found attractive and interesting. Overall, we found the resort to be an excellent value. The office was helpful and friendly and the housekeeping was well done and the room was kept clean and well stocked.

We had two adults, three teens, and one youth, and we all found this a very comfortable stay except when we all tried to find a spot to eat breakfast. Check in was easy. Automatically upgraded our stay to a two bedroom/two bathroom. One thing that we did not like is they supply you with pool towels for each member of your party...great, but not when you are responsible for returning them...if they are not returned you will incur $25.00 per towel. One of ours was taken by housecleaning and it was a run-around to get this taken care of. Room service was ok. Usually our room was taken care of; one day we received no service. On other days all items were not replenished like the coffee, sugar, and empty shampoo/soap were not disposed of. Other days our recyclables (worth bottle exchange $$) we had on the counter were taken, but the garbage under the sink was overflowing! Having only 1 frying pan in the condos made it interesting to prepare breakfast for six people. BBQ's are nice featured by the pool area, but be prepared to wait your turn and they tend to cook slowly. Pools were very nice. They have one chlorine pool and one with salt water. Both were very pleasant, but should stay open a little later at night...they close at 9 & 10. One hot tub that gets extremely hot....can hold around 14. We had the unpleasant experience of a group of 6-10 young adults that arrived a few nights before we left. I could not understand why the facility allowed obnoxious behavior to continue. Beer was poured in the hot tub (making them have to close it not only 1 night, but two nights because of this group)...beer bottles were allowed at the pool area where bottle caps were in the pool (one of my family members actually stepped on one and split open his foot because of this). To top off this, the same party was having sex in the women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restroom stall at the pools!! I could not believe this because ALL of the people at the Aina Nalu were family oriented and these people had NO concern for the children around, or the adults using these facilities. Complaints were made at the time, and at check out but the front desk lady said \"wow, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m surprised I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear anything about this.\" She did apologize. Besides this group, the facilities are nicely situated by town....restaurants, grocery stores, and main attractions in town. Town is literally two blocks away, but without the noise or traffic one would imagine. If you have the chance, walk to town; although parking for available for free. Although we were upgraded on our arrival, we had a bottom floor. This was nice for loading/unloading our baggage. However, we were unfortunate to get someone above us that were either 500 pounds, or walked like they were. It was no issue early in the morning/afternoon, but at two in the morning it was an issue. One night I called the front desk to complain and they took care of it right away...calling the other room. However, each night the same thing occurred so we just slept with the AC on low/medium so it would block the noise from above! Ice machines are hidden. There are two, one by each pool. Rooms were comfortable, and the grounds were beautiful. People, except previous group, were very nice and pleasant. It was confusing if this was a smoke-free property...or just no smoking in your room. When we first arrived NO one smoked until the previous group arrived. Then, smoking was taking place at the pool area....cigarettes, cigars, and ???? I was attracted to the non-smoking facility and they make sure all guests know that there is a $300 fee for smoking, but this obviously was / is not enforced....which is too bad, because it was nice to walk to beautiful grounds with out cigarette butts everywhere! Rooms/bathrooms were beautiful, but little water pressure. I would probably stay here again but NEVER pay $15 for parking again! This should be complimentary for guests. Safe in room was nice.

I don't believe there are any other hotels this nice that are close to downtown: Positives: Walkable to Downtown Remodeled rooms: stone showers, full kitchen (skip the studio - its too small) Black bottom pool Negatives: No Hawaiian front desk hospitality Road noise (there is a TON of this that ruins the vacation feel) Parking fee of $15/day - they have more than enough room to give you free parking Maze layout - took 2 days to confidently find room. Not very many amenities Some rooms are better than others. Upon check in, they put us in a room with a bad layout and tiny tv. Only when we asked to switch, did they bump us to a better room. After traveling to the other islands, Maui is not very authentic. You see less locals here than on any other island. If you want the true Hawaiian feel, go to the Big Island or Kauai. As for the Aina Nalu, I'd skip it unless you get an outstanding deal. The road noise and annoyances are too much to bear on a vacation.

Front Street is where the bars, restaurants and shops are all located. We arrived with a large suitcase each since we were in Hawaii for over 2 weeks. Be aware that this place does not have a lift / elevator. Although rooms are only on the ground floor and 1st floor it was still a pain to have to get up one flight of stairs with bags. No assistance was offered. The rooms are very impressive. They have two tv's, separate bedroom and lounge / kitchenette. The kitchen is nice and modern. Unfortunately our garden view was of the car park. One member of staff was very surly and unhelpful on a couple of occasions. One further problem to report is that we asked for a late check out 2 days prior to our departure. We were told that the late check out could not be arranged until the morning of departure. We specifically asked 2 days prior to depature since we were faced with a 25 hour journey home and an evening flight. Clearly the late departure was important to us so we asked again the day before departure. We were again told that we should check on the morning of departure and that the charge would be $75 up to 3pm and $100 thereafter. No problem with the charge. So, we called on the morning of departure to be told that we could not have a late check out and that we had to be out of the room by noon. This meant we had to pack in a rush and check out of the room quickly. What annoyed us was that the staff should have said to us that it was unlikely our late check out would be possible, but that it wouldnt be known until the morning to leave. They should have been able to put a percentage on it. Why couldnt they say the evening before \"probably not\"? In that case we would have packed the night before. There was no shower room that we could use, so we have to spend a day in the sun by the pool and then use the outdoor shower in the early evening, get changed in the restroom and then go to the airport. Not an ideal way to spend the final day. This is the first time i have experienced such problems with late check out or lack of facilities for those who have checked out.

We had a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom condo (unit# I-204). Checkin was smooth, but key cards did not work when we first tried. Had to drive back to the reception to get help. They re-keyed the cards and sent a security guard to help out. This time the cards worked. The condo was clean and well setup. BUT IT WAS VERY HOT when we entered. The air-conditioning must have been turned off all day. It was literally melting. We sat in the heat for 2-3 hours before the AC's had some effect. It was a pathetic way to enter a new condo. The condo has very new interiors, well maintained and very modern, which was nice. Bedrooms have nice beds, and flat screen TVs. There is an AC in each room so that really helped during hot Maui days. The bathrooms are nice and pretty modern. There is a fan in the bathroom but no vent (???) Although the condo is nice overall, I have some complaints which really made a difference for us. - The living room is really small. There is one smallish sofa that can squeeze 3 people and 1 chair. There are 2 bar stools but they are not comfortable if you want to sit for long (say to watch a movie). So we improvised by moving the center table to one corner and 2 of us would sit on the floor all the time with blankets and pillows for comfort. - The TV in the living room was an old 17\" CRT box (wow, we still have those around?). But the wierd part was that such a small TV was kept in a HUGE entertainment center (the box with doors style entertainment center). Why would you keep such a small TV in such a large enclosure when there is clearly lack of space in the living room. The TV could have been kept on s smaller corner stand and more room or sitting space can be made. This was pretty stupid to me. Same problem in both bedrooms. Small tv's in HUGE entertainment center furniture that took up half the room space for no obvious benefit. - The cabinets in the kitchen were awkwardly placed at very high levels. We are average height people (about 5'4\" - 6'0\" range). None of us could reach the highest cabinet without actually climbing on the kitchen platform. Duh??? Whoever designed this kitchen wasnt thinking straight. - The fan/light in the living room were so high up (we had vaulted ceilings) that none of us could reach it. We never turned it on/off for that reason. - The side tables in the bedroom had a lid like top that opened up. But there was a HUGE lamp and alarm clock on top, so how did they intend for us to use these side tables? Did they think we would actually move the lamp out, open the side table top? Again this was an architectural marvel for me :p In short, bad layout and utility of the space in the apartment. Space could have been reconfigured for a dining table and more seating in the living room. - The dishwasher was really small (to save space) so that was good - The bathrooms were HUGE, with so much space to pamper yourself. But I would have much preferred that Overall, I would semi-recommend this condo for a smaller group (4 max), but definitely not for 6 people (even though it can sleep 6).

The condo is amazing very clean, simple, and typically hawaiian. i was in the 2 bed 2 bath which was well proportioned. Its nothing overwhelming fancy just very homely and relaxing.

Like most people i read the reviews for the resort and there are some critisims, however i have to say the pictures are accurate and it is actually a nice resort. My only critisism is the fact that you ahve to pay $15 per day for parking, however i just parked outside on the street and it was totally fine.

Property appears to have recently been renovated. Our unit was a studio and had a nice kitchenette area. Unit had a bit of a musty smell & a window-type A/C unit that was noisy- neither of which was unbearable. The downside: our unit (F101) was at the back of the property by the dumpsters (allowing us a daily view of the dumpster divers) and the highway (noisey!!). The studio units are narrow, so to accomodiate the bed they use king size headboards and put queen size beds on the \"longways.\" To sleep on the bed in the correct orientation, one of us would have had to sleep \"longways\" up against the head board. We opted to have our heads at the headboard, which meant our feet dangled over the end. Because of a table in the room, this was the only way the beds would fit into the room. After one sleepless night, I went to the front desk & asked to be moved. The clerk refused & said that all studio rooms were this way; to move me would require an upgrade (at my expense). She went further to state that had I paid for a 1 bedroom she would upgrade me to a 2 bedroom at no cost; but could not upgrade me to anything as I only paid for a studio. When I pointed out that the property was not anywhere near capacity (parking lot was very empty & there were not many people around) she again refused.

When we checked in we were hungry so we did some light unpacking, then headed into town for dinner. When we came back to the room it was dark, and upon turning on the lights we saw dozens and dozens of cockroaches scurrying through the kitchen - on the counters, in the sink - EVERYWHERE. Note that we hadn't stored or made any food in the kitchen to attract the bugs, it was simply infested! I called the front office, and they responded by sending a man with a can of Raid. He began spraying the Raid all over the kitchen counter, in and under the sinks, etc. I didn't think this was an adequate response (spraying Raid on the kitchen counters didn't seem very effective, appetizing or safe!) So I called the front desk and told them this was not acceptable. We were told to come pick up keys for 3 other rooms and pick a different room. We looked at the other rooms and found no cockroaches, so we moved. Management didn't seem to care about our situation very much. No one helped us move our luggage, and we never got an apology. All of the rooms did have small ants, but I won't hold that against the resort (plenty of other things to hold against them). We saw those ants everywhere in Lahaina. Just gotta deal with them. While the rooms were decorated prettily, they were dark, dingy and smelled very musty. Unlike the other resorts that we stayed at on the other islands, there was no lanai. Not a place in which you'd want to spend much time. Another issue - the $15/day parking charge. This was the only place that charged an additional parking charge (even on Oahu we didn't pay add'l parking), seems like a ripoff. When we got home from the trip I got an email from the resort, claiming that we broke a refrigerator shelf. The e-mail said they were going to charge my credit card $50, possibly more depending on the final bill. I e-mailed the woman right back, saying that I disputed the charge. Quite frankly, we were so grossed out by the cockroaches in the first room that we were hesitant to use the kitchen or any appliances. We ate out every meal! The woman never responded to my e-mail, and they put a $50 charge on my credit card. I'm disputing it now. The only thing we did enjoy was the pool.

As we went to find our apartment, (Number H210 - \"Cell Block H - 2nd Landing\" LOL) we formed the impression of being marched along a prison landing - albeit with tastefully planted tropical flora and artistic fountains and hand carved ornaments every now and then! However, the apartment was nothing like a prison, I have to say. We booked a two-bedroomed (2 X Double Bed) garden view suite for the three of us. The apartment was well-equipped and spacious with a kitchenette containing full size range, midi-sized dishwasher and single door fridge freezer - perfect for our needs! The apartment was tastefully decorated and furnished.......just two minor niggles: 1. Why is there no air-con unit in the \"2nd Bedroom\"? By opening all the doors, and switching all the fans up to full bore, it took nearly three hours to make the room comfortable. The next day, the housekeepers would zap the air con off to save money, so the whole process had to be repeated! 2. The bedside cabinets in the 2nd Bedroom, whilst they look good, have no useable storage space as you have to lift the lid - on top of which is a heavy table lamp - to use them. This means that there is inadequate space for a girl to keep her things - Two people sharing the room would soon have arguments I think! The location was good - a very easy amble to Lahaina's Front Street and just a short drive to the supermarket and shopping areas. For our purposes, we needed a rental car so paid the US$15 per day for parking. Although other guests have mentioned the ready availability of street parking and I am sure Maui is relative crime-free, I prefer to keep a car for which I am responsible away from possible temptation at night! The swimming pools are lovely, and we successfully bagged ourselves a thatched roof shaded hut a couple of times to chill between dips.

The street that the Aina Nalu is on is a mixed use street just behind (inland) from the bulk of the activity in Lahaina, so we were a little leery when we approached the property.

The resort was comfortably busy, but it didn't appear to be any where near full capacity...it would seem like you would be able to get an \"interior\" unit if you request it. If you like to walk, the property is located close to almost everything in Lahaina. We walked with three elementary aged children to restaurants, shopping (including groceries and the post office), and even to our surfing lessons. We drove to the Old Lahaina Luau because it's a little farther and part of the walk is on a hot/unshaded, busy street. We made day trips to Ka'anapali, Kapalua and Wailea, and we were so happy to come home to the Aina Nalu. Those areas are absolutely beautiful (the beaches are amazing!), but they are also very \"resorty,\" which is not our style. Very manicured, very crowded. We really felt that the Aina Nalu was an great value for the spaciousness and quality of the accommodations and the central, authentic location of the property.", "Date": "July 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Property\u201d", "Author": "Jet_Lag_Tom", "ReviewID": "UR17346691", "Content": "Booked via VRBO, a 2 bdrm, 2 bath, 2nd floor with pool view. The condo was very nicely furnished and very clean. The property is well landscaped and the new pool and pool house are stunning and comfortable. My teens loved lounging on the large mattresses in the pagodas. The pool house was a comfortable place for reading or card playing. A very nice pair of gas grills at the smaller pool are available and a large dining table sits along side available on a first come first served basis. Free coffee was set out in the AM. There is a tiny little strip of almost useless porch on some units that was described as a Lanai. A lot of units had parking lot views and I coud imagine a few in the rear of the property could have issues with noise from the nearby highway. The designers did an excellent job creating a remote feel to the property in spite of the fact that it is almost in the center of town. Every type of restaurant imaginable was in easy walking distance. Parking cost $5.00/day which seemed outragous since they have more parking then they need. It made no difference to us but we had been told by one owner that bicycles were available to guests for free, not true, the bikes were all privatly owned. A.C. was a must, there was no breeze to be found and the pool generated a little noise unitl closing at 11?

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed on Maui at the Hyatt and down in Keihe at Kamole Sands so this was definitely a change from both trips before. When I first looked into Aina Nalu I saw the prices on the Outrigger web site and thought that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insane for a condo. When I looked further I found that some of the condo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at Aina Nalu are privately owned and rented for a decent amount less. We decided to rent through an owner on VRBO ([--]) since it was more affordable. We paid $198nt (as opposed to $275) for a 2BRM/2BA upper. We were room 208A right up front by the lobby on Wainee St. I highly recommend Aina Nalu if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a place in Maui that has that relaxed beach town condo feel! Pro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: - Location: 2 blocks from Front Street & half a block from Snorkel Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Walk to restaurants, shops & bars w/o paying for parking or worrying about a designated driver. 2 min drive to the 24hr Safeway supermarket - The surrounding area turned out to be the best. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just come from Lewers St in Waikiki so this laid back condo was perfect. Locals were awesome \u00e2\u20ac\u201c always gave me directions since I get lost all the time and I loved being able to walk across the street to this one house that sold mango\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for 25c. off the tree in their yard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c YUM! - Unit: Exactly like all of the Outrigger Units \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no different in any way. Decorated, run and managed by them. Check in was just the same as an Outrigger guest. Beds were super comfy, AC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in every room, Washer/Dryer was great and the open stone showers were really nice. - Quiet! We had no noise from the units next to/below us. Just some passer by conversations as people walked by the front door. We were up front right by the Wainee St and not back by Hwy 30 so I think this helped as well. - Short walk to the pools! Pools were awesome!! Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stress this enough!! Salt water pool was perfect every night and never crowded plus it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kill my highlights. Nice perk! The cabana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and lounge chairs were super comfy and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pool house\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with WiFi and a huge plasma TV were great to have right there. - The Grounds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WOW! Ok, the landscaping and grounds really helped make this place stand out. Everything is beautifully appointed with incredible palms, flowers and small fountains everywhere. - No Bugs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We had 1 mosquito the entire time we were there. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from NYC so I know the higher up and the less food/crumbs you leave out = less bugs. Aside from the 1 mosquito we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a single problem with bugs. But we were really careful with food & crumbs and were also on the 2nd floor. Con\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: - Because we were in a privately owned condo they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help us fix the TV remote. Learned quickly that it was just a case of dead batteries and the front desk gave us some new ones but it was up to us to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it by putting them in. Ok, not rocket science! - At first glance it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located right in the middle of a VERY residential neighborhood which you might not expect or like but see above b/c I think this really added to the charm. It just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a true resort like the Mariott or Hyatt if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you wanted. Much more a beach town condo than a true resort. - $15nt for parking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not bad but pricey considering there were TONS of empty spots. What were they charging for really? You could park on the street but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to deal with the hassle. - We had a few locals at the pool with us on some nights. They do have a guard who walks around the property and will ask people to leave if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not hotel gusts or being rowdy but \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Not really a con by any means because all of the locals I met there were the nicest people ever! But, I could see how it could get out of hand if Aina Nalu doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep an eye on this. One local was saying that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring her kids over on a hot day for an hour if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empty but then leaves where as her neighbor was thrown out of the pool area the week before because they showed up with a cooler of beer and things got rowdy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6take it as you will! - WiFi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c At the pool and lobby it was ok but still slow. They said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not available in unit but we were so close to the front desk that we picked up a signal most times in our room - Housekeeping \u00e2\u20ac\u201c There was none for us since we rented through an owner. We did have an $80 cleaning fee but still saved a ton over renting directly through Outrigger. Not a huge deal for us since we expected most condo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include it.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poughkeepsie, New York", "Title": "\u201cthis place sucks! dirty with bugs!\u201d", "Author": "myang", "ReviewID": "UR16711329", "Content": "we stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while in maui.

If they had just added this to the cost of the room up front I would not have noticed. I only have two complaints. First the key card system was often argumentative and on several occasions I was unable to get in to the room and had to walk to the front desk to have everything reset. I was at the far end of the complex so this was a bit of an inconvenience especially the one night that it was raining. Second, many reviewers have complained about the traffic noise. While I was not on the side facing the highway and I did not have this problem, there was an apparently blind rooster outside of our room somewhere.

The other factor could have been that a lot of the rooms either face the highway or are at right angles to it and there weren't going to be any quieter rooms available that day. Lahaina itself was a great place to stay for a few days. You pretty much need a car to get to the beaches but there are great eating places within walking distance of the hotel. On Friday nights, the art galleries in town of which there are many ,have \"open house\" and you are encouraged to stroll through and see what they have to offer.

This unit was exactly the same as the other one. The only differnces were the Dell Plasma TVs in each bedroom had been replaced with some other brand, and smaller. And the unit was very quiet. One thing I figured out on our 3rd day was that the sets of louvers that make up the bathroom and bedroom windows, if opened even a little, let in alot of outside noise. And there are 3 seperate sets per window. When we checked in some of the louvers were partially opened at every single window. Closing them makes a huge difference, and close them until they lock. Other than that we did get coffee service every day this time. But we could not connect to the wireless internet. I tried from the smaller pool also, but could only connect at the new, bigger pool. they have cabled internet connnections in the room, but you have to pay $9.99/day. That felt like a rip off. The new pool has an infinity edge and is very nice. The pavillion has an empty bar, behind which is the ice maker. A pretty long haul from the front unit we had. In the morning by the small pool they put out coffee and a few newspapers. The location is still fantastic. We walked to the Pacific Whale Foundation for a whale watch and had a great time.

The hotel was newly renovated and they did a marvelous job fixing up the place. When we first were looking for our hotel we missed it (it was at night and very very dark) and had to call the front desk to give us directions (even with navigation!). After we arrived we checked in speedily and was shown to our room. The room was modern and very comfy. We were also upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite. The bed was comfy and all rooms had a flatscreen TV. The bathroom was nice and the shower was exceptional! It had one of those water/rainfall shower heads so it was nice to take a shower after going to the beach. Who knew such a jem was located in Lahaina??? All my friends (i travelled with around 10-12 people) stayed at different hotels and were all envious of the suite. (Some of the other hotels they stayed at was El Dorado, the Westin, the Lahaina hotel (?) and more)They all raved the place was awesome! This actual became the meeting point with my friends since it's the middle point for everyone. Although this place does not have a restaurant on it's property there are more than one place just walking distance from the place! I suggest going to Lahaina Grille and have their salads. OMG, it was to die for!! And the view was just beautiful. There's also a snorkeling rental place just up the street and it was cheap to rent their gear. If I ever get the chance to go to Maui again I would definitely love to stay at this place again!! I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else! Helpful tips::: -Brown pea looking things are all over the place (at least when i went) from trees on the property. These things stick to your sandals/shoes so be sure you wear sturdy sandals... For real!! -You CANNOT buy alcohol after 10pm in Maui so I suggest you go to foodland or wherever to buy your beer, wine, etc. in bulk. -Buy food at a supermarket (breakfast food). It's a nice way to save $$ and a good way to make use of the hotel's amenities. -Go to the pool!! Their pool is a great! It's on the small side but if you want to lay out they have great pool side beds (not the plasticy kinds) and I believe they provide towels as well. -If you're a partier, go to Kihei for the parties... Ask a local where a good club is to party. -Try Maui Tacos!! This place is sooo yum! If I remember correctly, it's where the foodland is located. They have the greatest fish tacos! -If you're thinking of going to Haleakala for the sunrise bike trip; go drive to Hana yourself and rent bikes from a tour shop there (you have to call in advance) It's way cheaper and same quality!

Even after they sprayed the kitchen twice, the ants returned, despite our being extremely careful with our food. From talking to the front desk, it sounds like ants are common in the development, and from reading prior trip advisor reviews of other condos, it sounds like ants occur around Maui just because of the tropical setting. Still, it wasn't fun having to be super careful while eating breakfast and snacks in the condo, trying not to drop any crumbs cleaning up immediately after eating while on vacation. And seeing ants crawling around does kill the appetite. 2. There was only a countertop with 2 stools for eating breakfast, no table to sit down at. 3. Poor noise soundproofing - whenever people stood outside our 2nd floor condo, either on our floor or on the first floor grounds, we could hear them just as if they were in our own room.

The bed was not particularly comfortable, with one person stuck against the wall and a cabinet blocking the foot of the bed. The parking charge makes perfect sense if you know anything about the parking situation in Lahaina. The grounds of the hotel are pleasant, and the proximity to Front St etc was perfect.

My boyfriend and I are not really much on resorts since we like to get a feel for local life wherever we visit and picking the Aina Nalu was a really good choice for us. I liked that we were within walking distance of almost everything in the town of Lahaina since the Aina Nalu is one block from the main shopping and dining area. This was perfect for enjoying the nightlife of Lahaina since we usually didn't have to drive to get there. I think the one exception was the night we went to a restaurant called \"Mala\", but it was worth the drive! Excellent tapas-style food! Anyway, the town of Lahaina is really nice if you want a mix of tourists and locals, which was perfect for us. We visited the area north of Lahaina where the Hyatt and other resorts are located and although it was nice, we were glad to be in a town with more options and local flair. We spent one evening at the Hyatt at a Luau, so we were able to walk around the resort and shop and dine there anyway without spending the night. We were very happy with the Aina Nalu accommodations. We stayed in a first floor one-bedroom \"garden room\". It had a small kitchen (microwave, coffee maker, blender, dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, dishes) that was nice even though we didn't really use it much since we ate out. But if you want to save a little $, you could fix your own meals there. The room also had two flat-panel TVs (one in the living area and one in the bedroom) that were nice. The bathroom had an open-style stone shower (no tub) and had a washer and dryer for doing laundry. Our room didn't have too much of a view of anything but the front parking lot. That was okay because we didn't spend too much time there. The grounds were really nice. They are making renovations right now and the old pool was closed while we were there, but that was okay since we weren't staying near that area of the property and they've opened another pool. The new pool was a nice saline pool and has a covered deck/patio area next to it for relaxing. (There's even a TV there). There are also some individual covered cabanas with cushions for relaxing with just your party. We hung out at the pool one afternoon, but you're also within walking distance to the beach if you'd rather enjoy that. (All beaches in Hawaii are public, so you can go to any of them, even the ones at the resort hotels). The property also has barbecue grills and a hammock to relax in. The landscaping is nice with lots of fountains and colorful foliage. Although one other reviewer already said it, I think I should mention that there is a $15 per day parking fee. If you had to pay to park in town it would probably be more per day, but you might want to consider the parking fee when considering the room price. We had purchased a package deal from American Airlines Vacations (flight, car & hotel), but it didn't cover the parking fee. Overall I was very pleased with our stay. If I were to go back, I'd definitely stay there again. I might spend one night in Hana so I could enjoy that side of the island without being rushed to get there and back in a day, but otherwise I'd stay at the Aina Nalu.", "Date": "September 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cGood for the money if you don't care about beachfront\u201d", "Author": "Ellie1425", "ReviewID": "UR8715931", "Content": "Just got back from our Maui trip.

The critique I'd have of this place are as follows: 1) Even though this property has their own parking lot with enough spaces to accommodate all units, they charged an additional $15.00 per day to park your car there. The other option was parking on the street which we weren't comfortable with a rental. At the time of booking this wasn't mentioned to us at all and we only learned this upon checking in. 2) One of the pools was closed which also wasn't divulged to us. It was the older pool and the newer one was open and it was nice and the pool house was very nice as well, however, the new pool area backs up to the busy highway so you can hear the cars. 3) There are no elevators for the second units which is a drag when you're hauling up a lot of groceries and could pose a problem for anyone with physical limitations.

We loved this place! We loved the location, the decor and the condo itself. We originally booked a 1 bedroom, but we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom, 1 bath. It was a nice surprise. It was just the 2 of us, so we didn't need the extra room, but it was nice to have the extra space. The only drawback to the 2bed/1bath is that the second room did not have it's own a/c unit, which made picking which room to use really easy. We loved the big shower and having your own washer and dryer. You wouldn't think that you need to do laundry while on vacation, but I did 4 loads - it was mostly washing the beach towels. The kitchen was great! It had everything we needed. We picked up groceries on our first day (be prepared for HIGH prices at Safeway) and we ate breakfast in the condo on most days and a few dinners. The blowdryers are in the drawer and it is plugged into an outlet in the drawer (I thought this was pretty neat). I hate to bring up anything negative, but the only issues we had (and they weren't big) were that housekeeping came at completely different times each day (who wants to be in the room when they come to clean???) , they didn't replace the coffee everyday, the kitchen sponge disappeared after the first day and after leaving 2 notes to get another one, we finally got one on the 4th day when my husband tracked down someone from housekeeping ( no big deal but it did make cleaning up breakfast dishes nicer - there is a dishwasher too). We did notice on the 5th day when we told housekeeping we didn't need anything but coffee and laundry soap, they seemed to be thrilled and gave us 2 of each. To be quite honest, we really didn't need a full cleaning everyday and thinking back, we should have just met up with housekeeping and asked for what we needed and told them to skip our room. They also didn't replace the laundry soap unless you asked for it. One last thing, there were NEVER any towels at the pool. We called the front desk and picked 2 up there (we also had our 2 from home) we just kept the towels and washed them for the remainder of our stay. They do have little bottles of suntan lotion at the pool in the big wood box next to Expedia. Also, if you like THIN pillows, or feather pillows, bring your own. I called to request feather pillows because ours were very thick and they said that what was in the room was all they had. I thought this was odd because most hotels will have feather pillows upon request. Aside from a few minor issues, we really enjoyed the place. The new pool area is beautiful. The old pool is being re-done and it will be closed for most of September, we didn't know this before we arrived but it didn't affect us (perhaps if it was a busy time in the season it would have made a difference). We spent a lot of time sitting in the cabana-style hut and just jumping in the pool when we got hot. There really weren't many people there so the pool wasn't too crowded. The restooms by the pool were very nice and ALWAYS very clean. Staff was nice and grounds were beautiful. Location is great, just a short walk to Front Street. The Expedia desk (Nicole) was great and often had the best prices for events. One last thing, parking is $15 a day, which is kind of a bummer because it didn't show on our original reservation total.

The common room has a nice sofa-sleeper that the kids had no complaint sleeping on, an A/C unit, and a nice flat screen TV. Both bedrooms (1 Q, 1 K with it's own bathroom) also had flat screen TVs. Each bedroom has it's own A/C unit, which we really liked since people had differing ideas on how cold to keep the rooms. The bathroom is huge, with a washer/dryer stacker unit located in it, and a very large slate lined shower stall (w/o doors for privacy). It's very nice, but it's not setup for more than one person being in the bathroom at the same time unless you're really comfortable with each other. A minor point to make, and not a big deal for any of us. Check-in was smooth, and the staff in general was helpful. We asked for laundry detergent multiple times and only once did we get any attitude about it. The kids loved playing in the pool every night, and the housekeeping staff / front desk staff were very accomodating for our many requests for fresh towels. There was a fire relatively nearby the Aina Nalu in Lahaina while we were staying there - the hotel manager was professional in asking for people to calmly leave their rooms and wait in the open-air lobby area in case the hotel needed to be evacuated. We decided to go snorkeling instead (why ruin your vacation?) and came back to the hotel with everything just the way it was when we left. We appreciated the manager's calmness in handling the situation. The Aina Nalu is centrally located. It is 2 blocks inland of the large banyan tree on Main St. Main St is the main touristy strip in Lahaina with plenty of restaurants, shops, stores etc. We went to the Feast at LeLe (a high-end Luau) on the 4th, and we were able to walk there from the Aina Nalu which was great. There was a Snorkel Bob's store at the end of the block, which made snorkel/beach gear rental really easy.

Really what it boils down to is that two or three sections of the hotel DO NOT have garden views of any type but open onto the parking lots. In addition the one we got stuck in was 40 ft from the highway. Disappointing to say the least. On the positive, the Outrigger chain has done quite a bit of work remodelling the units and they were very nice inside. No concerns whatsoever. Good value overall if you can avoid getting put in close to the highway. Unfortunately, you can't really book a specific wing in advance. The best thing to do is upon check-in, hope for a fair amount of vacancy, look at a map of the hotel and make sure you get into a room with green space or by the pool. We booked in December of 2006 with our holiday in April 2007. While we knew that the second larger pool was under construction, we didn't expect that they had made virtually no progress on it over the winter months. Too bad. The one small pool is crowded with lots of kids. The good thing is, we didn't really want to sit around the pool. Too many beaches to go to !! Overall, even with the disappointments of room location, we would go again but would be a little wiser about which room we let them put us in.

My girlfriend and I travel from Phoenix to Hawaii several times a year and spend considerable amounts of time online trying to get the best bargain. We both could not have been happier with this trip's hotel result. We wanted to be close to Lahaina because of the great food and shopping concentrated around the massive Banyan tree anchoring the town center. Much to our surprise, this hotel is literally a couple of small blocks from Front St., the main drag in Lahaina, and is directly east of the Banyan tree - no more than a 3 or 4 min walk. The grounds are plush and bountiful with indigenous plants. The open-air lobby is very inviting and the desk agent greeted us with a friendly reception and helpful recommendations on local establishments. Our next surprise came in the form of a unsolicited 2-BR upgrade from our 1-BR reservation. While we didn't need the extra room, the extra closet space and expansive 2nd bathroom added to our delight. We were initially cautious about the renovations taking place on the second pool and the addition of a fitness center (and disappointed it was open for business) but that did not disrupt our stay. The rooms come as advertised in the picture - ALL of the rooms. You know how sometimes the online pics represent the best room in the hotel? Well at Aina Nalu all of the rooms have been newly renovated and few expenses were spared. Our room had 3 large LCD flat screen TVs, exotic tropical ceiling fans in every room - including the bathroom, new designer carpet in the common areas and BRs - and I am not talking about this nasty sand-stained beach front stuff. The entry, kitchen and bathrooms have beautiful stone tile. The kitchen has black granite-like countertops, new black appliances, and a stainless steel refer. Very nice! The kitchen is outfitted with all utensils, plates, dishes, etc.. so plan on cooking in. Dishwasher, microwave, washer and dryer are a big plus. New wall-mouted A/C units are in each room and provide plenty of cool air (although they can be a bit loud). As others have said, a few rooms have a view of the mountain-side of Lahaina, but most rooms offer little far-sighted viewing. Most are adorned with tropical plants just off the balconies to draw your attention up close. The grounds tend to be a bit of a maze - something I can only equate to what I believe the first day of work at the Pentagon must be like - but luckily parking is fairly abundant and just outside your room (think Motel 6 parking). We were so unexpectedly surprised by our stay, I felt compelled to write this review - even at the risk of giving away my newest secret.

The apartments have literally everything you need, the kitchen is fully kitted out and the washer and dryer in the second bathroom is greatly appreciated after spending time on the beach and with 2 children. The bathrooms are very boutique hotel style \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stone tile lined wet room for the shower.

Of a morning they also provide coffee. Would recommend this site to anyone but please be aware of the building work currently going on. Unfortunately we had to move apartment because the first apartment we were located in was right next to the builders resurfacing the car park. We arrived after a delay at LA airport, checked in during the night, no problems etc., unfortunately the next morning we had problems getting our car out of the car park because they had started to resurface the road leading to the car park next to our block (no mention of not parking in this particular car park right next to our apartment when we checked in), eventually got over this obstacle but the second morning we were shaken from our beds by 2 diggers pulling up the car park surface outside our window, this work started well before 8am, up until 8am is supposed to be quiet time on the resort ! Unfortunately we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the reception staff very helpful to start with (I think the poor receptionist had had a number of complaints), we managed to speak to a Manager and got an apartment change, unfortunatly this didn't go smoothly, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready at 3pm as promised, had to come back at 7pm, we eventually moved apartments ourselves at around 9pm on our second day, at no point were any staff offered to help us move. Once we moved we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault the resort. Recommendations: Definitely visit Snorkel Bobs opposite the resort, they are a wealth of information, can you point you to all the local snorkel sites etc. We found the Old Airport beach to be the best for snorkelling but the car park does shut at 7pm prompt which is a shame as we had a lovely few nights watching the sunset and chilling on other beaches. Lots of marine life and turtles a plenty. Road to Hana, glorious drive, amazing scenery but really do only do it if you can stomach the ride. When they say bends, they mean bends, various members of party felt travel sick. While in Hana we went to the Hana Maui Hotel, this place is definitely worth a visit to eat or stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c out of this world, very welcoming even though we were in shorts etc. and had only just been swimming in the waterfalls. Staff brilliant, looked after us very well. Lahaina really nice town to stay within, easy walking distance to Front Street from apartments, had some lovely dinners and breakfasts.

I knew when we booked the stay that there was a new pool being constructed, unfortunately, 5 months later, this was still the case and it wasn't finished. However, it turned out not to be an issue at all, as the existing pool was really nice, with plenty of lounges, pool towels, free tubes of sunscreen and even poolside tea and Kona coffee in the mornings. There were also bbq's next to the pool area and we saw a few people using them for dinner. I was worried about construction at the property pre-arrival, but we didn't see or hear any, with the exception of glimpsing the new pool, which is tucked away right at the back. I suspect they are using the rooms adjacent to that area as a last resort at the moment. The whole property was really well maintained, everything was super-neat and the staff were cheery.

The bedrooms are very quiet, even with the construction on the unit across the courtyard we could barely hear it in the mornings. The master bath had a good sized linen closet, plenty of cabinet and drawer space around the sink. The shower was very roomy and relaxing. Housekeeping came in everyday and provided fresh towels in both bathrooms and kitchen. The kitchen was fully equipped with refrigerator, electric stove and oven, microwave and dishwasher.

A large assortment of dishes are also provided, cups, tumblers, wine glasses, coffee mugs, plates large and small, bowls, storage containers, large salad bowl, 9 x13 baking dish, pots and pans. There was service for 8 and plenty of silverware and utensils for cooking. Salt and pepper, dishwasher soap, coffee, cream and sugar packets and laundry soap are provided. More available on request. The kitchen had a 2 seater bar and the living room with a fold out couch w/ TV is directly off the kitchen. The second bedroom (queen bed) also had a large closet with plenty of storage space for suitcases and other junk. There was also an ironing board and iron, spare pillows and an extra blanket located in the closet. There is not a dresser located in this room so our guests had to use the TV cabinet as a wardrobe closet. The second bathroom was very large, good sized shower. Drawer and cabinet space around the sink. The washer and dryer are located in the second bathroom. Some of the not so great highlights; The construction is still not completed. The second pool is also not finished. We originally booked a 2 bdrm 2 bath w/ 2 king beds. We got 1 king 1 queen. No big deal.

The kitchen had everything you would want and it had looked like nothing had ever been used. The livingroom was a nice size and had a flat screen t.v. The bedrooms were seperated by the livingroom. The master bedroom had a king size bed and another flat screen tv and plenty of dresser space. The bathroom was attached and had a huge shower and a linen closet. My children age 12 & 14 shared the other bedroom wich had two twin beds and had its own tv (not a flat screen). The only problem with this room was that there was no dresser but the closet had a shelf and plenty of hangers. Their bathroom was across from their room and had a closet with the washer & dryer and also had a huge shower and plenty of drawers and a medicine cabnit. The decor throughout the condo was bueatiful. I was so impressed and so happy that we had decided to stay here instead of spending more on less space. The pool was not the greatest and the newer pool is still underconstruction, but we only went swimming one night. There is no beach within walking distance but you can walk to all of the restaurants and shops on front street. We were also close to the dock where we went parasailing. Beaches were a short drive away and never seemed like an issue not to have one within walking distance. We did not have prolems with noise, bugs or ants.

We were very impressed with what they did with the place. Did I mention new appliances, Whrlpool, American Standard, and Kohler! And the TV in our bedroom was a DELL flat screen 26 inch. My techy husband was also very impressed. The only weird thing that was the TV in the living room was a regular 20 inch. I figured it was the only one that could fit into the armoire? The bathroom was covered in slate tile throughout and the shower was deep enough so you didn't even need a shower curtain. I think we were the first ones to use the toaster and washer/dryer. Even the dishes and silverware were shiny and immaculate. The only bad part was there were tiny ants everywhere! We had to put our snacks in the microwave and I was scared to sit on the toilet because they were crawling around there too!

They were very distruptive don't even think about sleeping in. The staff was pleasant enough since we didn't need them much anyway.

So I went back to room and deceided to go back and offer to pay another full days rent for the room just for them letting us check out late.

The Islander was both. I was very pleasantly surprised when I got to see our room. It was more along the lines of a 1 bedroom suite with full kitchen and bath, with new appliances and even a washer and dryer in the suite. This saved us a lot of money since we made breakfast each morning and washed our clothes whenever needed. There was also a automatic dishwasher so that we didn't have to do our dishes (trust me, it helps when you travel with neat freaks). There was construction on site but we never heard anything, just that the view was not pleasant. This was not a problem for us since we spent the daytime hours out and about, and during the nighttime, it was too dark to see anything outside our window. Most of the rooms on our wing was vacant so we barely heard other guests. There were times where we thought we were the only ones here. The one thing I was definitely not impressed with was the service of the staff. They were not attentive and came off very rude. Also, since our departing flight out of Kahului was at 11pm, we asked if it was possible to do a late check out. They told us that the hotel was fully booked (which was not the case since the whole time we were there, our side of the building had about 5 cars in a lot that could have accomodated about 50-70 cars). They then said that if we wanted to do a late check out, we would have to pay for one night. For me, it was a matter of principle, not money. How can you be fully booked yet can allow guests to stay if they are willing to pay? They were not honest on several other occasions.

In most cases we would be happy to tent camp if given the option, but we wouldn't say no to a nice bed to sleep in. Unfortunately the Ohana couldn't deliver this. Though their brochure and booking agent promised a king bed, upon arrival we had two twins. We politely asked the desk staff could we be moved to a room with a king bed ( I am over 6'2\" ). We were informed that there were NO rooms with king beds, contrary to what they tell you before you get on the plane. Furthermore, there was no refrigerator in the room. People who stay at a place like this are on a *budget* and need a refrigerator because they can't afford to eat out three meals a day. Long story short, the staff (who to their credit were helpful and friendly and just working under horrible conditions) sent us around to several rooms because not a single pair of them had exactly the same configuration. We found a room poolside (noisy) with a queen bed (small, unkempt) and a refrigerator (loud, warm). The FIRST day the toilet stopped working. I don't mean it got stopped up or the chain fell off - we tested for these things. I mean the mechanism ceased to function. Several hours later they sent someone out who eventually fixed it. Lastly, the entire hotel was under construction at the time. What that means to the consumer is that all of your neighbors are going to be construction workers. Anyone, especially a woman, who has ever walked by a construction site knows it's something you don't want to sleep in the middle of.

It also drowns out the sounds from other rooms. We were lucky in not hearing our neighbors-- one other guest complained about partying in an adjoining room. The second floor rooms have a clerestory ceilings with an overhead fan. There's a modest $5/day charge for parking, a lot less than we pay at hotels in Seattle.

Restaurants are only blocks away. Although they charged us $5/day for parking, but has anyone seen other commercial parking lots around Lahaina? It'll cost you a lot more than $5/day to park your vehicle. We also took the advice from other reviewers and asked for a renovated room and we sure glad we did. Our room was cleaned and no bad odors.

What I couldn't overlook were the numerous mosquito bites I'd endured during the night. I have to note that I'd fallen asleep only 3 hours after arriving in Maui and slept for 14 hours. So, basically my whole first day was spent asleep (no outings to get bitten by mosquitos). I was definitely bitten in my room. After showering, I stepped into the living room to find a mouse attached to a sticky mouse trap. It was pathetic and sad and STILL ALIVE. Apparently, it had been trapped under the couch and thrashed around enough to make its way out to the middle of the living room. It took two phone calls to the front desk to get someone up to the room to fetch the mouse. A girl came in and put the mouse in a plastic bag... I assume she suffocated it.
