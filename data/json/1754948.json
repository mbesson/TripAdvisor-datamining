Pros: The hotel is well located in the Sultanahmed area. The Topkapi palce is few minutes walkaway. The hotel is very modern and extremely clean. The beds are comfortable with a extra pillows. The hotel staff are extremely helpful and professional. Cons: The minus side was that I was in a room 304 that was next to restaurant. The wall between room and kitchen is very thin and you can hear everything. You cannot sleep until the restaurant closes at 1.30am. I had my earplucks and was extremely tired on my first night, but the noise woke me up 4 times. It is not just tables and plates moving, but proper banging noises. I suggest this room for travelers who are nearly deaf or someoene who wants to go sleep after 1.30am. During the other times hte hotel was really quiet. Also there were problems with the breakfast and many other hotel guests complained about it. There was always some food that had run out, whether is was bread, juice, water etc..and the food was not replaced once it run out. The staff was not concerned about this and it took 15 -20 minutes to get juice or bread. It was a total joke.

Although there are dozens of better hotels in the same neighborhood. Negative: Tiny, tiny, tiny room. The room contained a double bed with literally 50 cm of room space around the edges of the bed. No shelves, no drawers, no place to store luggage or stow clothing and other items. So you end up putting the luggage on the only available floor space and stepping on it to get to the bed or the bathroom. Folded clothes end up on the table, competiing with the teapot and computer for limited space. Cramped and uncomfortable for one or two guests. There are no/no convenient electrical sockets. There was a single one underneath the small table, so if you want to plug in your computer you have to crawl under the table and unplug the teapot. If you want to charge your cel phone, you have to do it in the bathroom. There are no electrical sockets near the night tables, so you can't plug in a clock or charge your cel phone by the bed. No shelves or cabinets in the bathroom. Not inside the shower, so you have to put your shampoo and soap on the floor while you shower. Not near the sink, so you have no place to put your toiletries. No hooks or shelves to hang towels or clothing. You have to toss it all on the floor. The glass bathroom door is about 2 feet from the bed, so people in the bathroom and bedroom have no privacy between them. The reception desk is staffed by a couple of teenagers who are so busy surfing the internet that they don't lift their heads to greet guests. Breakfast is included, but mediocre. Cold cuts, powdered juice and bread. This hotel is only a couple of years old, so the paint and decorations are new, but the rooms are so small and badly-furnished that it reminds me of a youth hostel, except that the price is that of a real hotel.

The street is full of hotels/bar/restaurants and you don't really get a 'Turkish feel' but that's not to say that some of the bars an restaurant aren't great (Metropolis Restaurant across the road was excellent). The breakfast buffet at the hotel was varied with something to please anyone - continental cheeses and meats, eggs, fruit, yoghurt, bread, croissants, pain au chocolat etc. The restaurant attached to the hotel is not too bad either, we got a complimentary meal on arrival which was a nice surprise. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Istanbul. Make sure you pay for transfer as well as Istanbul traffic is crazy at times and the airport is a fair trek. Not the cheapest hotel maybe, but you get what you pay for. The only slight disappointment was the extra charge to use the sauna, which we subsequently chose not to use.

The entrance is a doorway between two restaurants which leads to a small reception area. We were greeted by an unshaven gentleman in shorts and tee shirt. Being used to smartly dressed hotel staff, I wondered if I had arrived at the right hotel but my mind was put at rest when were were shown the room (a standard) which looked the same as the photos on the hotel website. We asked for and were given a quiet room at the back of the hotel. Unfortunately this means no view & not much natural light as the next door block of flats is only a few meters away. The room also had a large pillar which had to be carefully navigated when getting in / out of bed. The room was very clean and well decorated. The bed was large but firm since the mattress rested on a platform. There was tea & coffee + in room safe. The robes and slippers were a nice, unexpected touch. The bathroom was small with a fantastic shower (no bath). Unfortunately it had my pet hate - a glass door between it and the bedroom. When using the bathroom at night the light floods the bedroom (disturbing the other occupant) and as the door doesn't closely fit the surround the sounds and smells(!) from the bathroom are noticeable in the bedroom. Breakfast in the restaurant was OK - nothing special & the staff were not especially attentive. We didn't have dinner there as the large screen TV put us off. The Albura restaurant next door is worth trying as it has an entrance (at the back on the right) to the recently discovered Grand Palace of Constantine. It's still being excavated but it well worth a visit. Also the nearby Four Seasons Hotel is expensive but an oasis of calm with fantastic views from the roof top terrace of the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque. The hotel staff very helpfully checked us in online for our flight home and stored the luggage. Despite initial reservations, I grew to like the hotel.

From the day we booked our room Online, Senatus hotel communicated with us immediately by email confirming our booking and answering all our questions, they even went out of their way suggesting what we should tour before we even arrived. Airport transfer was hassle free, This hotel actually looks really nice from outside and inside, i believe its an old building that was overhauled with very nice finishing...we were greeted nicely by the reception staff, Check-in Was smooth, the room was ready on-time, while the room was not spacious (Economy) it was clean, nicely decorated + LCD TV (for when you can't fall asleep at night) and honestly the room is sufficient for any couple. As we spent 95% of the time outside the hotel, space didn't matter. The Washroom is very nice and we enjoyed the Rain Shower after a long day touring Istanbul. The staff are great, every staff member is very chilled out and its clear that they have a relaxed work atmosphere. The General Manager himself hangs around the hotel most of the time and they all wear the same T-shirts so you can't really tell who is who until you ask him, he's that humble! Staff is very helpful with all your needs and always say \"Yes\" to whatever you ask, never heard a \"No\", if something is difficult they will always \"Try their best\". They will also explain to you all the info you need and will never pressure to sell you \"Tour packages\" unless you want to opt for one. Breakfast was included in our package which was an added bonus (most other hotels were charging this separately) the breakfast is of good quality, but i do wish they provided more variety, the menu is fixed with eggs & sausage. Also the Music that played at breakfast was classical music, while relaxing it wouldve been nice to have a turkish version of \"relaxing\" music for a more authentic experience. Something unique i found is that they played \"Tom & Jerry\" every morning on TV (muted) which i enjoyed although many other reviewers complained of this on TA. We got a good deal on this hotel, considering the peak season we visited Istanbul in, we paid about 1000TL for 4 nights which was better than most nearby comparable hotels quoted me. Now to the negatives: There isn't really much to complain about, but as mentioned earlier the breakfast does need variety & authenticity. And its v difficult to get an early-Checkin & Late checkout especially on high season to this hotel, this is not really the hotel's fault due to limited number of rooms but it definitely would be nice to check in early especially if your flight comes in early in the day, or checkout late if your flight is late...An issue that you might not face in larger hotels. A very good Experience overall, if this is your first time in Istanbul look no further, don't confuse yourself looking for big brand hotels...you won't regret it.

Best shower - super strong! * Breakfast is not fancy but with quality food. :\") Croissant is surprisingly good. Great bread spread! Very reasonable price to stay with this lovely place. The only thing is that it doesn't have a rooftop restaurant with sea view / view of Blue Mosque etc.; however you can easily find such places around the hotel.

We chose our hotel via internet. We noticed that Senatus Hotel had a high ranking (#7) at tripadvisor, so we checked the reviews and the photos and we called them to make a reservation. We spoke on the telephone with them and they were extremely helpful and very illuminating about their hotel. So far the first impression was excellent. So we booked a room (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Senator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) for 4 nights. Due to an unexpected problem we were obliged to postpone our trip for about two weeks. We called the hotel and we requested cancellation of our reservation - this was done without any problem at all. When we called again after a few days for a new booking, they told us that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any room available for four consequent nights. As we definitely wanted to stay at Senatus Hotel, because they sounded so friendly during our first contact, we agreed to their proposal that we stay at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Imperator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (which was larger but a bit more expensive) room for three nights and then on the last night we could change to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dominus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (a slightly smaller room), for the same price that we had agreed on the first time. When we arrived at the hotel, the first impression was very good (and it was going to get better\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attractive building situated in a semi-pedestrian road at a great location, 7 minutes away from two tram stations and in a walking distance from Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque and Topcapi. What can we say about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Imperator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (#407) room? Spacious (a good 30 m2), tastefully decorated, modern but with enough Turkish elements. Very clean, very bright, surprisingly sound-proofed and with all the modern comforts one can expect from a hotel of this category. The highlight of the room was the big painted glass that separates the room from the bathroom (you could choose to draw the blinds inside the bathroom for discretion). The bathroom itself was big and spotlessly clean, with high pressure water and a Jacuzzi tub (the only issue was the height of the fixed overhead \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shower (I am 1,85 tall, so it was low for me -my wife is 1,70 but it was ok for her.) But there was an alternative hand shower, so everything was ok. Large closets, a safe and free wi-fi access completed the set. Overall impression: excellent! We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have made a better choice. Excited as we were, we went to the reception (Selcuk and Umut were our men) and asked for some information about the city. Their English was perfect and we soon discovered they were fluent in other languages as well! They had a great sense of humor and they were more than willing to help us in any way. They were always ready to answer all our questions or get us information on how to move around. For example, we wanted to make a small trip to the suburbs of Istanbul and they very kindly printed all the boat and bus timetables, they contacted the Patriarchate for us and printed a multi-page list of orthodox churches. They were even willing to stay beyond their working hours until they were sure all problems had been solved! We almost felt that they had adopted us!!! We want to thank both Umut and Selcuk for making our trip so enjoyable. Breakfast was rich; everything that we tasted was of the best quality. The restaurant was nicely decorated with a good selection of classical music playing softly on the background, a flat TV showing (muted) Charlie Chaplin films and old Cartoons. It was always a pleasure seeing Habib\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Gozde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smiling faces every morning. Finally, another good thing was that -for some reason- they charged us LESS(!!!) than what had been agreed. We returned to the airport with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transport service, with a gentle driver and soft classical music playing all the way. Would we recommend Senatus Hotel? ABSOLUTELY!!! PS. Some tips: -We think Sultanahmet is the best part of Istanbul to stay in; you can walk to all the main attractions or take the public transportation to visit the rest of the city. -Keep a pair of extra socks with you for use inside the mosques (at least that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we did). -Spring is a nice time to visit Istanbul.

The sparkling clean room I entered was a welcome sight and in particular the bed which was covered in crisp, white linens. While European beds tend to be much firmer than Americans are used to, this one was relatively comfortable (no pillow-top, mind you, but the mattress did have a little give to it.) Bottom line, I felt like I was in a very nice establishment where high standards are maintained. Oh, the bathroom, was also wonderful. Sophisticated looking with a wonderful shower. The restaurant for breakfast was nothing fancy but nice and clean with helpful wait staff. Eggs, sausage, assorted breads, fruit and cheeses are included and are presented in an appealing way. I particularly enjoyed getting to sit at tables next to a wall of windows that look out on the charming street which is narrow but always bustling with activity.
