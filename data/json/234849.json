Room was a good size, with modern d\u00e9cor and always clean. I don't usually sleep well on holiday, but the bed was of just the right firmness and the location of the hotel was quiet, so I had 3 very good nights sleep.

We didn\u2019t have enough pans to cook one of our meals (yes, we cooked proper meals in the room!) and after a quick call to reception a pan was delivered to our room within minutes. Reception staff always friendly and helpful. We had a late flight and they were more than happy to store our luggage for us after check out. On the topic of markets, we would highly recommend the newly refurbished Mercat Llibertat, only 5 minutes walk away from the hotel. Clean, bright and airy, it looked more like a supermarket or shopping centre than a food market. It also has a supermarket attached. As for food recommendations, our best lunch was eaten at Wok Yutaka II near Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. An Asian buffet with so much choice, good quality and great value.

First, the hotel is located literally footsteps from the Fontana metro, which is so crucial when you are a tourist trying to get around and see places.

If you are looking for a non-touristy retreat after being a tourist all day long then this is the place the for you! My favorite part about Gracia was its two plazas, Plaza Del Sol and Plaza Dominica, which were just a few minutes walk away. Both plazas have good, cheap places to eat and they are packed with people enjoying, relaxing, eating, drinking, talking ... the epitome of Spanish culture. Don't miss out! Lastly, the rooms were clean, compact, and modern and staff nice and helpful. We only had two issues during our stay ... #1, one of the outlets in the bathroom was not working, which made it hard for me to blowdry, etc ... I could have probably asked them to change our rooms but we had already settled and I didn't bother. #2, the front door is automatic and somehow the sensor was not working and hit my poor husband in the side of his head on our way out one day ... hopefuly they fixed it!

However, on the other side of the spectrum, our room was the most bland and unattractive space we had in all of Spain. (We stayed in room 105.) There was a window, but no natural light came in because the window fed out into a skylight-type area. Therefore the whole room was a dimly lit, dingy yellow-ish color, no matter the time of day. The dated cabinetry surrounding the bed and the orange & brown duvet did not help matters. It seems as though the rooms decor has not been updated since the 1970s. Our bath was tiny with no counter space for toiletries. Additionally the drain in our shower was clogged and despite reporting it to the front desk twice, it was not fixed during our stay. The kitchenette was an amenity that I was looking forward to having, but it turns out we only used the fridge for juice and fruit, so it wasn't worth really having it.

Our room overlooked the lovely garden where you can eat your breakfast or just relax in peace. The room had tasteful decor, a flatscreen tv, a stereo, an incredibly comfy bed, kitchenette with fridge and cooker and cutlery, and a good sized bathroom with an excellent power shower. The location of the hotel is excellent. The Gracia district has many little restaurants and bars that are much cheaper than the Ramblas and, we found, often of a much higher quality. We would recommend Bo restaurant for beers and tapas! Our idea of hell would be staying somewhere directly on the Ramblas with its noise and drunken tourists. This hotel is a minute's walk from Fontana metro station and then it will take you less than 5 minutes to reach Catalunya station which is at the top of the Ramblas. The metro stations are incredibly warm but the trains are fantastically frequent. It is \u20ac1.40 for a single ticket one way. Should you choose to get a taxi from the hotel to the Ramblas or vice versa, it will cost you around \u20ac7. The staff in this hotel are fantastic. They are so friendly and helpful and efficient.

There was of course a kitchenette, but since we were always out and about, we only just used the fridge. My only complaints about our room: 1. The airconditioner wasn't working properly. Even when it was cranked up, the room felt warm. 2. The water from the shower kept dripping from the ledge of the tub on to the floor, so there was always a puddle.

Thus, staying at this hotel is definitely a good choice as compared to staying at hotels in/near the La Ramblas area. I recommend that people should book directly with hotels not only for better rates, but as well as direct communications with hotel. This was true in my case. I got on to their website and they have a promotion rate of almost half price for a double/twin room. As I was travelling with family of 6, including 2 elderly and 1 young child, I also request for a connecting room which I got it, which is only applicable to the comfort room and I also stress that comfort room is the best choice as it is refurbished and definitely looks classier and comfortable than the lower room categories, at not very much difference. Now, back to the hotel itself, location perfect, near to Fontana Station, the first traffic light on your right upon exiting the station, cross over and walk along the narrow street and you will find the hotel. It's location is quiet but feels safe, and is Barcelona, of course, you got to be careful everywhere. Not only it is close to station, nearby hotel there are late night shops, a few small eateries as well as one supermarket (closes 9pm). As for the room, the most delightful about the comfort room I booked, was the fact that it had a mini kitchen, thus if you like to make a simple meal, it is perfect, not to mention the extra touches like microwave, sink, mini dining table, you will not even get it in 4-5 star hotels. The bathroom is not so big and has showers only but not a problem for us as my family members are small-sized people, so one point to look out for those people wanting huge space. Staff was helpful and friendly. There is even a computer for Internet surfing at the lobby for guest to use for free. The only problem (not hotel's fault) was that some guests using the computer tends to hog on it for hours and thus, if you are reading this and thinking of booking this hotel, may I suggest a common simple courtesy to restrict usage of the computer to maximum 30 minutes. I was a little irritated by 2 middle-aged ladies who used the computer for more than 3 hours when I came down a few times to try to use it.

The taxi driver knew exactly where this hotel was. The gentleman at the front desk when we checked in late in the evening spoke very little English but was patient with my Spanish and was very helpful. The daytime front desk clerk was fluent in English and also very helpful. There were lots of tourist brochures in the lobby as well as newspapers/weeklies in Spanish and English. We stayed in one of the older rooms (the hotel was undergoing renovations), but found it - although a tad shabby - very clean and comfortable. Our window looked out into a nice little courtyard. We were worried about late night noise but luckily it was very quiet in the evenings the entire time we stayed there. First, some bad things: When we booked online we read that the hotel has laundry service, which we thought meant there was a laundry room on the premises. Turns out that it's actually a \"send out\" type service you pay extra for - you put your laundry in a provided plastic bag and leave it for the cleaning service to take care of for you. The price was a little unreasonable and we didn't like that too much. If you need to do laundry, there is a laundromat (in Spanish, a lavanderia) a reasonable walk away from the hotel: Bugaderia Wash n'Dry on Carrer Torrent De l'Olla. Google Map it to see where it is exactly. We also didn't like that you had to pay for wi fi service. There's free internet at a public computer in the lobby, but every time we went downstairs in the evening, someone was always on. Now the good: For about an extra 10 Euros a night, you can have breakfast buffet included during your stay. This was one of the best things about the hotel, as we expected a simple continental type breakfast (pastries, cafe con leche, and fruit), but when we came down to the cafe the first morning, we were very pleasantly surprised. Although there were no hot items, there was a plethora of yummy things like breads, cereal, coffee, tea, juices, cheeses and meats. Definitely worth the extra money. If you're trying to save a little, you can load up on breakfast and have a light lunch or quick, inexpensive tapa during the afternoon. There's also a mini fridge in the room if you want to buy food at a store.

Not true! Our family group of 11 people in 6 rooms stayed here twice in the summer of 2008, for one night upon arriving in Barcelona and then for two nights a week later. All our arrangements were made by email with the hotel and everything was friendly and professional; all was as we expected when we arrived. The location is terrific - in the Gracia neighborhood (sometimes called \"the Greenwich Village of Barcelona\"), one block from the Fontana station on the L3 Metro line. If you are new to Barcelona (as we were), let me tell you that being close to the L3 is ideal - it makes it easy to go everywhere that you want to visit while in the city. (Get a T-10 pass and figure out the system by which multiple people can use the same ticket.) All sorts of shops and services also are close at hand. The area felt safe and fun - we loved it. This is not a luxury hotel - and you won't pay luxury rates. Instead, it is a medium-size operation with clean, efficient, and quiet rooms at a very fair price. So don't stay here if you want the Ritz. But if you don't want to pay for the Ritz, this is the place for you - you won't be disappointed. Look at their very honest Web site; it gives you a perfect feel for what the hotel is like. If you like what you see online, then it's a good bet that you will be happy when you arrive. The beds mostly fill the rooms, but still they've fit in a desk, a kitchenette (fridge, microwave, cooktop), a closet, and a fold-down shelf. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are functional. Everything was clean and maintained well. There is a charming courtyard where you can enjoy breakfast or gather your group for cocktails in the evening. There's a computer with Internet available at no charge in the lobby (but you may have to wait your turn to use it), or you can pay for access to WiFi by the hour or by the day. If you get the concept that hotel rooms are where you sleep, then you will find Aparthotel Silver offers a great way to save some money and still have a solid and enjoyable base of operations while you visit an exciting and beautiful city (with, incidentally, perfect summer weather).

Unfortunately it seemed to be a very expensive time to book a hotel in Barcelona, possibly because of St George's Day, but we managed to find rooms at the Hotel Silver for a reasonable price. On each floor of the hotel there are 2 rooms facing onto an internal courtyard which is not open to the sky (there's a panel of small glass squares at the top) and because we opted for the cheapest rooms, these were the ones we got. I found it a bit strange not having any natural light in the room at all, and as it was quite warm and the air conditioning is not allowed to go below a certain temperature, it did get quite hot and stuffy. (There was an electric fan supplied in each room, but mine was slightly faulty and my mother's didn't work at all.) But it was a comfortable room, with a kitchenette (which we didn't use) and a fridge, and the bathroom - although small - was clean and had a good shower.

After extensive research on trip advisor, I booked the hotel for my wife and I as well as another couple and we were not dissapointed. We chose the Silver based on price as well as location (conveniently near the metro). The Hotel: While a small hotel, it has a friendly atmosphere and all of the people who worked reception were kind and spoke excellent English. We stayed in a standard room (double bed for 92 euros). The room was small but this appears to be the trend in Europe (correctly advertised based on the pictures from the website). Not a big deal since we didn't spend much time there. It was clean and had a decent bathroom. Would recommend keeping your windows closed at night though to keep the noise down that comes from passer-bys on the street at 2am. Getting there: It cost us 35 euros to arrive by taxi from the airport (extra charge for 2 pieces of luggage and travel from the aiport itself). Keep in mind this was at 8am and during rush hour, otherwise I expect it would have cost ~25 euros as the hotel site indicated. You can also arrive by taking the aeroport bus (pay when you get on) from the Airport to Plaza Catalunya and then take the metro from Plaza Catalunya to Fontana (L3/Green Line towards Zona Universitat) for ~4 euros + ~1 euro respectively. I would recommend buying the T10 pass (as per other reviews) for the metro which cost 7.5 euros (purchased at the entrance of every metro stop, provides a total of 10 rides per card, and can be used by multiple passengers). The hotel is only 50 yrds from the Fontana stop (which is 3 stops from Plaza Catalunya, the hub of the city). FYI- Our friends took the aeroport bus + metro to the hotel and said it was cumbersome carrying their luggage up the stairs/escalators at the metro. Location: As above, the hotel is conveniently located near the Fontana metro stop and is a 20-25 min walk to las Ramblas (although we always took the metro). There are several restaurants near the hotel as well as small bakeries and such. Never ate breakfast at the hotel so I can't comment on that.

It was hard to know that the window was open because of its location in the room. The first night it got very cold and I fell very very ill. That somewhat ruined my trip. I then realized that they left the window open and I made it a point to close it each night. I don't understand why housekeeping would leave it open and cover it with a curtain! Anyway, when I got back home, I had to take two sick days because I was extremely unwell.

It is in a residential location that is quiet compared to the Placa Catalunya/Ramblas areas. There is good shopping within walking distance of the hotel and some restaurants too. SERVICE All of the front desk staff spoke english well. Check in and check out were fast and easy. The hotel also lets you store your luggage if you arrive early or need to leave late. The storage area is out in the open under the stairs, but the staff was nice enough to hold my laptop computer behind the receiption desk until I left. You are asked to leave your key at reception every time you leave the property. Reception is available 24 hours. Check out time is at 11 am. ROOMS I had a standard room, one that hasn't been upgraded. It was in need of an upgrade, but everything was clean and worked fine. The bathroom was nice. TV was basic and had a couple of english channels. The rooms come with a fridge and stovetop, very convenient if you're spending a couple of nights. Air conditioning worked well and a manual fan also is provided. A safe is available as well, and it has an electronic lock that is easy to use. Road noise wasn't an issue. BREAKFAST The hotel has a breakfast area on the first (second) floor. It costs seven euros. Food was basic but good. It included croissants, cereals, toast, juice, coffee, and bread with meat and cheese. The sitting area is outside in a nice garden area. INTERNET ACCESS There is a desktop PC in the lobby with an internet connection that guests can use for free. There is also Wifi in the lower parts of the hotel. You buy an access card at the lobby. This card has a PIN code on it. Once you're in an area covered by the Wifi, simply open Internet Explorer and enter the PIN code on the website that appears to gain internet access. Cost for a 24 hour card is 12 euros. You can also buy them in hour increments if necessary. Just note that you'll need a room on either the first or second floor in order to use the Wifi from your room. Otherwise, you can pick up the Wifi in the lobby or in their garden (breakfast) area one level higher. TRANSPORTATION The subways in Barcelona are excellent: on-time, clean, and easy to use. If you're there for a weekend, I'd recommend purchasing the 10 ticket pack. It lets you ride 10 times (transfers to other lines during the same trip are not included in your limit) and costs around 13 euros. There are machines at each stop where you can buy tickets, and you can change the language of the machines as needed. Credit cards are taken, although the credit card readers didn't work in some machines. On a side note, I found the cheapest place to buy a water or coke was at the Placa Catalunya subway stop. There you will find a huge vending machine on the wall that sells a 1.5 liter coke for two euros. SUMMARY This hotel is very cheap compared to others in Barcelona. I paid 85 euros on a Friday in late summer. But it doesn't feel like a cheap hotel, and even the rooms that haven't been refurbished are pretty nice, especially given the kitchenette. The location is really ideal; no reason to stay in the Ramblas/Catalunya area. The metro will take you there in five minutes and is very easy to use. It's nice to break away from the congestion of that area and have a quiet place to sleep. Aparthotel Silver is highly recommended.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "MacKiwi", "ReviewID": "UR5553355", "Content": "This hotel has lots going for it - efficient staff, free internet, gifts in the room each day (we stayed over Christmas), great location very close to the Metro and not much further to a small supermarket and other shops.

The bathroom was small and \"appeared\" clean but the tile floor didn't \"feel\" clean. The overall experience just did not make us feel comfortable. However, on the plus side - staff speaks English, free internet in the lobby, room rate was a bargain at 72EUR/night, convenient to everything on the Metro (just a few stops from the center of town, and the subway runs every 3 minutes or so). Note on the Metro - buy packs of 10 tickets for 6.30EUR - only 63 cents per ride. Single rides are 1.10 or 1.20. A day pass is 4 or 5 euros so we found that the 10-ride ticket was a much better deal. Several people can share the same 10 ride pass so you don't each have to buy one. We were there for 2 days and went all over the place on one 10-ride ticket.
