Certainly no value for money. From day one there was no hot water in the toilets. Front desk wouldnt even look at me when I complained. The manager refused to talk to me and all insisted the problem was fixed. They even suggested I should boil water in the kettle and have a sponge bath or else go to their other facility a kilometre away to have a bath. The soft mini bar is well stocked with all of 2 small water bottles. The complimentary wifi in all rooms was non existent. Had to go down to the lobby to use my ipad. The restaurant is a joke. My family and I ate only breakfast and the food was far from satisfactory. Health club is a big empty hall - probably still under construction. No pool though they did say we could use their facilities in their adjoining property a kilometer away. Mattress on the extra cot asked for and provided was as hard as a plank of wood. Their brochure says airport transfer is complimentary, but when I asked for it, they said they normally charge Dhs 60 but for me it is free ( probably a measure to compensate me for no hot water in the rooms!!) All in all poor facilities, indifferent service from staff and a sour note in anotherwise enjoyable holiday for my family.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent place and location\u201d", "Author": "HappyChappy16", "ReviewID": "UR116029786", "Content": "The staff were all helpful and the suites are good.

My wife works in Abu Dhabi and I flew into Dubai, so we stayed the first weekend there. I found the hotel perfectly adequate, and the room price (including breakfast) was more than reasonable. The room was simple, but had good beds. WiFi worked without a problem. The location is excellent, close to the metro and the Bur Juman Mall (also good for the sight-seeing buses!). Breakfast had a very Indian flavour - no problem, since I like Indian, but might be a bit of an acquired taste for some people. Staff were reasonably friendly and sorted out the key card problems promptly. Make sure that you don't carry your key card in the same pocket as your phone - the chip is likely to get wiped and thus won't work! Needed to leave the car and luggage in the hotel before our departure for a few hours after check-out, which was no problem. On the matter of parking, the hotel has underground parking, which is nice if a bit cramped. In all, a perfectly adequate and reasonably priced hotel.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAcceptable for its price and location\u201d", "Author": "janedoodle", "ReviewID": "UR89649836", "Content": "Moved here for 2 nights after 5 nights at the Radisson Deira, because my travel plans could not be confirmed earlier. It's no Radisson both in terms of service and rooms, but the location was EXCELLENT in terms of proximity to metro and restaurants (in BurJuman). Other good things included fast Wi-Fi, and better than expected breakfast spread -- there was a selection of bread, juices, and hot servings which included omelette and other local dishes. What brought me here was also the non-requirement of a room deposit and absence of cancellation charges. Our room was quite small but nicely coordinated. We were barely able to open up our 21 and 24inch luggages and leave walking space in the room though. This is partly due to the super single sized beds, which are comfortable, but came with only one flat pillow. The bathroom was small and simply furnished. It looked clean enough, until I drew the shower curtain and was hit by a stench of sweat. Nothing a spray of hot water and shower foam couldn't remove though. One of the bath towels also had numerous brown stains on it. Additionally, the fixtures did not seem to be fitted properly -- water leaked from the shower pipe, and the WC moved slightly when you sat on it. We found bad fittings and infrastructure to be a common problem throughout the hotel. The room door lock looked as if it could come off if someone gave it several good yanks. It was not bad enough to concern us though. Inside the room, the TV remote control, desk lamp, one of the electric outlets and one of the wall lights in the room all did not work. The worst part was that we had a 40min POWER OUTAGE during our first night around 9pm. The entire hotel did not have power except the emergency lights in the corridors. However, the staff made no move to keep guests updated (we had no idea if someone was coming to fix it, etc) nor apologise or offer to make up for this in any way. I must state that we did not take this up with the staff the next morning either. A comparatively minor inconvenience is that cab drivers usually mistake London Crown 1 and 2 for this. It will help to know exactly where it is (look up wikimapia for location) so that you can direct the driver. All in all, I would stay here again if all I need is a cheap (AED275 including taxes, breakfast and wifi), comfortable bed that is near the metro and restaurants.

Location is great - a few steps to the Metro Station which, when the full lines are completed will be fantastic.

Value - second to none, I am still astonished at how cheap the accommodation was for the quality. Food - didn't try the food though brekkie always smelt great.
