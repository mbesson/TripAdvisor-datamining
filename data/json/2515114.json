When we made our reservation we were told to ask about an upgrade when we checked in. We did that and were upgraded to the 'Suite Level'. Apparently I don't know what 'Suite Level' means since the room we were in was one of the smallest I've ever seen. Also, the 'Suite Level' lounge isn't open on the weekends so whatever is offered in there remains to be seen. We were in a room that faced the pool and as other reviewers have stated, it can be loud at times. We looked at the menu for the restaurant - prices were off-putting so we opted for dinner in the bar. That probably was the best thing about this Marriott - the food was good and reasonably priced. There was some kind of convention being held at this location so the bar was a little louder than one would expect at 6 pm on a Saturday night. There was also a mix-up on the parking charge...we were told when we made the reservation that parking was complimentary for the night you stayed at the hotel. When we checked in, the front desk quoted a parking charge and couldn't be convinced that we were told otherwise. In the morning when we checked out, that front desk clerk asked if everything went alright - I related the parking charge incident and asked it that could be 'comped' - she agreed to do so. We had planned on parking at another lot for the duration of our trip due to the Marriott's high rate to park there - when we asked for our car, the valet asked why we weren't parking there - explanation given - then we were given a MUCH lower daily rate which we took advantage of. The airport shuttle was efficient. Because we are loyal Marriott customers, we'd probably stay here again but request a tower room.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego CA", "Title": "\u201cNot too bad...a bit noisy\u201d", "Author": "United858", "ReviewID": "UR126886817", "Content": "While the pool is great for families, the accompanying noise can be quite annoying if you are trying to sleep.

I made our reservation by calling the hotel directly and being transferred to Marriott's main reservation center. I normally book online, but wanted to know why the rate was so much higher than the last time we stayed at this property. I was told it was because of the holidays (our stay was Jan. 3) and because the hotel was almost completely booked. I was told there were only a few rooms left and I should book immediately. When I told her I am a Marriott Rewards member, the agent very nicely offered to upgrade us to concierge level and she said she'd put us in a corner room since they're larger. Great! But when we arrived, none of that happened. The desk clerk didn't even have any notes in our reservation about that. We asked if the hotel was booked and he said \"no\" and that it was practically empty!! The reservation agent lied. We asked if he would honor our promise of concierge level and he said he would. We got to our room on the 7th floor, only to find the concierge level is on the 8th floor! The desk clerk lied to our faces. We were not in a corner room and despite the hotel's near emptiness, we were put in a room next to a family with an infant that cried much of the night.

What we like - and still liked this year after several years' break - is that although it's a big chain hotel, at an airport, it has a much smaller feel to it than most such hotels. When you enter the Reception area, the style is reminiscent of some of those lodge hotels you find in national parks - all stone and wooden beams - and on a more modest scale than many large hotels. The staff seem helpful and friendly, and the rooms comfortable and well-equipped as you would expect. The rooms are built around a large closed atrium in which there's a pool. We've never tried the pool but we like the fact that it's there. It does mean that about half the rooms face inwards onto this area; we've always had rooms facing outwards, which I think may be better. The restaurant also is not bad for a chain hotel - we've eaten there several times in the past so did so again this time, and again were very happy with it. The restaurant doesn't seem very large but there was no problem getting a table, either for the evening or next morning for breakfast. Breakfast is good - but you have to make a choice between the extensive buffet (including freshly made omelets etc) or a la carte. Both were fine but you can't mix and match the two options, which made the choice harder as some things were only available on one and not the other, and vice versa. You have to pay to park at the hotel - I can't remember how much but it all adds the cost. As there's a Hertz rental office in the hotel, I suppose a good option might be to take the hotel shuttle from the airport, then pick up one's rental car from there the next morning - saving on a day's rental, and the cost of parking. It's just a thought. So - overall - this hotel is perfect for a night after arriving from afar.

Our beautiful room was exceptionally comfortable - and the indulgent bath amenities were the most fragrant and luxurious I've experienced in a product provided by a hotel.

I expected just a bit of convienence but instead found a wonderful welcome to Seattle in an unexpectedly luxurious setting. The hotel itself was lovely, evoking a sense of Northwest charm. The lobby was comfortable and inviting, with a bar that overlooked the garden style pool/atrium. I enjoyed a delicious jumbo shrimp cocktail with a generous glass of wine. It was a wonderful way to relax after a very long day of travel, especially knowing that my room was just steps away. The location was as convienient as can be - minutes from the airport with shuttles running at frequent intervals. (I know this for a fact since I used the shuttle several times, having forgotten something at the hotel and using the shuttle to pick it up before I flew out of town). The staff - the front desk, the shuttle drivers. the bartender, the waiters at breakfast, the store clerk - all of them were wonderful - friendly, professional and helpful. (One desk clerk seemed to be having a bit of a bad day when I returned to pick up my forgotten item, but I, too, was feeling a bit rushed and inpatient - still, it was nothing that detracted from the overall experience). Perhaps tellingly, there seemed to be quite a few flight crews staying at the hotel. In my experience, I haven't found too many airport hotels that would be worth the visit besides the convienence - the SeaTac Marriott is an exception. It's a nice hotel, airport or not!

So then when we got to the room we were all trying to decide if we just wanted to order room service or go down to the restaurant. Boys decided restaurant would be good. Called the front desk to ask what time the restaurant closed, they said 10 pm. Well being that it was 8:40pm we made our way down to the restaurant only to find out that it was closed \"for the holiday\" ...again 4 days before the holiday. After explaining that we had just called and they told us it was open until 10 they recommend that we sit in the bar (with a 14 yr old). Bar told us go to the restaurant because 14 yr olds are not permitted in bar(DUH). FINALLY, they agreed to seat us and after all that BS we had a VERY good steak dinner. One of the BEST I had had in a while. All in all beautiful hotel, great food, crappy staff. Seemed like laziness if you ask me... closing for the holiday 4 days before the date.

It is located directly across the street from the airport, so it is a great location if you arrive on a late flight, or have to leave on an early flight. I arrived on a late flight. I slept in a bit the next morning, and never heard any plane noise, so the hotel is well sound proofed. The parking is restricted, but there is plenty available and it is free if you self-park. The lobby is unique and rustic, with plenty of overstuffed couches and fireplaces. My check-in went smoothly and I had a room on the 9th floor. (Note - another reviewer said there were only five floors; this is true in parts of the hotel, but there is an annex with 9 floors that is separate from the main courtyard area.) I ordered room service for dinner (the crab sandwich and a salad). The food was delivered promptly and was quite tasty. The room itself was small, as many airport hotels are since space is usually at a premium. The bathroom was particularly tiny. However, the bed was quite comfortable, and there was plenty of work space. There are also robes in the closet. The workout room was spectacular - one of the nicest anywhere. There were numerous ellipticals, treadmills, and bikes, all with personal TVs and headphones provided. There were also several weight machines. Fresh fruit was provided along with a refrigerator that offered cool towels. There were plenty of sanitizing wipes, cups, water, everything for an enjoyable workout. The pool area is quite lovely and peaceful. There are plenty of tables and chairs scattered around. Of course, I had to take photos of the huge totem pole. Very cute! The small gift shop has prepared items for a quick breakfast. I grabbed a fruit cup and a bagel and cream cheese and it was quite reasonable and fresh. Upon checkout, I was easily able to arrange to keep my car at the hotel for a few hours past checkout while my colleague drove us to a meeting. The front desk was very accommodating.

To complain about this, is like to complain about McDonald's charging for fries and a coke with a burger. If you don't like it, stay in a non-business class hotel. The reason they charge is because these are all reimbursable expenses for most business travelers. The reason Fairfield doesn't charge is because they are an economy hotel geared more toward thrifty travelers. So I have no complaints about the charges for extras because I expected it. I got this room on a Thursday and Friday for 129 which was a good value in my opinion. This is especially true considering I went to the flight museum and to Alki beach one of those days.

When returning to the desk to find out why, the bellman told me that the card readers hadn't worked for some time and that I needed to push the green button. Yet, there are no instructions that indicate such. The directions on exit were inaccurate (the West Exit Booth was not open and it was difficult to backup and exit). The parking charge was eventually comp'd, but not without considerable effort. The room rate came with a $25 Chevron Gas Card. No card was presented. The service at this property has definetly slipped. There are lots of other hotel choices in the airport area. The rate was $174and overpriced for the services.

The first stay was not the best, but the subsequent ones got better, and they have obviously taken some of the notes on the comment cards seriously. The hotel is located near SeaTac with a frequent shuttle. There is a tower, 8-9 floors high, and an atrium area that is about 3-4 floors high. Note, the tower rooms really have no view although some are advertised as having Mt. Rainier views. (Maybe before the trees grew!) Regardless of where you are, in the tower youwill be looking at the roof/ventilation or the roof/associate entrance. Avoid rooms ending in X16 and X18 as these are a bit noisy when the trucks show up. Odd numbered tower rooms will be a little noisy from the AC but frankly it wasn't as bad! The bathrooms are small, and double double rooms are a little crowded. King rooms seem bigger and have a chair and ottoman. All have been redone very recently but don't have the big flat screen TVs. The desk is pretty roomy and there is a cabinet and 2 small drawers...not the greatest storage. Rooms in the atrium area are noisier for some reason. Aside from the noise from the pool (and functions if there are any being held near the pool), it seems that the walls are thinner....last time, I actually thought someone left a cellphone in my room it was ringing so loudly. Food in the hotel is good-could be better. It is a bit pricy. The restaurant is due to be redone 1st quarter 2008. Desserts however, were tasty, and since I had some issues with my meals, they were free! Try the chocolate cake, it is VERY good! The lobby/bar are nice but the music is a lot too loud! One of the songs played has some sort of random spoken sounds...very disconcerting! Internet is part of the $9.95 wired for business package so if you don;t make calls, it's too expensive. I don't know when Marriott will get it through their brains...STOP CHARGING FOR INTERNET! There is a business center with 2 computers and an ethernet cable that you can use for free. Also, you can get free use of internet in the concierge lounge. There are only a couple other dining choices in walking distance (Dennys and 13 coins-which I think is also too expensive.) Other than that, and restaurants in other hotels, you need a car or a cab. Self parking is $16 per day, valet is $22-very high, but it's the norm for cities! Be careful in the shower...tubs can get slippery (I fell). I was able to get a rubber mat, but I also informed the GM and several other people of the situation, and that housekeeping needs to rinse carefully. The hotel is very clean. I even noticed a housekeeper vacuuming the rock wall outside of the restaurant. The staff was friendly, remembering me by name, and by my luggage-which seems to go someplace else when I come to Seattle! Seems that this is also a popular hotel with cruisers as there were a large number of folks heading off to Alaska on Vision of the Seas...maybe this is a Royal Caribbean pre-cruise hotel. Some people hate the pacific northwest design of the hotel-the lobby looks like a lodge. Frankly, I think it is appropriate for the area. There are plenty of places inthe area, but all in all this hotel is nice for flyers or anyone needing to be out inthe SeaTac area. It's about 30-45 minutes to downtown and you can hop on a bus at the airport (I also think there is a stop at the end of the hill) or drive.

It was an accessible room facing south. The photos show the room better than I can describe, but my impression walking into my room was \u201cthis is really nice.\u201d The Revive bed not only looks great but is super comfortable. The new desk was very functional. The separate box and wires for broadband internet connection are gone with the electronics hidden elsewhere. The cat 5 cable plugs directly into a panel on the desk which also has a bunch of electrical outlets. The new office chair was GREAT, being both functional and very comfortable. The arm chair and ottoman were new and comfortable. Lighting in the room was excellent. Each of the lamps was bright and all had electrical outlets in the base to accommodate cell phone chargers, etc. The bathroom is also completely new, floor to ceiling. The countertop is granite and the sink was large and deep. The showerhead was about eight inches in diameter which delivered a lot of water without being too strong. Lighting in the bathroom was good. The main lights turn off by themselves and a night light comes on automatically. I think the difference in the room being accessible is that it was a little larger than a standard room and did not have a closet door. The bathroom door was large and the vanity did not have any shelves under it so that someone in a wheel chair could easily use the sink. The combination tub and shower had hand rails and there was a shower chair in the bathroom. I had access to the concierge lounge on the 8th floor. It had also been complete renovated. My first morning hot entrees were scrambled eggs and bacon. The second morning scrambled eggs and port sausage. Besides the hot items there was everything you would expect on a continental breakfast buffet.

The Amex rate for this stay was $189 per night which was comparable to other hotels in the area. Taxes add about 12.5% to just about everything. The hotel has a fairly complete gift shop which was handy because I did not bring any liquids in my carry-on luggage. I was able to buy a small toothpaste and deodorant and I like the new Marriott shampoo and conditioner in the room. I have stayed at the Marriott Sea-Tac Airport hotel quite a few times.
