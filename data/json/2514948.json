There is a car park virtually beneath the hotel (although there is no concession for short stays) which is very convenient and the hotel itself is actually on Boulevard Saint Germain - next door to Cafe Lipp, across the road from Le DeuxMagots and Cafe de Flore. Not that we used any of these restaurants, as there are so many to choose from! And there is a Monoprix supermarket just around the corner!

We had a deluxe on the 1st floor (which is the 2nd floor to Americans) and enjoyed the room and its amenities. The bathroom was quite large for Europe standards and had an overhead shower. We loved the towel warmer as well. And the room was very quiet. The free wifi was decent, running around 5Mbps down/1Mbps up and easy to connect to. The staff never steered us wrong on dining recommendations and were happy to converse in English. There are ATM's just a few steps in either direction outside and the Metro stop is basically across the street. The hotel is easily within walking distance of the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay and Notre Dame. Also walk in literally any direction and you'll enjoy window shopping and a never-ending selection of cafes. The location is fantastic. Sweet tooth Tip #1: Get a Nutella crepe across the street in the street vendor's stand (open late).

The hotel is perfectly located especially if you like to walk as it was within walking distance for us of the Louvre, the Orsay, the Pompidou Center and Notre Dame. The rooms while small as is usual for Paris have updated bathrooms. It was a little tricky using the shower as it was not a fully enclosed tub so it was difficult to avoid getting water on the floor. However, the heated towel rack was fantastic. We loved the fact that the rooms came furnished with robes and slippers. If you like firm beds this is the hotel for you. I would have prefered a bit more give in the mattress, but that is such a matter of individual taste that 50% will like it and 50% will dislike it. Breakfast was included (although we learned for bookings after December 2011) breakfast would cost 14 Euros. If it had not been included we would have definitely eaten elsewhere. It is your typical hotel breakfast - cheese, bread, coffee, hard boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt and pastry. It was fine, but if you are paying my advice would be to go to a nearby cafe. The gentleman at the front desk, Aziz, was very helpful. He arranged for us to purchase our museum passes at a nearby Best Western and was always pointing us in the right direction for our excursions. The young man who was on the desk when we checked out was not as helpful. As we were handing in our key, he asked if we would like to pay.

When we first arrived we got the metro from gare de nord to saint germain de pre and were pleasantly surprised to find the hotel almost opposite the exit of the metro station. The hotel itself was very chic with a very friendly English speaking receptionist who put us in room 502 facing to the front with lovely views overlooking the city. The room was outstanding with fabric walls and an ornate decor huge bed chests for our bags and a fabulous bathroom I almost didn't want to leave it. Saint germain de pre is very central we decided to walk to the Eiffel tower which took us about 40minutes but was very straight forward and enabled us to see some other amazing buildings on our journey. On the way back we decided to grab a bike from one of the many bike stations dotted around the city this cost \u20ac1.70 although you will need a debit/credit card for the machine as it will pre authorise a deposit in case you don't return the bike. Every where is flat in Paris so riding a bike was a breeze and there are loads of bike stations to drop it off at when you are finished one just outside the hotel infact.

We booked a \"Deluxe\" grade room and requested an upper floor, non-smoking room. On arrival, Aziz at the front desk helpfully advised us that non-smoking rooms were limited and smaller. So we tried the \"smoking\" room (402) with our desired criteria at Aziz' suggestion and it was perfect. Not a hint of smoke smell in the immaculate room. As others have noted, rooms are on the small side, but there was plenty of storage for the contents of our large suitcases. The bathroom area was a bit odd, since the room door opens into the sink / tub / shower area. But the toilet is in a separate space with door and a sliding pocket door closed off the bath area from the bedroom/sitting area, so it worked out fine. Tub had hand and overhead shower heads, which were very convenient. Room AC was on and worked very well. So did the free wireless Internet. Although the hotel was fully booked, we heard not a peep from our neighbors either beside or above us. The clientele here is older and quiet. So if you want to party, go somewhere else!

As a solo female traveler who does not speak French, I enjoy the charming rooms, lovely reception staff and maid services, and lovely breakfast (included) at all 3 hotels.

I have stayed in the 16th, 8th, 5th, and 6th and find the 6th to be the most charming. Sometimes the church bells ring, summoning one to mass and transporting one back to the village life of medieval times. Riding the 63 bus, very convenient to the hotel, provides one as well with a free view, day and night, of most of the major sites of Paris (Louvre, Concorde, Grand Palais, National Assembly, Eiffel Tower). The subway is just across the street. Notre Dame is a 15-20 minute stroll away. I really enjoyed the Christmas Markets at both St. Germain and St. Sulpice (4 blocks away), especially the crepes and vin chaud after a snowy stroll. The same fair-booths were erected during my June stay for the \"Solidays\" events. While I found the famous cafes immediately adjacent (Lipp, Flore, Deux Magots) to be great for people watching from my hotel room, I chose to walk down to Rue de Seine/Rue Buci for different dining experiences. The recent World Cup matches made for a lively evening experience for the business traveler, especially during the France/Mexico match.

After resorting to an old Charming Hotels in Paris book I came across this hotel. I could not believe it ever existed, as it is located EXACTLY at my favorite crossroads in Paris, and I had never noticed it. Indeed, it is just a small door next to Brasserie Lipp. I was afraid as I arrived as the lobby didn't quite live up to the room pictures (I don't think it had the uplift that they had in the rooms), but a warm reception from Aziz and the updated lift dispelled the first impression. The room was absolutely like in the pictures, bed extremely comfortable, and furnishings visibly updated from the bathroom to the carpets, drapes and appliances. Thank god, not those dreadful red carpets from turn of the (last!) century and curtain fabric bed covers so common in would be classy Parisian hotels. The room was extremely clean, too. However, it was the view from my two windows, that looked on to the cafes on St Germain boulevard and the Church that really conquered my heart. That was really everything I could wish for!!! and unlike other guests, I didn't hear any noise from the streets, and had great sleep on all nights I spent there. Breakfast was plentiful, although they don't try to compete (maybe rightfully so) with the neighboring cafes, so you get filter coffee and little option of cooked meals, but remember it is included in the room price, a rarity in Paris. My only negative comment, as already mentioned in one of the earliest reviews, is that they still need to raise the 4 star level to the bathroom toiletries, which had a really poor selection. This hotel doesn't claim to be a boutique hotel, so don't expect evening turndown or honesty bars. This is a very well located, solid old school hotel, with friendly service (once again thank Aziz and Liberia at reception) and nicely appointed rooms. This will remain my top choice anytime I come back to Paris, and a prime alternative for anyone who loves St Germain and the Latin Quarter.

It is within walking distance of three separate metro lines, one being right across the street. You are a short walk (10-15 minutes) to the Louvre, the Orsay, and a number of other sights in the 5th and 6th arrondisments. Good restaurants nearby and right across the street and next door to three of the most famous of Paris' cafes. (We did not visit ourselves but did people watch when we walked by.)

Our room was a decent size, especially compared to other hotels in the area where we have previously stayed and where we had so little space that we had trouble walking around the room, the bed here was comfortable and the bathroom modern. I would suggest asking for one of the two front rooms on each floor (we were happy with room 101 and saw that 102 is even bigger and nicer--both rooms overlook the busy street and have big double windows that open so you can get fresh air and hear the sounds of Paris). I think 201 and 202, and 301 and 302 would have the same basic layout (realize that room 101 is actually on the 2nd floor, since 0 floor is the ground level). And, best of all, when the windows were closed, the room was quiet! There is a taxi stand in front and famous cafes across the street and next door, and we were not bothered by noise at all. I saw room 203 (expect that 103 and 303 would be similar) and it had a nice king bed but looks into a boring courtyard. Looking at the hotel floor plan, the remaining rooms (104, 105, and especially 106) seem like they would be smaller and also no view--I would much prefer the front rooms. It is a small hotel with about 18 rooms I think. We found we used the St. Germaine Metro station a lot, which was one block away, and we walked to the Louvre in about 10 minutes, plus you could walk to the Musee D'Orsay easily too. The breakfast included each morning was adequate, with slices of ham, cheeses, a basket of croissants and rolls, hard-boiled eggs, cereals, yogurt, orange juice, etc. in a nicely decorated dining area. There is a Monoprix store around the corner if you want to get some grocery items and we went there several times. The cafes are expensive but the food was good and you are paying to sit and watch the parade of Parisiennes and tourists who stroll by--we got used to 4 Euro Cokes and 6 Euro beer and 8-10 Euro drinks after a few days in Europe!
