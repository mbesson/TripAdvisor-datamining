The price of the hotel is certainly among the cheapest but the experience was terrible. Hence, if you are not that on budget, please choose some other hotel. Seriously!! Let me elaborate that: 1. The TV is those antique bulky kind and I often need to give it a hit to make the screen display images if not it will just stay black and play sound only, 2. The windows were sealed so we cannot open them and the air ventilation in the toilet is bad. So, if someone passes gas or takes a number one, then we have to open the room to ventilate the air. 3. The hotel is very stingy. There is some kind of chemical liquid in a container in the toilet that is for handwash, bodywash as well as hairwash. I really wonder what that is! Anyway, It is terrible. so if you are planning to stay there, please bring your toiletries. 4. Do not be fooled by the free internet access. it is only free for one person per room. how hilarious! they will give you a set of username and password that can be only used by one person for real. 5. The aircon is pretty old and it does not sync with the remote control well so the temperature always changes for some reason. I have caught a flu after a stay. so be careful if you are staying there. I hope this is useful.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dhaka", "Title": "\u201cI'will stay another hotel\u201d", "Author": "Zafrul_Hasan", "ReviewID": "UR117607932", "Content": "I was there in 2007 on my way back from China.

We checked a few hotels around and this was the cheapest we found in the area. I think we paid around SGD 100 for a standard room. We were soo lucky we got a lovely room at the top most floor of the hotel. Next time you go to this branch of hotel 81, ask for room 501. You can virtually climb on the root and watch the night skyline from there. YES! ROOFTOP! One thing though the lift only stops at 3rd floor so you got to lug your luggage all the way to 5th floor. When we stayed there, they had this rack of dirty towels and linen lying around all over the stairs to the 5th floor. We had to thread over it to get to our room. There's this small swing right outside our room and the nice balmy weather made it nice for us to drink and enjoy the skyline at night. The was one problem tho, the air cond was leaking and there was a towel placed underneath it to collect the puddling water. Typically Singaporean, the loo had combs and toothbrush. There was a bathtub too, and the water force was relatively good. The TV was too small tho..well all in all, I'd say this is a good place to stay at night, and 501 is so peaceful and quiet at night..", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wroclaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cQuiet hotel away from the center\u201d", "Author": "Rattaman", "ReviewID": "UR97492207", "Content": "The hotel is located in Chinatown, on the street with night clubs and nightlife.
