When I arrived, I was informed (incorrectly) that Priceline had canceled the reservation, and the hotel was now fully booked. I explained that one is unable to cancel a reservation via Priceline, but the hotel held firm. They sent me to a nearby hotel, still a 10 minute walk in the pouring rain with my luggage, for one night, then instructed me to return to the Little Palace for the second night, which I did. Despite this inconvenience and false information, I did not make a fuss. Late Friday night, I asked the hotel to call for me a taxi to a restaurant, which they did, bragging \"We have a contract with a taxi company and can get a taxi when no one else can.\" Sure enough, one came in 15 minutes. Then, when the restaurant could not get a taxi to take me back (it was 3:30am in Paris and taxis are hard to come by), the restaurant suggested perhaps my hotel could help. I said \"Yes, good idea, as they said they had a contract.\" The waiter came back stating \"Your hotel is very rude\" and explained the front desk said I should walk (apx 2 miles in a city I do not know well, at 3:30AM.) I phoned them and asked again, personally, if they could help. The person said he would make a call and I should call back. I asked the restaurant to phone back, and they told me he told them it was not his responsibility to help a guest get back to the hotel; only FROM the hotel. I have no problem with the hotel not being able to secure a taxi for me, as they are indeed hard to get late at night on a Friday. But to suggest a guest walk back at basically 4 in the morning for 2 miles in an unfamiliar city is ridiculous, and then after boasting they had a special relationship with a taxi company to say \"it is not my responsibility to help him get back\" just was too much. OK, so you can't find a taxi, but even the restaurant thought it was rude. So, I checked in, was sent away; and on my last night, was treated rudely.

I am not a big fan of this style of decoration but the style does not carry over to any of the other furnishings. The window drapes and room furniture are fairly comtemporary looking. So if you can live with those paintings on the wall, rest is all fine. The bathroom is modern as well, and even though small, it is very usable. Some reviewers have mentioned the elevator is small. Its in fact tiny. If you are with your spouse, its fine. Taking it with a business colleague - maybe take the stairs. But the hotel has a small number of rooms and at least when I visited, there was never much of a wait for the elevator. The stairs are right besides the elevator and so except when checking in and out (or otherwise carrying luggage), thats always an available backup for the lower few floors. Very close to two metro stations, both connecting multiple lines. Their driver also provides cab rides to the Orly and Charles De Gaulle airports for a fixed price, which is slightly higher than the cab fare for those routes, but can be charged to your room.

We would not advise walking nearby at night. \u2022 Do NOT order taxis. You will then pay additionally for the taxi from wherever he starts from to the hotel (this could be $30). Better go to the corner and hail a taxi. \u2022 Ask for more hangers or you won\u2019t be able to hang all your clothes.

No clothes dresser! \u2022 Our room electric went off our last night and was not repaired before we departed. \u2022 Look out for the mini-bar prices; they are truly expensive. Some Paris tips: \u2022 Some of the tours cost more than they\u2019re worth. Take a taxi to the Sacre Coeur and enjoy one of the many delightful nearby restaurants, many with music and entertainment. Taxis are there to take you back. \u2022 The food at the Moulin Rouge is only fair. Better have a great meal at a really good restaurant and then catch the early show, or wait in a very, very long line for the late show. The show is really great. \u2022 The Lido continues to be a spectacular show, better than most in Las Vegas. \u2022 Do take a cruise on the Seine River\u200e, especially in the evening to see the lights, but have dinner at a really good restaurant and only a glass of wine on the cruise. You\u2019ll love it! But look at the boats before you buy; some are great and some are old and shabby. You can also have a hop-on-hop-off cruise that stops at many of the attractions and permits you do debark, stay as long as you wish, and catch the next boat, all for a single fare. \u2022 The Louvre is not to be missed, but it is so large that you could not visit it all in a week! \u2022 Do get a really good Paris map or you will get lost! The free maps are too small and almost illegible or do not show many of the streets which may be very short. \u2022 Provide not less than 3 hours before your departure flight. The traffic will crawl and the lines for passport control and security are unbelievable. We made our flight only 5 minutes before departure and ran through the airport! \u2022 You will be exhausted when you leave Paris.

View fantastic but...Staff poor, no customer service of any sort. Attitude, extremely negative.

Also, taxi info, when the hotel orders you a taxi you are charged from the time dispatch sends them to your location meaning the fare could already be 18 Euro before you even get in the taxi. Yes this is customary, but very excessive dealing with Golden Palace Little Tulip. Ordered the hotels in house driver for trip to airport at the hotel rate of 55 Euro, confirmed and re-confirmed with front desk only to have a taxi waiting for me with the fare already at 20 euro, this was extreme nasty. I could of hired an outside car service and the entire fare would have been 55 Euro instead of the 80 Euro I ended up forced to pay. location of the Golden Tulip Little Palace was dicey, Rue Blondel is the place for prostitutes, which is around the corner, nothing I was interested in but there you are.

My hotel room was on the top floor and it's worth requesting one up there despite the slow lift, because I had a wonderful clear view of the Eiffel Tower and a glimpse of Notre Dame and the Hotel de Ville. My room was reasonably sized with a comfortable bed, plasma TV and clean bathroom. It also has a reasonably priced mini bar with beers, orange juice, mineral water and wine. The garden plaza out the front I found quaint, watching people play boules during the afternoon and certainly not seeing it as threatening as some have mentioned in other reviews.

Overall a very nice hotel, but lacks the 'wow' factor that people might be looking for if on a very special trip, but good value compared to a lot of other Paris hotels.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBeware III !\u201d", "Author": "ICY_8", "ReviewID": "UR13779752", "Content": "We booked a month ahead to stay 2 nights in this hotel, using the hotel website (Golden Tulip chain). I also telephoned to make very sure of our booking, and spoke to a gentleman whom I believe was the manager - he confirmed we had a superior room with balcony for the nights 9-11 February. When we arrived at about 3pm on Saturday 9 Feb, there were two young girls on reception. Just as we now see had occurred to two earlier reviewers, we were told our room was \"unavailable\" for that night, but would be ours for the Sunday night. No explanation was offered as to why our room had been given away, nor why we were not forewarned. We could even see at the desk the paper with our confirmed reservation on, taken out of the bookings register. Furthermore, when we asked to speak to the manager, the girls said we could not as \"he is at home, he does not work weekends\"! They then pointed out that they had no responsbility/accountability, as they were not the manager....Grudgingly, one girl 'phoned a \"similar hotel, round the corner\" which could take us for that night and we could return on Sunday to the Little Palace. Although inconvenient we tried to be reasonable, and walked to the other hotel. It was not near (1 km away). It was old-fashioned, not very clean, on a very noisy trunk road, and was - unsurprisingly - charged out at half the price. The room smelt of smoke too. We promptly used our mobile phone to book ourselves in for 2 nights at a good, if pricey, hotel in the area we had originally wanted. We returned, on foot with our cases, all the way back to the Little Palace to get in writing their acknowledgement that we were not staying with them and owed them no money, as they had our credit card details. This looks like a scam the manager is running. In 20 years I have never come across this problem before in Paris. I have informed the Golden Tulip, as their group reputation is being tarnished by this hotel's unacceptable behaviour.", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cbeware II\u201d", "Author": "dm214", "ReviewID": "UR13223537", "Content": "we booked the little palace 4 months in advance.

We booked a suite for 3 nights directly with the hotel six months in advance. We were travelling with our 14 year old son and needed a room large enough to accommodate 3 people, which is very difficult to find in Paris. When we arrived to check in we were told by Monsieur Ali at Reception that there was a \"problem\" with the suites and that none of them were available. The alternative was two rooms at opposite ends of the corridor - not suitable as we did not want our son in a room by himself. We explained this to Monsieur Ali and asked him to explain exactly what the problem was with the suites. He was very rude and evasive but after having a stand up argument with him he told us that the suite was already occupied and would not be available for 2 of the 3 nights of our stay. We then asked him to find us alternative accommodation. He refused to do this. By this time it was early evening, and having no alternative accommodation we spent the first night in a small cramped room with a roll away provided for our son. The suite did become available the next day but the whole situation by this time had left us feeling very disappointed with the hotel.

The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. There is the issue with the park across the street with homeless men living there. And yes, they do tend to get a bit loud at each other. But never once did they show any disrespect to people passing by. Our room faced the park, so when in the room I viewed their behavior. Another reviewer mentioned stale urine smell coming from the park. News flash.....all of Paris smelled like stale urine. The hotel was very clean and convenient to all the attractions. The rooms were a bit tiny, but comfortable. I would recommend the Little Palace Hotel to anyone visiting Paris. I surprised my mom with this trip to see Il Divo in concert at the Paris-Bercy. I had the tickets sent to the hotel. I didn't know the tickets were being sent registered mail. I happened to use my husbands credit card to purchase the tickets. My husband did not join us on this trip. The post office would not release the tickets to me, only the person to whom the letter was addressed. Even though I had all documentation and proof what was in the envelope. Since there was the language barrier, it was very difficult for me to communicate with the postmaster. The young gentleman at the front desk of the hotel was an enormous help. He spent so much time being my personal translator and never once seemed annoyed. I did get the concert tickets and only by my husband faxing over a letter to the postmaster stating his permission to give me the envelope. The whole episode was a nightmare, but could have been worse if not for the Little Palace Hotel's staff member.
