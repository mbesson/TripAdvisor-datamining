When we checked into this hotel I thought that maybe they forgot to clean the room. I actually asked the staff if they had a clean room to which they promptly replied that they clean the rooms daily. The pillows looked like somebody already slept on them. The furniture was covered in dust. The bed spread was disgusting. The windows were cracked and mouldy. The tiles in the bathroom were cracked. The towels were filthy. The carpet was stained and damaged. The couch and chairs were dirty and coming apart. The staff was nice enough, but the hotel is a dump and would not recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago Ill.", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice!\u201d", "Author": "duncanz2121", "ReviewID": "UR58223108", "Content": "I'll tell you what..Nice location.close to La Zona Rosa(relatively speaking) and a great value..Staff was courtious friendly and spoke English well...Will go back this year hopefully!", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Sybharis", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d1449252-Reviews-Hotel_Sybharis-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$46 - $52*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Sullivan 163-B</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Col.
