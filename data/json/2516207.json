We made a reservation for a \"guest room\" and were pleased to find it was a suite. The sitting area alone was 12' x 15', outfitted with a big L-shaped couch that folded out to a Queen bed, a big ottoman, business desk, wet bar and dresser. It was separated from the sleeping area by an attractive partial wall/room divider. The decor was modern but warm, not stark, and the room was immaculate. Everything--hallways, elevators, carpets--were spotless. The beds and pillow were comfy, and the air conditioner magically kept the room at the perfect temp noiselessly. There were marble countertops, a full length mirror. In-room Wi-Fi was painless to log onto, didn't need a passcode. A swiveling 42\" flat screen TV allowed us to watch from just about anywhere in the room. There was plenty of parking and a security guard was walking around the grounds at night. Late check-in was no problem as the desk is staffed 24 hours. The check-in desk is continuous with the cocktail bar, which I thought was a little unusual. All the staff were courteous and friendly regardless of the time of day. Continental breakfast was standard fare of oatmeal, cereal, muffins, toast, bagels, and fruit, stepped up a notch with nice plates and Starbucks coffee. An added nice service was a computer screen in the breakfast area where you could swipe your key card and order a hot entree (like a breakfast burrito) and have it charged to your room. The downsides: Our room faced the freeway so there was ongoing traffic noise, not enough to keep us awake but if you are a light sleeper you may want to request a room on the other side. The bathroom light/fan was loud and the shower squealed, also the sink was outside of the shower area so it was hard to use it and not wake your hotel-mate. Our key cards didn't work well at the back door so we had to swipe and swipe several times before it would let us in. Not enough to prevent us from coming back though. It's a short drive to restaurants, fast food, and stores, and easy to find just off the freeway.

I was so glad I found this gem! However after being greeted and assisted so courteously during such a busy time of year (Spring Training) AND with a last minute need for a room, my gladness turned into pure jubilation! The rate was extremely reasonable, especially after I got to my room. I did no prior research into this property, in fact it was my partner's decision to check it out. The lobby is cute and modern, and the staff members were more than happy to give me a tour of the floor's amenities. The interior of the hallways were nice and the room was even nicer. It was very modern, with a comfy sofa and ottoman, a sink area for dishes as well as a mini fridge. The bed area separated by a nicely adorned wall and the washing area lit and maintained well (the marble was a nice touch!) The bathroom was a little small, but then again you're not in there for very long. The bed was extremely comfy! The sheets were nice and so was the down comforter. The real show stopper was the gorgeous 42\" HDTV. It was the center of the room and pivoted to accommodate bed or sofa viewing. For the price this place was amazing. I've stayed at resorts that cost more and weren't nearly as nice. Add on the fact that you are able to order movies in room that are still in theater and this makes for a great hotel for when you're travelling with a loved one and just want to get away for a nice evening out. The continental breakfast offered the next morning was great as well! Not only did they have Starbucks and Tazo teas on tap, but they carried high quality jams, marmalade, juices and milks as well. Fantastic! And if the free breakfast wasn't enough, you could order food from the kitchen, talk about convenience. The checkout process was even easier, with options to check out from the room, a kiosk out in the lobby or in person at the front desk.

We gave him our reservation information. He made sure there was a room available for us and checked us right in. The hotel itself is very modern and clean. This hotel is a Hyatt Place, so if you are used to the Grand Hyatt or Hyatt Regency ,this is a much smaller facility. Our room was spacious. It had a living area with a sofa bed, a wet bar and refrigerator. It was stocked with the customary Hyatt toiletries, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, etc. We tried to take a nap but since our room was on the side facing the freeway there was a bit of noise from the traffic. After approx 2-3 hours of the traffic noise, we called the front desk to see if they could move us to a different room. Much to our surprise Mario went out of his way to make sure he found us a room away from the freeway noise. We can not emphasize how much we appreciated the outstanding customer service provided to us from this young man. Once we settle in we went out to grab something to eat. Having Poppadeux seafood restaurant next door was a bonus! They have amazing seafood dishes! Our trip was mainly for the St. Louis Rams vs. Arizona Cardinals game.

The hotel is typical of the Hyatt Place brand. It feels like a recent renovation and is nicely decorated, with a large open area lobby and plenty of parking. The room I was given was large with the usual weird arrangement of furniture that makes it impossible to watch television if you are using the kitchenette area or the work desk. The living area and bedroom were bright and nicely decorated, clean, and comfortable. Like most Hyatt Place's, the bathroom was a step below the rest of the room: small, practical, with a really loud fan (you turn on the light and you get a lot of fan noise, too). Water pressure was awful, and the water never really got hot. I do love Hyatt's soap though. The worst thing about the room was the linen on the bed, which was very course and scratchy. I am rarely bothered by this but the sheets were so uncomfortable that I had trouble sleeping. The second worst thing was the internet, which was barely usable. It connected fine, but had so little bandwidth that I gave up trying to work with it. The breakfast was nice. I went as soon as it opened so everything was fresh and plentiful, except for seating. There were only five people at breakfast but the layout of the tables and chairs in the hotel lobby actually made it awkward; it's designed for groups to dine together, not for business travelers. The exercise room has three pieces of cardio equipment. The business center worked fine for me to print some things. I stayed here because the rate was good, and I feel I got what I paid for.

We had not been to the Phoenix area in quite a few years so really did not have a clue to what hotel we were going to stay at. After reviewing a few hotels we decided to stay at the Hyatt Place Phoenix North. The rate seemed good, the photos and reviews of the property made it looked acceptable. When we arrived we had the choice of a self check in kiosk or the one person who was checking people in, we chose the kiosk, simple and easy. We needed to head to the grocery store and a gas station so we asked the young gal at the front desk (I have indicated she was young because she did not know where anything was located.) We were sent by this gal in opposite directions one was in a very bad part of town the other in halfway decent part of town. In the morning when it was time to take a shower there was hardly any water pressure and it took 5 minutes to get warm water (What a waste of water, when there are signs everywhere to please conserve.) We then went down to the \u201cContinental Breakfast\u201d When we arrived it was 9:20 AM the workers were literally forcing the coffee pumps out of our hands! They could not get cleaned up fast enough plus were extremely rude. We then decided to take off and grab a bite somewhere else. We exited our room at 9:45 AM. Put the privacy sign back inside and went on our merry way. When we came back at 5:00 PM we noticed when we got off the elevator there was a table full of dirty dishes that had not been cleaned up from the morning (I assume these were plates from other rooms left there.) We then found that the maid decided not to clean our room. I called the front desk; she was extremely nice and said I will have housekeeping give me a call. Well housekeeping called I told them to just bring us towels. A woman brought the towels and told me the maid left at 3:00PM so no one was there to clean the room! The hotel also did not seem very secure the doors to the outside were not locked and there wasn\u2019t any security that we could see.

They looked after us, helped me get our car exchanged (only took 9 phone calls), let us use the internet all night till we booked our flights and accommodation to Ohio so we could make the funeral, let us use the phone at Front Desk so we incurred no fees. We also had to cancel the next 3 nights accommodation etc etc. They were so supportive and helpful, organised taxis, made sure we ate and in all honesty although the 2 previous hotels we'd stayed at in San Diego and LA were great, I don't believe for a minute they were 1 inch as helpful as these guys. Not only, this, they let us leave our car in their car park, stored all our luggage and had a room ready for us should we wish to stay another night when we returned. Without these guys the whole nightmare of finding out about my father in law, a broken down car, would have been 10 x worse. What fantastic service - you can't even dream that a team would be so helpful.. . The hotel rooms were great, the food great, the helpfulness of staff great....

If you are looking for a real kitchen, head for the nearby Candlewood Suites or possibly the Homewood Suites. The hotel staff was great, providing friendly and prompt service. The housekeeping was fine, although they didn't always leave the full complement of drinking glasses, no biggie. The continental breakfast was satisfactory, with an array of fresh fruit, breads and bagels, and cereals. Cooked items cost extra.

There are two computers with internet access in the business center. A few problems kept me from giving this hotel a higher rating. Foremost, the shower was unsatisfactory. The pressure was low and the temperature was only lukewarm the first morning. I complained to the front desk, who noted it on their maintenance sheet. The next day, the pressure was a bit better, but the temperature was still lacking. After speaking with some of my fellow lodgers, I found that there were all sorts of problems. In addition to those similar to mine, others complained that the water was too hot. One mentioned that he turned on the shower about ten minutes before he got in, so I tried this on my last day. It worked, but what a waste of water! Another issue was that the switches on the lights near the bed did not work very well. One was so stiff that I was afraid that it might short out, so I unplugged it. Finally, I think this hotel has very few outgoing phone lines. I needed to call my airline, and over the course of a half hour, I kept getting a busy signal. I dialed using my cell phone and got through immediately.
