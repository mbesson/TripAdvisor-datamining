All other rooms do not have any decoration let alone anything close to what the website shows. I had to complain forcefully to get an upgrade. I am sitting in the 'superior' room right now and it has a stench similar to urine cakes. The floors are dusty and the bathroom wall has hair stuck to the tiles. I have switched rooms twice now and the issues are the same. Don't expect to take a nap when you get here either.

The downsides of the hotel are actually nothing to do with the hotel at all, just the fact that it is on the rambles, which is home to some of the most inventive thieves in Europe, particularly noticeable in the evening. I have never been to Barcelona without hearing of someone getting mugged or robbed in some way. You should be ok if you are aware of this, hold on tight to your stuff and don't go wandering around drunk on your own at night. To stress again, this is nothing to do with the hotel, just the Ramblas area in general in the evening.

This is probably my 10th visit to Barcelona and the International Cool Hotel is by far the best hotel I have stayed in and wonderful value for money. The hotel is located on La Rambla, approximately middle to lower end, right opposite the Liceu Opera Theatre. If you didn\u2019t want to make the 5 minute walk from Placa de Catalunya to the hotel then you could disembark the Metro directly outside! Although the entranced to the hotel is discreet once we entered the glass lift to our floor you see the full scope of the light, airy and contemporary hotel. We had a twin room, it was lovely and clean with simple modern decorations, a beautiful little bathroom (well it was a shower room really as there was no bath) and double doors opening on to the neighbouring side street with a view to the left of La Rambla. Even if the room was a little small by some people\u2019s standards I feel that in this price range I would rather have the nice modern surroundings than bags of floor space. The bed was extremely comfortable and the towels were nice and soft and in the bathroom there was a good hairdryer and the usual complementary bits and pieces. Breakfast is served on the first floor in a gorgeous room over looking La Rambla. They had a good selection of meats, cheeses, fruits, cereal and some delicious pastries. They also offered scrambled eggs, bacon, fried potatoes and cooked tomatoes, all very good. It was the attention to detail that really impressed me with this hotel not only with the d\u00e9cor and furnishings but the laptop computers dotted around with free internet access and the complimentary drinks cupboards on the landings of each floor, all really nice touches. My final comment is for the street bar located on the Rambla, this is owned by the hotel and it only added to our experience. The bar tender Ramon worked tirelessly to tend all of his guests whilst going back and forth to the bar on the first floor. This really is a great spot to relax and enjoy a beer.

The full hotel seems to pay a tribute to the May 68 events in France which seems confusing at first, but which then gives its \"cool\" spirit to the whole building. Breakfast is good, with fruits, eggs & bacon, cheese, yogurt bread, and cereals. If you're looking for a good value for money hotel, on the Ramblas and in front of the Liceu Theatre then this is definitely the one to choose.

Couldn't relax in the room at all so it felt like we spent the whole 5 days on our feet. On a plus, the location is great. I really regret not booking into the HUSA Oriental instead, which is on Las Ramblas the same, but a little closer to the harbour. I also found it at a cheaper rate!

It was very clean but there were no elevators and there are no rooms on the ground floor! Dragging your luggage up the various levels of stairs is a real pain.

There was no breakfast at the Hotel but we bought a voucher from them and we were able to have Breakfast in one of the other Hotels accross the Street. It was a buffet Breakfast and it was fantastic for just a little over \u20ac7.00 each per Morning. Our room was a bit on the small side but that did not bother us really The Hotel is so near to everything and the buzz on the La Rambla is super. The Harbour is just about 5 mis walk from the hotel and a lot of the beautiful places to visit are within walking distance. Of course I being a person who loves to shop was in my eliment because all of the Shops were around me. The Weather was just beautiful.

Round the corner, the Gothic quarter starts, 5mins walk down La Rambla to be by the sea, 5 mins walk the other way to be at Placa de Catalunya... (ideal for transport to/from the airport). The hotel was clean, the staff at reception nice and helpful. The room was small, yes... but reasonably small, and clean which is more important...
