First, let me say that we are very budget conscious travelers (in our late 50's to early 70's) and like to see and do as much as possible (we don't spend much time in our room...we are too busy nosing about) without breaking the bank in doiing so. With that said, we were pleasantly surprised by our room at the Marsala. The location is just great...a perfect base for sightseeing (trains, buses and metro all depart from Termini). The hotel is, literally, across the street from Termini station (take the Marsala exit from the station). Our room was on the top floor (I think there were only 2 on this floor) ...ask for a room on the top floor if possible, had a nice little balcony overlooking via Marsala, tv, fridge, safe and bathroom. Breakfast was included and was fine...no gourmet experience, but just fine for us. We dined at various venues for lunch and dinner. There is also a laundry nearby if needed. The desk staff was pleasant and our room was cleaned daily with fresh towels. We arrived in Rome at about 8pm (tired), took the express train from Fiumicino airport and walked to our hotel from the station. Simple!! On our previous trip to Rome, we stayed at a 4 star hotel. The room was NOT much better than our room at the 2 star Marsala, but the cost was much higher and the location not nearly as convenient. Beds were hard at both 4 star and 2 star hotels. However, we were so exhausted after a full day of activitiy we had little problems getting to sleep.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mayo, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value beside train station\u201d", "Author": "baxter1", "ReviewID": "UR120365235", "Content": "This is not a five star property, but for the money you pay it is great value.
