I reserved two night's but had to leave Rome one day earlier. When I arrived, I asked the hotel (which for some reason is written on HostelWorld as a Hostel, which it is not in any way), to cancel my second night. As It did say on the website that the hostel policy allows you to cancel up to one day prior, I couldn't understand why they would not try to help me out. I talked to the manager, and was even more surprised when he just tried to get more money out of me... I wish I had something good to say about the place, I saw the rooms, they looked ok, but everything was dark and filled with bad vibes.

It cannot be called a hotel. It is not a standalone place, it is part of a residential building that houses other entities. Maybe it should be renamed to a guesthouse, at most. The WiFi works only in the tiny \"lobby\" which is a room in a former apartment. The elevator is truly ancient and is used by the staff during the day so it's hard getting up and down the steep stairs. There is no secure luggage storage. The TV and AC remotes missing - so I could not sure. Bad noise insulation and loud traffic from street. There were ants in the room (though this doesn't bother me as much). There is no character. As you can tell by the low price, there is not much activity in the area at night, it's almost a dead zone. As I paid 35 euro for a singe room en-suite and stayed there only 1 night, I could put up with it. I would not schedule a multiday vacation or a romantic trip in this place - it would be embarrassing.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cWorst Place Ever Seen...\u201d", "Author": "ashabella02", "ReviewID": "UR106000677", "Content": "I have never been so offended by a hotel like I was with Hotel Lella. They make you pay up front because they know once you see the room you will run for the door. First of all, the hotel is a hallway, nothing more. Their version of cleaning our room was taking out the clothes of whoever was living in our room before we arrived. There was old bacon left in the mini-fridge. Our window/balcony wouldn't close and the hotel is on the first floor...perfect for robberies. We were afraid the staff was going to rob us as well. We did not feel safe and therefore told them we were not going to stay there. The staff is not helpful and kept passing us on to other staff who were supposed to be able to get us our money back. This vicious circle continued. The room was dark and I would be afraid to get under those sheets. The place looked like it was crawling with bed bugs and other undesirables.

We were booked for 3 nights at another hotel, checked in there and were escorted a block and a half down the street to this crummy hotel. This should have been our first clue, but we went along. The room was musty, walls were filthy and in a state of repair, so there was just rough plaster in many areas. The bed was like sleeping on a hard slab and the room was cold. Amenities ? We had to ask for towels; there was no soap, shampoo or even a glass to pour our water into. The bathroom was totally gross. The linen was clean but the bedspread had cigartette burns and stains. The TV probably worked, but there was no remote; howerver the refrigerator didn't work and there was no lock on the safe. When we asked to be moved we were told this was their nicest room. The hotel staff was rarely at the desk, and were difficult to communicate with. There was no breakfast at this hotel- if we wanted to eat we had to get dressed and walk to the original hotel. The sign on the wall indicated this was a HOSTEL. Even for a hostel this place was a disgrace. Our bed was made one day, but other wise not serviced at all. The morning we checked out I discovered several bites on my leg and foot- I suspect these were from bedbugs. Do not stay at this hotel or hostel- Rome has so much to offer it's not worth ruining your vacation.

The linens were threadbare; I could see holes in the fitted sheet. The blanket looked like it hadn't been washed since 1980. The bathroom smelled like sewage. The worst part of it all-- I got BED BUG bites the next day. Thanks God I didn't take them home with me, but that is seriously unhygienic. As far as breakfast went, my sister stayed for 3 nights and was not once served any. I heard it's nothing to write home about, but the fact that it wasn't even given was awful.

Well, to be fair, it was not *terrible*. There were no rats or bugs or anything like that. But I would not stay here again. First, we booked a triple. That to them apparently means a double bed and a small single bed - a bit awkward for three guys. To top that off though, the room was extremely cramped - it was very hard to maneuver around with suitcases and luggage strewn about. There was also only one working power outlet if I recall (and one in the bathroom), so we all had to take turns charging our gear. Second, the service. Terrible. The woman at the desk, nor any one else as far as I could tell, could speak a word of English. They also only accepted payment in cash, and in advance. One minor thing that did get on my nerves - the towels. The towels are the polar opposite of soft; they are coarse and rough. Not a huge problem, but think about it - what does it say about a hotel that won't splurge an additional few dollars to get some nice soft towels? The 'breakfast' that was included was a very small glass of juice and a wrapped sugar croissant. Internet and laundry facilities are off-site, and you only get 15 minutes free per day. Overall, absolutely not worth it. It's within walking distance to the train station, but that means it's a hike from anywhere you need to be in the rest of Rome. We extended our stay in Rome.
