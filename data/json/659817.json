I wanted someplace relatively cheap (87 euro) and close to the train station. Didn't know it was a Catholic conference center. Not sure what the other poster said in German but I bet it was good. The hotel was quiet, close to lots of restaurants, and had a first-rate breakfast. Free internet connection in the room. Obviously, party animals should look elsewhere because it's about as low-key as you can get. Modern but nothing fancy about it, either. If you want plain and simple (and neat and quiet), it's the place to go.", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Aquino", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d659817-Reviews-Hotel_Aquino-Berlin.html", "Price": "$77 - $151*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Hannoversche Strasse 5b</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Tagungszentrum Katholische Akademie</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10115</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "659817", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5a/ff/5aff77959b478249788774791268a5e78large.jpg"}}
