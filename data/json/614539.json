{"Reviews": [{"Content": "2nd. visit just as nice as the 1st. This is my second stay, and it was just as great as the first. I stayed from June 13 until June 18, 2008. We stayed in a 2 bedroom this time as opposed to the 1 bedroom we stayed in last time. It was very quite, we were on the bottom floor, and only heard noise maybe one time from the unit above. And that was when they were running water. The staff was just as nice this time as they were a year ago when we were there. I would stay here again in a heart beat. As a matter of fact, we will be staying again in August 2008.

We were a group of four adults. This is a quiet resort (at least it was in May). Our unit was spacious and clean. The kitchen was equipped with basics like dishes, cutlery and pots and pans. There were no mixing bowls, colander, etc. so it would be difficult to prepare a real meal but it was great for breakfasts, etc. The beds were comfortable and the linens/towels were of good quality. The pullout couch was not the best (apparently sagged in the middle). We had an attached garage which was extremely convenient, plus the car stayed nice and cool. The complex has a nice pool and hot tub, a small fitness center and a couple of computers with internet for public use. There was complementary coffee/tea/water in the clubhouse, plus newspapers and magazines. Canyonview backs on to the most amazing natural area, which is fantastic for hiking in the morning and looking at the stars at night. The location is excellent. Very close to Arizona Mills Mall and close (but not TOO close) to the highways to get one out town easily for day trips. There is a good grocery store (Fry's) nearby, plus there are several restaurants nearby (within 5 minute drive or 15 minute walk). All the staff were friendly and helpful. The complex and the neighbourhood seemed very safe. We had housekeeping service on the Wednesday of our week. I would say this place wouldn't be appropriate for people who want to party but we would stay here again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "May 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR176191935", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JWren"}, {"Content": "Worst experience in 25 years Where do I start? To find it, you drive through a business park area to find an older, 2-story converted condo complex in a remote area. There is no food service in the immediate area, no room service or maid service. Apparently there is also no security in the complex. My ground floor room had both a sliding glass door  regular door to the rear of the condo. I did not feel safe. For example, on the older sliding glass door, there was only a cheap flip lock with no drilled pin or even a safety bar. The screen door was off track  rusted. I was unable to pull it into the fully shut position. I was in a 1-bedroom condo, so yes there was more space than a regular standard hotel room. However, my room was dark  decorated in putty-like colors circa early 90's. The cement patio in the rear had no table or chairs to enjoy the outdoors. When I went to the front desk to tell the female clerk I wanted a safer second floor room, she informed me it was an upgrade and I would have to pay an additional $35 per night. I was shocked  stunned. As a woman traveling alone I never stay in hotels on the ground floor. In addition, I've never been told that I had to pay more money to achieve a basic sense of personal safety. Then when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I discovered there is no internet access in the room. Apparently the only internet access is in their office area. Both the hotel manager  desk clerk were unresponsive  indifferent to my concerns. For the first time in 25 years of business travel, I decided to check out after 30 minutes. I stayed at another hotel (Marriott) where I felt safe. Without a doubt, this was the worst so-called resort experience in 25 years of national travel. I would never have knowingly selected a property where I had to stay on the ground floor in an unsafe room or had no internet access. I selected the property based on the information on the Orbitz web site which stated both internet and wireless internet. I feel ripped off  duped. Because it was prepaid reservation Orbitz said too bad. The resort manager said we're taking your money, you prepaid. On the positive side, there did appear to be some desert hiking trails nearby. However, there was also a public parking lot at the entrance to the property, so you could enjoy the trails without having to stay at this disappointing property.", "Date": "Mar 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR110601666", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "FemaleTraveller876"}, {"Content": "A great vacation We were just there the last week in Feburary 2008 and hope to return.

The buildings were lovely, spacious rooms but the renovations had been done on the cheap - eg: cheap MDF cupboard doors and interiors that are hard for housekeeping to keep clean, mismatched crockery and bent cutlery, a waste disposal that didn't work and most of all, when we went to use the oven (which was all stained and marked on the top - so obviously had not been replaced) it was absolutely filthy inside. The location of the property was terrible (in the middle of offices and places of work). There were very little evening activities and if one was interested in something such as dreamcatcher making - or the like - you had to sign up for it 48 hours in advance. On vacation, I don't always know what I'm doing or where I'm going to be 48 hours in advance.

When we showed up to get our room, we were told we had booked a 1 bedroom, 1 bath for four adults (women). I explained that was not correct and asked to speak to the manager. He looked at the reservation, and explained I was wrong.

The clerk standing by corrected him and explained that I was quoting the correct amount that I had been given when the reservation was made.When I again explained the error was on the resorts part, the manager asked me if I was accusing his staff of lying. I told him, No, his staff had made an error.
