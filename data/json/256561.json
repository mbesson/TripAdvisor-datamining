It was painted dark charcoal gray which would usually make me think \"UGH!!\" but it was really quite beautiful. There was no view from the window. It looked out into a little courtyard, so while there was nothing to see, at least there was natural light.

Due to it being so close to the ground you really could feel people could see in. This was a shame as we had to keep the curtains drawn all the time. The room was very dark and not much natural light come in the very small window even with the curtain open. The bed was comfortable and gave for a good night sleep. The bathroom was very small (you could only fit one person in at a time) and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much room to store your personal stuff. The staffs were helpful and helped us get a courtesy bus back to the airport (which you had to pay for). As we arrived late on Thursday night we got room service this was not that good and very expensive (would recommend looking for a restaurant in the area). Overall very expensive hotel for what you got but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for location location then this is the right hotel for you.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bairnsdale, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot Impressed.\u201d", "Author": "Mark M", "ReviewID": "UR120401138", "Content": "My wife and I stayed in mid October.

My wife and I visit Sydney several times a year and normally stay at another hotel, but this was a special occasion (a milestone birthday for my wife) and I decided to pay more, for the harbour view. Due to the significant gap between the booking and the stay I confirmed the booking (with the hotel itself, not a booking agency) two days before we left for Sydney. The gentleman checked the records and the booking was confirmed with no additional comments. In order to show my wife where we were staying, the day before we left I showed her the video which was running at the hotel website and showed the views from a Harbour View Room. She was looking forward to the stay. When we arrived at the hotel on a Saturday afternoon, with a full schedule of activities to follow, the room I was allocated had no harbour view. I was then told that due to internal renovations and a renovation in an adjoining building there were no Harbour View rooms. I complained and explained that had I been told that when I had rung two days earlier I would have stayed elsewhere. (I also found another person complaining about the same problem, and another the next morning.) As I had a series of appointments and no time to spare I was then shown three different rooms , in ascending order of quality. The first was very small, just above the street and when I asked it was confirmed that I could expect it to be noisy that night (a Saturday). I would rate it two star! The second was tiny, had exposed plumbing and painted timbers in the ceiling (a \"heritage\" room apparently) and views of adjoining steel roofs and building infrastructure. I would rate it less than two star. The third room was bigger, a good size, and again above the road but up another level and said to be not as noisy as the first. Time was running out and we took it along with the comment that we would be recompensed for the \"inconvenience.\" It is a good three star room. The recompense we were offered was a complimentary breakfast both mornings of our stay, free wine or drinks at the bar either of the two nights, a discount on the room and the attention of the manager (who would be appraised of the situation) when he was on duty the following Monday when we were due to depart. We ate the breakfasts. When we went for our free drinks on the Sunday night we found the bar was not open that night. When I went to pay the account on the Monday morning I was presented with a bill for more than my original booking amount. The manager was nowhere to be seen. I complained and was offered a discount of $20 per night. Asked if I was happy with this I said no but as I was sick of discussing the matter would pay it as I didn't have time to argue any more and had better things to do. The staff I spoke to were not particularly concerned about what had occurred. I should comment that the young lady who showed us the rooms was extremely nice and helpful. Management is a joke however.

When we got to our new room the air con in that room didnt work either but because it was late at night we just wanted to sleep. The room we got moved to had a view of the Sydney Opera House, which your supposed to pay extra for but i wouldnt recommend paying the extra to get the view as you can see it if you walk 2 minutes from the hotel. Another problem we encountered with this hotel was that we asked the hotel receptionist to book us a taxi for a few hours away. We came down on time and waited in reception for our taxi, still no word 10 minutes later, the receptionist assured us it would be here soon its just running late, another 10 minutes passed still no word, so she helped us flag down a taxi for a few minutes as we needed to get to central station. The taxi still never showed so we got our own taxi. Another thing to note about this hotel is they dont have a lift - they have a small luggage lift - when we arrived we went to put our luggage in here but it was filled with bed sheets so we had to carry 3 cases up 2 flights of stairs, which wasnt too easy!

Our room on the first floor was very comfortable...a small reception area complete with Victorian fireplace leading to the bed area complete with wardrobe and all the usual things like safe / fridge / television / coffee maker etc. The bathroom was small, but absolutely adequate and everything was in good order.Even though the room looked on to the street, it was very quiet and we had no issues with noise at all. When we booked on line we did not take the optional breakfast for AUD$23pp as this seemed quite steep for a continental breakfast, but when we checked in we were offered breakfasts for AUD$15 which was much better. The breakfasts were lovely and very relaxed in the breakfast room that also opened out to a small balcony for 'al fresco' dining. The staff were all very friendly and efficient and we found the cost reasonable compared to the other hotels in the area - that said, Sydney is centainly not a 'value' destination and we found most things quite a bit more expensive than the major centres in the States and Europe.

I can't speak highly enough of this Hotel. The staff, the location and the quality of the hotel were all excellent.

The hotel is a boutique hotel in a quiet side street 5 minutes walk from the harbour side. The area is quite hilly so might not suit those with mobility problems and the hotel does not have a lift, but with only two floors this was not a problem and there is a dumb waiter system for your luggage which is helpful. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel which was not a problem as there were plenty of cafes and bars very close which served high quality food for a fraction of the price of the hotel breakfast. In saying that we did order room service one night and although it was the usual fare it was tasty and reasonably priced with good sized portions. My sister had ordered us a bottle of sparkly and chocolate strawberries as a surprise on our arrival and she found the whole process hassle free and the staff were very accommodating. It was also reasonably priced and a very much appreciated surprise! The room was nice and big and well maintained. We also had a seating area comprising sofa, arm chair and coffee table. We also had a mini bar (again reasonably priced) and a tv etc. The bathroom was a good size, with a bath, and well stocked with toiletries which were replaced daily. The staff at this hotel could not do enough for you. We flew to Sydney from Melbourne with Tiger airways (a nightmare btw) and Anabele on the front reception kindly offered to print out our boarding passes for us. She was unable to do this due to Tiger airlines awful website however she did spend time on this task and researched it thoroughly so that we were adequately equipped with enough information to refuse to pay the extra charge at the airport for not checking in online. The Rocks area was just beautiful. Lots of restaurants, shops and cute alleyways to explore. You are centrally located for accessing all points of interest and even if the weather is not great, as it was when we were there, you will still find plenty to do. We went to see toy story 3 in 3D at the IMAX which was pricey but is the largest IMAX screen in the world and it was certainly an experience worth having.

As others state, it is right in the heart of the Rocks district and accessible to many of the activities that we participated in during our stay (the zoo, aquarium, circle quay, botanical garden, etc. We had to take the ferry to the zoo and aquarium, but the walk there it is not long). There are many restaurants in walking distance as well. The hotel itself is average, and we had to walk up quite a few stairs to get to our room (I think two flights, plus another to the penthouse), but it was a good workout! Accommodations - Amazing! We had a K size bed in the master room, which was quite big, full size kitchen and living room with a sofa sleeper. We brought in a rollaway so each of our children could have a bed. The King bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was convenient to have with kids. We had no noise issues (although we heard something that sounded like a generator from the master bedroom, but it didn't prevent us from sleeping). Views - Amazing! Seriously, we had our own private deck with a view of the city and Opera House. We must have taken a hundred pictures from that balcony. There was a dining table on the balcony and a jacuzzi (which really didn't work, we were told to fill it with hot water, but how hot would that really be? We didn't miss using it.) Service - it was good. We had to inquire a few times at the front desk with questions and they assisted us as needed. The front desk staff was average upon check-in. Housekeeping was quite helpful. I asked for a blanket one day and we had it in 5 minutes. We accidentally left the \"do not disturb\" sign on our door one day and they were concerned they couldn't come in to clean. Housekeeping brought extra towels when we got back to the hotel, which we appreciated having with 4 people showering. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.

It was very convenient for us to walk everywhere. Staff was ok. They did help us with our luggage and put it on the luggage lift for us. Bathroom was small but convenient. It does have history as it was convict built. Cons:There is no guest elevator so if stairs are a problem this place is not for you. The rooms are small and really do not have any charm. Furnishings are dated and the whole place smelled musty. The view is mostly of roof tops. Overall, not much character to the place either. It was convict built but used as a warehouse mostly, I think. Our air conditioner did not work and the last night it broke. It started spraying water in a fine mist and we noticed water leaking down the wall. Then it started buzzing. It buzzed for about a minute every 22 minutes. Apparently, this was the water tank trying to empty but it was unable to so the water leaked and sprayed. We turned it off which stopped it from spraying and leaking but the noise continued. We attempted to get our room changed but nothing was available. We tried to sleep as best we could but with it buzzing every 22 minutes it was difficult!!!!! Upon check out the next morning staff said they would not charge the travel agency for our last night but could not give us any credit directly as we only had a voucher and they had not received payment yet.

This hotel is right in the middle of the Rocks area and is within an easy 5 to 10 minute walk from the Circular Quay area. Circular Quay is where the Opera House and the sightseeing ferries are located, making this a very convenient hotel. I did not choose this hotel since it was chosen for me as part of an add-on package by Brendan Travel. The hotel itself is described as a \"boutique\" hotel and does have some charm since it has some historic qualities. The standard rooms seemed very small. I traveled alone and seemed cramped with my two (albeit large) suitcases for my cruise. There are no elevators for the 3 story hotel. There is however a \"luggage elevator\" that can be awkward. No one offered to help me with this, but the instructions themselves were self-explanatory. I smacked my head pretty good though. Once upstairs there are a few small stairs to some rooms so luggage had to be lifted here and there. I never pack what I can't lift myself so not a big deal to me. In general this hotel is not for anyone with mobility issues. The cobblestone sidewalks leading up to it, and the lack of elevators inside, could be something to consider. The harbor view of the Opera House was minimal, instead mostly courtyards and rooftops. You can however see whatever large cruise ship is in port directly from your window. I didn't mind that since it was my ship I woke up to seeing. The windows are the roll-out type with both screens that were in need of repair. The rooms came equipped with umbrellas for use, which was a nice touch. Overall I would say that this small hotel was in a perfect location from which to start touring Sydney, and it definitely had \"historical character\", but if you're looking for luxurious amenities or large rooms, you may want to look elsewhere.

We can empathise with other reviews regarding the limited Harbour views from the standard rooms, however we were lucky enough to have the Penthouse Suite for our stay, and can only rave about the position and views - there are no floor to ceiling windows, but you are so close to the action, and you have opening windows, and a large private rooftop terrace with an outdoor setting big enough for 8, and a 4 person spa/jaccuzzi. There is a full view of the Opera House from the Lounge, Dining and Terrace areas, and plenty of water as well. Looking the other way provided the city-scape view. The suite was fully self-contained (although the nifty laundry had a space for a washing machine with no machine!), with all kitchen appliances, crockery, cutlery provided, meaning we did not have to eat all our meals out .This helped offset the higher price for the room. The bedroom is large with a comfortable KS bed, tv etc., the galley kitchen was functional and the lounge dining area adequate. We stayed with our two children (8 & 10), so the couch was folded out to become a bed at night-time. The decor is stylish and practical, though starting to show its age a little. We found the staff to be very helpful and courteous. The one drawback of this great room is that due to the historic nature of the building, there is only a luggage lift, so coming to and from your room on the 4th floor will keep you fit!

It was no more than a Bed and Breakfast and it was definitely not a four-star hotel. The room smelled musty and awful. The odor was prevalent throughout our four night stay at this dump. The room and bathroom were so small that if you wanted to change your mind, you would have to go outside to do so. The bathroom barely accommodated one person at a time. The shower door was so small that you had to enter the shower sideways. There was literally no room between the shower stall and the toilet in this very small bathroom. Reported a hall light directly outside our room was burned out immediately upon arrival. Took the hotel staff two days to repair the inoperable light bulb. In the interim, we had to enter and exit our room in the dark. Room was dirty and noisy. We heard police sirens, loud talking and yelling in the street and the cafe area below our room, as well as constant banging of hotel room doors throughout the nights. The hotel needed a total refurbishment and upgrading. Furniture was old and outdated. Walls and carpet were dirty and worn. It's an old hotel in need of a lot of work. Contacted our travel agent, Goway Travel, and requested a change in hotel accommodations. Unfortunately, Goway Travel would do nothing to assist us with the lousy hotel booking they provided us with at this less than four-star hotel. They had our money and planned to do nothing additional to assist us, other than to request additional funds, to resolve a very bad situation created by their booking. Would never recommend or use the Harbour Rocks Hotel, Sydney.

Initially we were charged a cancellation fee for one days room but later that day the hotel relented and refunded the fee. our friends who arrived the next day were happy with their larger room at the harbour rocks but also a little disappointed the staff attitude. we wondered if there had been a recent change of management and were suprised how ordinary the rooms and ensuites were were after all the reviews we had read we expected charm and grace and it was our first and only dissapointment throughout our trip to OZ .", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cRelax at the Rocks\u201d", "Author": "Hil-Harv", "ReviewID": "UR6161452", "Content": "We stayed at the Harbour Rocks Hotel for four nights and arrived back in England yesterday.

Agree with everyone else, location,location,location - you cant fault it, our room was very quiet wenever heard a noise, but on the doorstep and within walking distance for all major attractions, yet great holiday rather than city centre feel as located in historic and interesting part of city. Very near Tourist Info Centre and crafty type shops and lots of good restaurants. Breakfast excellent, very varied and large portions, did not eat in hotel at night but it looked pleasant enough. Overall we felt hotel had a nice family atmosphere as opposed to the usual inpersonal large chain of hotels which you find in every city in the world now.

Try the outdoor noodle bar (can't remember the name) located out the door to the right of the hotel for an inexpensive, tasty meal.
