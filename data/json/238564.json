Besides, why stay inside when you're visiting Amsterdam? The breakfast was a step above continental, but decent. The interenet was reliable and they had bikes for rent at a fraction of the cost of some of the other locations around the city. The biggest downside is probably the shared bathroom.

The Bicycle Hotel's strengths are: convenient location, free wifi and internet access (I hate being nickel and dimed for that), and most important, value for money. Amsterdam is an expensive city; you can get a stylish room with crisp linens and fluffy towels, but it will cost you. (Though the Bicycle Hotel's linens and towels are certainly worn, I'm confident that they are clean, as I have personally observed them fresh from the dryer.) The breakfast is adequate (juice, milk, coffee, tea, yogurt, muesli, cereal, bread, honey & jam etc, cheese and salami) and not a bad deal considering that it is included in the price (my hotel in Paris charged 9 euros for an inferior breakfast, to give you an idea).

We were warmly greeted by Gerald and given \"the romantic room.\" I'm not sure if this is specifically the romantic room but our room was cute, comfortable enough, and very purple. We sprang for our own bathroom which, while small, was immaculately clean. The most worrysome characteristic of the hotel (and also one of the most charming) was the stairs. My wife and I were grateful that we had backpacks as the stairs were shallow, near vertical, and turn as you go up. This staircase is not for the faint of heart nor those with bad knees. Breakfast in the morning was continental plus meaning it had cereals, pastries, milk juice, coffee machine and toast but we were also given ham and a nice gouda to go on our toast along with a wide selection of spreads/jellies/jams. We ate well enough and headed out into the city to explore. We liked that bicycles are available for rent (though we did not partake). This is a fantastic base hotel to stay in if you are looking for a clean, friendly hotel to stay in and don't need (or want to pay for) all the frills. The location while not in the middle of everything, is very close to the Albert Cuypmarkt and only a block or two from several tram/bus stops which will get you back to the city center and Amsterdam Centraal within 5-10 mins depending on where you are looking to go.

The comforters were disgusting and the room was furnished with old Ikea furniture and our towels (when we got them) were thin and barely clean. The toilet room was tiny (we went with the shared option) and the shower room was so disgusting we had to go out and buy flip-flops. There were hairs and mildew everywhere and the drain was clogged. We felt dirty after taking a shower. We were also on the top floor and the staircase was so steep and narrow I had to hold onto the railing to keep from falling down. We only went to breakfast once because it was so bad. There was a toaster at our table and a miserable woman slapped a plate on our table without saying anything. The staff here were horrible!!

There was free internet access within the communal area and you could hire bikes with them if you wanted to. The only issue had a couple of issues, one being the stairs in the place. I had booked for 5 of us to stay, so I had a couple of rooms booked out, theses happened to be on the top floor, which didn't seem so bad when the member of staff handed me our keys, that was until I stood at the bottom of the stairs...they are near vertical and horrendous for getting luggage up. Get back down was even more of a nightmare as you couldn't see the next step infront properly, I had to resort to coming down them in the ballet 1st position (feet outwards!) the whole way down. You had to make sure you had everything with you before you left your room as the hike back up just didn't seem worth it! Apart from that, everything was great! The staff were great, when we first got there, we had arrived early and they let us leave our bags with them while we went for a wander about.

Just a short walk up from the hotel is a square with good restaraunts, and during the day there is a cake shop that can only be seen to be believed!
