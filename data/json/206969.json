Upon check-in we were met by the obligatory miserable desk person. Every Spanish hotel we have ever been to has one. Luckily everybody else at the hotel was very amiable. We had a very nice room 724. The view was uninspiring but we did not pay for that. As you entered there was a separate anti-room with the wardrobe and safe. This led off to the bathroom and bedroom. The bedroom was huge but unfortunately the bed was not but it was comfortable. A major bonus was that the A/C worked without the room key inserted for the lights to work meaning you could leave it on all day. The bathroom was also large with a bath/shower and a separate area for the w/c and bidet. Every day the room was spotless when we returned after a day out so top marks for the maids. Breakfast was included in the rate which is quite rare for Madrid. Most hotels we looked at were room only. On the first day we made the mistake of hitting the buffet at the same time as a tour party that were leaving that day. It was utter chaos but after they left if was fine. There was quite a variety but the standard could have been slightly better. There was a choice of cereals, pastries and toast and then the hot and cold buffet. There was everything from fried and scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and fried potato to cold ham and cheese and even salad, carrots, broad beans and chips. Coffee and tea were self service from a machine and usually one of the two machines was partially out of action. There was also a choice of fruit juice as well. Wi-Fi is not included for free and was a bit expensive. It was something like 5 Euros for an hour or 8 Euros for the day. We also wanted to use the computers in the lobby and were quoted 8 Euros even though we only wanted to use it for 10 minutes. That was the rate for 24 hours with no option for less. Even though the hotel is away from the centre it is only a few minutes walk to Plaza Espana and Parc del Oeste. There is not a huge range of eateries nearby but a 10 minute Metro ride away is Puerta del Sol giving access to Plaza Mayor. Also, next door is a supermarket and food court for any snacks and drinks and the department store of El Corte Ingles. Access to the hotel is brilliant with the Arguelles Metro station literally a two minute walk away. This gives you access to lines 3,4 and 6 which cover most of the city centre. It also gives you access to the airport with a change onto line 8 from either line 4 or 6. Personally I would recommend line 4 with a change onto the airport line 8 at Mar de Cristal. The other line 6 involves a long walk at the interchange station Nuevos Ministerios. It is maybe quicker in the long run but not when you are carrying luggage. Also remember to buy the airport supplement ticket when buying your subway ticket. Without this you cannot get into the airport. It is an additional 3 Euros each on top of the 1.80 Euros for the Metro but still cheaper than the rip-off taxi's. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon with no traffic and it cost 36 Euros. Overall a very nice and certainly recommended.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel with a Great Rate !\u201d", "Author": "POONAWAT", "ReviewID": "UR137430861", "Content": "Centrally located hotel in Madrid from a business and leisure perspective .

Turns out wifi doesn't work in the new part of the hotel so after a visit from an engineer I was moved to another room. My second room was in the old part of the hotel - this all took about 40 mins. The room was fine, but not anywhere as nice as the other one - so always ask to stay in the new part. One issue in my second room was that the toilet was making lots of noise - constantly filling up with water, but I couldn't be bothered to move again so I didn't say anything. I also had to wait for over 10 minutes to get seated for breakfast which is not ideal when you are on business and need to get in and our in a hurry.

We booked two rooms expecting quite small ones for single occupancy but they were superb, spacious and luxurious room which they still classes as 'standard'! Rooms 661 and 663 (ask for rooms in the newly refurbished part) The rooms are the most spacious I've ever stayed in. The bathrooms were marble with top quality fittings, toiletries and thick white towels. The main bedrooms both had seating areas, my son in 663 had a corner lounge sofa! Both had excellent tv, coffee making facilites and the biggest single beds I've ever slept in. The reception in the hotel was spotlessly clean (as was all the hotel) with friendly staff and elegant fixtures. Although we didn't eat at the hotel the bars, cafe and restaurant looked just as high quality. There are so many excellent restaurants and bars nearby you have to try them out. My son used the gym which is well equipped and found it to be really good, although we didn't use the pool there were a few people in it with children who seemed to be having a great time. The hotel is next to Arguelles metro station (across a road), has a 'Starbucks' a couple of shops away if you can't do without it! and a huge department store with pharmacy, supermarket and 5 floors of clothes and household shopping joining the hotel (el Corte Ingles). I found it an enjoyable 10 minute walk to the centre of Madrid or 5mins to Park Ouest. It took us about 20 mins on the metro from the airport with one change and cost 4.50 euro each single. As we were there for 4 days we bought a 3 day metro pass for 17 euro's zone A which covered everywhere we wanted to visit and well worth the money. Madrid is great to walk around and you can see more by walking but the metro is quick and easy and the trains are new. I would recommend rowing a boat on the lake at Park Retiro, The sunday flea market at El Rastro, the Palace which is stunning and strolling around Chueca. Opera has a great atmosphere for meals out at night. You can see most of the centre in a couple of days and if you enjoy walking you'll see even more. We also took a ride on the telerifique cable cars.

The TV had a few options to navigate (pay per view movies, hotel offers, etc) before you could get to the actual tv and radio channels, but worked fine. There was a towel \u201cto use in the gym\u201d as per the note left with it, in the closet. No idea where the gym was or whether the usage was included in the price or not. The room looked a bit dated and the carpet had a few stains but the size and comfort of the room made up for it. The A/C was quite basic (only 3 temperature settings) but worked fine for me. Breakfast was varied (cold meats, fruits, cereals, croissants, etc) and very good quality. They even had a diet section with a few choices-other places tend to keep only one or two products while Husa Princesa seemed to have quite a few options. Location is fabulous for visiting city centre (Plaza Mayor is about 25 min walk, Gran Via is about 10 min walk). The hotel has a subway stop around the corner, by the shopping centre (El Corte Ingles, simmilar to Macy's if you are visiting from US or to John Lewis if you are visiting from UK). Walking at night felt very safe. Fabulous location for business travellers attending any meetings along the A-6 and wanting to spend the night in Madrid There are two things that would have made the stay more pleasant: 1) Wifi was not free (even for the first hour). For a hotel of this category, I would expect the wifi to be included for free with the room. There are other hotels in the area of the same category with free wifi so I found quite surprising that it wasn't included in the room price. 2) The check-out process was extremely slow. They seemed to take ages with each customer checking out so I had to queue for about 10 minutes with no one in front of me. At some point 2 of the receptionists had no customers to serve but they seemed more pre-occupied on checking their files and making phone calls than on serving people waiting to check out.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "World is not enought", "Title": "\u201cNoisy but well located\u201d", "Author": "luc t", "ReviewID": "UR128626579", "Content": "Husa princesa is an average hotel well located.

Although the property is an older one, we were very pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. It was very large, with room for two desk areas (well, one is really a make-up spot for ladies, I guess) and a small sofa and coffee table. We were on the 14th floor with a huge window overlooking the northwest of the city -- very light, bright, and spacious. The room was in good condition, a few spots on the carpet and a few dings on the wall, but not bad. The bathroom was nicely done and in good condition as well. We were very comfortable there - and it was very quiet in the hallways (maybe the hotel wasn't full in February?) The lobby staff and the women checking us in at breakfast were very friendly. The breakfast buffet is excellent and everything was full regardless of the time we arrived. (It might be nice if the breakfast waiters smiled occasionally, but it didn't really matter.) The breakfast room feels like a conference room turned into a buffet; the decor could be a little more attractive, but that doesn't take away from a very complete and delicious breakfast. Wifi in the room worked well at a modest cost (even if it should be free!) and when we did have a problem, the hotel staff resolved it promptly. The immediate neighborhood has a handy Starbucks and an El Corte Ingles, including a fabulous supermarket in the basement (very handy!). There are a number of restaurants within a 10 minute walk, but they're not as obvious as in other parts of the city. In fact, location is the only reason I wouldn't stay here again. I love to walk in cities and be able to do my sightseeing on foot. This hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Palace, 30 min to Plaza Mayor, 45 min to the Thyssen or Prado Museums. I enjoyed the walk, but not everyone would and it did feel like we were out of the way of the main action in the city.

The reception staff were helpful although they thought we were arriving for a conference as there were 8 of us and we nearly ended up joining in! I had requested rooms on high floors, near to each other and the hotel did arrange this for us. The rooms were a good size and had a lot of storage but some of our friends had problems with their heating as they couldn't control the temperature or speed. This was sorted out very quickly once reception had been contacted and was fixed in a few hours. The rooms were equipped with a good selection of toiletries and a safe, mini bar, magazines, extra pillows and blankets and a turn down service. We had breakfast included with the price and there was a reasonable range of food, probably not worth the full cost but if you get it included you may as well have it. We looked at the pool but there are not any directions showing you how to find it. Once arriving at the floor from the lift you open the door and find yourself in the middle of a gym. After squeezing past people working out we mananged to locate the pool and decided it was not worth using, due to the volume of people in the gym. It appears that the gym, pool etc are not exclusively for guests of the hotel and therefore the health club was constantly busy. We never used the restaurant or champagne bar but we did have a few drinks in the main bar and found the prices to be an average price for a hotel bar. About Madrid - we bought a 3 day travel card for the metro at the airport and used this to get around or walked everywhere. We made the mistake on our first day by walking into a bar for a drink and snack and let the waiter bring us out some food.

My request for an iron was met with a mix of bemusement and irritation. The housekeeper could provide me with an iron at 8.15 the next morning (my meeting was at 8am). The guy looked like he was pretending to call someone to get an iron delivered as a special favour but none ever arrived and I had to wear the same shirt two days running. Not five star service really. On to the positive stuff. The room was very big, clean and comfortable. Nice view to the NW of Madrid and beyond to the mountains.

Breakfast was buffet style and adequate rather than sumptious (I have had more extensive ones elsewhere in Spain).

There were two Internet terminals in the lobby area but I did not use these. The concierge was very efficient in booking a city bus tour, and found excellent restaurants for paella, and fish dinners.

It was explained to me that the Spanish don't eat heavy breakfasts (as Americans are accustomed to). Therefore, I think their attempts were adequate. The concierge spoke great English, but the rest of the staff gave me a great opportunity to practice my Spanish. I found that most people do speak passable English, and tend to be a bit more forgiving if you at least try to communicate in their language vs. expecting them to speak English right off the bat. The hotel is in an excellent location: just steps from El Corte Ingles, which is a Macy's type department store. There are several branches near the hotel.
