The location is stellar...you really are right on Bourbon! I've found that sometimes you compromise quality for location, but that definitely wasn't the case with the Inn on Bourbon! The hotel rooms were really nice, the building is historic (used to be an opera house), and the breakfast area was lovely. I'm not sure if this is normal all the time (or just due to the fact that they are renovating their restaurant) but we got a free continental breakfast in the lovely breakfast area in the lobby that has huge picture windows that look out onto Bourbon Street. It wasn't anything fancy, just some bagels, cereal, juice, and coffee, but the sitting area felt very regal. I didn't have a chance to check out the pool but the pool area looked really nice! The one main caveat: noise. Not terrible (we faced the back of the building and not Bourbon so we heard no street noise), but keep in mind that bars stay open very very late and you will undoubtedly hear drunk people finding their way back to their rooms. I'd say this is a great place to stay with a group of friends or even a significant other (as long as you aren't looking for a super quiet romantic stay) but not necessarily a place for people with young kids.

While we generally found the hotel pleasant there were a few negatives worth noting. 1) Noise. We decided to stay off of the Bourbon St side of the hotel. This was a wise move. Nonetheless, noise we really a problem on occasion. There are some very easy fixes that the hotel should look into. First, the patio doors have a massive gap all the way around them. They don't close well. Simple weatherstrippiing may help. 2) Cleanliness. The rooms were ok, but the 4th floor of the hotel had an unpleasant smell during the entire stay. Also, we noticed that while the linens were clean, the pillows were an absolute mess under the covers. Ugly stains, the origin of which I'd prefer not to consider. 3) Bathroom doors. You may get stuck! They are very narrow double doors that are held closed by a latch system. One of those doors required tremendous force to open. 4) Wifi. Free, but very, very slow. 5) Breakfast. Also free, but rather limited. The only major issue here is one that could be fiixed by the hotel in five minutes. Buy another toaster. Believe it or not, toasting is like a competitive sport in the breakfast lounge. 6) The remodel. This wasn't as major an issue for us as it's been for others. Noise from the remodel was a minor annoyance, and nothing more. Upside? Simple the best location. Friendly staff...once we arrived.

The staff here were really rude, the hotel is really loud and construction activity woke us up at 6:30 in the morning. Also, one of the managers told us that because we booked through Expedia we could not be guaranteed our room and would not be moved to another room without paying for an upgrade (none of the electrical outlets in our bathroom worked and the hotel couldn't, or wouldn't fix the problem. Nevertheless, the manager - Alex Williams - would not let us change rooms). Here are some specifics: 1) The hotel is loud: we had a quiet room, which meant it didn't face Bourbon street. We had no illusions about perfect peace and quiet, but the doors to the hallway are not sound proof and the noise from the hallway woke us up all night. This was not just people partying either, we heard room service in the morning knocking on doors and talking in the hallways; 2) Construction Noise: the hotel has construction going on and we were twice woken up at 6:30 by drilling and hammering under our room. We called the front desk, and the hammering and drilling stopped for about fifteen minutes then started again. The front desk kept telling us they would take care of this and never did; 3) The staff is rude: not all the staff, one of the front desk employees was very nice, but he was the exception. Other employees lied to us about switching rooms, promised to fix problems with our room and didn't and were downright nasty. Alex Williams in particular, one of the hotel managers, by th way, wa particularly rude. We spoke to him about our problems and he basically threw up his hands and told us it wasn't his problem. Then be actually called our room to tell us we booked through Expedia and had no right to another room. That's right, we booked through Expedia so we have no right to a room without problems or the king bed we requested (we got two doubles). All in all this was an awful experience. We stayed for three nights and didn't get a full nights sleep during any of them.

If you are coming to the French quarter to drink and party until way past 3am, this is the place for you. Otherwise, do not stay here. Oh, do not bring any kids under 18 ... the street has many adult-themed posters, girls, etc. You are forewarned! With that disclaimer behind us ... friends and I stayed here Sept/Oct. It was a perfect location to check out the Quarter as well as to take the streetcar to the other side of town. Go to Cafe du Monde early - really early - to eat beignets. The river is close by. Street market and Hard Rock Cafe is there as well. Onto the night life ... it's noisy and crowded, but not many drunk people stumbling around. Catcalls from adult (strip joint) entertainers, starving artists, and balcony flashers wanting beads are normal. No cover to get into the bars. The 3-for-1 happy hour special is worth the deal ... it gets expensive after it ends, so drink up. What's the first rule in real estate? Location, location, location! It was awesome to just walk back into our room after getting hammered. The interior courtyard pool is a welcome respite during the day to sober up. The only problem, we had a room facing Bourbon St., so we could not sleep until it quieted down after 4:30am. We will remember to bring earplugs next time! Cab ride for 3 people to/from hotel is $14 per person each way (say $17 with tip, so $34 round-trip per person). We tipped the bellhop upon arrival, so he was nice to us the rest of the stay. In summary, I encourage singles 21-40 to experience the French Quarter using this hotel as the base. (Single girls, do drop a note to me if you're going, lol.)

The energy outside is obvious, but the friendly, professional staff when you walk in the doors lets you know that they understand \"outside\" and \"inside\" The first time we stayed last year, we had a room on Bourbon St. We would advise against this as the bar across the street blares LOUD music until early hours. While not horrible, it definitely was an issue with one of us. This time we requested an interior room and got one. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The view was two small windows looking out over a parking lot. Nothing special, but quieter at night. Disclaimer: This time we were there for a gay event. Turned out the room next door was full of 20 something guys here for the same event. They were awake by 9, started pumping house music right away, at least 6 of them met every morning and loudly discussed the previous nights activities. Walls are thin.

We chose the Inn on Bourbon for this purpose. We stayed 3 nights (Fri thru Mon). Upon valet checkin, we were greeted by the nicest people that the Ramada had to offer! Our first hotel room, on the Toulouse side, was very nice. It was clean with plenty of storage for 4 people. The Bell Boy also offered a refrigerator for the room. We were able to take our own cooler for our own drinks. On the first night, we decided to upgrade our room to the Bourbon Street side. This offered a huge balcony and a lot more to see. Travelling with 2 boys (ages 10 and 12), this was the best decision. The front desk helped us immediately upgrade and move our things to the suite we were offered. This was a 50.00 per night upgrade. They also gave the boys a huge bag of beads to throw! It was noisy but, the earplugs offered were sufficient to sleep. The noise dies down about 3 in the morning and then it is pretty quiet until about noon. There was a religious group that parked their cross and \"preached\" via a bull horn from about 11 p.m. until at least 1:00 a.m. This was the worst part of the stay. Not that I have a problem with people witnessing for their cause/religion but, these people were extreme and rude. The continential breakfast was breads, danishes, fruits and cereals. They offered coffee, milk and juice. It was sufficient to start our morning. The conciege (sp) was wonderful in giving us a layout of the sights and coupons for meals. If you are going to book any tours, I recommend going thru the hotel than going thru someone off the street. The pool was great and the area very relaxing. It did rain everyday, wear durable walking shoes... I had to ditch my fancy sandals.. the stores have umbrellas if you forget. There are also street entertainers that perform in front of the hotel. That was very entertaining! Also, at night, the hotel does require you to show your key before you enter the hotel. I did appreciate that gesture.

I wish I had seen their exercise room, there wasn't much talk about it in the welcome packet. The Meeting room had wide, obtrusive pillars splitting the view. Electrical outlets are at a premium, only access at the lamp on the desk (which my room mate claimed) or the lamp on the nightstand between the beds. IF you pulled the TV cabinet out from the wall there was an adapter that gave 6 outlets. It was heavy to slide away from the wall. The pool area is secluded and pleasant, the hotel was evidently lovingly cared for by all the employees. THEY are all friendly and helpful, especially the Bell Staff.

Housekeeping was exceptionally friendly and well trained (I would have given this property a 4 out 5 star if it would not have been my check out process.) Now to the bad: Parking $28/night plus tax. There is a parking lot 3 blocks away for $10 bucks a night! Use it! ( While the parking charge is about what all hotels charge for parking in New Orleans, it is way over priced just like theirs!) Breakfast- Buffet was a joke. OVER PRICED and food was cold and honestly, I could have walked to Mcdonald's (which I did most days after that) and paid 14 bucks less for better food and treatment. Here is my one HUGE issue with this hotel Upon check out, I called the front desk from the site I was working at and spoke to a young lady, it was 12:18pm, I asked her if I could have an extra hour to get back and gather my things for check out. She said \"sure, no problem..\" I said \" Thank You\" Due to high volume of traffic I arrived back at the hotel and gathered my things and came down to check out 26 minutes past the time she said would be ok. The maid on the floor was telling me to take my time, that she was ok for me being a little behind. The front desk agent that was there when I came to check out, his name was Jonathan. I informed him of the error in my room charges and then he didn't even acknowledge that, he was rampant and mostly concerned at what time I was checking out. When he mentioned a penalty, i informed him the young lady said I could have extra time and I apologized for being a few minutes past that time.. but he slammed through the door behind the desk to try and verify if what I was saying was truthful. His attitude and demeanor was so unprofessional that I immediately became offended and asked him to retain a manager when he returns from the back. He roles his eyes and picks up the phone and calls someone to send a manager and stats the following : \"can you send a manager out for this person at the front desk\" This \"person\" just spent over 800 dollars for the company that employs you and pays your bills and you are going to be RUDE and disrespectful? A manager arrives but doesn't introduce himself. I explain to him what was happening and what had happened and was rudely interrupted by Jonathan stating \"that is not true\" He was now calling me a liar for telling the FACTS of what happened. I am a very easy going guy who is in hotels 10 months a year for work and I don't get mad easily, but when someone is blatantly rude, I become enraged. The manager that was on duty, around 1:45pm on Sat, Feb 19th never once apologize for the actions of his employee and told me he would take care of the late check out fee. I told him I had no problem paying for the additional 30 minutes, but no one ever disclosed how much it was... It was never about the FEE or the money, it was about the RUDE Behavior of a front desk agent that had no regard for someone who just spent a great deal of money with the company that employs him I will NEVER return here while in New Orleans, and I am in New Orleans A LOT along with 25 other representatives from our company and have already sent out an email alert and warning them not to stay at this hotel.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Benton, OH", "Title": "\u201cAmbiance & Character\u201d", "Author": "jrcc1", "ReviewID": "UR97315195", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel while traveling with friends.

There was no bathmat, so we had to use a hand towel as a substitute. There was no trash can in the bathroom, we had to take the one from the main room and put it in the bathroom.

Who wants to drink champagne from a plastic cup?! In fact, she acted as if it were a major imposition just to get up from the barstool.

We didn't have much of a view but once you shut the doors to the lobby and go up the elevator the noise was non existent. The hotel is very clean and pleasant. There is a quaint courtyard area with a pool and lounge chairs. If you pass through the lobby on the later shifts ask for G rose he is very knowledgeable of the cities history and tourist info. The water pressure in the shower is good but the drain in the shower didn't keep up. Bathrooms where small but cute. Check out was simple and fast. Our flight wasn't till later in the evening so the hotel held our bags for three hours wile we took one last look at the city.

In our Bourbon balcony room, the bedding was plush and the mattress was comfy and felt new. I did the \"white sock test\" and the carpet was clean.

Within about 15 minutes the front desk called again and asked if the room was OK. My husband said well, it wasn't on the courtyard, but for us the King was more important than a balcony or the courtyard. Nevertheless, Joseph called back within 5 minutes to say there was a King on the courtyard if we wanted it. Once we transferred there, we found a quiet, comfortable room overlooking the pool.

Just a few complaints. First, because of the terrible time we usually have checking in before actual check-in time (everywhere but Royal Sonesta), we decided to put off leaving on our 5 hour drive to the Quarter until we could arrive well after the 4 pm check-in. At 5:30 pm, I attempted to check in to the hotel, but the front desk woman said it would be 15 more minutes. She said the room was clean, but still needed to be inspected by a manager. She took my number and told me she would call as soon as it was ready. Because of our dinner reservations, we sat down in the table area, and waited on my cell phone to ring. After 40 minutes, I returned to the same woman, and asked about the room. She looked at me like she had never seen me before, asking my name again, etc. The room was ready, but she neglected to call. That just wasn't the right first impression returning to the IOB. We missed our dinner, and the night just didn't turn out as it should have. As for the room, I was impressed. The hotel seems to be in much better shape than it was back in 2007. Beds extremely comfortable, and cold ac. The hotel room had a Flushmate toilet installed, which was SO MUCH better in the bathroom! Toilets in the Quarter are usually very slow, and not dependable when it comes to carrying away the waste water. Not so here!! Wow! We didn't like the half doors leading to the bathroom, though. They leave a nice 1/4 inch gap in the middle that would allow anyone to view you as you use the restroom. One of the doors wouldn't stay shut (room 331) which made it worse. Pool area/courtyard was pretty, but not as big as I expected. Saw a little mouse scurrying about one evening. Pool was clean. 12 PM check-out was a breeze. We got to use the express checkout system so we didn't have to stop by the front desk on the way out. We'll be back as long as we can continue to get a fair price for a room, and the location is one of the best if you want to be in the middle of the action.

This was our second stay in the same room category, although it had unfortunately been 2 years since our last visit. I'm happy to say that nothing had changed. Check-in was quick & painless- the staff from front desk to bell service was friendly, helpful & accommodating. We received a hand-written \"welcome back\" card from management, which we found to be a nice touch (especially because it was hand written rather than a standard issue form letter). Room was spotless & the bed was very comfortable. A/C worked perfectly, which was very important- temps were in the mid-90's every day. Balcony was shared with 2 other rooms, but was HUGE, so nobody stepping on anyone else's toes. We became friends with our \"neighbors\" & actually spent our last evening out together. Balconies have a large round table with 3 chairs (max occupancy is 3 in king bedrooms) in front of the French Doors and offer a great view of the activity on Bourbon. Yes, believe what your hear about the noise- Bourbon Street is loud, especially with the music that booms out of the storefront directly across the street. This lasts from morning until evening, when music from the nightclub across the street (Funky 54) takes over. It doesn't bother us at all, but if you are a light sleeper or plan to turn in early to get your beauty rest, it may not be for you. At no point during our stay did we order room service or visit the restaurant/bar, but had taken some snacks, adult beverages & a cooler that we purchased ahead of time. When we opened said snacks, we realized that we needed a knife. When my wife phoned the front desk to inquire, several sets of silverware from the restaurant arrived at our door within 10 minutes. We were very impressed with this. When we were ready to check out, I phoned the front desk to ask for bell service. Repeated calls over a 5 minute period went unanswered & I was resigned to the idea of humping all of our luggage downstairs ourselves. But before this occured, the front desk PHONED ME, asking if I'd been trying to contact them! Again, within 5 minutes a bellman was at our door to take our luggage. I was very impressed with the call back from the desk. I've stayed in countless hotels over the years & paid as much as $600 per night, but never have I received a return call when my calls to the front desk have gone unanswered. Again, very impressed. So the bottom line is this: don't be turned off if you read negative reviews about this property. It's comfortable, clean, well-staffed & right in the heart of the Frech Quarter action.

The staff was so friendly, it really felt like you were staying with friends. Shawn, one of the bellhops couldn't have been any nicer. I forget the very nice lady's name at the concierge desk, but she was also a pleasure to deal with. Her quote \"When BP speaks, BP lies\". The lady tending bar was also a lot of fun. Nice dry humor, just the way I like it. And she makes a very nice martini as well. But this makes it sound like we were in the hotel a lot. We weren't hardly ever there. Our days and nights were full of sightseeing, dining, and searching for the ultimate hangout. When we checked in, they were fully booked. We booked through expedia, so our request for a king smoking room was never passed on to reservations. We explained to the desk that it was our anniversary. Well, the next morning, we were upgraded to a king balcony room at no additional cost. It was fantastic. We're used to sleeping on a pillow top king, and the ones in the hotel are even nicer than ours. Talk about sleeping like a baby. Room darkening shades made it impossible to tell what time of day it was. Not that it mattered. The party is 24/7. As far as the noise? HELLO!, it is Bourbon Street. If this bothers you, drink more or stay somewhere else, far far away from here. As far as parking goes, we flew into town and spent less on taxis and street cars/buses than parking would have cost us. A much better way to see the city in my opinion. But a little research prior to your trip would have told you that parking is very much at a premium in the Quarter. Besides, you can easily spend a whole week just walking around the 85 square blocks of the Quarter and still not see or do everything. We got room service one morning and were satisfied with that experience as well. Yes, 6 cups of coffee is about $14.00. But things like english muffins and so forth were only $1-$2. Try getting breakfast anywhere in the quarter for that. The day before it cost $40 for an omelet and 3 bloody marys at a restaurant right down the street. They pressure wash the grounds around the pool every morning and place fresh towels on all of the chairs. The pool is also cleaned daily and the grounds are beautiful. Vacations really are what you make of them, but the entire staff right down to the maids did an excellent job of making you feel at home. A little research prior to your arrival also goes along way. The only surprise we had was that the place was nicer and friendlier than we could have imagined. As far as a comment by another reviewer that they make you show your room card late at night to get back in, well, trust me, if you see what goes on out on Bourbon Street, you'll be glad they do confirm that everyone entering is indeed a registered guest. One last observation as well as a response to another reviewer, yes it is 2010. The outlets are on the base of every lamp in the room. Right next to the switch. Reviewers have mentioned the smell on Bourbon Street. Comparing it to vomit and urine. Well, we figured it out the very first day. They do scrub and wash the entire French Quarter every day. There are very few alleys or places for dumpsters, so everyone uses the large cans on wheels. The smell is garbage. They pick up daily and once the cans are rolled away the smell is all but non existent. It reminds me of Philly back in the 60's. Every woman would wash and scrub their stoop on Saturday, or make the kids do it, lol. In the Quarter they do it daily!

I called the front desk and spoke with a gentleman who said, \"Well it's an old hotel, set your thermostat to 72 and the put the fan on medium and it should cool down.\" I did this and left my room for the party that is New Orleans. Upon returning to my room, it was still extremely warm. I went ahead and went to bed after a cool shower. The following day, it was still no cooler in my room. As I had left the thermostat and fan on as directed and this did no good at all, I went down to the front desk to speak with a manager on duty. I sat in the lobby for 3 hours waiting for the manager to check on my room. At 2am, I had not heard back from the manager and my room was no cooler, so I located the manager and she only would tell me that she \"hadn't had time to get to it.\" Not sure what she was doing from 11 pm until 2 am, but it appears she was trying to conjure some free breakfast coupons for me. She told me that as a night manager, she had \"no authority\" to do anything but give me a free breakfast. She could not comp my room nor move me to another property that could accomodate me. After 3 hours, the front desk clerk told the manager that they had 2 rooms available that were \"no shows.\" At this time, the manager said I could move to one of these rooms, but it was a smoking room. This room was much cooler with a working A/C, although it was a smoking room and smelled terrible. My travel companion has to take breathing treatments and smoke is highly irritating for him. Thus, the reason I specifically requested a NON-SMOKING room. I had no choice but to take this room as it was now after 2am and I had been waiting for 3 hours for some resolution. I specifically pre-paid for a NON-SMOKING room. If I hadn't pre-paid I would have left the property, as the hotel on the next block, Maison Dupuy, had rooms available at a lower daily rate. Ramada knew that I was in a SMOKING room and although I had 2 more nights stay , they made no attempt to try to move me to the room I paid for, a NON-SMOKING room. I stayed at the hotel for two nights with a non-working A/C and two nights which was much cooler, but in a room that reeked of smoke. The front office manager on the day shift advised me he would refund my room for one night, but I would not be further compensated. I have yet to receive my refund for any night. I sincerely got the feeling that since I had pre-paid before my arrival date----they had my money---so they really didn't care about my experience. I don't understand why the hotel would have a night manager on duty who stated she had no authority to do anything to accomodate my needs. Throughout my 3 hour stay in the lobby, the front desk staff as well as the security guard on duty repeatedly made comments about the incompetence of this particular manager (and now I know why). One of the front desk staff even wrote a letter of apology and slipped it under my door. Again, why the night manager would not do this herself remains a mystery to me. Per the night manager, this hotel only gives any kind of authority to the front office manager who is a day manager. And the hotel staff are not permitted to contact anyone after hours who has any type of authority. If you have any problems during your stay, you better hope they happen during the day as at night, the hotel becomes a property that becomes \"managed\" by people who have no authority to help you and refuse to contact anyone who has any \"authority.\" I have stayed at this property over the past several years, but they will never get my business again and I certainly would not recommend this property to anyone I know.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex England", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel but expensive parking.

We booked trough a travel agent in October 2009, requesting a 2nd floor Bourbon St balcony. As the time for the trip approached, both couples made several phone calls to the hotel to check on the balcony rooms possibility as well as to request our rooms next to each other. We knew that there was no way to guarantee our choice but felt that numerous requests (which were noted in our reservation file) would help. We arrived around 1 or 1:30 pm knowing an early check in might not happen. Upon arrival, our friends had a confirmed Bourbon St balcony room on the 2nd floor. My husband and I however, did not have a room. At all. There was a lot of confusion as to whether we even had a reservation although we had all the reservation documents. Finally they said we would have a room by 4 pm which is check in time. We left for some lunch and returned about 3:30 pm. Our friends got into their room right away but we had to wait in the lobby. Finally we spoke to the front desk manager Troy, again, and said we'd be in our friends room and to call us there. He told us they finally found us a great room that we would be happy with....on the 2nd floor, Bourbon balcony. But not near our friends. The room was finally ready he said so we went to it. The door was cracked open so we went in to a very dirty and messy room. The housekeeping staff had not been told to get the room ready. But it was a perfect room....on the corner of Toulouse and Bourbon with a wraparound balcony. So we went back to our friends room and after awhile, not hearing from the front desk, went on to the room. It was ready! It's 5 pm now. Although we were not next to our friends, we had a great time during the week. We were to be there from Sunday night to Friday morning. On Thursday afternoon, we came back to the hotel after a day out, ready for a last night happy hour on our balcony. But our keys wouldn't open the door to our room. We kept trying and finally we got a bellman to open it. There was a group of people on the balcony who when confronted by my husband, told him that this was their room that they booked every year and they wanted us out. Meanwhile, I had gone down to the front desk to get new keys and was called into the back room. Not looking good at this point. The manager tells me that they knew we wanted to be next to our friends and now they had a room right next door! He wanted us to move. I couldn't believe that this had happened and told him so. He said he'd comp us half the room rate if we'd move. Upstairs on the balcony, the \"rightful\" guest told my husband that if we didn't change rooms, he'd make our last night unpleasant. In the end, we demanded the night free and did move but it was a nightmare. It was our last night and we had to pack everything up and haul it down the hall because the promised bellman did not show up in time. Now I have to say that our first trip was wonderful back in 2005 and is the reason we chose to stay there again. However, the mistakes that were made on this trip were absolutely inexcusable and there was not ever an apology given. It was as if they were doing us a huge favor by switching our rooms. They knew when we checked in and were given the room that it was booked for Thursday on. I hate to be the bearer of a bad review but when you spend that amount of money and get mostly trouble and unprofessionalism in return, we WILL NOT RETURN and will advise any friends traveling to NOLA to avoid this hotel.

Our only complaint about the room was that although it appeared to have been redecorated fairly recently (great bed, new looking furniture, nice linens, drapes, and carpet) the bathroom cabinetry looked old and needed repainted, our room door looked shabby (that hurt our first impression of the room), and in general all the interior door frames needed painted. Although the room was on Bourbon we didn't have a great deal of problem sleeping - the beds were very comfortable and the noise seemed to only wake us up when there was unusual yelling down on the street. The hotel staff were efficient and helpful. The maids in the hallways were always very friendly. The pool is small for the number of guestrooms and does not have a bar. So, overall, the hotel was pretty nice, but for the price we paid for our room we'll likely go back to the Sonesta next time since the chances of getting the private balcony appear to be slim anyway and Sonesta's attention to detail is just better (and no more expensive).", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "L.A., CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "sndspeed", "ReviewID": "UR64751514", "Content": "Most of the nice hotels in the quarter are more than $200 per night-- from a discounter the Inn On Bourbon Ramada was a steal at $120!

Ignore all the bad reviews - this is a very nice hotel, well kept, clean, very friendly staff throughout, very helpful concierge service. We arrived several hours before check-in and were given our room right away. We had a balcony overlooking the pool which was great. Had requested a King, but got two queens, not a problem at all. Beds were very comfortable, room was very clean, bathroom more than adequate, housekeeping did their jobs well. We spoke to another couple that were changing their rooms (didn't like the noise on Bourbon Street side - HELLO ! ) If you want to go to bed early and sleep don't stay on Bourbon St. ! We went there with the expectations of having a lot of fun in a noisy environment and the heck with the sleep! We weren;t disappointed. As far as the complaints of having to show your room key EVERY time you entered, it just isn't so. After 10:00 pm they did have a doorman at the door. I don't know about anyone else, but my room card is always in my front pocket, and just a quick flash to the doorman was all it took - you do have to get it out to get into the room don;t you? Made for a more secure feeling, what with all the crap going on these days. Also checked out the Royal Sonesta down the street (Irvin Mayfield IS the real thing!). Also a very nice hotel. But for the price we paid, the location and the ambience, my wife and I both agree that the Inn on Bourbon was definitely the best value and the best place on the street, hands down.

The famous Mardi Gras party starts and ends on Bourbon Street, meaning that you are right in the middle of things at this location. If you prefer a more secluded or quiet location, we would suggest you book a hotel a little farther away from this area. This hotel is also about a 15-minute walk of the main shopping street located just outside the French Quarter. We stayed in a standard room and found the room quite comfortable. The room was small, but it did have a nice balcony to relax on. How much time are you going to spend in your room when in New Orleans anyway? The rooms are tastefully decorated and have comfortable bedding. The bathroom in our room was small but had everything that we needed during our stay. We stayed in a street-view room which was a bit noisy at night due to the loud music being played at the many nearby bars, but that was part of the appeal so it really didn't bother us. If you want something more quieter, you can always stay in a pool-view room instead of the street-view room. Overall, we really liked the location of this hotel and we really did enjoyed our stay. We recommend this hotel, just make sure you choose a room that's appropriate for you, i.e., a pool-view room if you prefer a quieter area or a street-view room if you prefer the noise and action from the street below.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome,Ga", "Title": "\u201cPerfect - Once Again - Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Dale_Shannon", "ReviewID": "UR60873183", "Content": "This is our second visit to this hotel within the last seven months..

My husband and I stayed at this hotel about 10 years ago, and he stayed here with friends (boys weekend) 3 more times since then. It is PRIME location if you want to be right in the middle of the action. Had 2nd story balcony room overlooking Bourbon street every time. We are going back again in July 2010 and just booked the room last week. I just wanted to make people aware that the booking process was VERY confusing this time! First, I went to the hotel's website to check availability and price for the date I wanted. I wanted a mini suite since there would be 3 of us staying in the room. (Me, husband, friend) I read all of the details about the cost of having an extra person in the room as well as looked at the photo they showed of the suite. It had a king bed as well as a living room-type set up with a couch, chair, coffee table, and a small round dining table with 2 chairs. Since it was most important to us to have a room overlooking Bourbon street, and it wasn't clear on the website if the mini suite was in that location, I called the hotel directly (from number listed on the website) to verify the location. The person answering the phone stated \"Inn on Bourbon, how can I direct your call\"? When I said I had questions and would like to book a room for July, they transfered me to what turned out to be the nation wide Ramada Inn call center. I asked my questions and the women stated the mini suite could hold 3 people but it would cost an additional $35 per night. I asked if we could get a roll away cot and she said yes. She even suggested that the 3rd person could just sleep on the couch. That was perfect. I let her know that I would discuss this with my husband, then call back shortly to book the room. So I call back about 30 minutes later and got the same hello, then was transfered again to that call center, and got a different person. I told him I wanted to book the mini suite for 3 people, etc.....He said you can't have 3 people in the mini suite, it can't be more than 2. I told him I had just spoken to someone a short time ago, and they said it was fine, and that I had read on the website that an additional person in the room was ok as long as you paid the extra fee. The very condesending voice on the other end of the phone repeated that you can't have 3 people in the room, it's a safety thing, the rooms aren't big enough. I reminded him that I was booking the mini suite and it looks big in the picture on the website, and the 3rd person was going to sleep on the couch. He rudely told me that there wasn't a couch in the room. I said, I am looking at the website photo of the mini suite right now and there's a COUCH! I said is there some other room /suite that has a couch/ living-room area, he said NO. He said he could put me on hold and call the hotel directly himself and inquire. He came back and said no couch, no 3 people! At this point I was very confused...cause I saw the couch.....so I hung up and thought maybe if I call back and get someone else, they might be more helpful and hopefully polite. I waited about a half hour and called back, this time, I stopped the guy from transfering me to that Ramada call center. I asked if he was actually, physically at the hotel. He was. I asked if there was someone on-site who could help me book a room. He nicely transfered me to a very nice women at the hotel, who I told everything that had occurred up til now. She said they DID have rooms with couches, but you can't have more than 2 people in them due to some safety reason. ( knew I saw a couch). Ok, so I ended up booking the 2 double bed room with a Bourbon street balcony. I asked if it could be the 2nd floor instead of the 3rd to be closer to the action. The only way to get the 2nd floor balcony is if you want \"smoking\". We don't smoke, but requested smoking so we could have the 2nd floor. In summery, I would say, it's the best location if you want to be right in the thick of things. Request the \"Bourbon\" street balcony. \"smoking\", so you can get the 2nd floor (3rd is too far away from the action), and ask to speak to someone on site to book your room.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "aol", "Title": "\u201ci enjoyed it enough to write about it\u201d", "Author": "silkylady70", "ReviewID": "UR60474304", "Content": "I researched over twenty hours on a hotel for my trip to New Orleans, and i was not disappointed.

I wanted a balcony facing Bourbond Street, and there are really just three hotels that provide that - this one, Royal Sonesta, and Bourbon Orleans. The only reason why I gave the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because booking a room was a nightmare. People at the actualy hotel wouldn't talk to you. They forward you to the Ramada Central Reservation System, which appears to be located outside of the country. They don't speak great English and try to get you to book a timeshare trip every time you call. However, the web site didn't show any Bourbon Balcony rooms available, while the reservation person on the phone said that she could see one, so we went with the reservation people. After several calls we books a Bourbon Balcony room, and had our fingers crossed that we would actually get one. We had no way of making a special request, such as \"second floor\", which is what we really wanted. So when we checked in, sure enough, we got a third floor balcony (although it was facing Bourbon St as advertised). They told us second floor was smoking only, which why we didn't get it (even though we specificed that was didn't care that much about smoking/non-smoking and would take the best room available). They asked us to keep checking, which we did, and finally they gave us a second-floor room, which was much better (easier to interact with people on the street, i.e. throw them beads, etc.). Our first room had a huge balcony shared between 3 or 4 rooms. Our second room had a private balcony, which was nicer. Besides that we were happy with the hotel. It was clean and plush, both the lobby and the rooms. The walls did have some nicks on them, but the furniture was in good repair, and all room accessories seemed new and in good repair as well. The beds were comfy. Hotel staff was (for the most part) friendly and helpful. The location is what makes this hotel so awesome. It is in the middle of Bourbon St, so it is a great location for Mardi Gras or to explore French Quarter. Of course, you won't get any sleep if your room faces Bourbon St. However, we knew that, so we brought one of the \"soothing sounds' alam clock machines to block out some of the street noise, and we also had a set of ear plugs. Both of those combined allowed decent sleep even facing Bourbon St. The only other drawback is of course cost of the rooms during Mardi Gras.

I was also hoping for a better rate since we got switched. Nope; we got the same rate, $180 per night. This, we were told, did not include parking, which was $28 per day. In our room, I placed some items on the end tables, which caused them both to fall over. Upon closer inspection, I found these table balancing on one small screw. Obviously, these tables were merely for decoration. The remote was slow and tended to malfunction. The windows were painted shut. In the bathroom, we found the toilet leaking into the floor. We reported it, but no action was taken. We had to put towels down for our entire stay. Ready to party, we pushed on. As we headed out, we found two drunken males on the fifth floor attempting to pry one of the elevators open with their hands. We went downstairs and reported it as it was happening. The people at the desk didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care and no action was taken. That elevator was out the next day. These elevators were the biggest complaint I heard from the other guests. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ridiculously slow, working or not. Before we headed out, we went straight to the bar. The sign said the hotel bar was open \u00e2\u20ac\u0153until\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153. Unbelievably, we found the tiny bar closed before 10 p.m. on New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve. Ridiculous. We ventured out, had a good time and returned. On New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, we slept in, although it was very noisy. We went to the hotel caf\u00c3\u00a9 at lunch. On our way down, we asked one of the maids on the floor to clean our room. She said she would take care of it. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 looked closed but we found some workers seated. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 personnel said they were open so we took a seat. One of the women yelled to someone to come out and take our order. The food was fine but the service was horrible. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return. When we returned to our room later that day, we found that it had not been touched. We had to request additional towels because ours were wet from the leaking toilet. The maid had my wife sign something before we could get the towels. Later that night, we went back to the bar. As on the night before, they were closed before 10 p.m. Seriously? We then tried to order room service. Nope; no room service available either. We hit the vending machine but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work either. Took all our change. On Jan 3, we ordered breakfast before we headed out. The breakfast was delivered, minus the fruit I ordered. I noticed it and yelled to the lady as she walked down the hall but she never turned around. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure she heard me. I then called downstairs. They said they would send it right back up. Twenty minutes went by and I called again. Eventually, they brought the fruit back up, which consisted of only melon. On our way out, we had our usual wait at the elevators. While we stood by for one of the elevators to arrive, a male housekeeper stood by the elevators and yelled down the hall for one of the female maids. He yelled for her approximately six times. I started to walk down the hall for him, as it was obviously too far for him to walk. Check out was slow and a nightmare. We got our car and sped away, vowing to tell others of our experience. A couple of days later, I found another charge on my credit card from the hotel in the amount of $3.83. I called them for an explanation. This, I was told, was for a bottled water taken from our room during our stay. Seriously? I sent this e-mail to the hotel and to Ramada on 1/3/10. In that e-mail, I told them I intended on posting this online as a review of the hotel after a short period of time, giving the General Manager a chance to contact me about the problems. As of this date, 1/12/10, I had not heard from the General Manager. So much for customer service! Pathetic. Although the hotel is in a great spot, do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.

Apparently there is only one. Can you believe it? One bellman at an EXPENSIVE, Downtown hotel, on a holiday weekend!! We made our reservations several months in advance and requested a room close to Bourbon St., but were given a room as far from Bourbon St. as possible. All the way at the end of the hotel to be exact. The elevators were tiny. The room was tiny. In fact, the bathroom was almost as big as the room. There was no towel bar by the sink, no ref., no micro., and the coffeepot was hidden. The maid never left us enough towels. Upon check-in our room had no washcloths. We had to call down for more towels every day, sometimes waiting a VERY long time. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom and the climate control took a long time to adjust. Once we called down to have our car brought out and when we went to the garage 10 minutes later the valet hadn't even gone after it yet. However, upon check-out the bellman and valet were very speedy. Breakfast from the hotel cafe was tasty and quickly prepared. You can order individual items which are filling and much less exensive than the buffet. The menu in the room, however, did not exactly match the menu in the restaurant. We had a Toulouse St. balcony and found the noise from Bourbon St. to be rather loud in the late evening, around 10 to 2 when the bands were playing. Each night was different as each band had their own sound level. After the bands quit it was generally quiet. We found it amuzing that the music from 2 blocks away could be heard quite clearly inside your room, but there were signs all over the hallways telling people to be quiet. I was a bit dismayed by the lack of security. No one was checked for a room key when entering the building or the elevators, even though the hotel had no open restaurant in the evening. The only thing the lobby staff seemed concerned about was making sure that you got your umbrella inside a bag within an inch of entering the building. Upon making a reservation you are told that you will be charged one nights rate to hold your room, however, they did not do this. You are also told that you must cancel your reservation 2 weeks in advance to keep your deposit. They even called us a few weeks prior to our arrival to verify our credit card to make sure they were going to be paid. ( I have never encountered that before. ) Apparently, this is just their scare tactics to keep you from canceling. The desk clerk told us that they tell that to everybody, but don't do it. ( I wish I had known this in advance, because as it turned out it really turned out to be an ordeal for us to keep this reservation. My life would have been much easier if I had known that I could have canceled. ) On our last visit to New Orleans we stayed at the Monteleone and found it to be a much nicer accomodation.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pensacola, Florida", "Title": "\u201cInn on bourbon\u201d", "Author": "Tnewmark73", "ReviewID": "UR52870537", "Content": "Best Hotel best location. wonderful staff.

I often had a hard time getting someone to answer the phone at the front desk, but my wedding guests didn't report any problems. Maybe it was a fluke. The crowds were less rowdy since Mardi Gras was over, but still somewhat loud. Our suite had a balcony that overlooked Bourbon Street.

The rooms were clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. The bathrooms were not as luxurious as some of the more expensive Bourbon Street hotels, but I guess that's to be expected. They were really just nice normal bathrooms. All of the staff I encountered were very pleasant and helpful. There are no microwaves in the rooms or easily accessible in the lobby/restaurant. The in-room refrigerators are not compimentary; they were $10/night. The hotel does not offer dinner in its restaurant, which is okay considering the plethora of good restaurants in the Quarter -- just something to be aware of. There is also no hotel shuttle, which made transportation from the airport a little more difficult. Hotel parking is extremely expensive, but the rate is typical for hotels in the Quarter.

Let me add that we have stayed at this hotel many times in the past, usually with a group booking 3-4 rooms. One of the main things we have enjoyed at this hotel in the past is spending time on the large balconies and watching the action on Bourbon Street. At the time I booked, I requested 2 Beds with a large (shared) Bourbon balcony. At that time, there were plenty of balcony rooms available. We arrived around 1 and they sent us to a room with 1 King Bed (for 3 adults) and a small balcony. Next, after waiting about 3 hours, they sent us to the 4th floor and another room with a small balcony. We contacted the manager and waited on him for half an hour. He suggested that I had made a mistake in my request when booking, but agreed to move us to the 3rd floor to what he said was a room on one of the large balconies. I told him the large balcony was my priority. I even told him we would take a King Bed if they would provide a rollaway bed as long as it was on a large balcony. We had to move our luggage ourselves as they were too busy. It turned out to be another room with a small balcony. By that time, it was around 5:30 and we had wasted half the day waiting on rooms, waiting on the manager, and moving, so we gave up and stayed. The room had 2 bath towels for 3 people. We requested more the next day, so they gave us 3, but no bathmat. When we checked out, we called for a bell captain to get our luggage and waited for 45 minutes. Finally, we carried our own bags down. I suppose all this was punishment for complaining about our room. One good thing...the bartenders in the lobby bar were great; we spent a lot of time there waiting on our room and they were very helpful and nice.

We thought about staying in one of the five star luxurious hotels but we wanted to be in the middle of the action to get the feel of the real deal. We were so happy that we did! The location can't be beat. Everything is close including the areas off Bourbon. We did not rent a car and that was one of the smartest choices we made as everything is walking distance and parking is impossible. The hotel itself was very nice. The lobby had the southern charm and was charming. I was pleasantly surprised by the room since I read the negative Trip Advisor's reviews. Everything was clean and satisfactory. Upon checking in, we asked for a free upgrade to a balcony room. The front desk gave us exactly what we asked for....a balcony overlooking the pool on a higher level. We slept fine at night...no noise at all. The pool courtyard was small and was under construction for the days we were there. We could still use the pool but it was bothersome since they were using jackhammers. We really didn't run into too many drunk party animals in this hotel which was surprising since we were right on Bourbon. Security at the entrance checks your key at night before entering. (I was very happy with that.) My main concern was staying safe and I felt safe the entire trip. All in all, we had a great trip and I would recommend this hotel.

This was my first trip to New Orleans and I really didn't know what to expect. I loved where it was located if I wanted to party, but I just needed one night of sleep and I didn't get that. I would love to go back with my husband and stay there to go out to Bourbon St., but I wouldn't go by myself. The hotel was very charming and fit the Bourbon St. image. It is built into a square with the center open. There is a pool right in the center with a beautiful garden built around it with tables. There were a couple of shops and a bar/restaurant on site, but I didn't have time to enjoy either one. I had a King room with a window that faced Bourbon St. It was a very small room, but comfy. Everything was nice in the room, however you could tell that it was well worn. But for a one night stay, it was fine. There is one major complaint, but it was handled properly by the staff. There was a door for adjoining rooms with a lock on my side. About 5am, I was awakened by the sound of the door trying to be opened. Me being by myself, I just yelled for them to stop, but they didn't. I called down to the front desk and they sent someone up to that room. I didn't hear it anymore, so I figured they just warned them and that was it. When I checked out later that morning, the front desk clerk informed me that they had taken care of the problem and made them leave. She told me that the security of their guests were priority and that made me feel good. My only other complaint is how expensive the parking is, but that is at just about every hotel in New Orleans. Once I got parked, I just took a taxi where I needed to go. But don't expect if you take a taxi late in the evening, for them to let you out at the front of the hotel. Bourbon St. is basically closed off except for the side streets that cross over. Once I got back that night, I had to walk about a block through the streets with people partying.

We chose the Inn on Bourbon because of its location and the good reviews. We were not disappointed. The hotel has just undergone an extensive and complete renovation so everything was brand new. That makes the comment in another person's review that the carpet and bedding were worn and shabby very odd. I guess they must have missed the room he stayed in. He also mentioned that Big Daddy's (a strip club) was right below his balcony. This is a very deceiving comment because Bid Daddy's is actually across the street, right beneath his balcony is the first floor of the hotel. We also had a balcony room, but ours was on the inside by the courtyard as we did not want to take a chance on noise from the street bothering us once we turned in for the night. In truth we actually did not use the balcony very much but would pay extra for the balcony room again as these are the only rooms that are smoking. So unless you smoke or think you might actually spend time sitting on a balcony save the extra money and get an inside room. The rooms were very nice. As far as size goes they were standard and the bathroom was a little small but very nice and very clean. We never heard any noise from the adjoining rooms but did hear some from guests yelling the hallways. That of course is the fault of the guests, not the hotel. We did not eat in the restaurant or drink in the bar so I cannot comment on those things, but I can say that the bar was almost always empty. But why would you drink in a hotel bar when right outside the door are many bars to chose from all with live entertainment. I felt that the hotel was very pretty and did not look old at all. We walked from the lobby all the way to the gift shop at the end and everything was pretty and brand new. The service was for the most part very good. The only complaint we had was that the pool deck was still being worked on and maintenance refused to clean the pool after the workman left for the day. Shouldn't a pool be cleaned daily anyway? Understandably there was dirt and concrete in the pool from the workmen, so as they refused to clean it you could not use it, unless you wanted to swim in a dirty pool and take the chance of stepping on concrete. We requested everyday that they clean it so it could be used but it was never done. That is until Friday when the guests for a weekend wedding arrived and the pool was cleaned so they could use it. I guess their satisfaction was more important than ours. That was the day we were leaving so out of five days we only were able to use the pool once. When we made our reservations we were not told that the pool would not be able to be used. We were actually told that by the time we arrived the renovations at the hotel would be complete. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The problem with the pool was the only complaint and will not be an issue the next time we go as the work should be done in about a week. If you plan to party on Bourbon Street this is the perfect location to stay. It is just about in the middle of all the action and you don't have to figure out how to get back to your hotel after a night of partying as it is right there. Also at night when you return to the hotel you have to present you room key to the security guard at the door to be allowed in, so there are no strange people rooming around the hotel.

My husband and I were able to use some credit card reward points for the room, which is how we selected the property, while our friends booked through the hotel directly. They reported they got very reasonable rates. One of the couples got a balcony room, overlooking Toulouse. The other couple had a standard room with window over Toulouse, and my husband and I were on the front of the hotel, directly over Bourbon Street. Basically, if you look at the picture of the hotel on the web site, we had the tiny windows right over the flags. :-) I was pleased on check-in to find we had a non-smoking room. I had requested this, but because we were using points it was not guaranteed. I was slightly surprised that we had a room overlooking Bourbon Street, which seems a premium spot, but guess it isn't as popular because of the noise factor. And it was LOUD. But we expected this, so no worries there. The staff was very pleasant on check-in and even allowed us to unload our cars at curbside where we pulled up on Bourbon, even though they aren't really supposed to ... shhh! and directed us how to pull around to the parking deck. The bellman was great - wonderful personality! The balcony room wasn't ready yet, so he brought our friends' bags to our room and then came back to switch them over later when their room was ready. Our room was on the third floor. The elevators had a persistent odor of natural gas throughout the weekend that led us to fear they would blow up, but no problems. The room was pretty small and looked worn. The bed was a bit saggy. There were 2 small windows with 2 wing chairs and a little table between them. Everything was clean. The bathroom was fine, with a marble vanity and nice toiletries from Bath & Body Works. The shower had good water pressure and temperature. Again, everything seems well-worn, not just because of the historic location, but more likely because it's a popular party hotel. But again, very clean, no complaints. The rooms are LOUD. Especially ours that overlooked Bourbon directly. The party started at 1 p.m. and continued literally all night, until 4 or 5 a.m. At that point, the trash department came around and started dumping the dumpsters. We stayed out pretty late most nights, so it wasn't that big a deal to us. You definitely should request a courtyard room if this is going to be a problem. However, in addition to the street noise, we found the noise inside the hotel to be loud as well. The walls were paper thin. Our first morning, around 5 a.m. after listening to the revelry all night and adjusting, our neighbors came home to find one had suffered a house fire. We were treated to the resulting screaming, crying, and hysterical phone calls for the next two hours. It was like they were in our room. We understood, but even normal conversation is practically full volume. Also, the crack under the main door to the room was at least an inch high. No barrier there. Very odd. We did not eat at the restaurant, but sat at the bar in the lobby a couple times. Unremarkable and tucked behind a wall so you'd never know it's there unless you looked. We didn't use the pool but it looked nice and there were always people out there during this hot season in New Orleans. Overall, we had a nice stay here. It's definitely not an upscale property, but everything seems to be reasonably well maintained. I think the beds could use an upgrade, if the one in our room was any indication. The staff was friendly. As other posters have mentioned, they had good security, requiring us to show our room keys to enter the lobby at night. Nice decor in the lobby.

We had a wonderful experience. I was a little worried at first because we already had this trip booked when we stayed at another Ramada hotel (Hazleton, PA) which was not so great, but the Inn on Bourbon is not your typical Ramada. The building is converted from an old French opera house. The lobby is beautiful and luxurious. Our room was an average sized room with 2 double beds (the hotel was full and there were no king rooms left). The room was clean, the beds were comfy, the bathroom was not huge, but bigger than most hotel bathrooms I've experienced. On the first day, we noticed the tub was draining slowly. We notified the front desk on our way out to breakfast and it was fixed by the time we returned. Our room faced Toulouse St., so we could hear the band at the bar next door starting at 1PM and going non-stop through the night every night, but we didn't mind much because we were out on Bourbon St. partying until about 4AM every night. If you want to sleep, the interior rooms have balconies over the courtyard area with the pool, but the hotel fills up fast and there is no guarantee you'll get one of those rooms. The priciest rooms have balconies over Bourbon St. The courtyard and pool are very nice and well maintained. A waiter will bring cocktails and food poolside. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It is on one of the busiest corners on Bourbon Street. Security is pretty tight in the evening. There is a security guard at the door, and you must show a room key to enter. This hotel is for people that want to party and be in the center of the action. There is a topless bar directly across the street. If that sort of thing bothers you, stay elsewhere.

Located directly on Bourbon Street, almost in the middle of the Quarter the location is really excellent. We planned this trip for my 40th birthday and my friend suggested the Inn on Bourbon as she has stayed there before. My first choice was the Royal Sonesta (the best in the Quarter if you ask me) however their rates were almost double that of the Inn. I have had some really unpleasant experiences with Ramada and so I was reticent but..after all, a bad day in New Orleans is still better than a good day anywhere else so I decided to book it. First off, this property is no ordinary Ramada, it's a Ramada Plaza, the brand's high end. It was a lovely old building, well maintained with every amenity you could ask for in a reasonably priced hotel. There is a breakfast restaurant (skip it and go either to Brennan's for a blowout or try Petunia's around the corner, fantastic food for breakfast lunch and dinner with great prices all day long. Go early, the lines get crazy). There is a little bar in the lobby which is often closed but you're on Bourbon so who cares?! The staff could not have been more outgoing, attentive or professional. They couldn't do enough for us and even upgraded us to a balcony room in honor of my birthday. The most shocking thing is the tranquility within the hotel itself. The doors must be made of magic because once they close you can barely hear any Bourbon street noise in the lobby. Our room had a balcony facing the interior courtyard which houses the pool. Really beautiful and tranquil. The rooms were large and well appointed and very, very clean.

The bar hours were varying as well, but we put that down to \"off-season\" hours, visited a liquor store, and had a stash in the room! No big deal. The location is perfect for clubs, loud music, walking around the French Quarter over to Canal, Jackson Square, Harrah's, etc. Be aware however, the noise of the music is loud, very loud, until about 3:00 in the morning and then the revellers leave very loudly from most places as well. To be honest, the music lulled us to sleep. The balcony was great fun for watching people (drunk and sober) experiencing New Orleans. We wanted the French Quarter experience and were very pleased with our choice. Would I stay here again? Unlikely, simply because we've done it and don't need to again. Next time, I'd stay at a quieter, newer facility with more amenities, but only because that is our taste, and does not reflect our satisfaction with Inn on Bourbon.

It was like a little oasis of calm in the middle of the fun and sightseeing, which was the purpose of the trip. The room was like a normal hotel room with hints of New Orleans decor.

She saved us about $100 just starting with the room. Valet charges roughly $20 a day, it's charged to your room so you don't have the hassle of dealing with that seperately, and believe me your car is pulled around, with your baggage already loaded, waiting on YOU when you check out. It took us all of 7 minutes, from check out, to driving off!

Coffee maker, in room safe, free highspeed internet access, luxury bedding. The pillows & bedding were absolutely awesome. Bed, Bath & Beyond toiletries. Wrought Iron Balconies, with Bistro table & chairs, cable T.V. They had movies that you could purchase that were still in Theaters. So, we watched movies from our room. (That was a plus for us) We didn't feel like going out one night ( hung over), so we watched movies & watched the crowds from the balcony. The security is the best I've ever seen.

We went during the SugarBowl, so their were alot of rowdy college kids, just out to party and have fun, the horses were tied right along side the alley portion of our hotel.

We went to NO about 4 weeks before Katrina hit, and this was our first time to go back since then. There are very few buildings that actually were boarded up .

If you want to stay somewhere with a more personal touch and in a more quiet location, I can highly recommend the 1896 O'Malley House B&B (#1 rated in New Orleans).

I was a little nervous that the inside of the hotel would reflect the insanity of the street below. As soon as we got inside, I realized I didn't have to worry. The inside of the hotel was clean, quiet, and very welcoming. The front desk and concierge were friendly and ready to answer any questions we had. Our room had a balcony which overlooked the courtyard and pool, which was really nice. From our balcony and the pool, the noise from Bourbon Street was completely blocked out, but the great thing was, we were in walking distance of all the bars, and could party whenever we wanted to, but then retreat to our room when we were done. Unfortunately, Katrina made a big mess of a good deal of New Orleans. The French Quarter (where this hotel is) didn't get hit as bad, but many other parts of the city are still in terrible shape, even 9 months later.

The smell was terrible in the morning with all the garbage, urine and vomit smells. We had to walk a few blocks over to avoid the smell.

I have to start by saying that we are never usually complainers and understand that things go wrong and no place is perfect. Upon check in, we asked the front desk clerk if she was giving us a good room and she says Oh, yes it is a nice room right on Bourbon Street. Ya-hoo for us! Our excitement was very short lived once we saw this great room on Bourbon. You could barely see a thing because we were right over an awning of the Balcony room below us. We had to crane our necks and press our cheeks against the window panes to get a glimpse down the street. The room overall was nicely appointed with a pleasing color scheme. We are generally early risers and hit the streets before 9:00am each morning. We always hang the sign that says \"refresh our room\". This was of no use - each day we came back to the room at about 2:00 to rest before dinner and the room was still not done. We figured that the room finally was cleaned at about 3:00 each day. One day, we only received 1 bath towel, and no toilet paper - I was finally able to track someone down to get what we would need. No other rooms had their signs out, but they all managed to get their rooms cleaned before ours - go figure.... I suppose the general excuse is because of Katrina. I am sorry, but this excuse does not cut it on this issue. On the morning of our departure, Monday, I called down to the front desk to see about a late check out. Their normal check out time is 12:00noon. I asked to stay until 2 or 3, and was told that they could only extend until 1:00. What a joke since our maid does not even bother to clean the room until 3:00! We tried to use the business center to print out our boarding passes only to find that their internet connection was not working. They called an employee to fix the problem.

This will be my 6th trip to NOLA & I have stayed in all manner of room, from a suite in a time share to a small room at the St. Anne Marie Antoinette. I loved the Ramada as much for its location as for its personality. You do not go to New Orleans to stay in a \"typical\" hotel, at least I don't. I want the narrow rooms that feel like \"old times\", I can stay at a Holiday Inn anywhere. We found the staff to be extremely friendly & helpful; we requested a frig for the room & had one within an hour of check-in. The concierge gave us several great restaurant suggestions, for restaurants \"off the beaten path\". All of the complaints about security make no sense to me. I want to feel safe in my person & my belongings while on vacation. I would think others would also! Who wants strangers roaming the hallways? I expect that at Mardi Gras or other holiday/festival times, the staff must be meaner and more strict, because those are the times when such measures are warranted. This is a typical New Orleans hotel, not the Ritz, but if you want the Ritz, go to New York! I love the Inn and recommend it to all who can afford it!", "Date": "April 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harlingen, TX", "Title": "\u201cA Ruined Anniversary\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1688266", "Content": "I have used the reccommendations of tripadvisor.com's visitors many times and have never been disappointed, until now. Why? Because I did not read the reviews before I booked (and I prepaid and could not cancel). I agree with the others that say that the staff is extremely rude and stuck up. They think just because they have one of the few properties actually on Bourbon Street that they are the bomb! I am not going to go into as much detail as others have, but I would not reccommend this hotel to anyone in my circle of friends or family. To summarize... we had a small, smelly, musty room with green mold growing out of control in our tub area. Not only is this not a good choice for a hotel while visiting New Orleans it is potentially a health hazard. Oh, and I never saw one staff member smile or look happy to be there. The restaurant leaves alot to be desired too. I am off my soap box, do what you want to do. Outside of the hotel issues, out 3rd anniversary went off without a hitch! We did tour a hotel while we were there, called Iberville Suites by Ritz-Carlton, FABULOUS hotel with a free full-american breakfast buffet they said! That's where we are staying next time. And their rates are better than Ramada.
