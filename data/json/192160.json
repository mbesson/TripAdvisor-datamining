After viewing the hotel on the website, it seemed a good standard 3 star that represented value for money. However, when we arrived it was a different story. We were in a double room on the second floor. The hotel in general is in need of a good clean and updating. Our room was damp with mould all over the walls and ceiling. The bathroom was covered in mould and mildew, the curtains were hanging off (as were several light fittings and, quite worryingly, a plug socket). After we'd seen the room, we decided not to stay. My boyfriend went to the reception to explain. While the lady on reception was friendly, she asked us what we expected from a 3 star. We expect there to be less facilities and luxury than a 4 or 5 star, but the same standard of cleanliness and comfort. at \u00a3100 per night, I don't think that they can justify the state of the room, which was further confirmed when we found a hotel for the weekend just around the corner in Earl's Park (a couple of miles away) that was clean and modern for \u00a370 a night! It's worth mentioning that we didn't get charged for the second night, but the hotel still charged \u00a3100 for the first night that we were supposed to stay but didn't. Unless you are paying rock bottom prices, don't stay here.

Single rooms were booked out everywhere. Location was handy for me but that was it. Two old houses side by side, dirty hallway, narrow steep stairs, bedroom was clean enough but overpriced and hadn't realised but had to share a bathroom. The shower curtain was absolutely filthy, needing to be steeped in bleach at least, or thrown out. Bedroom was ok, double bed with new bed clothes, laminate floor and what appeared to be new sliding aluminium door in front of window to block noise from trains, which it did. So slept very well. Following day went to check out, the 'reception' is in breakfast room so sat down and had my breakfast! This was good actually and though on the booking it was not included in price, I felt justified in having it when shown to a table by the receptionist as the bedroom was totally overpriced, no reduction for one person in a double room and shared bathroom.

If you are looking to actually relax after a day of touring around and/or a night of pub crawling, the Avonmore is perfect for you. Yes, the tube runs through the backyard, but the windows are double glazed and we never found it to be an issue; our sleep was never distrubed by the noise. There is a small selection of restaurants in the area - Persian, Chinese, greasy burger shop, &c. There are a few cute pubs that also serve meals. The tube station is a quick walk from the hotel, making it easy to get to any attraction you may be interested in seeing. The staff is adorable. Someone should base a sitcom around this place! There is \"Helga\" (we nicknamed her that), the Amazon Angelica Huston lookalike who seems to be the maid and the cook (and a fine cook! we enjoyed breakfast each day!). She walks around barefoot quite a bit. Then there is the tiny Asian night bartender, who measures out shots in a bottle cap! The proprietress is very chatty and sweet. She also has an affection towards skintight jeans - meow!! Overall, a great experience. Loved the quiet location. The place could use a bit of TLC, but is kept clean.

Well placed for access to buses and tube Bad points: 1. On arrival, the main door was out of use due to a broken lock and was to remain so for our stay, so we had to access via the basement door! 2. One room was on the first floor, with the two remaining on the 4th. The stairway was extremely narrow, with glass fire doors, one of which was consistently wedged open (this was done by the owner right in front of me), presenting an extreme fire hazard as there was no other way out other than to jump from the 4th floor! 3. The rooms appeared clean on first sight, and indeed the sheets and pillow cases were, but the blankets and bedspreads were stained and appeared not to have been washed for some time. 4. Some of our beds were made on the second day, but one was left unmade, only 2 milk capsules left on arrival for 3 people, but 9 on 2nd day! There was no hot water on the 2nd day but this was fixed quickly after speaking to the person on duty. 5. The breakfast was disappointing. Cereal was either museli or cornflakes of which we ordered the latter - they were clearly cheap alternatives and tasted awful. We then had cooked breakfast which was actually quite tasty, but the sausages were poor quality and there were no tomatoes (as advertised), and no veggie option. The food is prepared and cooked to a small kitchen right next to the dining room, with the door wide open which is a little off putting. 6. On checking out we were asked to pay by cash (something I notice other guests have been asked to do). We didn't have the \u00c2\u00a3200 plus required in cash so the Visa was accepted in the end. Very odd.... 8. One of my party was in a 4th floor room and was kept awake for over 2 hours by the noise of a TV coming from a neighbouring house, in addition to the trains to the rear of the hotel and traffic noise to the front. 7. Generally the decor was very dated and shabby, towels frayed and old, bathrooms contained mould and needed more attention paid to the cleaning of them Overall, I would say that the websited is quite misleading, and guests should be warned that the tube runs directly behind the hotel, and the road is fairly busy to the front. It should also be noted that there is no lift, and therefore is not suitable for elderly (or unfit/infirm) people. The staff, however were very polite, and did remedy any immediate problems we had.

The website was very attractive and we were looking forward to our stay based on this. We are looking for a hotel to stay in Kensington for a family of 4. The Avonmore was described on the website as a 4 diamond hotel, on a quite street in close to local sites and transportation. The description of the hotel mentioned privately owed, mentioned that it had won an award , great care and attention has been dedicated to the furnishings and accessories. One of the most pleasant affordable hotels in central London. We experienced the following issues at the hotel: 1. Bed bug bites 2. Dirty blankets, bedspreads and overall bedding 3. Pillows were well used, and uncomfortable beds 4. Old rotting food in the mini bar from previous client 5. Floor / sink area visible dirt 6. Carpeting - evidence of dirt and objects from previous clients on the floor 7. Noise level high from train tracks located right outside of our window. 8. dead bugs in the walls 9. dirty curtains and windows 10. stained upholstered furniture Overall, we found the housekeeping conditions of this hotel to be completely unsatisfactory and to be a health hazard. We could not sleep with the bedding and had to strip bedding off of the beds down to the top sheets. We still ended up with visible bed bugs bites all over our bodies. We met a hotel keeper who was basically in charge of the reception desk, the breakfast prep and running the hotel. She mentioned to me that Sunday was a long day for her...7 a.m to 12 midmight. We spend our first night in the hotel and the following morning, I worked to find another hotel and express my concerns to the hotel management. The hotel keeper on site was kind and understanding of my complaints about overall housekeeping nd offered to call the hotel owner who was not on duty on Sunday 7/8. She offered to talk to the maid ( who she said did not speak any English) and try to have her spend extra time in the rooms cleaning. I insisted on talking to the manager of the hotel. The hotel keeper told me that she did not like to be disturbed on a Sunday and that I could talk to her in person on Monday as she would be there serving the breakfast. I insisted that we needed other rooms or better accomodations immediately that we could not sleep another night in the hotel in this condition. She called the manager...and spoke with her to convey my frustrations about our accomodations...We did not mention bug bites to her. The manager refused to talk to me over the phone. She insisted on communicating through the hotel keeper. She offered to locate new blankets for the room and offered this up. She told the hotel keeper that if we left the hotel, she would charge us for all 5 nights unless she was able to rebook the rooms. I kept insisting to talk to her with no avail. After the phone call, the hotel keeper said that she was very sorry that we were not satisfied, she told me that she could do very little, only have the maid clean extra long in the rooms, that she understood my complaints, that the owner was Polish, that she was British and that she understood the standards we were expecting. My family and I checked out of the hotel...paid cash for the one night stay ( they had originally billed my Visa for this amount and refused to refund it once I paid the cash). We itched our way to our new hotel location. Upon checking in to my hotel, I found out that my Visa card had been billed for the entire 5 night stay.
