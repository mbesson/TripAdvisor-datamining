This should be a 2 star at most, it's absolutely filthy and the staff unprofessional, I checked out after 2 days. The first room they gave us had faulty air con, long dark hair all over the kitchen floor, food splattered all over the microwave and dust everywhere. One of the maintenance men looked at me as if I was strange for complaining of a 25 degree room temp and saying the place was dirty. We changed rooms and the second one was superficially clean but still substandard. The micro was dirty, the rubbish bin stunk and the kitchen equipment wouldnt fetch 50p at a car boot sale. The pans had bits of curry and oil in them so a trip to Ikea ensued for some cheap cups etc. And hangers too- there were only 3 in the wardrobe. The noise of the planes was unbearable and that's coming from a former air hostess so it must have been bad! The bathroom was also a disgrace- a coaster was used as a soap dish, the toilet seat wouldn't stay up- word of caution to male guests :)- the towels were threadbare and the shower head was rusted. The bed had all its life bounced out of it and made for a painful nights sleep. If that wasn't enough, the corridors were a disgrace too, with stained carpets and a hum of oil, smoke, BO and old food. When I was on my own, I felt the male staff leering at me and felt rather uneasy.

The sink in the bathroom was clogged, didn't drain at all. Stayed in Rm 129 near the elevator so there was a lot of foot traffic outside the door. The room overlooks the courtyard.

This is a nice, large, full service hotel about a 10 minute drive from the Dubai International airport. VERY clean, large and spacious rooms, which Americans like me absolutely love (Americans love big rooms), and so it is no suprise that I always find a large contingent of western travelers staying here. Beds are very comfortable, AC works well, beautifully appointed bathrooms with lots of hot water. Great food at restaurant located on ground floor and very convenient hours, especially the dinner menu, which is available pretty late into the evening, which is nice if you are arriving from a late flight at the Dubai airport. Location seems to be good, as it is located directly across from the large Reef mall. Also, a very well equipped and attractive gym and spa located on the 3rd floor, and a great rooftop swimming pool that is perfect for soaking in some arabian sun!

Very impressive quality and decor for the price, we paid around \u00a380 a night, perhaps because it was a late booking, list price is around \u00a3200 a night. Definately a 4 star hotel with all hotel facilities, just that rooms happen to have kitchens to make them self contained living spaces, all staff helpful and friendly, lovely pool and reasonable sized fitness centre, all very quiet, just what the doctor ordered. Only gripe is wifi access is around \u00a33/hour, there is an internet cafe across the road in the Reef Mall at \u00a31/hour, shame the hotel is milking this so much. Also the standard for the hotel is 3 guests per room, fourth charged extra, however when I booked via Expedia I booked for 4, when we checked in the Desk clerk asked me to pay extra, but when I pointed out I had booked for 4 he agreed so no charge. This is a city hotel, so if you want beaches then Jumeirah beach park is around 30-40 minutes by taxi, the Gold souk and the Abra station around 25 minutes walk, can be done in 40 degrees C, but you will be a bit sweaty. Definately recomend the hotel, 2 supermarkets now, a Carrefour express to the left and another local brand across the road at the bottom of the Reef Mall. Always direct taxi drivers to the Reef Mall they may not know the hotel, although some did. Al Ghafari City Mall is across the road and past the Reef Mall on the right hand side, you will spot Nandos through the next road to your right, if you reach Burger King you have passed it, there is a cinema and resturaunts (Pizza Hut, Nandos, Burger King), not very exotic, but nice places to eat none the less. As I said very nice hotel/apartment building, the front is closed due to metro works, but did not disturb us at all, using the back for taxi access and front for pedestrian was not a problem, we were on the 2nd floor with a huge balcony, great for wathcing the world pass by at the Mall across the road.

Beautiful apartments, with large kitchen area, microwave and washing machine. Only downside was no balcony but having said that it was 46 degrees in the daytime and 40 at night time so it was a bit hot to sit out for too long. Pool nice and clean and because it was so hot we had it pretty much to ourselves. Beach towels supplied for you and there was a sauna and steam room to. (we did not use it as we were having our own sauna outside). Some taxi drivers did not really know where the apartments were, because I think it is quite new, but asked to be dropped off outside Reef Mall and it is right across the road. There were some road works outside which were 24hrs a day but you honestly could not hear them and because of this if the taxi drivers could find it you had to go round the back, but not a problem, the back of the hotel was quite nice after you had walked thru a few parking spaces there were chairs and tables to sit at. All staff very pleasant and polite. We did not use the restaurant for breakfast as we were never up in time but there are plenty of coffee shops all over. Would definately stay here again.
