{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Unless there are no other choices I've booked this hotel online with LateRooms and on their map the hotel was shown in the city center. I was told only after the reservation that the real price was 50 euros less than expected per person. I was so happy I wanted to look on Google Maps how to reach the place and here surprise! The hotel real location was many Kms away the place shown on the first map seen.At least I thought usually hotels that are away from city center offers something better in order to be competitive. It is supposed to be a 3 stars but infact they threat you as in the worst pension you can imagine.My room was full of mosquitos, dust everywhere, dirty bed linen and the whole atmosphear was gloomy and old. The carpet in hallway and elevator was unstuck and kinda dangerous if you did not pay attention to it.Breakfast was the worst part, forget about the usual huge breakfast you can gave in a normal hotel, here I was asked if I wanted tea or coffe and just one cup was served. No pastries whatsoever, just some toasted bread (in plastic wrapping) with butter and jam. No fresh water, nothing just the sad, unprofessional and superficial service around us.", "Date": "May 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR296013995", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "AntoDublin"}, {"Content": "Real (---) We were staying in that hotel for the one night and i can say that it's really worst hotel i have ever seen. Dirty, with brocken douche, terrible breakfast and not in the city center and cost was 100 euro per night. Also they tried to charge me twice - 1st time they told me that credit card transaction was interrupted and asked to pay by cash, i paid, but later, after 3 hours i got sms notification from my bank that they charged my card. Time of transaction was 3 hours later than that interrupted transaction, so they processed my card somehow when i left the hotel.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR938315313", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "L'albergo \u732b semplicemente molto...   showReview(16730944, 'full');", "Date": "May 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR476356767", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ci siamo fermati soli 3 giorni...   showReview(16728552, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR728570280", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "La struttura alberghiera non \u732b...   showReview(16728860, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR349504038", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "No vay\u8c29is de ning\u7164n modo   showReview(7593933, 'full');", "Date": "May 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR406813827", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Peque79"}, {"Content": "All'hotel real ero in...   showReview(11344845, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR445726023", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "La mia opinione \u732b buona, in...   showReview(11344846, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR268055105", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d529691-r7593908-Hotel_Real-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "529691", "Price": "$108"}}
