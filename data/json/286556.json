That the hotel was by far beyond my expectations! And the staff!!! OMG The staff is so helpful and with big bright smile on their faces! Room is great! The Lobby is very well designed and always clean and quiet... Nice music in the evening whilst sitting down iPading and drinking a beer :) It is not hard to walk from there to any of the major sites (faster than vaporetto) but you MUST enjoy walking and getting lost! My husband and I have told all our friends and family about this hotel and we can't wait to go back!!! Thank you guys for the best holidays ever!

We therefore selected the Residenza because it seemed to represent excellent value for money as part of a trip booked through Lastminuit, and the location seemed somewhat intriguing. I researched its position online and emailed the hotel for precise directions. They replied promptly with a full list of alternative methods of reaching the hotel from the airport. We decided to catch a public No 5 bus, which runs from just outside the arrivals lounge to the main bus station in Venice, the Piazzal de Roma. It cost 5 euros each. From there we caught a waterbus to St Alvese. We purchased a 72 hour pass for 33 euros per person as we intended to use the vaperreto a great deal during our stay. When we arrived at the hotel we were impressed by the lobby and our room was plenty big enough for the three of us, in fact the double bed was absolutely huge! There was a nice clean bathroom and we overlooked a pretty courtyard. Some rooms overlooked the canal but we were happy with ours. We were offered a complimentary drink, which I thought was a really friendly touch. I liked the location as it seemed there were a great deal less tourist traps around, such as ghastly souvenir shops and restuarants serving suspect food. Instead the little shops and bistros were authentic and patronised by locals. Breakfast was a real surprise, as it far surpassed any other I have eaten in similar classed hotels. It was plentiful and there was lots of choice. I would therefore recommend this establishment without any reservations and hope to be able to return again one day soon. On the day we left my husbad asked the receptionist if we could buy the book which I had borrowed from the lobby and only half read, but he insisted that we took it as a gift....it doesn't sound much, but to me it's the little acts of generosity and friendliness which mark out one hotel from another.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cQuiet getaway in Venice close to lovely local tavernas, restaurants & cafes\u201d", "Author": "Panda9", "ReviewID": "UR126540301", "Content": "We did not know anything about where to stay in Venice and it was our first trip. What a lovely surprise this little charming hotel was! There is a great little bar where you can have all sorts of drinks and cocktails made be a very friendly barman. The restaurant is open til late if you get stuck. Breakfasts have everything you could want from continential to full hot breakfast. Rooms are spacious, modern and clean. Best of all, it is located away from all the crazy tourist spots, so it is quiet, peaceful and enjoyable to walk around the area, where there are lots of locals with local tavernas (bars), restaurants and cafes. Location is also PERFECT as the airport boat stop is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel, catch a boat (rather than a bus) from the airport, it's very speedy and only takes about 30 mins. if you catch the bus it is about 30 minutes bus trip then add walking/vaporetto time etc plus it's not as nice. It is only about 20 minutes walk to St Mark's Square anyway. Make sure you get a day pass to travel on the vaporettos (you can buy them for 24, 48 and 72 hours etc depending on how long you stay). The nearest vaporetto stop is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel and so easy to use, just like the Paris Metro or the London underground, but by boat, so much nicer! That means you can get to all the sites by little ferry boat and no need to get lost on the streets of Venice (unless you want to of course, which is fun too)!.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTHIEVES IN VENICE\u201d", "Author": "Ian J", "ReviewID": "UR126415597", "Content": "Whilst the Hotel was adequate I unfortunately left my Kindle on the bed.

What we love is that it is in a quiet, residencial and beautifully Venician area that makes like you feel like a part of the real city rather than just a tourist. A short walk from the main thoroughfare of Rio Tera San Leonardo with its shops and restaurants and adjacent to the old Campo del Ghetto plus only a 20min walk from the Piazzale Roma.There are also closer bars and family run resaurant along the canal from the hotel and while it is quiet the area is well lit and we always feel very safe. Infact this is an ideal base for walking anywhere on the island (and we are in our 50s!) a few mins from St Alvis plus 10 mins stroll from Fondamenta Nuove and the water bus to the islands of Cimitero, Murano & Burano (all done in a day). The hotel has a basically two different style rooms standard and suite, the latter having a mezzanine bedroom area but having had both they are both a very good standard thought the suite gives you more room. All rooms have a fridge, safe & hairdryer but no kettle or cups so take your own.The standard of decor is modern in an old building with lots of brick and wood so has a very comfortable feel. The bar is cosy and friendly and an ideal place to chat to the multi national guests about their days discoverys.The breakfast is superb, self service so ideal to set you up for the days sight seeing with hot and cold meats, cheeses, breads, cereal, cakes, tarts and drinks as much as you want. The staff are always happy to help and constantly filling trays with food. Finally this year, for the first time, we had a problem with a slight smell from the bathroom floor drain but on discussing it with the reception, all of whom seem multi-lingual, we were upgraded from a standard room to a suite for the remaining 3 nights. We have stayed in hotels on the Grand Canal, even overlooking the Rialto, but this is the one we keep coming back to. A bargain especially in November when we always go. hope to see you there.

But I have a problem with the attitude,service and ... heating .. of this hotel. We arrived at the reception just to hear that our \"canal view\" rooms had been upgraded to junior suite \"garden view\". We explained that we did not want \"garden view\" but our booked \"canal view\". They explained that junior suite were bigger and nicer but they could show us the \"canal view\" if we wanted. We said we wanted to see them . Then they suddenly told us that our \"canal View\" rooms had a water problem (strangely enough both) that's why we where \"upgraded\". We went to see the junior suites. Basically they are under the roof rooms with a mezzanine, with the bedroom watching the roof and the floor under watching the wall. The only window is on the stair and it's the only place that you could see something like a garden if you would move the curtains away. The room was so dark and so unappealing that we asked to be downgraded to a classic room where you actually could see outside. IN the evening after dinner we then just happened to hear a couple that just arrived at reception that still got a \"canal view\" room that they had reserved. Thanks ... It seems this all has a system. The hotel has only 9 \"canal view\" rooms. It seems that they love to \"upgrade\" the people to the weird garden view junior suites as not just airplane overbook. This is extremely nonprofessional . As for the rooms. It was impossible to turn the air-conditioning off . Yes there is a switch, but it does not work, it has to be turned off by the reception on the computer .. and .. it still does not work. At the end they came to the room just to see that it was just cold and there was no way to turn it off and we got blankets as they could not offer a heater. We two small kids we decided we had to change hotel (not to mention we where paying 400/euro a night for this mess). The Bar is amazing , they have a full menu of drinks but the bar keeper tells you that the only thing he can do and server is Spritz , white wine and red wine. Go figure.

It was very clean and spacious and the staff were fantastic - very helpful and friendly. It was a bit difficult to find but I think that's the case for 99% of hotels in Venice! The breakfasts were very good, an excellent range of breads, cheeses, meats, fruits, teas, coffees, cereals and just about anything else you could think of. The hotel was also very clean and had a nice garden area to relax and have a drink in. It's also close to a port and a supermarket which is very handy. The hotel is in the jewish ghetto region - which is superb. It may seem a bit out of town but I can assure you, it's in a excellent location. It's actually only about 10 mins walk to the train station once you know the route! But after battling through the crowds in central Venice during the day you'll be glad to retreat to a slightly more relaxed part of the city. Also, the alleyways and canals around this hotel host some of the best restaurants in the city. We really can't speak highly enough of the area.

On the plus side, the hotel looks very nice. The lobby has an \"African\" theme and you can tell that much of the hotel has been newly renovated. The rooms are spacious, which you often do not find in European hotels, and the bathrooms are very nice. The breakfast bar in the morning is very good, probably the best part of this hotel. There is a large selection of foods, but hot and cold, and excellent coffee. The outdoor door garden is also another really nice perk to this hotel. Finally, what made my stay at this hotel worth all the bad that I'm about to tell you is the night manager at the front desk. I never caught his name, but I have never had a more friendly and helpful person working at a hotel in all my travels in Europe. The guy was amazing. This is where all the good stops though, I'm afraid. The restaurant was never open. I'm not sure why, but it wasn't. The bathtub didn't drain and someone had to be sent in to fix it. By fix it, I mean he simply tore out the metal stopper altogether, so that you no longer had the option of taking a bath, only showers. The day manager was horrible. Simply put, the man was rude. I'm not talking about the typical rude that you find with most European hotels, this guy was over the top rude. I think I could probably go on and on about how terrible he was, but I'll just end it with this; not at all helpful, didn't seem like he wanted to be there at all, didn't make you feel like you wanted to be there at all, just belligerent and benevolent. Finally, and this is probably the worst part: bedbugs. I noticed that I have a couple of bites that itched like crazy after the first night, but I attributed that to mosquitoes as I slept with the windows open. After the second night though, I was tore up. I have bites all over me now. Overall, this hotel is not worth staying at and why exactly it got such good reviews on here I'll never actually know. The location is terrible, you're on the exact opposite side of where you really want to be. The service during the day was severely lacking.

We really liked the hotel and Venice is fantabulous. The hotel's a little away from the centre (a 30 minute stroll to St Mark's Sq) but we really liked being away from the crowds and tourist traps, This does mean that it is not suitable for those unable or unwilling to walk a little.

It's only a short walk from San Alvise though not completely obvious to find first time. Some Venice tips: - Better to go slightly off season (early June was perfect temperature wise), - Venice is expensive but not as bad as I was led to believe (especially staying away from the centre), - Buy a travel card from the airport - it was E33 for a 3 day pass which covered all transport (bus and boat). My partner only paid E18 as he is under 29. - The vaporetta is the way to get around town. They're pretty frequent and an experience in themselves. - Gondolas are expensive!

This pink hotel near San Alvise vaporetto stop, however, was a pretty interesting place to stay at. # Transportation: From the Marco Polo airport, you can take a bus to Piazalle Roma. Then take a vaporetto to San Alvise stop. (Ask the tourist information/bus information desk at both places for the exact numbers of the bus/vaporetto.) Once you get off the San Alvise stop, it's a short walk away with several turns from the hotel. This might be a bit confusing if you arrive at night or when there is nobody else around to ask for directions. The hotel is not right in the center of Venice, but if you like some place nice and quiet outside of the main tourist attraction, this hotel is it. # Amenities: very nice bathroom with good products (try the shower gel... it smells divine!) The room was not too big, not too small, really nice with very large windows and beautiful wood decor. # Wifi: wifi is NOT included. 1 hour = 4 euro; 4 hours = 7 euro. We paid for the 4-hour access. # Breakfast: nice selection of ham, salami, cheese, croissant, cakes, yogurt, fruits, orange juices, milk, etc. For me, food and drinks were really good. # Staff: this is where I got mixed experience. We met with three staff members. The first one was a very nice guy who went out of his way to help us with fixing the wifi. The second one was another nice guy who lent us an adapter since we were short of one. The third one whom we met the morning we left the hotel on 09-Mar was a straightforward Italian guy who, when I asked to borrow the phone to call my hotel in Rome, responded, \"Borrow? Nothing is free here, you know that.\" He later on did let me borrow the phone but was not enthusiastic at all with helping me to connect through, so I ended up not being able to make that phone call. To that third staff member if you ever read this: I do know that almost nothing in life is free. I also believe that there are many ways to convey that message. The attitude you gave me was appropriate given that I was a customer at your hotel. If the call were indeed not free, you could have told me something like this, \"I just want to let you know that a phone call to Rome would cost xyz euro. Would you like to make the call?\" Or you could have just replied with a nice yes and helped me with making that simple call. I didn't give you an attitude back nor did I contact management because my overall stay up until that morning was pleasant and I didn't want to ruin my experience any further. I'm not sure if you were being rude or it was your style of humor. If it were the first, I hope you'll learn that while nothing in life is free, kindness doesn't hurt and rudeness doesn't help.

It is situated in Cannaregio an authentic traditional part of Venice right next to the Campo De Gheto Novo, which is the oldest Jewish settlement in Europe. FIRST IMPRESSIONS\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The hotel is at the of a long narrow street. It has quite a small entrance that opens up into a big wonderful reception area. There are 4 steps into the reception area. Once your inside you are faced with a large open space, which is quite a surprise as the front looks so small. The floors are all marble & the ceiling is made from wooden beams. The large reception desk is on the right hand side & then there is a lovely seating area to the left, which has several leather chairs & sofas. The hotel is very peaceful & quiet. If you walk straight through the reception area you have the bar on your left & the ground floor rooms round. Around the corner you will find the breakfast room & the pretty tranquil Venetian garden. THE RECEPTION The hotel has a large reception, which usually has about 3 receptionists working. Most of them speak very good English & can help with any questions or queries. THE BEDROOMS Altogether the hotel has 66 rooms spread over 2 floors. On the ground floor there are a selection of twin rooms & 4 single rooms. The first floor is where all the family rooms & suites are so if anyone had walking difficulties or liked to be on the ground floor that would be no problem. Due to this the hotel doesn't have a lift, which really doesn't matter. All the rooms are sort of inter connecting I am not sure why but it is good for families with children that are possibly too young to be on their own. If people are not travelling together & are in a connecting room this is not a problem though if that's what your thinking. The connect by both having a key to the one front door & once your in there is 2 separate doors one to each room. Quite weird but as I said good if you're a family or even friends. All the rooms are looking out on to the Venetian garden & are double-glazed so they are pretty sound proof as it isn't really a noisy area anyway. The rooms all have air conditioning, mini bar, direct dial telephone, safe & television. The television I also able to connect to the internet so you can check your emails for a small charge I am not sure how much as I didn't bother & I don't think many people do but it was nice to have access just in case. The TV also had the usual English pay per view movies. You cant get away from paying for your movies or surfing the because the TV is monitored & the reception send you a nice bill the following day. You need to pay in Euros. Out of the 66 rooms 54 of them have baths in which is good as in most hotels you have to put up with a grotty make shift shower. The bathrooms are big & airy the floor is marble & there is a large mirror in there to make it look like the bathroom is really big. The bathrooms have complimentary soap, shampoo, and conditioner & shower cap. All the rooms have 2 large windows & are decorated with dark blue & orange bed covers & matching curtains with neutral coloured carpets. The ceilings all have wooden beams on to give the old yet modern feel. They certainly have the wow factor. The family rooms are either 3 or 4 bedded & have like a split level room they are very trendy & attractive with either a twin or a double bed on the first floor & then there is a mezzanine level with a further double or single bed. They are not tiny by all means they are probably just a big bigger than the average sized twin. THE BREAKFAST ROOM There is a large breakfast room on the ground level, which serves a continental cold breakfast buffet style from 07:30am - 10:00am, which is quite traditional for Italian hotels. The usual choices are cereal, fruit, ham & bread, toast & croissants & yoghurt. All guests have the option of eating in the breakfast room or in the gorgeous Venetian garden as long as it isn't raining! The breakfast room has plenty of tables & you can sit on a 2 table or a 4 table but I am sure if you wanted a bigger table the waiter would arrange that for you. As this hotel only offers a bed & breakfast stay you can either eat out at night or you can go to the breakfast room in which you will find has been transformed into an up market gourmet restaurant. You can expect to buy a meal in her for about \u00c2\u00a330 for 2. I personally didn't eat here but it all looked very nice & they served typical Italian dishes pasta or lasagne then meat or fish & then a nice dessert it was different most night though. The breakfast room is very trendy & has nice comfy modern furniture, it doesn't have many windows but there are lots of lights so it is nice & bright. There I a large door at the back of the restaurant which leads out on to the decking in the garden where there are several table & chairs so people can dine outside. THE BAR The bar is close to the reception & breakfast room it is very modern & is situated in a large alcove. The bar is well equipped for any occasion & there are 6 wooden stools at the bar it is quite long sop there are usually 2 bar tenders. The seating area is an adequate size there are about 8 tables with 4 chairs around each of them. On each table there is a small piece of modern art which is very eye catching on one there is shapes out of pencils another there is a bunch of shells & another was a structure of straws. You can order drinks at the bar or with the waiter As guests mainly stay at this hotel on a Bed & breakfast basis the bar also serves light snacks at lunchtimes. The bar closes at midnight. THE GARDEN This Venetian style garden really is the hotels selling point. It is situated in the middle of the square shaped hotel. It is quite narrow but very long & is a real suntrap. There are a few small seat areas with tables & about 4 benches down each side. The garden is very tranquil & extremely peaceful. It is the perfect place for reading or just a nice place to sit & relax. The one thing I loved about the garden was that it smelt gorgeous it was full of all different herbs & spices & pretty flowers & shrubs. THE D\u00c3\u2030COR The d\u00c3\u00a9cor at this hotel really sets it aside from all the other hotels in Venice it is amazing. Everywhere you look there is a magnificent work of art either in the form of a weird & wacky sculpture or a huge brightly coloured painting. The hotel has a modern sophisticated feel throughout. There are also lots of plants dotted around the place & everything just looks like a complete work of art. The restaurant & bar area all have ceilings made of wooden beams & some of the walls are exposed brick, which makes the whole building stylish & very modern. GETTING AROUND The hotel Residenza Cannaregio has its only private access to the Gondolas, water taxis & water bus on St Alvise canal just a couple of feet away from the hotel entrance. This is good as you can take a water taxi from the airport for about \u00c2\u00a360, which isn't bad, & I really think it's the only way you should go in & out of Venice. The Residenza Cannnaregio is actually in the Ghetto part of Italy & is a bit of a walk from the centre. It takes about 20 mins on foot to get to the Rialto Bridge & St Marks Square. PRICES To stay here on a bed & breakfast basis per night in a twin room you are looking at about \u00c2\u00a360 in the low season & \u00c2\u00a3200 in the high season & about \u00c2\u00a355 in the low season for a single room & \u00c2\u00a3175 in the high season. OVERALL COMMENTS I think this has got to be one of the best hotels in Venice where it lacks in location it certainly makes up for in comfort & modern surroundings. The staff are all friendly very smiley & the rooms are all spotless.

We had to pick up two friends at the train station, so we headed towards the SMN station. One the way there, the streets are lined with local restaurants, pizzerias, grocery stores, souvenier shops. We checked out the menu prices and knew we could afford to eat here for sure. The weather was awful, rainy and cold. We saw a consignment store and bought sweaters for 5 Euros. We had the best time in Cannaregio, bad weather and all. As for visiting the rest of Venice, we bought 2-day passes and visited San Marco and Burano on the Vaporettos. I would stay here again.

The hotel itself is not a luxurious one but it was clean, comfortable and well maintained. The service was generally very good with helpful (english speaking!) staff at the reception desk.

Regarding the cost of the waterboat, it is best to buy a three day pass, because at six euro fifty per single trip it can be expensive, whereas with the three day pass you can hop off and on as often as you like. The water taxis are only for people with money to burn. The disappointing part about our five day stay was that the bar and restaurant were closed, and still were when we left. The only explanation the hotel would give was that they were closed due to technical reasons. The hotel has a lovely little garden area and it would have been nice for my wife and I to enjoy a drink there. We were also disappointed that we were unable to sample the restaurant. I know that when people book a hotel they also take into consideration the facilities on offer at the hotel, and in this department the hotel was a disappointment.

The breakfast was OK, nothing amazing but good. Maybe the only thing to avoid would be the free trip to Murano. It's a clear tourist trap. They don't take you to the center of the city or a popular port, they take you directly to a Murano glass factory where you can see how the glass is made (nothing that can't be seen in any other factory you step into) and after that they expect you to visit their exhibition room and of course buy something when you haven't even seen any other options in the island. When we noticed this and mentioned we were not interested and would like to go to the island we got a bad attitude from the employees of the factory and were pointed to a back door that led to an empty alley with no direction of where to go in order to get to town. Haha no biggie just a touch of bad taste from the hotel to include this as a 'free' ride to Murano. The area (Cannaregio) is a bit away from the crowded streets and the tourists. At first, the buildings in this area can seem quite worn down however what isn't worn down in Venice. The local feel of the area is definitely a plus. There are nice restaurants in the streets of Cannaregio, they proved to be a good option for dinning in a modest environment but with beautiful views. The quality and reasonable prices of these establishments can be confirmed by the presence of locals. The walk to the Plaza de San Marcos takes about 20-30 minutes, consider 40 to the Accademia and the Guggenheim Collection. Therefore, the location of the hotel proves to be just right in order to keep away from all the chaos and explore this amazing city while walking to the main attractions. If by any chance you get lost on the way, remember that sometimes one of the best things to do in Venice is to just wander the streets aimlessly and see what beautiful sight the city decides to show you.

The bar is tiny but comfortable and is very modern looking. The desk front desk staff were very friendly and will help you book walking tours or whatever you like. HINT: If you are going to Murano to shop for glass, the hotel will arrange a complementary taxi as long as you agree to a glassmaking 'tour' there which lasts about 5 minutes before you enter the shop to begin the haggling process. They have some beautiful pieces and prices range from 40 Eur for a small piece to thousands of Euros. The higher the price the more leeway there is. I suggest looking in the gift shops by St Mark square, they have a lot of the same pieces from Murano and you will get an idea of prices. To haggle, shrug and look indecisive, they will ask you how much you want to pay, say you don't want to insult them, eventually the clerk will hand you a calculator and ask you to type in a price.

At first glance, the Hotel would seem to be out of the way, tucked up in one of the corners ( so to speak ) of Venice - but we find this aspect appealing. It means that we commute past all manner of sights and scenery - if we stayed around St Marks, it is doubtful if we would make the effort to go out to the far flung corners of Venice. Better to stay outside and travel in. The rooms are great - having said that, we stayed in a standard double overlooking the courtyard and everything was OK till the last night, when a family moved into the room above. The problem being that the rooms on the second floor are the Suites ( which overlook the canal) and Junior Suites ( which overlook the courtyard ) - these rooms have a mezzanine floor with metal stairs leading up to it, which reverberate when people run up and down them. Children being children, they could not resist doing this several times an hour - thankfully, it stopped about 10.30pm.

Therefore my assessment is based on comparison on other hotels in other cities and countries. This hotel has certain characteristics that might be interesting to know. On the positive side, one can mention that the hotel is very clean and the staff very helpful. We had no problem with any issue that could be solved. There were however some details, that new guests should be aware of: I called the hotel beforehand and asked about directions. Coming by Ryanair and landing in Treviso, I was advised to take the bus shuttle to Venice and afterwards take the water bus (vaporetto) line 52. We did this but when we arrived at the station called Saint Alvise, it proved not very easy to find the hotel. I have taken a picture of the map that demonstrates the address to the hotel with the bus stop marked with an arrow. It is actually very easy to find the hotel. Leaving the station and moving straight away form the stop there are two bridges. The hotel is close to the bridge on the right. I am writing this because the hotel area was rather deserted at night and it could be very difficult to find the hotel if we had not somebody to guide us. It could be frustrating since the streets are dark and name of the streets seem to be hidden and incomprehensible. The sign to the hotel is also very small and not at all lit. I met some other tourist having the same problem with other hotels, so maybe it is not unique problem for this hotel. The fact that the hotel is a little bit off tourist track can be both a blessing and also problematic. When you want to come back to the hotel during the day, it would be rather difficult to go back outside again if you are very tired. It is only 5-7 minutes back to the tourist track and not much longer. We got the room with the garden view, but as you can see in the picture here, we did not have any real garden to look at. I have taken photos of the canal that faced some rooms and I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it is worth paying any extra money for the small canal of water. The water pressure in the shower was very low. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if this is normal for Venice, but compared to other cities it was really low pressure. The hotel has a very nice breakfast with a couple of warm dishes such as eggs and bacon. Rather good choice of fruits for December. If was satisfactory. As said before, the hotel is very clean. The restaurant was also good, especially if one doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go out. The food is really served slowly and sometimes they might make mistakes and overcharge. The price was good compared to outside places with extremely high prices seen in Venice. I would really recommend mixed grill fish. The TV in the room was very small and situated very high.

Sure there are 5* hotels overlooking the Grand Canel but if your budget doesn't quite stretch to over \u00c2\u00a3500 a night then go for the Cannaregio. It's in a quiet location but easily walkable to all sites. Anyone who's experienced Venice during the summer season or on holiday weekends (and the tens of thousands of fellow tourists clogging the narrow streets and squares), returning to the calm of the Cannaregio is a real delight. Other benefits are that it's a reasonably short vaparetto ride from the airport. If you want to spend 100+ euros on a one-way water taxi then fine but it never ceases to amaze me that people are happy to pay these exhorbitant and over-the-top charges. Having paid just 24 euros for a more than enjoyable return vaparetto trip to the Marco Polo airport, the thought of getting to and from airports like Heathrow, JFK, Narita etc in the future just fills me with horror. Cannaregio staff are very friendly and helpful. Although the bedrooms (including deluxe ones) are certainly more than adequate they're not quite luxurious and whilst the breakfast, for some, may be a little disappointing, this is really just nitpicking. The hotel is spotless and I couldn't find a fault with it.

St. Mark's square was impressive, but the gondolas for 100 Euros in the cold wind and choppy water didn't look as \"romantic\" and special as we had imagined, so we passed and took the water bus home. It was a long journey, probably 45+ minutes back to San Alvise stop, then we had a nice dessert in the hotel restaurant and packed up for the departure the next day. The breakfast was very good, buffett style with toast, eggs, juice, bacon, pastries, fruit - it was just wonderful. The hotel called a water taxi, 100 Euros for 4 people, to take us to the Venice Airport which took at least 30 minutes. It was expensive, but we had planned to do this since we had 7 large bags plus 3-4 small ones. It was just way too much for the water bus (they are not very friendly here). Overall, the hotel was a good value but if I was staying in Venice longer than one day I would want a hotel closer to something - anything. The drawbacks: Hotel is not conveinent to almost anything and there are no restaurants except the hotel's anywhere close. No shopping or anything in this area. The rooms and hotel staff are great, but the restaurant staff is not friendly or helpful in the least.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGREAT!

It was still noisy when we left, 5 days later, on the 11th October. For that reason I would suggest that you avoid room 227. Our friends room was somewhat larger with AC which was both quiet and effective. Luck of the draw. Everything else about the Hotel was first class, including very friendly staff.

Getting to the hotel was easy and would recommend anyone getting the Alilaguna from Marco Polo Airport to change at Murano Colonna and get the No. 41 Vaporetto to St Alvise ,this means that you do not have to carry any luggage over the bridge at Fundemento Nove. The dock at Murano for the No. 41 is next to the arrival dock for the Alilaguna. The same applies for the return journey, except you get the No. 42 to Murano Colonna from St Alvise, and the dock is the same. On arrival at St Alvise disembark and turn left & walk a few steps and then turn right (you have no option) continue straight until you come out into a square (Campo St Alvise) where the church is. At the canal turn right (do not cross the canal) and walk to the last bridge, turn left and cross the bridge. The hotel is the first building on your left with the green awning.

The room was on two floors, with wooden beams, a spacious bathroom, comfortable bed and a nice view of the internal courtyard. The air con was effective and easy to control. We didn't use the mini bar much but we did store some of the water we bought from the nearby supermarket there! The bar was a bit on the expensive side, but the service was good. We didn't try the hotel restaurant as it seemed pricer than the nearby restaurants. The breakfast was pretty good, scrambled egg, bacon , toast and boiled egg were the hot choices. There was also good selection of ham, cheese, pastries, fruit , cereal and yoghurt. Coffee was loveley and if you ask them nicely they will do you an excellent cappucino. The only down side was the orange juice was a bit watered down. It's about a 10 minute walk to the water bus stop to get to San Marco. Get the 82 and it takes about 30 minutes. It takes about the same time to walk directly to San Marco. Rialto bridge is about 20-25 minutes away on foot. I would recommend going to Venice in May or Sept. June, July and August are very busy. We went in July and whist it wasn't so bad mid week, the crowds got a bit crazy at the weekend. Would I book the Cannaregio again? Definately off peak, but not at peak time, we found it just a little too far away from the action, whist it was a novelty to be in a quiet area at first, towards the end of the holiday it was beginning to become a chore. In the Cannerigo area make sure you go to the Iguana Bar (particulary on Thursday nights when they have live music) and the Mola Tratorria nearby (great fish). Don' t make the mistake of eating at the restaurant next to the Iguana bar (Diana) this was the worst meal of the holiday.

There was more than adequate wardrobe space so we could keep our belongings organized. The one minor issue we encountered was the lack of light in our room. There was limited lighting which made certain ares of the room e.g. Wardrobe and mirror locations slightly too dark, but this is a small price for such a stunning hotel. We were somewhat suspicious of what the bathroom would be like as there weren't any photos on the hotel website or trip advisor- but we were pleasantly surprised! Although not perhaps not in keeping with the d\u00c3\u00a9cor throughout the rest of the hotel, it was pleasant enough with nice touches such as a heated towel rail and speakers from the TV broadcasting live into the bathroom! The complimentary toiletries were rather special (see photos). The bathroom was cleaned to a very high standard every day. We were very impressed. The reception staff were really helpful and very accommodating by continuously supplying us with maps and looking after our luggage on the day we checked out. The hotel bar had a huge range of liquors and wines. Stick with the wine - liquors and mixers work out rather expensive. The buffet breakfast was very well presented and the waiting staff were very friendly and helpful. Location wise, we thought it was perfect once we figured out the quickest route, it took approx 15-20 minutes to walk to Rialto. We preferred this as it meant we got to explore and see so much more than having the main sights on your doorstep. If you Don't like to walk too far, this probably isn't the hotel for you although the vaporetto stop at S.Alvise is very close to the hotel, walking is the best way to explore Venice and is much quicker than waiting and travelling by the water bus.

They were expecting a large party of people and seemed eager to get rid of us, the food was very average and seemed overly priced. Suffice it to say, we only ate there once so hopefully this was just a one-off bad night. But if I went again, I would stick to the nicer and cheaper restaurants nearby.

It was fun to observe people going about their daily lives and hearing all the sounds that came from their open windows. We loved walking back from dinner at night, enjoying the locals who were happily drinking and dining outside along the canal. At no time did we feel unsafe. It was a bit of a hike to San Marco and we frequently got lost in the maze of tiny, winding streets, but Venice is so beautiful that we never minded the detours. The hotel is a nice stroll away from Vini da Gigio, a delicious trattoria (make a reservation!), and just across the canal from Vini is Al Fontego dei Pescatori, where we had one of our most memorable dining experiences in Italy and the best waiter ever.

We booked Residenza Cannaregio after reading the terrific reviews on Tripadvisor, however the hotel did not live up to our expectations. We arrived by water taxi (70 euro from Piazzale Roma, however it was only 50 euro for the return journey, so be prepared to negotiate!) and knocked on the canal entrance which seemed to be locked and deserted. Once we had checked in, we asked for an iron, to iron a shirt for that evening. Apparently they don't have any irons due to safety restrictions, but they do have a laundry. Unfortunately they do not do any laundry after Friday mornings for the whole weekend, and we checked in on a Friday afternoon, and were checking out on Monday. This meant no ironed clothes for our entire Venice weekend. After some (strong) words with the reception staff, twice, they finally agreed to help us and sent the porter to a 5-star hotel to iron 1 shirt for us. The most disappointing thing was the attitude and response from the staff member - he told us that 'We are not a 5-star hotel' and that we should not expect anything more. Given that we were paying approx. AUS$350 and that the hotel is a 4-star we were appalled. Furthermore, as I was walking out of reception the staff member started talking about us to another staff member, and only stopped when I walked back in there and complained. Our room was 101, the first room from reception and the one that people pass to get out to the courtyard and restaurant. Just outside our window, on the path, there is a man-hole cover (painted to look like cobblestones) that every person steps on along the corrider, resulting in a loud, hollow echo. This became extremely tiresome over the course of the 3 days we stayed there. Additionally, there was a family with a screaming baby staying in a room above us and the old, beamed ceiling did nothing to muffle the noise. Finally, the hotel is located about 20 minutes' walk from the train station, and at least 30 minutes from Rialto. It is a quiet, typical Venetian suburb, which was nice, depending on how much you want to be in the thick of the action. We didn't mind this, however others may prefer to be closer to everything.

For all future guests I suggest you go to the hotel website at [--], the site is in English and it has a zoomable map!. Also you could try booking the hotel via [--] , They send you a copy of the hotels own map of Venice with the location marked. Getting from the airport: I would ditch the water taxis(nice but too expensive) and do 2 things. 1) get a 24hr or 72hr ACTV pass from the booth in the arrivals hall which allows you onto all the buses/vaparettos etc, they cost 12 euros or 25 euros. 2) get the yellow bus no 5, which is included in the pass (but only costs 1 euro ) and takes 30 minutes to Pl de Roma , or the Blue bus which is not included in the pass and takes 20 minutes for 3 euros. At Pl de Roma you need to go to the canal and get on boat no 42 or 52 which will take 10 minutes to reach the S. Alvise stop. From there it is an easy 2 minute walk to the hotel. So with luck within 60-90 minutes of getting into the arrivals hall you could be in the hotel. Stay with me and I will give you the best walking route from the hotel to the Grand Canal. The hotel is an excellent place to stay, however if you want grand old style venetian hotels go elsewhere (try the Principe, 2 minutes from the train station) The Cannaregio is an ultra modern hotel , bright, exposed brick work, high celings in the rooms, spotlessly clean, with automated lighting in corridors that comes on when movement is detected, the doors have no traditional slots or keyholes, you place your plastic key card flat against the sensor panel to the left of the door and this opens the door. Air conditioning is ultra efficient. Rooms have open wardrobe areas (no doors and no drawers) and are decorated in shades of brown (see picture) witrh recessed lighting, they are quite big, even the single rooms and the bathrooms are well equipped and roomy. The mini bar is not too extortionate, (2 euros for water which costs 1/1.50 euros in the shops, and if I recall about 5 euros for a beer - similar to restaurant prices) Reception staff are friendly and businesslike (black suits and ties, even at 5am!) The breakfast is first class, good quality properly cooked scrambled eggs and bacon and anything else you could wish for, the courtyard area is great if you like eating outside but the interior is fine. The waiting staff were all friendly. The Hotel is in t a residential area of Venice. This means no crowds, and the restaurants are populated by locals and prices are more reasonable. The hotel restaurant is supposed to be very good but not terribly cheap. I found that the easiest way of getting around was to walk the 15 minutes to the train station, which is right on the canal and get a waterbus from there down to St Marks or wherever, the walk is pleasant enough or you could get waterbus no 41 or 51 from S Alvise. Walking from the Hotel to St Marks I made a few wrong turns even with a good map and reckon it will take 30 minutes or so. If you have got an ACTV card take a waterbus. The best way to the train station is also the way past all the local restaurants. go out the hotel door and turn left. At the end, when you reach the canal turn left, and then immediately right over the first bridge (a wooden one) continue down the alley and when you reach the next canal turn left, as you walk down here you will pass a number of bars and restaurants. Cheap and cheerful is Antica Mola 2800 Fondamenta Ormensini, for a more varied menu try Lafondamenta further down the street at 2578 Fondamenta Della Misericordia . However back to the train station, having turned into the street you need to go over the third bridge (a wooden one) at the time of writing there was some repair work going on and the bridge can be identified by orange netting. Cross the bridge and keep right then immediately left into a wide street past the huge pizza restaurant on your left (Vesuvio I think) which joins up with the main street further down. At this junction you can either go straight across following the signs to the S. Marcuola vaporetto stop or turn right over the Guglie bridge and follow the street to the train station. NB if you go left at the junction by Vesuvio, after about 5 minutes you come to a big supermarket (Billa) good for stocking up on things you might need. If you come to Venice in the high season you will be pleased to get back to the tranquility of the Cannaregio, if you come in September / October the city is less busy and a hotel nearer the action might be a better choice.

If you want to see Venice then the best thing to do is take a lesiurely walk and return on the water bus at the end of the day. If you want to eat good food in Venice, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend either a good guide book or ask at the hotel. The general rule of thumb, which pretty much applies to any destination in the world is the food and the value for money improve the further you are away from the main tourist spots. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll notice that something simple like penne arribiatta will cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5-6 near the hotel but nearer \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9-10 around St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The best meal we had during our 4-day stay was at La Colombina which is only 10-minutes from the hotel. We had another good meal at Antica Mola (a local family-run trattoria) which is closer still. If you choose to eat nearby the hotel you will find that the restaurants can be less glamorous but the food is better. Naturally being in a lagoon, the menu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are full of fish and on the whole it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very good. Worst meal of the holiday was on a visit to the nearby island of Lido when we opted for some simple pasta but it reminded me more of the botched attempts of student food from years ago at university. Another thing to be prepared for is that quite a few of the waiters seem to carry a chip on their shoulder so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect outstanding and polite service as you might receive in other destinations. I have no hesitation recommending this hotel. Location was great, it allowed me to see parts of Venice that I would most probably have missed and I would definitely go back there. It helped to make our holiday a very special one.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg", "Title": "\u201cExcellent recommendation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5448534", "Content": "My two daughters and I visited Venice from South Africa in June 2006 and were influenced by your travellers' reviews to choose Residenza Cannaregio as our hotel in Venice, we were not disappointed at all.

We didnt find it hard to find at all, a little bit of research, and the entire journey from the airport to the hotel took us little over an hour, and cost us 15 Euros each. If anybody would like directions, please email me and I will happy to help. The rooms were very clean, and were different to any other hotel that we have stayed in. Breakfast was tasty, and varied. I wouldn't recommend that you dont eat here for dinner, there are some lovely restaurants in Venice, especially locally, you will find the quaint, more quiet eateries, that dont cost the earth. We also found a fantastic bar, very close to the hotel, live jazz, and a glass of wine for 1 Euro!! A little different to bars in the San Marco vicinity!
