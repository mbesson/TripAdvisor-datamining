The price and outstanding reviews seemed too good to be true, but I ignored my gut feeling and booked anyway. BIG MISTAKE! The lock on the door knob was very loose. Not an issue when the dead bolt is locked, but I wouldn't leave anything at all in the room, as any key could open the door with enough effort. The room was fairly clean, but corners are definitely cut here. Theres a handsoap dispenser in the shower... I have no nice things to say.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSo much to offer with an amazing value\u201d", "Author": "longjohns21", "ReviewID": "UR118993063", "Content": "We had a king the room was huge and clean.

The staff is very friendly, the rooms are clean, there's plenty of parking, and we had two pools to choose from. One pool has a slide and a shallow pool for my kids to play in, while the other pool was very large and a bit more relaxed for adults (though I didn't get to use this one very much). I will definitely recommend this place to all of my friends and family.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Decatur, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding accomadations and staff\u201d", "Author": "maverick716", "ReviewID": "UR71686428", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for our 50th wedding anniversary and found it to be an Ideal choice.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cGREAT DEAL FOR THE MONEY\u201d", "Author": "sandi83", "ReviewID": "UR47421170", "Content": "I was a little skeptical, not seeing many reviews on the Windsor/Greenbrier Inn. We were pleasantly surprised. Great location to yellow route and attraction. We stay in rm 433, Nice size 4 queen beds 2 bathrooms. However, bring your body soap and shampoo they don't offer. The continental breakfast was a little lacking. They should add bagels and cream cheese and fruit. Other than that nice place.

Not knowing what was going on we did not turn on a light but my daughter did pull back the curtain to look out, there stood several people, she backed up and still there was a disruption outside our door. Needless to say we did not sleep the rest of the night. The next moring I went to the office and asked for a refund or another room-one of the workers was standing there and he told the lady on duty that he was aware that our room had indeed been double booked, they finally gave us another room.
