When we arrived at the hotel, we were a bit annoyed because they had taken away our room (through Shell Vacations) and moved us into the actual hotel. Same rooms and the same price, but they gave us a city view instead of a partial-ocean view, which we had requested and paid for. But it was fine. We got free breakfast everyday instead (which in my opinion was better). It was a very nice room. Quite clean, though I did see some dusty areas around the doors on the T.V armoire. We loved the balcony and even the city view. I don't regret the city view at all. There was construction going on outside, but it posed absolutely no problem. We didn't make much use of the kitchen, but were able to keep the ice frozen and our leftover cold. We didn't rent a car and didn't make use of the valet parking either. My Navy brother chauffeured us around, but when he had to park, he went to the parking lot behind the hotel. Be sure to feed the meter though. He had to run upstairs to get some change from my mom and when he came back down, he had a ticket. Overall, we loved the hotel. The downstairs and outside are a bit outdated and kind of ghost-town-ish, but it's a very nice hotel and rather quiet. We really loved the hotel. And we got a great price. There was an issue with the fire alarm going off in the middle of the night about 5 times, but they came over the speaker and told us it was a false alarm due to the construction next door. The construction was not going on at the time, so I'm not sure what triggered it, but it was very, very annoying and woke us all up.

I was very impressed with the fact that we booked this hotel room via a timeshare co website (Shell) and they did not give us any type of sales talk or presentation. The only 2 minor set backs are that it was difficult and confusing to find (it is located inside the Ilikai Hotel and there is another hotel across the street called Waikiki Marina) and that it is a bit far from the main Waikiki strip with all the happenings, restaurants, shops, etc. (accessible by a 10 min bus ride - cost $2pp plus transfer within 2 hrs.).

We were a little concerned about some of the reviews on TripAdvisor but the kitchen and location really sold us. We were happily surprised (and relieved) once we arrived.We spent a week in late Sept, with two children, 4 and 9 in Honolulu and we had a rental car the entire time. The building is somewhat dated but the entrance and all the interior areas are clean and elegant. The back of the hotel has a great veranda to hang out and look over the marina and the ocean.We went to the second floor to check in. The Marina Resort is part of the Ilikai Hotel. The building is part hotel, part privately owned condos and part time-share. The first floor has the desk and concierge for the Ilikai Hotel and the Marina Resort desk is on the second floor. We read about issues with the elevators but we did not experience any long waits or anything negative about the elevators. They do have additional bathing suit elevators on the backside of the main elevator lobby. These were great coming in from the beach and the pool. Each floor also had 2 washers and 2 dryers which really helped with the kids clothes (plus we went home with our packed clothes washed!)The RoomWe had two Double Beds and a sleeper sofa. All were very comfortable. It was almost like a suite. The kids had more than enough room to spread out. There was also a desk, nightstand, small table, four chairs, and an entertainment center that provided drawer space and some storage. The kitchen was a full kitchen, not a kitchenette (four burner stove with oven, refrigerator, microwave oven, large sink, cupboards, toaster, coffeemaker). It was fully stocked with pots, pans, mixing bowls, cooking utensils, plates, cups, glasses, and silverware. We went to the grocery store to stock up on breakfast foods, cold cuts, and snacks. It was a lot of fun cooking breakfast in the room while the kids slept in and then got ready for the beach. My wife even made cookies! The hotel provided daily towels, emptied trash and made the beds, in addition to daily soap/shampoo/lotion bottles.The room was clean and comfortable, albeit the furniture a was a little dated. We had a TV with cable and there is Internet access in the hotel room for an additional fee. I was able to get some free wi-fi in the lobby and the veranda but it was hit and miss. The shower was larger than nornal, but was standup only, no tub. The bathroom itself was large as well with a full length mirror on the door. The kitchen also had a bar counter and the kids enjoyed eating breakfast and snacks on the bar stools. The balcony was adequate with two chairs, a small round table and a lounge chair, although this is where you could really tell the age of the hotel. We made sure to ask for a room that did not face the construction at the Marriott Hotel. We had no issues with noise at all. The pool is small but the kids liked it since it was never really busy. This was one of the weaker areas of the hotel. We went to the lagoon between the hotel and the beach but the water was cooler than the ocean and the sand very hard. You could tell it was man-made with concrete right below the sand's surface. Waikiki Beach is only a 4-5 minute walk from the backside of the hotel. We were able to find some parking on the backside of the hotel but we had to pay for valet when we couldn't find any. On the the downside, valet was $25 per day. We did however, get a voucher to be used when we arrived and when we departed for bellman service.Overall, we were pleased with our stay. The staff was always prompt and courteous in responding to our requests. Beware: the little convenience store on the first floor was quite expensive so be sure to make a trip to the grocery store or Wal-Mart , which is just a 5 minute drive away....or even the ABC store at the corner across from McDonalds.", "Date": "Oct 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR764547935", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Longhorns_08"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel, Great Room, Great Staff This hotel is a bargain.

I am glad I didn't. The hotel was fine. We had read other reviews so knew where the check in desk was so that was not a problem and we didn't rent a car so didn't have a parking problem. There is a bus stop directly in front of the hotel so unless this is your first trip and you want to drive around the island why get a rental car? Per this website we knew there was construction going on so asked for a room in a wing farther away but even from the outside the noise was not bad. Others on the website complained about traffic noise. We had a room facing the street on the third floor but with the balcony door closed never heard it. If you are looking to hang out on your balcony this is not the hotel for you assuming you get a streetside room.There are some older I assume condo owners on the property reflected by the poolside lift for handicapped people so we avoided the pool. If a cool pool scene is what you're looking for than this is not the hotel for you. We went to the lagoon that is right next door. Except for a rooftop restaurant there are no on property restaurants or coffee shops but a one block walk will take you to the same coffee shop that travelers staying at the HHV eat at when they are fleeing the high priced breakfasts there. So again if the pool scenes is not important to you this is a decent place to stay and save money.

Stayed a weekend at this property, which as others have stated, is a 'hotel-within-a-hotel.' A little concerned due to the reviews, but the full kitchen, walking distance to the park and the major mall swayed us in the end. And we didn't regret our choice! Luckily we had been informed when booking that the front desk was located on the second floor, so we bypassed the Ilikai Hotel desk in the lobby and went straight upstairs using what looked like a fire exit stairwell as some of the elevators were not working. Heck, we started using the staff elevators since a small sign by the main elevators said where it was. It was quick, and we were on the 18th floor! The front desk staff were pleasant and helpful, and pointed out a Ilikai bell staff tip form that Shell pays for. We were the only ones checking in, and my husband and son got a drink from the water cooler and lounged on the sofa while I signed in. The room was clean, comfortable and had the air-conditioning on. Bliss! We had stated in our reservation that we decline the maid service for our two-night stay, so we did not see them but we did find extra towels in the bathroom. We didn't go to the pool, or go out on the balcony, but with a city view room we kept the lanai door closed and did not have a problem with outdoor noise. I was surprised to find a 'Room Service in Paradise' menu in the room, a local company that delivers meals from various restaurants around town to your door. It was interesting to read the menus of all those restaurants and know you could order whatever they had. Imagine a room service menu with more than three kinds of cuisine!  My family enjoyed our stay, especially for the full kitchen with microwave! My DS is four years old, so although there was no bathtub, only a shower, he was okay (I loved the wide shower head) and it was a blessing to be able to buy some popsicles and juice for him and keep it in the room. A blender and coffeemaker also included, we thought about making frappes or smoothies (next time, if we stay longer!) We even bought popsicles for treats when back in the room.  Check-out was easy, a video checkout service. I did see on our paperwork that it should be at a pre-arranged time, but 20 minutes before check-out time a quick call to the front desk to say that I didn't pre-arrange the time and need to leave in 20 minutes. I was told there was no additional charges by the staff member and I was simply asked to leave the keys in the room. Stayed at other SVC properties in addition to Hiltons, Hyatts, Sheratons and other chains.

I do say slowly due to tired exterior of the hotel and our experience during check in. When we checked in (on the second floor) our room wasn't quite ready yet. I should mention that we were about an hour and a half ahead of official check in time. To fill in the time the hotel concierge introduced himself, saying he could help us save money during our stay. Though, his help seemed more like a pitch for a timeshare. The Ilikai security was more helpful with information about getting around.After about 30 minutes or so, we got our keys and were off to the slow elevators. By incorporating some previous advice found on TA into our elevator calling strategy the maximum time we waited for an elevator was 5 minutes. One person would go around the corner and call the lone bather's elevator, while the other would call the main elevators then wait and we'd jump on the first available car. We figured this imposed only a small negative externality on the other guests.Our room was on the 13th floor and had a city view. The room was clean and bright, I think it had granite floors and counters in the kitchen and bathroom. The upholstery and linen pattern seemed a bit out of style but looked clean. The kitchen was fully stocked with the necessary things to make a meal, though, nothing to clean the dishes. (We later found that the maid would do our dishes sometime in the afternoon along with the usual daily upkeep).The hotel location was about an eight minute walk from the Ala Moana Center which had two supermarkets for groceries, plus a number of restaurants. The hotel was also a five minute walk to the Hilton Lagoon which seemed connected to the tip of Waikiki Beach. To get to the more touristy and crowded Waikiki Beach Park (which offered board and snorkel rentals) was about a 10 - 15 min bus ride. Though we did prefer the beaches in Kailua, but that is another review.We did not have any issues with the noise from the construction at the Hilton next door. I should note that did have another wing of the Ilikai as a noise buffer.The only thing that woke us up in the morning was the sun rising over the city. The east facing room was luckily situated over a bend in the road below, so the sunrise was not blocked by any of the surrounding hotels. A couple demerits in addition to the concierge: The AC controls didn't seem to work, so the only way to shut off the blasting AC was to open the sliding doors leading to the lanai. Also the maid service seemed a bit wasteful in replacing even the unused towels rather than using the floor policy found in other hotels.I should also note, that during our stay one afternoon some of the (Ilikai) workers and permanent residents protested in front of the building. It had something to do with the new ownership, though didn't get much of the details.I'd consider staying here again, but if all else equal, I'd preferably stay at a newer hotel.", "Date": "Apr 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR130251958", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Choco_Pies"}, {"Content": "Rip Off Many, many problems.

There was a good kitchen, a good bed, a couch, an armchair/ottoman, and a pleasant bathroom. The hotel is next to the beach adjoining the Hilton Hawaian Village, which is a very nice beach. The rest: This property is in some sort of transition - two out of three of the restaurants were closed, and one had been completely removed. The nicer swimming pool (the one shown in some of the internet photos I saw) is boarded up with a Do Not Trespass sign. At any given time, only a few of the available elevators actually are working. This results in long delays for even small movements, with the opening of an elevator door preceding a crush of people. While you meet people as you stand there waiting for an elevator, many of them are irritated by the wait, and not feeling friendly.There seems to be a lot of tension in this place. Some of the residents are condo owners, some are tourists. I don't know what has lead to the closures of the restaurants and the pool. It does not create a festive atmosphere.Many of the facilities in the hotel are only semi-functional. You want change for the laundry soap machine - you (wait), take an elevator to the change machine promised on the 12th floor, only to see a sign on it that it's broken. Back to the elevator, wait, down to the ground floor, get change, back to the elevator, wait, back to the laundry room, put change in the soap machine, and get no soap, etc. This became very irritating as the days passed.We had a city view room. I would recommend getting a different view, unless you like a lot of traffic noise, and a lot of big city out your window.Overall, we had a good time - the hotel is in Hawaii, after all, but I would not consider staying here again. They call it renovation, but it looks like decline to me.", "Date": "Feb 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR294941204", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "RoverUSA"}, {"Content": "Disappointing As SVC members we expected a modern, well-maintained property with 4-star amenities like those we encountered on the Big Island and Kauai.

Hot water for showers is in short supply in the early morning. Staff at the Ilikai hotel that shares the building were unfriendly to SVC and other time-share clients. Noise from heavy construction equipment next door permeates the daylight hours 6 days a week.

Stayed here for pre-cruise: Oct 31 for 3days. Booked the rm thru Hotwire. Check in had been moved to the 2nd floor, it was super fast  friendly! We were given a free upgrade on the 8th floor with a great ocean view overlooking the lagoon next door at the Village. We were absolutely delighted  in heaven with our stay here. The room was over 500 sq ft. with one wall of windows, so lots of natural light. It was clean as a whistle, had a super comfortable king bed, sofa bed couch, chair with ottoman, lots of great lighting, kitchen with basics, large bathrm, (no tub) but huge shower stall, desk  TV armoire. The ocean view lania was huge and private. We enjoyed our coffee out there in the a.m. and the last moments of the day there. The BUS  other shuttles stopped in front. We could walk to several restaurants right near by..as was an ABC, car rental etc. There was construction going on, but this was one of the most soundproof places we have ever stayed. Its also had A/C, which was not loud like a jet engine in your room. We had no problems with the elavators, cuz we just walked over to the supposed wet bathing suit elevators that no one ever used and always had immediate service. We did not use the pool, but it looked really nice. We walked over to the beach in front of the Hawaiin Village and enjoyed their Fri night fireworks from our lanai! We would stay here again as it was on the quiet side of town, yet close enough to walk to the huge Al Moana Center .Simply a great place at a great price with great service.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR346867268", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BackHomeCt"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel, Lousy Pool       Kitchen and Bar area", "Date": "Oct 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR719601962", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Airedale2"}, {"Content": "Enjoyed our stay! My husband, 2 boys (5  10) and I stayed here last week of August. We were able to get a great rate (AAA rate $146/night)which we bookedthrough their website. We really enjoyed our stay here. I liked that this hotel was at the quieter end of Waikiki. Yes, the outside of thehotel does look dated and a little tired but the rooms have been updated, look modern and are spacious (about 550 sq. ft.). The rooms look exactly like on the resort's website- we had a king size bed with queen sleeper/sofa. The room was very clean and we loved that it had a kitchen so we were able to have a lot of our meals in. Our room was facing Ala Moana Blvd and with the sliding doors to the balcony open, you can hear all the traffic but with the sliding doors closed it blocked most of the noise. Construction is still going on next door but we never heard any noise from it. Also, I knowthe hotel was almost fully booked when we stayed there but they must have some great insulation or thick walls because I never heard any noise from any of our neighbors. Housekeeping was very good- we always came back to a clean room and they even washed the dirty dishes that we left from breakfast one morning. The office personnel were very nice and they offer complimentary bellhop services upon your arrival and also when you leave. Also at the office you can get free beach towels to use for the day.The only negative was as the other reviewers have said are the slow elevators. They have 3 elevators in the lobby but only 2 of them were in service. There were 2 other elevators that the hotel were allowing guests to use- the Bather's elevator and the Freight elevator. After a few days though, the Bather's elevator was also out of service. My family and I just used the stairs the whole time we were there since our room was on the 3rd floor. Just a few tips: If you rent a car and don't want to pay $25/day for the hotel's valet parking, you can park at the parking garage adjacent to the hotel on Hobron Lane for $14/day with in  out privileges. For groceries they have a Safeway about 1.5 miles away and a Costco about 15 minutes drive away. Best beach nearby is Ala Moana Beach Park- about 15 minute walk. The water is very calm and has soft sand. Not as busy and packed as Waikiki beach- mostly localsgo here. Ala Moana Beach has lifeguards, restrooms and snack bar (they serve great loco moco, yum:)). We went to the beach in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village (about 10 minute walk) and we didn't like it as much. Waves are a little stronger and lots of rocks in the sand- ouch!I would definitely recommend this resort and would stay here again.", "Date": "Sep 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR506050435", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "DJsMom"}, {"Content": "fantastic@! This place is great! We are owners of Shell Vacations and used our points for two rooms at the Waikiki Marina Resort at the Ilikai. We were treated great, the staff at the check in office were very friendly. The rooms had robes and welcome chocolates, notecards, cold water, etc waiting for us. We had daily maid service, which is unusual for a timeshare. The room is large for two people, although for 4 people it would be cramped, only a king size bed and fold out couch. The location is good, not right on Waikiki Beach, but a short walk. But we didn't have to fight the awful Waikiki traffic on the main road, we rented a car and could just pull right out of our hotel to get into town. The valet parking guys were wonderful, we came and went constantly and we never had to wait more than a minute or two for them to get our car. There is construction next door, so the walk to the beach is a little longer than usual, but still only a few short minutes. The Shell Vacations Club had fresh beach towels available at all times, a concierge with info on activities, etc, and a lei greeting when we arrived. The views of the city are fantastic, and we had no construction noise whatsoever, even though the hotel next door is being built.

Our issues started the minute we got here. We were traveling with an elderly couple (separate rooms, of course) who upon getting their room key on the 18th floor found that their key didn't work and had to wait in the hot hallway for someone to bring them a new key. There was a guest book in the room with useful information including that there was no need to bring your own towels to the pool area as they would be provided for you there. After asking to receive a towel at the pool we were told that our rooms do not get this service. The concierge service is located across the street below the Starbucks. We went to get our coupon books and basically just had them handed to us with no welcome or smile. One of the things they advertised was a two for one meal coupon for Tanaka of Tokyos. We went to eat at this restaurant (which was great) and were told that this coupon could not be honored because it was actually a copy of their coupon. I brought this issue to the front desk and they simply said it wasn't their issue and we would need to take this up with the concierge service.While sitting by the pool we also asked to receive an ashtray and some water. The waitress said she was busy and pointed out the water cooler to us for water. We went to paddles bar and asked for the ashtray and they said they were out of them and gave us an empty soda can.Our room wasn't cleaned the first two days we stayed here. We finally asked the front desk about this and they indicated that upon check in you need to specify how often you would like to have your room cleaned. Once we explicitly said we would like to have our room cleaned at least every two days, the cleaning staff wouldn't come in until at least 4PM.Our shower light was burnt out when we arrived and we were told this would be fixed. It took three days before this actually happened.We don't consider ourselves to be very picky guests which is why we decided to give this hotel a shot even after some of the other reviews. After actually seeing the service you receive and the way you are treated, we would never stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR951861361", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Good value, nice room We recently returned from a trip to Oahu and Maui. We spent three days at the Waikiki Marina Resort. This resort is a time share property located at the Illikai Renissance resort. Same resort, different name, different price.

The pools at the resort are nice, as well as the bars and entertainment. Look for the 8 pm fireworks on the beach on Friday night.

Here are some information to help others who may stumble upon this place:-Waikiki Marina Resort owns a block of 80 rooms at the Ilikai Hotel (Renaissance) which they rent out separately.-We got a 3rd floor room on the Ilikai tower with no view.-Some of the amenities of the Ilikai that are availalbe to regular guests are not available to WMR guests.-There is no bell service or valet parking for WMR guests. The Ilikai staff will not help you if you mention that you're a WMR guest. I was given a cart to haul our luggage a long way across two buildings and into an elevator to our room.(Funny thing: Since I was wearing a hawaiian shirt and had a luggage cart, I was mistaken for a bell boy several times by other guests.)-You CAN'T use room service if you're a WMR guest.-However, you CAN charge meals to your room at the two other restaurants in house.-The WMR seems to have their own maid staff as our rooms were cleaned late in the day, only after I saw the other maids leave our floor.-No in-house concierge. There is a guy across the street (outside travel/activities agent) that is available if you need anything.-Front desk was only open limited hours. If you need help at night, you'd have to leave a message and wait until morning.All this being said, the Waikiki Marina Resort was listed as a 4 star hotel on Hotwire. I would rate the experience a 3 star at best. The Ilikai is a bit old and would probably be a 3.5 star in my book, but since we felt like second-class guests at this resort, I would only give it 3 stars.If you can get this for a 3-star price and can live with the above mentioned details, then it is probably a fair deal. Otherwise, I would consider other hotels such as the Prince Hotel (4.5 stars) next door which we also stayed in and highly recommend.Aloha.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR693672365", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "msquare"}, {"Content": "Buon rapporto qualit\u813f prezzo   showReview(14727315, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR737286320", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d575097-r22677601-Waikiki_Marina_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html", "HotelID": "575097", "Price": "$183"}}
