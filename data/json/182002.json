What impressed me most though was the service I received from everyone at the hotel. We had an unfortunate incident with the toilet which clogged after my young son accidently flushed his toothbrush down the toilet and not only did the woman at the desk send someone up immediately to fix it, they also sent up a replacement toothbrush for my son. It was a welcome surprise and I would like to pass on my thanks to her (sorry, don\u2019t remember her name).

It almost ruined our vacation. Our flight arrived too early for hotel check-in. We know that we can't be accomodated at 9am. But we still made a request, if ever a room is already available for we haven't slept yet and very tired from our flight. The reception people were very unfriendly and arrogant. They were two young ladies, a healthy Asian and a skinny Caucasian. No greetings, not even a friendly welcome. They told us to come back by 12nn for there might be a room. We decided to have breakfast (fantastic dimsum in Chinatown) outside and walk around the area to kill time. We came back at noon and saw a great number of people checking out. We saw that they were really busy so we stayed at the lobby. By 1pm, we approached the reception again and they even become more rude and unfriendly. She said that no room is available yet and that we will be notified once a room becomes available. Does this hotel only have one cleaning lady? I called Member's assistance hotline to make a complain but she only made matters worst. She told me that Best Western hotels are franchises and the owners have their own rules on how to manage the hotel. Hilarious. And to think that I just recently became an Elite member of their rewards program. Anyways, to make the matter worst, we saw several couples checking in and got a room ahead of us. We pointed this matter to the reception but they ignored us. We fell asleep several times at the lobby seating area and by 230pm, we asked the Caucasian lady again. This time she came out of the room with a mouthful of her lunch, checked the computer rapidly and voila, we have a room. They didn't inform us immediately to think that we were seating in front of the,. As if they just let us wait until the very last minute. They don't have compassion and concern about their guests. You should know that it is my first time as an Elite member and I read from the mail sent to me that Elite members will be prioritized and be given a special key card. Neither was given to me. The Caucasian lady just handed me an ordinary key card without saying anything, no good wishes for a pleasant stay. She went back immediately to the room while we were still at the counter. We heard them murmuring and laughing. How inappropriate was that? The room given to us was big. It has enough space to move around. The coffee maker, heating and lighting worked well. The bed and pillows was comfirtable, too. But the room has a very strong smell of smoke, the carpet needs cleaning and the bathroom has a lot of hairs on the floor, walls and tub. The hallways needs carpet cleaning and more lighting. The elevators were too slow. This hotel needs a major overhaul. A middle-aged man, who seems to be the manager or supervisor, made our check-out pleasant. He was friendly and nice. Same with the doorman who never fails to greet the guests.

It is a large hotel in downtown Toronto with unhappy, unhelpful employees who do not do their job well. Granted not every employee may fit this characterization, but it is obviously a large contingent of them based on the state of the hotel. On arrival, the guy at the reception was professional enough but it went downhill from there. The hotel is in serious need of a facelift. Everything must date from the 80s but it is not so much the old tired decor as it is for lack of cleanliness. The room has old dirty and stained carpetting and chairs. The bathroom is old, but the floor was dirty and the faucet still had toothpaste stains from the previous guest. The toilet had not been cleaned as evidenced by the grey / orange hard water stains and had a big black stain under the rim. Since it was late and I was only staying one night, I decided that I would not take a shower because of the lack of cleanliness of the bathroom. I did not have the energy to change rooms so I just went to bed, which was surprising very comfortable, as were the pillows. The next morning, I went to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. As I came in, the waiter was on the phone and told me to sit down; the buffet is 8.95$ or I could order from the menu. He hung up and then left and did not come back for a while, so I did the same. I took a look at the buffet...don't waste your time, money, or calories for this buffet. Just outside to the left of the hotel is a greasy spoon called the Golden Diner. Breakfast is huge and really good, served by a sociable waiter names Josh. Checkout took 20 minutes because there was only one woman at the reception. Customer service is not her forte. Parking is 23$ and very narrow so don't even think of trying to get an SUV in there. There is a parking lot right next door on Jarvis. Whoever is managing this hotel should be fired and blacklisted.

The staff was VERY courteous and friendly, and went out of their way to assist us in whatever we required or asked - both the day and night staff. Yes, the parking garage is a bit tight, but humbly, the parking *problem* is more with the driver than the facility. I managed to park a high, extra-length, 1991 GMC Safari XLT quite easily, and get it out very easily - 3 times - from 3 different parking spots, without a hint of hitting anything, thank you very much. If you know how to use your mirrors, it's really quite fine. The tightest aspect is the height, not the turns, or parking space sizes. You do need an extra person on the exterior to guide the driver between the sprinlker system valves to ensure you don't hit them, but ONLY if you have a van or vehicle of that height (6 feet). These days, there's very few of them left. We didn't have time to partake in the restaurant, bar, nor internet access (You need a short ethernet cable or have to request one from the front desk, no Wi-Fi yet), and having the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel was a bonus for that obligatory morning coffee. The hotel still does provide coffee equipment in the rooms, but our timeline precluded that. One reviewer mentioned the noise level from other rooms. It was not a problem for us on the 19th Floor, but honestly, I suspect it was due to the hotel probably being far from full. It could possibly be a problem in the high season, but how bad is subjective to the reviewer. As mentioned, the elevators are all new, and we never had to wait more than a minute for a car at any time - either from the 19th Floor, the Lobby or P1 Parking. The security to and from the parkade is very good as well. There was no evidence of panhandlers out to occost us for money, or any other unsavory characters, and we were out quite late on the 30th.

Great start but we thought we could deal with it for 2 nights so wouldn't say anything. The next morning the toilet blocked up for no reason. We were also in the 17th floor which caused a issue while waiting 45 minutes for a lift!!! My room mate took the stairs however as i had a ankle injury i was unable to had to wait for the lift.

I was quite pleased to see that they were truthful and that all the elevators had been replaced.

I have stayed in numerous hotels and found that the furniture was not what it should be. usually you have your 2 beds, a couch and table with 2 charis. All we got was our beds, 1 chair and a table. Which the only chair was broken. There were stains all over the wall and windows. We also did not find the customer service up to par. I had gone to the front desk to request more coffee, though I did no you could just call the front desk, but i wanted to get out of the room for a bit. When I arrived at the front desk I felt I was able to approach the lady working. When I asked for more coffee she gave a dirty look and pulled the magazine she was reading off the counter....kinda like I interupted her reading. She then proceeded to ask me my room number. I unfortunately didn't no it...due to stress as to why were there. She then proceeded to ask me what name the room was under which I told her 2 times and she said \" I have no one sdtaying here under that name\" and looked at as though I shouldn't be there. It took 5 minustes to resolve the room situation and for me to find out that they put our last name in the system incorrecltly. Which I find hard to believe when I know my mom would have spelt in out when we made our reservations and they looked at her credit card when we arrived. After determining that the name was wrong and she corrected it, she then told me she would have the coffee delivered. I asked if I culd just get at the desk. Wow, shouldn't have aked that....my response to this \" well we DON\"T have coffee, we DON'T keep coffee at the front desk\" then she walked away and got on the phone. Upon our day to check out we went to the elevators. We stood and stood and stood some more. During the waiting game we were playing we were stuck with another couple who was checking out. We spoke with them abut there stay and they had the same problems as us. They actually called the head office and were notified that this specific hotel has \"mangement problems\".

It took so long because the hotel service people were on the elevator with their towel cart and delivery towels to every floor.

Staff will ask if you want smoking or non, and king or two double during checkin. Ask for a high floor. I forgot to ask but noticed we were on a high floor when handed the pass cards for our room. There are smoking and non-smoking floors. We were on the 17th with a beautiful view of the city. There is a pool on the third floor, we didn't go down but people were using it. Staff are friendly and take the time to explain how to find parking etc. The underground hotel parking is now $23. The lot was full and we safely parked at Wood and Church in a city lot for $15. It is less than that if you are leaving by 6 am. There are two more parking lots just south of the hotel on either side of the street but wanted $30 for the night. A note about parking anywhere in Toronto - park by one of the lights, remove anything that is visible from your car. This includes face plate from your stereo, CDs. Keep your car clean and nobody will be interested. I have included a picture of the bedroom and the bathroom. The room was clean and well maintained. If I had to take a guess I'd say that it was renovated in the past year or two. The bedroom was furnished with a king size bed, two spacious bedside tables with lamps, a large 6 drawer dresser, tv with many cable channels, work desk with executive style chair, clean sofa with a pull out bed, several lamps and and a table with two chairs near the window. The front hall has a closet on one side and the other is a large mirror and the bathroom. Wireless internet is available in all rooms. I am not sure what the \"crunchy\" bed comment was about in previous reviews. It was a regular spring coil mattress. Air conditioning worked great and cooled the room fast. Also in the bedroom was a coffee maker, sealed take away coffee cups, two coffee mugs, 1 packet each of ground decaf and regular coffee, name brand tea, and little packs with sugar, sweetner, coffee whitener, and a stir stick. The bathroom was bright and clean. The floor tiles were a bit older compared to the new ones in the shower but still clean. The toilet, sink and shower were all clean as well. Plenty of fresh towels etc. Also in the bathroom was an ice bucket and plastic cups in sealed bags. The bathroom basket had two bars of soap, shower cap, brand name lotion, conditioning shampoo, mouthwash, and a sewing kit. Elevators are slow, if you know this in advance you will be fine. Look at the sign in the elevator to note which floors have ice machines. When the elevator doors opened on lower floors (we saw 6 & 4) I could see that the carpets were not as new looking as the ones on our floor. I expect that renovating a place of this size takes a few years. There is a Tim Hortons downstairs if that is your thing. There are restaurants all over, it is downtown Toronto. There is a Golden Griddle a few short blocks west of the hotel by the subway. I need to make a comment about the night life because of previous comments about this hotel. I was looking out so that I could comment for this review and I did see two hookers. Two hookers is not shocking stuff. They are not going to hurt you. It is downtown Toronto, and they are everywhere if you open your eyes. Do not freak out, there are also lot of police because...wait for it...yes, you guess it, because it is downtown Toronto. There is no reason to be afraid walking in the neighbourhood. This hotel is very close to the Village area and a quick walk to the subway or streetcars. I have been at many hotels and for the price this is a fine place and I would stay again. For a downtown Toronto hotel that is not a boutique hotel it is above average.

This was by far, the worst hotel on the tour, and the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We arrived late in the night and were told that this hotel was in the most dangerous area of Toronto. Great way to start the night. We went up the slow elevators to our room and it wasn't that great. We had a nice view of the CN Tower though. It was quite spartan, and the maid had done a relatively good job cleaning. The room was looking quite old, however, and the entire hotel is in desperate need of repair. We left for the Eaton Ctr, which is about 1/2 mile from the hotel. There were homeless people and mental cases yelling and screaming at us. We were even followed. Took a taxi back to the hotel, too scared to walk. We went up to our room to get a nights sleep, but we went one level down to get some ice for the water. The machine was very loud and took some time to get the ice out. After getting the ice we waited for the elevator. The elevator is about the scariest part of the hotel. It is so slow and usually breaks down, though we never got stuck. We waited about 15 minutes for the lift. The lobby is very dark and I was having fears that a boogieman would come around the corner and hurt us. Also, one of the lifts had broken down, with people in it, we could hear the alarm ringing. So, so freaky. We finally got a lift and went to our room. The next morning it took 20 minutes in the lift to get down, including wait time. We stopped at about 5 floors, and it was full from just the four of us in it. No-one else could fit. We stopped by at the Tim Horton's which is inside the hotel and picked up a coffee and cakes from the surly staff. And this all occurred on my birthday.

We were going to arrive in Toronto late on Friday evening and only be in the room about 12 hours, so we (she) decided to go the economy route. The hotel was listed on Hotwire.com as a 2.5 star property at $53 USF. We ended up paying $75.20 CDN (with taxes) for the room with an addition $15 CDN for underground parking. That is a pretty good rate for a downtown name-brand hotel on a weekend night in March. The hotel is located 500 metres east of Yonge Street (the main north-south street in Toronto) and it is a 5 -10 minute walk to the subway in good weather. The hotel is easy to spot while driving towards it and there is a tight but convenient front driveway off Carlton Street for checking-in. We found the check-in staff to be courteous. The underground parking garage has tight corners and steep ramps and parking down there is an exercise in very careful manoeuvring. The elevators have been criticized in previous reviews. There are 4 of them. They are small and tending towards being a little shabby. We were up and down 6 times but never had to wait more than 40 seconds for a car. Our room was placarded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-smoking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but when we entered, it smelled musty and it seemed like there might have been a smoker or smokers in there in the recent past. The room was equipped with a microwave (partially clean), a fridge, an iron and ironing board, and TV. The mattress was okay but not as good as the one we have at home. The room was generally clean although the upper closet shelf, the tops of picture frames, and the top microwave shelf were dusty. The bathroom was okay but it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153un-renovated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with old bathroom tiles and grouting that had a 1950's look. Apparently the hotel rents out rooms on the lower floors as part of a student residence program. When we returned from a late evening walk, we found the lobby to be crowded with students and 4 or 5 bicycles they had brought in off the slushy streets right onto the lobby carpet. Call me stuck-up, but they lowered the tone of the place. The maintenance and parking staff we talked to the next morning were quite friendly and helpful. Checkout is 11:00 am from the room, and 14:00 from the garage. I think we got reasonably good value for our money.

It comes very useful if you don't want to drive in downtown. The station is about 300 yards west of the hotel. Since I metioned driving, I must mention parking in the hotel. By the time we arrived, all parking spots at the hotel were taken. We were advised to park our car about 2 blocks away where there were no \"in and out\" priviledges. This is why we used subway frequently. Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway. Another inconvenience to us was Tim Hortons located on the hotel premises. This is not to complain about Tim Hortons in any way, but were were dissapointed of the \"limited\" menu they have had there. We are huge fans of their breakfast menu but there were only a few choices available- very few muffins and bagels. No Breakfast sandwiches for meat lovers like myself.

Despite some of the other disappointing reviews, my choices were limited due to finances and hotel availability. I will first start with the parking issue. I know Toronto is a big city with lots of people but if a hotel has its own parking structure, there should be enough room for the guests. However the garage was full forcing us to park two blocks away and carry our luggage to the hotel. I thought the clerk was doing us a favor when she offered us privileges to the 'employee' parking lot for $15 a day. That is the same price as the parking structure and actually cheaper than the lots around the hotel. We figured it would be safer as well. Since the structure was full and I read other reviews that it was difficult to maneuver an SUV through the tiny twists and turns, we took the offer. However, the employee lot turned out to be a complete joke. It was down a short alleyway and the tight turn to get into the lot required me to get out of the vehicle and guide my brother into a space. The lot was extremely small as well. No way could all the employees fit in this lot. Plus, there are bums/homeless people sitting on the curbs which made me uncomfortable. Another minor problem was the air conditioning unit. We set it at the lowest temperature but it was always so hot in the room. I called for help but it was still hot in there the next day. We were told that all the units had a motion sensor on them and that when there was no movement, the unit reset itself to 74 degrees. Well, one night we rushed in and checked the unit and what actually happens is that the unit totally shuts off and resets itself to 74 after you enter the room. So all day long while you are out the air is off and it takes forever for it to cool down especially in the July heat. Now onto the REAL problem with the hotel and that is the elevator issue. 90% of the time we tried to use the elevator there was at least a 5 minute wait just to get on. They did not sound safe either. They made this horrible noise and the 16th floor elevators did not show you what floor the elevator was on so it was a guessing game. Once after waiting about 5 minutes, I challenged my brother to a 'game'. I took the stairs 16 flights down while he waited for the elevator. I beat him by 5 minutes! Saturday morning I questioned this problem with the staff and they reassured me that the maintenance person fixed the elevators. Saturday night at 10:45pm my brother and I were stuck in the elevators for 15 minutes along with about 9 other people. We called for help and followed the directions but nothing was working. People were scared and HOT. Then we called again and the lady could not hear us, thus losing connection. Talk about scary! Finally after stopping at just about every floor, it stopped and the doors opened on floor 19. Boy was I furious. Upon checking out, I spoke to the manager and expressed my dissatisfaction especially after being reassured everything was fine. The manager tried to tell me some story how it was a busy weekend and kids were messing with the elevators, etc. but I knew better. A woman and her elderly father next to us were also complaining because he also got stuck in an elevator and the couple on the other side of us were complaining of the long wait. The manager was only going to credit me for one day of parking but that was not good enough for me. He finally credited me for all 3 days of parking and I couldn't get out of there fast enough. I tried to be moved to a room closer to the ground level but they were booked.

I am 20 years old so my expectations might be a bit different than someone older. The hotel is in the homosexual part of your town, so if that bothers you, pick somewhere else. The only really bad part of the hotel was the parking ramp and the elevators. The elevators were so slow, be prepared to wait between 7 and 10 minutes to get the elevator to stop at your floor, and if it's not already full, you can go to the lobby. In fact, these are so bad, 2 of the people I went on vacation with were stuck in the elevator for nearly 10 minutes becasue the door wouldn't open. The parking ramp is terribly small, with an entrance hill of about 50 degrees...I wouldn't make the mistake of stopping on it like I did, you might not be able to get up the hill. The corners are very, very sharp, and the parking spaces are tight...don't attempt to get anything bigger than a Ford Taurus in there, casue it won't happen. Check in is at 3:00 PM, and I suggest if you want a parking space you get there very early becasue parking is on first come first serve basis, and there are only 78 spots for a 100 plus room hotel building. The first night we were there and we parked in a run down, ghetto lot on Church street for 20 bucks. The service at the front desk could have been a bit friendlier, but it's not that big of a deal.

And when Rowena at the front desk gave us the wrong room (a double room instead of the king we had reserved 6 months before) the first thing she said when we immediately came back down was \"did you take anything out of the room?\" as if we were going steal the shampoo bottles. She kept asking us this for some reason and changed us to a king room without even an apology for the wrong room. You should also be aware that there are no fire sprinklers in the guest areas of the hotel. This is especially important now that they are installing kitchenettes in some of the rooms.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cDirty Hotel/Bad Service.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5230060", "Content": "My friends and I decided to stay at this hotel for two nights because the price was so good.
