The bathrooms are large, well-appointed, and luxurious with marble floors and very nice fixtures. Everything in the hotel is clean and bright. The mattresses are very comfortable.

We were looking at colleges with our 18 year old daughter and I hoped to share all of the Chicago experience with her while we were in town. The location is two minutes from Lake Shore Drive, Highway access and 5 miutes from Navy Pier, Water Tower, Downtown! Gorgeous hotel decor, mixed turn of the century with modern. Valet parking is expensive but it is at all the hotels. My husband parked on the corner and payed a meter. Not my first choice but it made him happy! ACCOMMODATIONS: We had a concierge room on the 20th floor with a full view of Lake Michigan. Our room was clean and comfortable with chocolates and water bottles left on our pillow everynight. The attendants were kind and friendly but always seemed to forget that there were three of us in our room. Not a big deal though, just a mention. Beds were comfortable and Queen size not full!! Thank YOU!! Not two doubles! Rooms was quiet from street noise which was a huge plus! One complaint about room, the bathroom door. It is a sliding door and never stayed on it's track, plus you could see in about an inch space of the side of the slider so my husband/daughter had to be careful to maintain privacy when in the bath room. Inside the bathroom we had nice counter space and a marble shower. Clean, towels were kind of small. Towels are the \"scrubby\" kind of towels which I like because they get the blood circulating. I have heard reviewers complain they were not soft enough but it is not because they are bad towels, just a different style. CONCIERGE LOUNGE: LOVE THE DESIGN and decor of the lounge, great place for a \"chat\" and to sip coffee or read a newspaper. CON-Food was really bad, bad, bad! They have water bottles and soda in the mini fridges. We preferred getting our coffee at the Starbucks below the lobby of the hotel. WORKOUT ROOM:The workout room had newer equipment in excellent shape and overlooks Grant Park and Lake Michigan. I would rate the workout facility slightly above average. Definitely had what we needed for a full workout but nothing over the top. Towels and water were provided, one water had fresh lemons and ice! My only complaint about the workout facility was that the equipment was kind of dusty, not really dirty, but it did not look as though they have anyone assigned to clean the equipment on a regular basis. In addition, finding the remotes to turn the tv volume down was somedays a workout in itself! ha RESTAURANT: They have a Spanish/Tapas style restaurant in the hotel but we did not eat there.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cTouches of Luxury\u201d", "Author": "medicalalert", "ReviewID": "UR125518380", "Content": "Great stay at this luxurious, historic property.

We found ourselves going downtown for the Chicago Cubs Convention at the hotel across the street from the Blackstone. Being that we are Marriott elite members, the Blackstone was an obvious choice...but would it be ok for the kids? I called the hotel directly and chatted with Tina (she is wonderful!) and made the reservation. We asked for early check in since we would be arriving in the morning for the convention. I intended just to drop our bags with the bellman and head across the street. When we arrived at 8 am, we were told they had a room ready for us!!! Really??? Amazing!!!! We headed up to our room - it was on Club level - and were thrilled with the size for the 4 of us! It was a really big room for such an old building - much bigger than the other rooms in the hotel we have been in. We returned after a full day at the convention and were warmly welcomed back by the doorman - he made a point to talk to my daughters. They thought that was the best thing ever! Little things like that make all the difference! We had one issue - at about 2 am the room next to us decided to have a REALLY loud party. Loud to the point our wall was rattling from the music and LOUD people. A quick, polite call down to the front desk had the issue settled within 20 minutes, and we all went back to sleep. Not the greatest experience in the world, but it was certainly not the hotel's fault, and they handled it quickly!!!

We spent 3 nights there. I have stayed at many Marriotts, JW's and Renaissance hotels and this is one is definitely one of my favorites, with the Eden Roc in Miami ranking at the top of my list. I loved the modern decor. The marble in the room, the glasses, the comfy chair added great touches. I only had a few minor issues with The Blackstone. The first was that we couldn't get an upgrade to a lakeview room and had a pretty horrible view of the subway behind the hotel. They were nice enough to give my sister and I two rooms right next to each other, but my room was clearly bigger and had room for the comfy chair. My sister's room did not and she also had a sliding bathroom door which many people complained about, but she loved it. My next issue with The Blackstone is the towels. The quality was not that great. My final issue, which isn't really an issue, was the water spilling out of the shower. Not a real issue, but I've stayed at other Renaissance properties where the showers were closed in with glass, sans the tub, also in Chicago. My boyfriend complained of the cold air, every time I came into the bathroom and he was in the shower. LOL. But this again was a very minor issue. I thought the area was great and very convenient to everywhere we needed to go. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job of cleaning our rooms daily. All in all, I will definitely be staying at The Blackstone when I'm in Chicago next. I've been to Chicago 3 times in the past 6 months and I'm sure I will be back soon.

Arrived early (9h30AM) and was provided a room on the 6th floor with a good view of the Lakeside park across the street. Check in was super courteous and friendly. The room itself was just accross the gym entrance, and was huge. The bed was delicious (slept like a baby), the wall mounted LCD TV had close to 90 channels, a nice work station with a good chair and a huge bathroom (with shower only, but i'm a shower person myself) well appointed with good toiletries. A bathrobe was also available, as well as a safe (didnt use either). Very good Wi-Fi available for 12.95$ per day, not a bad price, but do keep in mind it runs noon to noon, so if you buy it at 9PM an evening, it will run till noon the next day, not 24 hours as in most hotels (management was kind enough to credit me one day). The gym was quite big, well appointed with 3 of each ellipticals, bikes and treadmills, loads of Nautilus equipment, and freeweights. Also available are lemon infused and regular iced water, earbuds earphones, small towels, and cold damp hand towels. Nice view of the park mentionned above. Downside is that there is no pool, mind you, this is an older building (1920s methinks) so they did not build pools back then...didnt miss it. The lobby is quite nice, mixing classic 1920s elements with modern ones. The concierge was super helpful, and provided me with maps and what nots. The business provides free internet access and printing (no gouging here) so I checked in and printed my boarding pass online for my return. There are a few restaurants on site, but I used La Bodega downstairs for my breakfast, 6.50$ for a breakfast sandwich and a fruit or pastry...delicious German sausage, with eggs, Mahon cheese, caramelized onion...a good deal (they have 5$ deals weekdays, so even better if your staying then). A few inexpensive places around also: Harold's fried chicken on Wabash, South Loop Club and a pizza place , KFC/Pizza Hut/DD on the same street....plenty of choice for cost conscious travellers. Ran out of shaving cream, and within 5 minutes was provided with some Barbasol (travel size) and a good quality razor! Only downside: there was a marriage going on my last night, sounded fun...but also loud! Given the 6th floor is the lowest guest floor, the music could be heard in my room...called the lobby and was offered a room on a higher floor...but since they told me the party would end at around midnight (and I was watching TV late), I stayed put and the music subsided by 11PM...went to bed then. The hotel is 5-10 minutes walk from Harrison on the red line. Plenty of buses in front of the hotel...the CTA is quite good and efficient...all in all, good location!

My platinum status upgraded me to a beautiful corner room with a view of the Sears Tower, which proved to be quite lovely. I can honestly say that I was fascinated with the television that was embedded into the mirror in the bathroom. I typically don't bother with tv when I'm traveling - but since I could brush my teeth and watch the morning news in the same room, why not? The room itself was quite nice with a comfortable bed, Eames-style lounge chair/ottoman, refrigerator, and desk. My colleague who had not been upgraded told me her room was nice, but apparently my digs were much nicer. Sometimes status really pays off. The concierge lounge and food were both sub-par at best. I count on Marriott for my oatmeal and what I found at the property was a soupy/sugary/cinnamon concoction that was awful. Evening fare wasn't any better. I'm a vegetarian so typically I can find something in the form of a salad or crudite, but instead they actually server little hotdogs and some sort of bean concoction. I knew I wasn't off in passing less than stellar judgement about the lounge, when I heard a number of other visitors make a few negative remarks about the food. The neighborhood around the hotel is up and coming with a good restaurants within walking distance. Lake Michigan is a short 2 block walk. Once there you can walk in either direction for miles, enjoying the beautiful lake and the Chicago skyline. The gym is a decent size with good weight and aerobic equipment.

It was a beautiful hotel with so much history. The location was as close to downtown Chicago as we were going to get with our budget. It was a half hour walk to the downtown core, which was perfect on a sunny day. With Millenium Park right beside the hotel, the walk was beautiful - one of the highlights of our trip. On a rainy day, one would have to take the subway which is surprisingly not kid-friendly. We were a first-timer to Chicago, so we tried to bring our stroller on the subway, which was not only a hazard, but next to impossible. The only reason why I bring this up is because if people were travelling with kids and the weather was anything less than sunny, it might be worth the extra $$ to stay downtown. The room was incredible. Booking on priceline, I had a pretty good idea that we were going to get one of the non-preferred views, which happened - but it was not a bother. The room itself was clean and larger than I was expecting. There was a little white noise with a subway close by, but it was not nearly as much of a bother as some of the reviews I had read. Didn't bother either of us at all. The one and only cash-grab we felt while at the hotel was when they tried to 'upgrade' our room at check-in for $40/night for a better view. The staff were amazing. Everyone was very professional and courteous. The front desk staff, concierges, housekeepers - everyone was great. Back to trying to be a 'family' stay - there was one concierge who had absolutely no idea what kind of restaurant to recommend when I said that I was bringing a one year old child and looking for a family-style restaurant - she continued to tell me about upscale restaurants. I wish I got her name because the other concierges I spoke with were much better. Also - the hotel did not recommend Buddy Guy's Legends at all, which was really surprising. It is basically on the same block, and their afternoon entertainment from 12-2pm was again another one of our highlights. Glad we stopped in to it while attempting to walk to the restaurant the concierge recommended, which was blocks away. We actually stayed there for about 3 hours - it was really a load of fun with the acoustic blues set - perfect for kids. We didn't dine in the restaurant because we figured it would be expensive. We opened the inroom dining menu and the first page was obviously the breakfasts. They cost between $20-$25, which is crazy for breakfast. A few nights later, after a full day of walking and exploring, we were bushed and submitted to going back to the hotel for room service dinner. We got $7.50 hamburgers which were surprisingly one of the best meals we had on the entire trip - FAR less expensive than we figured, and the quality was incredible.

I loved waking up to the sunrise over the lake and just drinking in the gorgeous view. 2. I had forgotten my toothbrush and at another time needed a pair of scissors. The hotel did not charge a delivery fee to bring it up (I was surprised - many Renaissance hotels would have charged 12.5 dollars each time) 3. The location was very convenient - the Shedd aquarium, the Field museum, the Millennium Park and Navy Pier are all close by. It also helps that all cab drivers know where the hotel is. 4. Al Capone was at the hotel (yeah .. i know it's stupid but it was kind of cool to stay at the hotel where Al Capone smashed someone's head :) ) 5. When the lounge is open, it is small but tastefully decorated and I really liked the food! What was not so good 1. The wifi is REALLY slow. I had difficulty connecting to my company VPN through the wifi connection and ended up having to use my aircard 2. As a platinum member, I enjoy getting the frills. But I received no room upgrade and Friday through Sunday, there was no turn-down service (with the complimentary bottles of water and little squares of chocolate). Also the lounge was closed all 3 days and I did not get breakfast coupons instead - which many other Renaissance group hotels provide 3. I was working from the hotel all day Monday and did not have time to step out for lunch. But the hotel provided NO lunch options. Since the day was crazy busy with a bunch of calls through the afternoon, I had to wait till I got to the airport later in the day to get a really late lunch.

There are a lot of reasonably priced food establishments all within walking distance.

I requested for a room with a view, and right away I was told it was going to cost extra. So I said, forget it. But even if I did not get a room with a view, the guy put me in a very nice room on one of the top floors where I could see a portion of the park, lake and the museums by the lake. Room: Very spacious! And bed was huge! I think it might have been a california king. The pillows were soft and the bed was very comfy. The decor was simple yet elegant. The furniture and carpeting still look like new. The room was clean and there were no bedbugs! :-) Everything around me was quiet except for the low hum of the air conditioner, and the flat-screen TV when I had it turned on. There's not a lot of rooms in each floor (I think maybe around 20) so it felt exclusive. Room features & amenities: A robe was provided (which was inside the closet). Some of my clothes had wrinkles when I unpacked them, good thing an iron and ironing board was provided as well. So sprucing them up was not a problem. There was a mini-fridge and a 1-cup coffee maker which also doubles as a water boiler. There were also coffee pods, teas, sugar, half-n-half - all the things that you would need to make a cup of coffee/tea. I only needed to bring in bottled water and my morning coffee fix was solved. Access to Internet was provided but it was not free. There were wifi and LAN connections. Bathroom: A lot of reviews already mentioned the sliding bathroom door that does not provide adequate privacy. I agree, so make sure your roommate is someone you are very comfortable with. Some reviews say that the shower had no water pressure. Well, it's a rain shower and it's supposed to mimic rain drops, not agitate your skin with piercing water pressure. I found the rain shower very relaxing and soothing. Bathroom features & amenities: Aveeda products - shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and soap. They were okay, except for the conditioner that had my hair all tangled-up instead of smoothed. I had brought my own conditioner so that was not a problem for me. There were also packets of cotton and q-tips - which I did not expect. Housekeeping service: I always put out the DND sign on my door the night before I slept, and housekeeping left me in peace. I usually left the room around noon, and when I got back in the evening, the room had been serviced. I did not need to call and ask for service. Every day I was there, I got clean towels, fresh supplies, and bed was made up. Price: I had a huge discount but considering I stayed 4 nights, what I had to shell out is still a considerable amount of money. But it was all worth it. Recommend: Yes!

Its in a tie position with the St Pancras Renaissance in London. I conducted a very large meeting here with over 120 attendees. This place was incredible, from start to finish. My meeting planner could not say enough positive things about how easy it was to work with this staff. We held our meeting in the historical ballroom, and we invited the hotel \"historian\" to come in on one of our breaks to present to our audience about some tidbits on the hotel. EVERYONE loved it. Not only is Ryan a great presenter, but just the sheer history of this place, the architectural design, and its location just make is a true pleasure to stay at and the story just rounded out the experience for all attendees. My room was beautiful. I gave it 5 stars, even though it did not get cleaned on one day. However, I ended up having to have my birthday during my stay, and the hotel brought me a bottle of wine and cupcakes. I mean, booze and sweets will make up for any minor discrepancies. I only had a few hiccups in service, which is very rare for Renaissance hotels (I am a Marriott Platinum member, and these are my favorite places to stay). The front desk did not have my Marriott number on file, even though I called in ahead of time to add it to my reservation, and my travel agent had already added it (it was on my confirmation sheet). And, when I asked the concierge about the club lounge and breakfast, she said it was served until 10. When I went up to the club the next morning at 9:30, I found out the food disappeared at 9:00. So,,,,I went back downstairs and asked for local places to go for breakfast. I explained I was gluten intolerant. She suggested breakfast sandwiches at Starbucks (apparently, when I told her I couldn't eat bread, the synapses failed to connect), or eating at the hotel restaurant (which I had already done the night before, and I wanted a change of pace). When I asked for other near by locations, she gave me nothing to work with. Despite my little hiccups, the service, ambiance, and appeal of the hotel made up for it all. The food for our meeting was truly wonderful. AV services were top notch. All the meeting staff were fantastic. Check out my separate review for Mercat. I would recommend a meal here during your stay. You would remiss if you did not sneak a peek at the Ballroom, and the Art Museum on site.

Admittedly, I completely lucked out with a bid from Priceline, because there would have been no way I could have afforded a 4-night stay here otherwise, but I think I might have to budget myself for at least a night or two the next time I'm in town. The building itself is an architectural gem (but really, what building on Michigan Ave isn't?) and so it the decor inside. I kept thinking it was very thoughfully renovated with a clear eye on the artistic details. The lobby is a mix of old-school charm (cast plaster details, marble fireplace) with new artistic touches ( a rug that recalls a Gene Davis canvas, large steel chandeliers that are a nod to Anish Kapoor's Cloud Gate a few blocks away). The hallways are decorated (the ones I strolled down at least) with black & white city photographs but not postcard images; rather ones that showcase unusual angles of the city and abstract it. The art in the rooms themselves have great pieces- i don't know if they're all different, but I had a fantastic faux-bois with buildings piece over my bed that I wouldn't have minded hanging in my apartment. The Blackstone's website I think mentions all of the work as coming from Chicago-based artists which I think is an unbelievably fantastic idea. I would have liked to have known more about the artists whose prints were in my room (I'm a bit of an art nerd incase you couldn't tell ;) And then....there's the Art Hall. It's own stop on the elevator. The art hall is a beautiful little gem of a room that when I was there, had a great show by local artist- Eric DeBat which I wholely encourage you to view. The pieces are great and very affordable. Now, I'll stop talking about the art & mention the room....Again, very thoughtful details. My room had a stack of books (Creepy Chicago, stuff about Ghosts, Wrigley field.. I don't know if that's the standard assortment or they do some snooping on you ahead of time, but I enjoyed looking through them. The bed was....it was like sleeping on a cloud. I've never slept so well in my life. The bathroom was just....huge and the shower as great (although I do love me a good soak in a tub) The door i thought was strange, and I could see if you were merely traveling with an acquaintance it might make things a little more...uh...'intimate' (door is translucent and to be honest, not well sized to the opening, even when closed you could pass a moderately sized paperback book in the gaps to the sides) but I was traveling by myself so who cares. Other amenities include an in-room coffee maker and a small fridge. The Aveda toiletries were luxurious (although I could have used twice the conditioner given) and the service was the best part.

I was rooming with an online friend that I'd just met F2F for the first time that day. What the deal is on this: the bathroom door is a sliding door, but not a pocket door. So once it's closed, from the front, it covers the doorway just fine. From the sides, there's about a 1\" gap, if you're looking. I didn't look and it worked out just fine.

Upon discovering that I didn't bring any shaving cream, I went downstairs to visit the sundries store located next to the front desk.

She promptly disappeared and provided me with a small complementary bottle of Barbasol. The rooms sport a great decor with a comfortable bed and large bathroom. I was disappointed to find there were not any waters placed in my room. I rarely find a hotel these days that does not place some complementary bottled waters in them each day. I'm not sure if that was a hotel practice or an oversight. I stopped by the gym, and although I did not work out there, I would say it was impressive. It was by no means small in size, and featured a large amount of equipment. Upon returning from a dinner engagement, I stopped by the 1st Floor restaurant, Mercant a la Planxa, for a nightcap. The place had clearly been busy during the evening, but appeared to be emptying out. I believe it was around 10:30pm. The staff at the bar was friendly, and they told me they closed at 11pm. 11pm, on a Friday? Lots of wasted potential there for a weekend place like that, but that's neither here or there. The menu looked palatable, and I found myself committing to memory that I must try out the tapas on my next visit there. In the morning, I decided on a walking tour of Grant Park to snap some photos instead of a run along the river. The hotel is literally directly next to the park. Aside from a few vagrants, one of which yelled at me angrily when I took a photo of a statue across the street from the hotel, it's a pleasant experience and recommended for any visitor.

OK, parking is just outrageous but suck it up and pay. It is so much easier than driving around trying to find a lot. So, inside is a fun and funky mix of old time hotel with some modern stuff thrown into the mix. Front desk staff were superb and when our son forgot something when we checked out, a staff member in the lobby went upstairs with us to unlock the room get it. We ordered room service because by 6:30 pm we were hungry but too tired to go get it. We thought it would be outrageous like the parking but for three of us, we paid $63, very reasonable and did I say delish? Yup! My favorite part was the TV in the bathroom mirror. We just don't get out much so this was just too fun. We kept the NASA channel on all night with the space shuttle on the launch pad for a night light, perfect. The only thing that was weird, and others have mentioned this...the bathroom doors that slide are too narrow so you can see someone in the shower from the living room.

My first impression was favorable. I liked the feel of an old hotel yet the renovations have brought it into the 21st century. The room was nice sized as I had worried that it would be on the small size like so many of the older hotel rooms are. It was clean, bright, and modern. I'm a shower person so the fact that it didn't have a tube didn't affect me and I didn't hear my wife grumble. I like the walk in type shower and the glass wall made the room seem bigger. I would agree about the bathroom door though, it just doesn't offer privacy. The sliding door seemed at first functional and unique but when closed it left about a 2 inch gap between it and the wall. My wife was sitting at the desk in the room and had full view of me in the shower, not a pretty site. One other criticism was the length of the beds. I'm not a tall person, 5' 10\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and my feet were barely on the bed when lying down. Might be a problem for someone taller. My overall opinion of the room was good to very good. One thing I like in the morning is a good coffee and you can access a Starbucks without going outside. Something else I was surprised with and is worth mentioning was parking. It was the typical $40 something charge for valet but we wanted to do some shopping after checkout so I asked what I could do with my car. We had checked in at 10:00 a.m. on a Sunday and checking out by 11 on Monday. I was surprised that I could leave my car there till 5:00 p.m. without additional charge.

We flew in at around 1 PM and took the Blue Line train from O'Hare to Jackson Street and then the Red Line to Harrison. It would've been better just to walk from Jackson since we waited for about 10 minutes and it was only one stop which we could've walked more quickly. It was raining and was only a few blocks from the train stop to the hotel. We got to the hotel a little after 2 and were able to check in. We had booked the room through Priceline a couple months ago and had called and requested 2 beds but they said there weren't any available. We asked for one when we got there since there were 3 of us sharing the room and they offered us a lake view room with 2 queen beds for an additional $30/night so we jumped on it. The room ended up having a fantastic view that we were able to enjoy off and on over the weekend since it rained a lot. When we left on Memorial Day the view was stunning since the weather was perfect. The room they gave us was huge, so big in fact that the 37 inch LCD HDTV looked rather small while sitting in the bed. Maybe it was a bit smaller but the picture was great nonetheless. The beds were extremely comfortable. The only real issue we had with the room was the bathroom. This bathroom needs its own paragraph since for whatever reason it had a sliding door that didn't even cover the full doorway! A horrible design and completely ineffective. Basically the door provided zero privacy so if you have this room to yourself it's not a problem, but I just hope that you're REALLY comfortable with whoever you're with if you're staying there with anyone. Not only did it give a straight sight line into the shower from the main room with the door slid shut, it also did nothing to muffle any noise. A fan or something would be nice. I was woken up on Sunday morning by the shower which sounded like a dang waterfall right next to my bed. A little common sense in room design goes a long way, people. Something I guess I've taken for granted all these years at other hotels. The actual shower in the bathroom was nice as it was a rainfall design, but the wallpaper is a bit of a question mark. OK well enough about that since I really did like the hotel. We had a 9th floor room that looked right out to Buckingham Fountain and we could see towards downtown and the Navy Pier to the north and down to Soldier Field and a few nice looking museums to the south. A great view of Grant Park. A big plus to get a room with one of these views. We had a perfect in-room vantage point for Saturday night fireworks that were going off around 10 PM in the Navy Pier vicinity. The location of the hotel is a bit south of most of the Chicago hotels we were looking at and we did end up walking a lot over the 3 day weekend. We took the Red Line to a baseball game at Wrigley Field and it only took about 45 minutes or so to get there. We definitely recommend going to a baseball game if you're in Chicago. We had a great time and met a bunch of great people while sitting through a 3 hour rain delay waiting for the game to start. The housekeeping was great and the people at the hotel were all very nice. We had a few meals nearby, one at Yolk which was about 4 blocks south on Michigan Ave which we would highly recommend for breakfast. We also ate at a nearby Lou Malnati's on State Street that had some really good deep dish pizza. Overall we had a nice stay at the hotel and look forward to a return visit to Chicago at some point in the near future.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johnsburg, IL", "Title": "\u201cMeh!\u201d", "Author": "MaureenJohnsburg_IL", "ReviewID": "UR110640348", "Content": "I stayed at Blackstone for a wedding. I booked the room 6 weeks in advance with the \"wedding planner\" & was given the \"wedding party rate\". I asked for a double bed room being there were 3 \"sisters\" staying in room together. I was told there were no double bed rooms available, only king & I'd have to wait upon check-in IF a double was avail. Weeks before our stay, I called & asked for a double room, replied to their automated email reminder of booking (anything they can do for us? Extra towels, pillows, etc??) with the same double room request - else roll-a-way if stuck w/king bed - always told - no double rooms available... gotta wait until check in. I get to hotel, PRE-register @ 11:30am... asked for double bed room....nope - none - zip. I asked if I'm stuck w/King - I'll need a roll-a-way. The check-in clerk responded as if he was looking right through me, saying there's a \"convention in town, I'll make sure you'll get a roll-a-way.\" Later @4pm, checked in... asked for double bed room, mentioned the \"wedding party\"...nope, same response, blankly stated \"all double rooms taken....there's a convention in town, etc.... no mention of roll-a-way - so I had to ask AGAIN for the roll-a-way for the King room. Meanwhile, my brother was checking in - who booked his room the night before.... HE GOT A DOUBLE BED ROOM. Peeved, I took my issue to the father of the bride (who was shelling out huge $$ for the wedding at the Blackstone) - who immediately went to the \"stone-faced - scripted \"convention in town\" excuse of a clerk.... Father of Bride discussed issue w/check-in clerk, dropped the \"event planners name\" - and WA-LA - suddenly, they had a double room available. Upon arrival of room.... Father of Bride & me examined room for \"completeness, (it truely had TWO double beds) cleaniness, etc...\" & deemed it acceptiable. Upon use of the room..... we found only ONE skinny bar of soap to be used for sink and shower..... no top sheet on either bed... only down comforter and fitted sheet. I was suspious if they even changed the sheets. VIEW was crap of a view of other hotel room windows, skimpy towels, and they charged $5 per 1 liter bottle water that was placed next to the 1 cup per use coffee maker. How tacky (and tricky). Sure, they had marble bath room counters & floor, marble tops on night stand, a valet dresser, crappy shower head (no water pressure) - big deal. The bed firmness was no better than a moderate priced hotel. No place to put your suitcase (other than the OPEN shelved dresser - which only can hold a overnight size case). The final offense, the (meh) check-in clerk... only activited ONE room card. We discovered the other card was not activated when trying to get into the room..... having to wake the sister who used the \"activated card\" and was already in bed, sound asleep. We pounded on the door to no avail.... finally a maintenance man walked by, asking if we needed help..... he tried the key.... nope.... he walkie - talkies someone - who didn't know what to do.... finally I suggested he use the floor \"house phone\" to contact front desk.... who then called the room - to wake my sister.... who then opened the door. No one offered to send up a \"activated key card\". They had no problem calling the room - waking a \"guest\".

After getting to our room the front desk called and said the credit card had not gone through and we had to come back down. We thought a good time to ask about the water view considering the only place we could see the water was standing at the far window and craning your neck. When we went back down, my friend was not treated very well since they kept acting like her credit card was no good. After 45 minutes they realized it was their computer system, not her card. They then asked for $200 cash deposit, they were doing her favor because it should have been $300 for the 3 nights of stay. Luckily she had that much cash. I thought this entire situation was handled very poorly. First they made her out to look like a person with out credit then they demanded cash. Instead of saying you are already checked in we will deal with the issues when our computers come back up. Less than an hour passed and they called to say the system was up and the card went through and she could come down to get her cash. The clerk realized that it would be nice if he brought the cash up, so he did. Thank you! The room was nice and comfortable. The bathroom was very large and clean, the only problem was the sliding door that most people have commented about. The bed only had a duvet, so this was problem with temperature control. Too hot with cover on but nothing lighter to cover up with so then you would be cold. A sheet would have been nice. I realized most people don't stay in their room at night and play games but we did and we only had a very little table to put between the beds to play on. The hotel was quiet, the halls and the outside noise. We took advantage of the fridge and microwave. The location was fine. We actually enjoyed the walk. The red line L stop is also close to the hotel. Very easy to get to Wrigley.

They said no but then another clerk asked what room we were in. Five minutes later he was at the door with a handful of mints from the club lounge. That is service!

And this trip marked my second time being there. My first time there was incredible, so this second trip needed to measure up...and it did! About the Blackstone: Check-in: I had requested two queen beds, unfortunately they didn't have that available so my friend and I were given a king room instead. It ended up being great! Our room had a stunning view of Grant park, Lake Michigan, some of the downtown buildings and Navy Pier (bonus: we got to see the fireworks that were on Saturday night). Obviously, my friend and I had to share the bed, but it was large enough that it felt as if we had our on beds. Room: PROS- Super clean, large bathroom, comfortable beds, mini fridge (not a bar fridge with things to buy in it, an empty fridge!) CONS- The bathroom door-- it slides, but when someone walks by they can see it. Not private enough. The drawer space was minimal. Parking: EXPENSIVE!!! If you are driving in, there are other parking lots near the hotel (on Balbo) that are about $12 a day...a far cry from $47. Look into it. Staff: The valets and doormen are quite friendly and there is always some there to fetch you a cab. The concierges were o-k. Not as friendly or upbeat, or even as knowledgeable as other ones I have spoken to in Chicago. It was kind of a let down for me. Cleaning staff was very friendly. Location: It depends on what is happening in the city because the location can be amazing or just \"meh.\" I prefer to be closer to Magnificent Mile/North Loop ( which is more central to a lot of things, whereas the Blackstone is South Loop area. But keep in mind that this hotel is super close to Buckingham fountain and a short walk to Millennium Park. Some other things to keep in mind... -We found that there was a lot of commotion on the street- honking and sirens etc. For some that might be annoying, you may want to ask for a room that doesn't face the street...but it didn't bother me- after all Chicago is a busy city, so that kind of noise is expected. -There is a Starbucks connected to the hotel which is quite convenient. - They have computers by the front desk that offer free internet (printers available too).", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jefferson City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely fabulous!\u201d", "Author": "CarlaH301", "ReviewID": "UR81185585", "Content": "Check-in was a breeze.

I paid less than $200 for 1 night's stay and they upgraded me to a suite on the top floor with corner views of Lake Michigan and the Chicago skyline. I was truly floored. I would have to think a room like that normallly goes for $750 a night or maybe more. They had little TVs imbedded into the mirror in the bathroom and a skylight with a remote control retractable shade (for sleeping, which I didn't figure out until the next morning, oh well).

Make sure the airport shuttle knows that you want the one on Michigan Ave. Actually the front door is on Balboa, but the address is Michigan Ave. I spent a week at the Blackstone on a govt rate which is a real deal. It is under $200 and includes free internet in your room and coffee and a pastry at Starbucks each day. One person mentioned the stairs at the front door into the lobby as an obstacle. Two doors away towards Michigan Ave is an entrance that leads to an elevator to the lobby. The same elevator takes you from the lobby to the dining room and down to Starbucks. It is seperate from the elevators to the rooms. So I never had to walk up or down any stairs during my stay. I can only duplicate all the raves about the attractiveness and quality of the rennovations. This is truely first class and beautiful. I agree with the commments about the cheezy Al Capone art gallery and the wierd gift shop. The concierge was great but not always there. She efficiently ordered tickets to Billy Elliot for me and provided excellent directions. Taxis to the Loop and the theater district ran between $6-$8 each way. I was working in the Loop so was there all day and ate lunches there. In the evening I found that the hotel did not have many good restaurants nearby. The one complaint I had was a restaurant recommendation by one of the desk staff that was a cab ride away and really not worth the effort. It was nothing special. (Unfortunately I had left my Zagat books at home and did not know the area.) I did eat lunch in the hotel dining room while waiting for my room to be ready. I had the lunch special----the fig salad was a winner; the steak item I ordered was a real loser. Not what I would expect from an Iron Chef---ALL SHOULD BE GOOD and consistent. The dining room is pleasant, but was noisy which is one of my pet peeves. Waiter was a bit brusk. Have to mention the bathroom as does everyone else here on trip advisor. The walk in shower is great, although I prefer a massage shower head to a rain shower head. The wall paper is interesting--I liked it ---but did not notice the hook near the shower door to hang my robe until I had been there two days.

The room ... large, spacious, well appointed, with that dreamy Marriott-style bed and deep-pile comforter and Egyptian cotton linens. Everything was clean as a whistle. The bathroom was almost as big as the actual room itself. My room faced Grant Park, had a perfect view of the Buckingham Fountain and Lake Michigan. It was magical. I was on a high floor and one night I heard some mild popping noise outside around 9pm. In a few minutes I looked outside and saw the most extraordinary fireworks display over Navy Pier (slightly to the left in my line of sight). It was breathtaking. This is a classic, old-fashioned hotel -- no modern decor, no abstract lighting, no indiscernable images on the walls. I was lured in by the rich woods, gorgeous floors, and ornate chandeliers. Honestly I could live and die here. The restaurant, Mercat, was a little different for a hotel restaurant and bar but exciting and delicious nonetheless. It's tapas-style food and it's done right! Service staff knows their business and knows how to offer warm hospitality. Food was out of this world and reasonably priced. For lunch, they run a special for about $20 where you get 2 courses. Ooh la la. Dinner is a little pricier -- plenty of small plates, actually more than we could eat -- with wine for about $60 per person tax/tip incl. Some of the best food I've enjoyed in a long time.

Plenty of fast food (Subway, KFC, etc.), a local chicken shack that was quite good, are all within 1 block of the hotel. A few blocks further there are more dining options.

As previous travelers have noted, the hotel is beautifully renovated. My room was a good sized, had a very comfortable bed, and I loved the Aveda toiletries.

The challenges for the hotel are the large number of steps just to get into the lobby (good to know if you have a problem with this) and the area. The front desk described it as up and coming. This basically translated into a lack of places near by where you'd want to eat (since there are several colleges, there are a number of college type dining places) and really no shopping nearby (so if you need something at CVS/Walgreens, you'll have a bit of a walk).", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cDoes not work for business travelers\u201d", "Author": "NYCilley02", "ReviewID": "UR63607649", "Content": "The Blackstone is a classic hotel that has been recently renovated and reopened under the management of Marriott. The renovation was extremely well done, and the result is a hotel that is elegant with many quirky design touches. I've given the hotel a relatively low score only because of some downright bizarre service lapses and policies, which could be easily remedied. After having stayed at the hotel on three occasions over the past few months, I've decided that these are just unforgivable. I'll start with the good and then move on to the bad... Rooms are top notch - they are elegantly decorated and are equipped with all modern conveniences. Bathrooms are spacious, covered with white marble, have rain showers, good water pressure and TV's integrated into the mirrors. The climate control works very well (something I wish all hotels paid a bit more attention to). Beds are the standard Renaissance beds, which are excellent (better than Westin Heavenly Beds, in my opinion). They tend to be a bit small, but that is common for older hotels like this. The gym is also excellent. It is large and is well equipped with tons of cardio equipment, free weights and a full set of machines (no fewer than 10). Service is friendly and professional. The staff really couldn't be nicer and more eager to help. My big problem is around the hotel's lack of dining options. It seems that they have outsourced all in-room dining to an unaffiliated on-site restaurant and are thus limited by that restaurant's hours. This means that there is no room service between 11am and 5pm and after 11pm. This means that, if you are a business traveler and you arrive at the hotel after a long day of travel or a late night at the office, there is literally no place to get a bite to eat or a drink after 11pm. Mercat's food is pretty good, which is great if you only eat meals during breakfast and normal dinner hours. Unfortunately most business travelers I know have less predictable and conventional schedules than that, and often have a food craving after 11pm. This is why most hotels of this caliber have 24 hour room service. The lack of room service for 54% of the day would be forgivable if the hotel had minibars, but management seems to have made the bizarre decision to forgo minibars. I've noticed a trend among 4* hotels away from minibars, but most hotels that go that route offer guests 24 hour room service as an alternative. Not this one. Just to recap, this means that, should your flight be delayed and you arrive at the hotel after 11pm absolutely starving, you are just [--] out of luck. (This happened to me during 2 of my 3 stays here). You can get dressed, climb out of bed and start trudging the streets, but there is absolutely nothing in the hotels immediate vicinity. Feel a hankering for a drink after a tough day of meetings? Sorry! You can't even buy a beer at the small shop in the lobby. Blackstone management: this is why most hotels have bars, room service, restaurants and minibars - to serve their guests needs. After 11pm, your hotel has none of those. Nada. I understand that you made the decision to outsource your hotel dining to Mercat, which admittedly has better food than most hotel restaurants. In that case YOU MUST STOCK YOUR GUEST ROOMS WITH SNACKS AND DRINKS. A few other quibbles: - I called down asking for a fork and knife to be brought up and was informed that there is a $12.50 fee for the delivery of \"non-food items.\" What?! I've heard of nickel and diming, but this is truly insane. What are you thinking? - Rooms do not have wine glasses or corkscrews in them. This would be fine if this was your way of gently nudging guests to order room service, but, as I discussed above, your hotel doesn't have that for 54% of the day. - As far as I can tell there are zero benefits for Marriott Platinum members. Most hotels give some sort of room upgrade, but its hard to imagine that my rooms could have been any smaller. Was that just oversight on the part of the check in staff or is that the hotel's official policy? - The lounge is very nice, but keeps extremely limited hours. I don't know exactly what they are, because, during my multiple stays here I only encountered it being open once. It was closed basically at all other times. Maybe this is a cutback because of the recession? - The hotel doesn't seem to have bellmen. (Or if they do, they only staff them during the absolute middle of the day when no business traveler would be arriving or departing). This means that, if you arrive in the evening with a ton of luggage, you get to haul them up the two flights of stairs into the lobby all on your own. Maybe this is also a cutback due to the recession? - Once I forgot to bring toothpaste. Not only did the hotel's housekeeping have none in stock, but they don't even sell basic toiletries in the lobby shop. Since I arrived in the evening, after CVS had closed, I just had to forgo brushing my teeth. This is really not acceptable for a hotel in this category. Basically, in conclusion, I am extremely frustrated by the Blackstone. They have a great physical plant (beautiful old building, exquisitely decorated rooms and public spaces, a top notch gym). Their staff are outstanding. They just need to invest a bit more in their offering of services in order to become a hotel that is at all realistic for business travelers. They are so close, yet so far! Leisure travelers who intend to take their meals outside the hotel, be in bed by 11, and have no Marriott status should be very happy here. (Just don't expect to be able to eat breakfast in the lounge on weekends. Or grab a coke there during just about any other time, since it will be locked.)", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cStellar\u201d", "Author": "Zoezer", "ReviewID": "UR62491200", "Content": "I was at a conference at the Hilton across the street, and couldn't be happier that I chose the Blackstone instead of a big impersonal conference hotel.

First, let me say that I'm a Chicago native and a frequent Marriott patron. The Blackstone is a historical landmark in Chicago and i appreciate the historic French look in the lobby area but the chic style of the rooms. The bellmen, desk service, and housekeeping staff were all very attentive and quick to respond. I was first placed in a room on the 19th floor very close to the elevators - in fact, you could hear the pulleys and occassional bumps immediately. I didn't even unpack, but instead called the front desk who immediately moved me to a different room (Michigan Ave View) and had a bellman bring me a new key. There's a Tapas bar in the hotel that's very good (forget the name but it was rated one of the top tapas bars in the city). I was especially happy with the fitness center b/c the equipment is top notch and ceilings high (a stickler for me since I jump rope as part of my routine). Fitness center also offers warmed towels and 2 water dispensers with sliced lemons. Flat screens and view of Michigan ave also nice touch. The room itself was adequately spacious and well appointed. Bose sound system was great, flat screen TV, and wet bar which I didn't use (automatically charges the minute you remove item), and wireless internet for a fee. The bathroom was also spacious with TV embedded steamless mirror and sliding smoked-glass door. The business center was being remodeled so they had two desktops in a small room off to the side of check-in and Concierge desk. Hotel is on S. Michigan Ave which takes you away from the major crowds - but a brisk walk to N. Michigan Ave. with all the high-end shopping. Cabs are all over the place if you need to get anywhere.

The plan was to do a little sightseeing, shop, and visit Harpo Studios as an audience member =). The hotel is lovely. The building is just breathtaking (though the interior is a bit too modern and does clash). The rooms were a very nice size with a huge marbled bathroom. The bed was comfortable, there is a large flat panel TV, wireless (which is not free and just overpriced), and a Starbucks located right in the hotel (though that staff just did not know what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing so it really was not that much of a bonus) . It really is just a beautiful hotel. Service\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6well, to be very honest the check in staff was a bit uppity. I found the female employees to be rather rude upon check in, so I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like asking them anything. The doormen were incredibly, wonderfully helpful and kind as was the cleaning staff. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure service is fine at the Blackstone, but we were really put off by the tone when we arrived. However, this does not make or break a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay. I think I can put up w/ just about anything as long as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in a clean room w/ a good location. And location is something you need to seriously consider before booking your stay at the Blackstone. I think to get to Harpo Studios the location is fine. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a $12 (tip included) cab ride to the show. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re visiting the Chicago Art Museum or Millennium or Grant Park it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a ten minute walk. To Chicago O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare airport it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good 30 minutes by taxi at $40 (tip included), or 1 hour 20 minutes by metro (only recommend using during the day, have to change lines after first stop) for $2.00. However, if you want to be in the middle of things (and I think we all do!) you should not stay at this hotel. I think that if travelers should stay at the hotels located on the Magnificent Mile, where all the restaurants and shops are. Hotels over there are also a ten minute walk from the parks and museums. The Blackstone, while lovely and comfortable, is just not as conveniently located as other hotels with the same rate or lower. At night, being two women alone in the city, we felt a little more weary in this location. Also, normally on my trips I prefer taking a city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s metro/subway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a great way to save money! On this trip we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that despite the close location of the metro (5 minute walk). Even walking from the metro to our hotel in the day we felt a little unsafe, so we sure weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to take it at night!

I assumed it was a room kitted out for people with a disability/mobility issues (given the size of the bathroom and low hanging hooks and rails) but some things (like having a bathtub) did not make sense. I did not like the low hanging rail in my room as I could not hang anything long up. I also thought the light switches were a pain. Instead of one switch, each light had 2 dials to fiddle with and it wasn't obvious (at least to me) how to control them. I just kept pressing until something happened. The room was also furnished with a low chair/high desk combo. It might look good but I did not find it practical for either eating or working. The only thing not acceptable was the cleanliness of the towels. Everyday I was given new towels and without fail, there was always at least one in the pile that was stained.

The plush, top-notch bedding & linens I've come to expect from the Marriott family were even nicer than usual. However, the king bed in a friend's room wasn't so great - not nearly as comfortable and not up to the Renaissance/Marriott standard. So if you have a choice, go with the queen room. The bathroom was great - Aveda products & good lighting. The TV in the bathroom mirror was amusing, but mostly a gimmick.

My only other complaint about my trip is with the City of Chicago - the sales tax is a little steep at 10%, but at $40+/night, the hotel taxes are an insult to visitors. Traffic management was the worst I've seen for a city of any size - but that's nothing to do with the Blackstone.

Room was exceptionally quiet despite being on the corner of Michigan and Balbo. Our king bed was clean and the mattress was very comfortable. The suede chaise in the room is just perfect to stretch out on and read or watch television. Mini-bar prices were reasonable, room came with 2 spa robes. There is a Starbucks on the lower level with an outdoor seating area where we went on Sat. It was very pleasant to sit there and people watch and enjoy some coffee. We had breakfast on Sun in Mercat. My only quibble is that they need to increase their staffing for weekend morning breakfast service. There were a number of tables occupied and not enough servers. The hostess was doubling as the bartender. The servers were obviously stretched and were not too prompt with additional things like hot sauce, etc. Prices are on the high side, too. We noticed a number of people being seated, checking out the menu, and then getting up and leaving without eating.

On the interior of the rooms they were amazing. The place has obviously had a complete overhaul from top to bottom and the finishing touches show that whoever did the renovation paid very close attention to detail and used all high-end finishes. Everything in the hotel room was better than we could have asked for from the amazingly fluffy beds and pillows to the fully stocked mini fridge, to the flat screen TV, huge desk and the bathroom. The bathroom was impeccable with marble floors and counter tops. We never heard anything through the walls either. The place is built completely solid. The staff was also incredibly helpful.

Overall, we were pleased with the accomodations. The room was quite spacious, the beds were very comfortable and the staff members were helpful. We picked this hotel because it had been recently renovated and they did a wonderful job with it. It's not too big a hotel either which i think is great when you have kids with you. We had breakfast at the Mercat each morning and it was enjoyable and fairly priced. There is 1 thing I did not like. The day we were leaving (August 7th) was the beginning of La La Palooza. Prior to making my reservation, i phoned the hotel to ask whether or not they could accomodate a late check-out on the 7th. I was told it shouldn't be a problem. The day i checked in (August 4th), i was told the same thing although they told me i should let them know the morning of the 7th. So i did. And the response I got was, \"i'm sorry but because of the La La Palooza\" taking place this weekend, we are unable to accomodate your reuqest.\" Well, it's not like the festival came as a surprise. I would have appreciated it if I had been told of this prior to confirming my reservation. If this is an annual event that sells out their rooms, they could have been honest about it from the get-go and told me so. The location of the Blackstone places it right at the center of the festival - i could have picked a hotel more north of Grant Park to have avoided this. So that actually annoyed me that day.

The bathroom was very roomy-although it does not have a tub so if you like a tub this is not the place for you. The lighting was also very nice in the room, almost all lights had dimmers. There were also several mirrors so if someone was in the bathroom you could have an alternate place to get ready. I also liked that there were roman shades which blocked out the light at night. Nice soaps etc. We did not know Lollapalooza was going to be going on so when we saw the lobby filled with teenagers and their parents we were a bit worried we would hear noise all night long but we didn't. The workout room was great. It was very large-3 rooms with just about every weight machine any mid-size gym would have, plus free weights. There were also several nice new treadmills, ellipticles, and a couple of bikes. All had TV's attatched to them which was nice. My one recommendation would be that if you do want a pop or water dont get it from the little gift shop in the hotel it costs $3. Go the the CVS around the corner.

I had booked two rooms for two nights at the Blackstone 6 months ago for Lollapalooza this year, and it turned out to be a very poor choice. When I had tried to book the rooms on the Blackstone's website, it would only let me book rooms described as \"1 King or 2 Queen.\" Because my wife and I were traveling with four teenagers, I called the Blackstone's reservation number to make the reservation instead of doing it on-line so that I could confirm that I would be able to get 2 rooms with 2 beds in each room. Given that I was booking the rooms so early, I was assured by the person taking the reservation that this wouldn't be a problem. However, when we got to the hotel, we were told that there were no \"double queen\" bed rooms available. Obviously, we wouldn't have booked the Blackstone hotel if I had known this would be the case, and we weren't alone in this experience. The couple checking in next to us was told the same thing and had the same problem. The Blackstone clearly knows how many King bedrooms and double Queen bedrooms that it has when it takes reservations. This \"1 King or 2 Queen beds\" option was simply a \"bait and switch\" scam by the Blackstone. Don't be fooled by this like we were. To make matters worse, from the time we checked in, it took 3 calls and 6 hours for the hotel to bring up 2 roll-away beds. And then to cap off our less-than-stellar Blackstone experience, there was urine still in the toilet in one of the rooms that we checked into on Friday. While this didn't ruin our experience, it certainly wasn't pleasant. The Blackstone is a very nicely decorated hotel, and the rooms are very comfortable. From the stand point of the rooms, they were fine. However, at this point, I can't imagine recommending the Blackstone to anyone staying in Chicago. If you want to experience downtown Chicago, stay at the Affinia. My wife and I have stayed there several times, and it is excellent. And if you're coming down to Lollapalooza next year, I'd suggest staying at the Hilton or perhaps even the Travelodge.

The biggest con is the exhorbitant parking rate, but I s'pose that's to be expected in what can be an expensive city to visit. However, I would suggest checking out one of the numerous lots/garages in the vicinity. The hotel charges $47 per night for valet. That rate is also very similar to the garage rate just across the street at the Hilton, which I believe is where The Blackstone valets park guest vehicles. Not sure if there are in-and-out privileges included, but we found a nice, new-ish, secure garage at the corner of 8th and State. Just a block away from the hotel. It's in the same building as the Lou Malnatti's restaurant and the entry is on 8th Street, between Wabash and State. The overnight rate was from $17-20. Can't recall the name of the garage, but there is a digital sign affixed to the outside of the building above the entry that says 24 hour parking.

It's definitely worth reserving a lakeview room; mine was on the 18th room, and the views were spectacular - Lake Michigan with all its sailboats, Grant Park, and a view of the city from Navy Pier to the north all the way down to the Museum Campus and Soldier Field in the south. The room decor was funky modern; the bed was supremely comfortable; and everything worked well, including the flat-screen HDTV with lots of channels. The bathroom was spic and span; lots of fluffy towels were provided, as well as bathrobes. No bathtub, but an excellent, spacious shower. As other reviewers have pointed out, the frosted-glass sliding bathroom door is a problem for those who are sharing a room and want some privacy. As I was staying by myself, it wasn't an issue. The only slight drawback was that the hotel's excellent tapas restaurant, Mercat a la Planxa, was closed for renovations during my stay - would have loved to try it.

We arrived on Friday afternoon. We felt welcome from the moment we arrived. We were greeted by friendly doormen who opened the cab door for us and took our luggage inside. We checked in, went to our room which was on the 7th floor. Snacks and drinks were provided for an extra charge, which we did not use. I noticed coffee and tea but found it strange that sweetner and creamer were not provided. We loved the actual room. Nice big bed, great desk and chair, but I can honestly say the bathroom design/layout was lousy. It reminded me of the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Must be the same architect. You absolutely have no privacy with these bathrooms. Everything is all in one room. The bathroom door just slides over the opening, doesn't shut. Therefore, anybody sitting in the bedroom area can hear everything that is going on in the bathroom. You might as well leave the door open. There was no purpose in it at all. Very odd. The shower was nice and big, but again, no door which is ok except water gets everywhere on the floor. I think the toilet should always be separate from the rest of the bathroom. Never can 2 people get ready at the same time. Would be embarassing if you had a guest visiting with you in your room and then someone used the bathroom. You would hear it all. Poor design, Blackstone. My daughter and I would joke about it and whoever needed to use the bathroom, then the other would wait on the bed and had to turn the TV on to make some distraction noise!!! We were happily surprised by the Blues Fest we came across at Grant Park which was across the street. Location was fine, but noisy for sure. The staff was friendly but not well informed as they should be about directions and restaurants. We asked where we should go for famous Chicago pizza and we were given directions and never found the place. This happened 3 different times. I asked about Italian Beef sandwiches and nobody had a clue as to where to get those (Chicago is famous for them) and on my last day walking around, there was a restaurant within one block of the hotel that had them. I would think they would know this. They told us how to take the bus which was $2.25/each person but did not inform us that for only $5.75 you could purchase a day pass and ride all you wanted to. We learned this the last day as well and wasted money because we were not informed of this. It's a college area and safe and fun.

Upon visiting the front desk, I was told that a rollaway would not fit in the room because of fire codes, that there were no rollaways left, and that there were no other rooms available. Finally, I was given the use of a \"parlor room\"--essentially a meeting room on another floor that had a fold-out couch. I was happy for some accomodation after the broken promise but overall disappointed that we could not have gotten a two-bed room to begin with. The hotel was clean and the rooms were comfortable.

We requested and paid for a lake-view room and sure enough our room faced the lake but - when the room was re-designed the TV was put bang slap in the middle of the window - completely obscuring the wonderful view - even the staff were bemused by this and no, neither the desk nor TV could be moved - both firmly screwed down.

Here is a part of the letter we sent them describing the problems we encountered. Although our flight was delayed in San Francisco, I phoned the Blackstone from the tarmac @ SFO and advised the front desk that we would be arriving on the date reserved, but without the early check-in as previously arranged months ago.They said that would be fine. When our plane touched down @ O'Hare, I called the Blackstone and was put on hold. My call was not picked up, so I called again from the taxi en route to the Blackstone to be told our room had been sold and there was no room of any kind available in the hotel. I requested assisted in seeking a room at a comparable hotel and was told by the front desk manager that this was not possible. Our reservation had been made (as I mentioned) months earlier and comfirmed prior to our departure from San Francisco, We were instructed by the front desk manager to proceed to the downtown Marriott (not the same hotel class as the Renaissance), where a room would be waiting for us...when we arrived at the Marriott, they had never heard of us and weren't very friendly about it. Finally, after much ado, they gave us a room. We were told by the Blackstone that a room would be ready for us at the Blackstone the next morning....it wasn't. After the Marriott staff came to our door and told us we had exceeded check-out time, we took a taxi to the Blackstone (never reimbursed by the Blackstone). They held our lugggage, and we went out to kill time,...... when we returned, a room was finally available. We were told we were given an upgrade. (I don't think it was an upgrade, as the room had no bath tub and looked like the picture of the one we had reserved months ago). When I called after seeing there was no bath tub, we were told no room with a lake view and two beds (and a bathtub), existed in the entire hotel.....it's a 300+ room hotel. There were problems with getting the room cleaned in a timely manner, at one point, I found myself carrying out room service trays (you will find room service to be slow) and trying to straighten out the room before my husband got back from his business meeting in the late afternoon....something I have never had to do previously, regardless of hotel class.

There was a high-definition flat screen TV, a very comfortable bed, and some nice touches including some books about Chicago. The only issue we had was with the bathrooms. Maybe it's picky, but the door to the bathroom is a sliding door and doesn't slide all the way closed.

We were two single gals traveling together and we never felt unsafe anywhere around the hotel (or, anywhere in Chicago). We paid $99/night in mid-April for two queen beds.....what a steal!

So when I check-in, I want good service. Someone to welcome you after a long journey, and give you a decent room upon arrival. I was quite unimpressed with this gentleman's service. We arrived around 3pm (check-in time, per their terms) to find that there were no double queen rooms remaining. Now, I know that when you book via their site, you merely make certain requests and they do their best to accommodate you. But when you check-in on time (neither early or late), and they give you a room on the lowest floor (7th, right above the gym) when you requested high floors and a king bed when you requested two queens.. would you be impressed? All the while emphasizing that we got a $99 rate (as if they could get more in this economy), which is why we could not guarantee the double queens. I just feel that you should charge what you think you deserve for your hotel. For example, if you think you are better than $99, and do not need the boost in traffic from people you consider less than your ideal clientele, then feel free to do so. That way you weed out those you find less than worthy, and you can charge the $400/night you believe your hotel is worth. I just ask you this -- how do you fit 3 people onto one king bed? The 3 people we stated upon reservation, I might add. Anyhow, he did not make a very good effort to make us happy... The next morning, the lady was also unpleasant when I asked to change rooms (since the guy at check-in had said it would not be a problem).. but again, I had difficulty communicating with her (Diana?). I'm not sure what their problem is. But luckily, we were not in the room too much and I finally got over the room situation. Other than that, the staff was really nice. I particularly liked the doormen and the rest of the concierge/front desk was pleasant. They were helpful with restaurant recommendations and transportation options. The room itself was pretty nice. You can tell that it has been recently renovated, with comfortable bed and LG flat screen. The bathroom was fairly spacious, but I will say that you should probably share a room with close family & friends, because the way the sliding door closes leaves little to the imagination. The shower did not really have a door, and was all glass..so again, little to the imagination. This is just in our room - I am certain that there are better rooms. The business center was great.. two computers hooked up with all the internet you will need, and printers as well. This is one of the best features of the hotel, given that they do not provide free wireless. Other fine qualities include the proximity to Grant Park (though if you try to walk to certain attractions such as the Sears Tower or John Hancock, it will be quite a trek). Millennium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago are within walking distance. One downside is the lack of restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel (starbucks closes at 8) so you should probably eat before you go back to the hotel, although room service was not too bad. The selection was decent, and the people were nice :) Other than that, you have to walk to State Street (under the El, and the street not particularly well lit) to feed yourself, particularly later at night. All in all, it was a great value for our money, despite the less than helpful guy at check-in (though we did not encounter him again). I would probably not go back because it's a bit further south than I would have liked, but definitely a beautiful hotel with nice rooms on the museum campus.

Another five star feature of this hotel is their staff--very warm and friendly and courteous. My boyfriend and I decided to walk around the hotel and look at some of its features, like the Art Hall and the ballroom. We found the door to the ballroom locked, but an employee of the hotel was getting off the elevator and saw us trying the door to the ballroom. He asked us if we would like to go in, so he unlocked the door for us, and gave us some time to look at the beautiful room, and told us a little bit about the renovation of the hotel. When we walked back to the lobby, an employee named Arturo asked if we were enjoying our stay. We told him that we had just been walking around, looking at different places in the hotel. He asked us if we had seen the historic Smoke Filled Suite. We said, \"no\", so he offered to take us up there to show it to us. The Smoke Filled Suite is a beautiful suite that has been redecorated to look pretty much like it did in the 1920's. Back in 1920, when members of the Republic party were trying to decide on their presidential candidate, they met in this suite. When they made their decision then opened the door to the waiting press outside, the press was enveloped in a cloud of smoke that came out of the suite. Thus, the phrase \"smoked filled room\" was adopted.

The hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a buffet and room service was way too expensive so we just went over to the Hilton (which is just across the street) and ate a very good buffet breakfast at The Pavilion for half the price ($22 per person).

The hotel was carefully restored and is just stunning. The rooms are bright and airy, with nice finishings and great Lather products in the marble-filled bathroom. The ipod docking station was perfect for my iPhone. The hotel is quiet, a calm oasis in the middle of the city. I loved the leather Eames chair in the room as well.

It was a birthday surprise weekend for my wife. All I can say is she loved it! The Blackstone has been closed for about 8 years. It was due to become condos but the deal fell through and the Marriott Corp. picked up the property. We were somewhat nervous when the hotel wasn't listed in any of the guide books we had. The reason for not being listed is the hotel has only been reopened for about 5 months. There was no reason to be nervous. We checked in early on a Friday morning without any difficulty whatsoever. We were there at about 10:00am, but our room was ready so they allowed us to check right in. We were told by the front desk that we had been upgraded to a lake view room. Our room was on the 14th floor overlooking both Michigan Ave and Balbo. It was a corner room that had it's own entry hallway! On the lake side we had 2 huge windows and a third smaller window. The Balbo side had one huge window. The decor is very modern although the hotel dates back to the early 1900's. The bathrooms are all marble with huge walk-in showers and rainfall shower heads. Again the bathroom fixtures are all very modern styled. The king bed was super comfortable with lots and lots of pillows. Our weekend package included breakfast, so we ate both mornings at the Mercat restaurant. It was very nice but a bit pricey. One floor of the hotel is called the Art Hall. While we were checking out the Art Hall, one of the hotel folks asked if we had seen the ballroom. Of course we hadn't and he opened the doors of Art Hall which put us in the balcony of the ballroom. It was awesome. A brilliant flower patterned rug was the focal point of the room which had just been finished and was going to host their first wedding this coming weekend. The hotel lobby is again a mix of old world hotel with a modern touch. All very cool. The staff was there whenever you needed them and everyone was very eager to please. Our package included Citypasses for the 2 of us. They had run out, so the concierge just told us to go see whatever museums we wanted and save the receipts and they would reimburse us. That worked out very well as we did want to make the most of every minute we had in Chicago, and waiting around for passes wasn't on our itinerary. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is very beautifully restored and the staff is very eager to please.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Round Lake Beach, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Great Surprise for her Birthday!\u201d", "Author": "playmaker16", "ReviewID": "UR19669832", "Content": "I decided on a surprise for my wife in the city. Unfortunately, like many others, family life and children don't always allow us the opportunity for romantic getaways. I searched for the right place and I sure am glad that I found The Blackstone Hotel. Located sweetly on Michigan Ave, across the street from Grant Park. This was ultra convienent because it was also the weekend of the Chicago Jazz Festival. First thing we noticed when we went in was the nostalgic lobby (except of course the Starbucks downstairs). The employees were friendly and courteous and gave us our room on the 18th floor. The Deluxe suite was loaded with modern decor an amenities that were hard not to love (HD flatscreen TV, iHome alarm clock, etc.) The bathroom was spacious with quite a unique (in a good way) shower. The only thing lacking was great water pressure. But probably the most important aspect, the bed, was right on point. Spacious and comfortable king with down comforter and down pillows.

I speak for both my husband and I when I say that we were blown away at the level of service and the quality of the stay over the course of the weekend. Our friends had hired a wedding planner, but the staff at the hotel , especially Flavia, were the ones who really made the wedding day as special as it was. All of the staff were very accomodating and attentive to the bride as well as the groom, going above and beyond making sure that needs were met and that everything was taken care of. The rooms were wonderful, modern touches but very comfortable. The bride had booked the \"Smoking\" suite (one of the rooms with quite a bit of political history) for her over the weekend. We have NEVER seen a room as spectacular as this -the view overlooked Buckingham Fountain, Navy Pier and Lake Michigan, there were 2 bathrooms and the master bathroom has a TV in the mirror and there was a bedroom a sitting room and a combined dining and living room. The crystal ballroom was where the reception was held. The room was amazing and the hotel staff, including a manager, was present during the entire night to make sure that things ran smoothly. We live in Chicago and could have easily gone home, but wanted our time at the Blackstone to be extended as long as possible so we were more than happy to have stayed overnight.
