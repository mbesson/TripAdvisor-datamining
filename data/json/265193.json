But the best thing about our stay was the large pool right next to our room. We could walk out of our little patio right over to the pool and then just down the steps to the beach. The pool was very large and was cleaned everyday. Lots of pool chair and tables. Our room had a large refrigerator, 2 burner stove, microwave and a dinging table for 4. The room was not huge, but comfortable enough for the 3 of us.

You have to have a key to get into the building after 6 pm and a key to the vendor and exercise rooms and outside door to the pool plus a key to get out of pool area to the beach- which is very inconvenient when you are loaded down with stuff to carry. Also on day #2 of our visit there (which was the week after July 4th) for 8 hours there was an alarm check going on and the alarm sounded off every 10 mins for a FULL 8 hours (no nap for the kids that day!) and on day #3 they had to shut off all the water for pipe work for over 4 hours! They should have shut down the hotel for a day or two for this type maintenance in my opinion. There is no front desk and no attendant to ask any help from. As for the beach, there are cars allowed to park on the beach and this is definitely NOT a kid friendly beach.

Its our understanding that about half of this resort is owned by Westgate and the other half is privately owned. We like to stop in Daytona Beach on our annual visit to Orlando, and decided to rent a couple of nights at the Harbour Beach Resort through Westgate at the onwer rate. We were pleasantly suprised with our stay and think this resort has excellent potential. Our family travels to Florida 2-3 times per year and Daytona Beach is one of our favorite spots to stop for a few days of beach time. We have stayed at numerous beach front hotels in this area, and truthfully there are only a handful that we would revisit. This is one of the resorts we would probably consider returning to. The location is great, facility is pretty good and the price was right. The things we liked: The rooms are set up very nicely. You walk into the \"master bedroom\" which has a bathroom of its own. Having two bathrooms in a room that sleeps 4 is fabulous whether you are traveling with kids, teenagers or adult friends. There is a kitchen in between the master bedroom and a \"living room\" with a sofa sleeper. Its a nice set up because there is living space during the day when the couch is folded up. The kitchen is a bit bigger than a kitchenette and a tad smaller than a full kitchen. It does have everything you need in a kitchen though. A full refrigerator, stove, oven, microwave, coffee maker, and is well stocked with utensils. There is a small table for dining as well. Its a bit of an older building, but it was pretty well taken care of. Its not the facility that a timeshare owner may be used to, but overall was a pleasant surprise. Things we were less than excited about: The view from the balcony is as good as any other ocen front hotel; however there is no privacy whatsoever on the balcony. When you walk out of the room you are literally sitting next to the neighbor and can probably tell what they had for breakfast. Some lattice between the rooms would probably make it just private enough to be cozy. There isa very obvious effort towards security of the facility by resort management. Each room is issued two keys for use of facilities; which you must protect with your life or pay a $35 replacement fee if one is lost. The entrance to and from the lobby to the pool area, the lobby bathrooms, the excercise and game room, and entrance from the beach to the pool area are all locked and a key is needed for access. We had two rooms for our stay with 4 people in one room and 3 in the other. Trying to juggle the facility keys was a complete inconvenience. If Westgate/Harbour remain committed to securing the facility in this way they may want to consider swipe card access for the facility use keys as well. That way they can issue unlimited card keys to their guests. Just a suggestion. Another annoyance was the parking. Management was clearly having difficulty with non guest parking. They were constantly issuing warnings to guests about properly displaying their parking pass or they would be towed. I know I went to my car several times just to make sure the parking pass hadn't blown out or fell on the floor. Despite all of their efforts, we came back one evening after a trip to the airport for one of our party members, and there was not a parking place left in the resort. I had to park next door and risk being towed. Parking is a problem everywhere on the beach though and not just Harbour Beach Resort. I would suggest that they get some actual parking passes that hang from a mirror rather than a piece of paper that sits in the dash. I know it would have saved me a few trips to the car to double check. Overall, this is a hotel we will probably try again. The area is close enough to walk to the boardwalk. The rooms are set up perfect for an extended stay at the beach- better than a simple hotel room. The staff was friendly and the room was secure. The shape of the facility is not impeccable, but pretty good for beach front property that usually gets the wear and tear of the Ocean air. Pleasantly suprised is a good definition of our impression of this resort. We think it has great potential and we are interested to see if Westgate has any future plans for this resort.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Legau, Bayern", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place to stay - not only for Bike Week\u201d", "Author": "HeidiLegau", "ReviewID": "UR127640497", "Content": "We stayed at the Harbour Beach Resort (the best little Condo's) in Unit 416.

For us, we traded some timeshare points to get closer to Main St without breaking the bank and this certainly fit that bill. All the rooms look mostly the same - front faces Atlantic Ave and the rear has a balcony facing the ocean. Rooms are narrow and the bedroom part was closest to the street. On Bike Week that means lots of louder MC's but for us that was ok. For others that may be a problem. There is a bar but no restaurant. Front door is unmanned and closes at 5-6PM - you will need the pool key to access the building. I have stayed at other Westgate locations and this is the low end of their offerings.

Water does not drain properly, so as you shower, you'll see dirty, yucky, blackish stuff comes back from the drain. Very disgusting. 2. No remote control in the room, the owner would not tell you until you were in the room and call her and ask where the remote is, she would tell you the previous guest accidentally took it away. TV only has few antenna channels (with poor reception). 3. The room smells like somebody has been smoking in there for a long time. 4. We did not use their towels until our last day, coming home; both my son and I get rashes on our body from using their towels. 5. There is no air condition in the hallway and the room is adjacent to the trash dumpster, so it always smells bad. 6. During booking, when asked about internet connection, the owner told us sometimes there may not be good reception. But during our stay, we tried many time, we were not able to connect to the internet even once. Overall, the place is filthy and unhygienic, After called the owner and reported the problems, she acts like all are new to her and showed no intention to correct the issues. It is shocking a room in such a filthy condition is still not pulled out of the market. Please do not rent the place for your health and your loved ones\u2019.

All rooms face the ocean and mornings were expecially nice watching the sun come up over the ocean while enjoying breakfast or a cup of coffee. The bathrooms were well stocked with toilet paper, kleenex, towels, face cloths, beach towels and hair dryer. The kitchen had a supply of dishsoap, dishwsher soap and paper towels.

While the exterior appearance of the resort was disappointing, the interior parts that I saw were not bad at all! The staff was very friendly and helpful. I did see on a bulletin board a memo from the Condo Owners Association to the condo owners at the resort that there was going to be an exterior rennovation of the resort, and they are in the process of voting for various rennovations. There were constantly people there doing some type of work on the resort, but it did not seem to interfere with the guests' enjoyment of the resort. We were in room 103 and it was spacious, clean and was located on the first floor right by the pool. I did see a few pigeons, but never saw evidence of any pigeon droppings around the pool area or on any of the first floor patios. The furniture in the living room area was comfortable and clean. The bed was huge! The pool area was beautiful and clean. There was a nice hot tub and plenty of beach chairs and tables. The pool hours were from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m., which was a little frustrating when we tried to sleep in a couple of days after being up late. On the other side of the pool was the beach, which was beautiful, clean and not really very crowded. My only complaints about the room were that the television in the bedroom did not work, the kitchen light was burnt out upon arrival and one of the slats from the vertical blinds in the bedroom kept falling, leaving a small gap, making it necessary for me to change clothes in the bathroom or the living room. These are minor complaints and would not deter me from recommending the resort or returning myself. Maintenance did fix the kitchen light but advised us that the television was broken and that new tvs were on order. Fortunately the television in the living room worked so we weren't totally without tv the entire trip and were able to keep track of the storms at sea, which never caused us one day's worth of bad weather. There were two bathrooms - a small bathroom with a stand-up shower in the bedroom, and a bathroom off of the living room with a jacuzzi tub. I saw no mold in either bathroom and both were very clean.

This property wasn't quite what I expected. Because this property is not entirely a Westgate property, upon arrival you have to find the manager in a small room off to the side (because most units are condo units owned independently, there is no front desk or receptionist to help you). Frequently, there is simply a sign on this door \"Out to Lunch---back at 1PM\" or \"Back in 10 minutes\". One guest standing at the door had been waiting for over half an hour for the 10 minute sign. There is just one person on duty at a time. The manager, the person who cleaned our room and maintenance man were all very nice. I must add, however, the TV did not work properly (sometimes not at all) and I called or stopped down to the office every day, but in the almost two weeks we were there, we never got the new TV they promised. There is no maid service, no fresh towels/sheets everyday and no washer/dryer in the room. We had to go down a floor to access the one washer/two dryers available and they are not free. There is a towel/sheet exchange on Wed morning so we shlepped everything down to the 1st floor to get some fresh ones. On Saturday, our room was cleaned and we got fresh towels. We had planned on having 2 relatives stop over for dinner one night, but after we arrived to find the size of the room, we decided to go out to dinner. Tiny, tiny, tiny kitchen: there was not enough seating for 4 people (only a small table for 2 attached to the wall). There was a stove/oven, fridge, microwave and dish washer. We guessed in a former life these units were small hotel rooms. The bathroom was nice--looked like relatively new tile work; however, the shower leaked and dripped all night long. Really nice water pressure in the shower. But no place to hang up your towels---no towel rack at all. There was a tiny hook on the back of the bathroom door, but so small everything fell off it. They REALLY need to do something about that.

The temperature is kept very cool (we wished it was a lot warmer) and there is a nice jacuzzi. Both are kept in tip-top shape. It is unfortunate that this 8 story building casts it's shadow over the pool; all the guests by the afternoon are crowded into one small area that still has sun. The front sliding glass doors at the entrance lock from 6PM to 7AM with good reason. Twice when unlocking these doors, someone appeared from parking lot and snuck in behind me as I opened the doors. There were unsavory characters in the area and many police cars were noted. I enjoy walking the beach in early morning/after dinner and was very uncomfortable walking alone here. I only walked down the street once (as opposed to taking the beach) down to the Pier; I didn't want to walk that alone even with my pepper spray (thankfully I inadvertently left it in my purse when packing).

Ladies, if you walk through the lobby on the way to the pool, please cover up b/c the employees WILL stare I promise. Speaking of the lazy employees (Im not positive they were even employees because they never DID anything), they were always sitting out front smoking and laughing (almost certainly at you) and one guy asked in reference to my husbands truck which has Nascar decals on it \"Hey, buddy, do you work for Nascar?\" all my husband could think to say was \"No, they just let me drive the truck.\" (We could not believe he had nothing better to do! Go clean something!) Please! If you go to Daytona, DO NOT waste your money at this place. Save up if you must and get a nice hotel that has a chain name. The HOJO up the street is nice (Stayed there too) and I'm sure the Holiday Inn must be better than this. Oh yeah, there was a group of kids who mysteriously appeared from nowhere (no luggage, etc) and used the pool, beach and most of the lounge chairs all day long on a SATURDAY, had a ground floor room with direct access to the pool from the sliding glass door (which Im sure may have been a nicer room than the dump they put us in!). I noticed on the \"Dad\" of the group's shirt that he was an employee at the resort and was outraged that he would take up what might have a slight chance at being a nicer room for his kid to have a party!

The location is great and the pool and pool deck is one of the largest on the beach. Most units face the ocean and a Denny's restaurant is located off the lobby, which I find very convenient.

The biggest problem was no maid service. We had the oppurtunity to receive clean towles and other necessary supply replacement only once per week. If you dirtied all towles before that time you could wash them in a provided laundry room out of your pocket. If you ran out of other supplies you had to go to the Westgate office to get more (the office is only open 8-5). The floor in our room was filthy and dresser drawers broken. The oven didn't heat properly and we found a cockroach in our shower. Our air conditioner didn't work most of the time. We spoke to the manager of Westgate but our air was never fixed.

Of course with the cancelatin policy that they have you are stuck with the reservation that you have made. Never mind that they were not up front and honest.
