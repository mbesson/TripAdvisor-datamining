The good: - Location: not to far from the airport, shopping malls, Old Town (gold, spice and textile souks) the walk to the metro station isn't too bad either, though due to the extreme heat, I would advise you to just get taxi everywhere, as it is relatively cheap to get to most places in Dubai from this hotel. - Staff: the staff really are what make this hotel. Especially Florentina from Housekeeping and Eme in Guest Relations, both really looked after us during our stay. Also on our day at the hotel, we had a very late flight and had been on a jeep safari excursion. We had already checked out, but the reception staff allowed us to use the gym facilities to have a shower and freshen up, which was well needed after being in the hot, dusty desert all evening. - Restaurants: There are a few restaurants, bars and cafes in the hotel. Elia the Greek restaurant does delicious food. Tirquaz does a good breakfast buffet, while I found there were a few items repeated such as juice, tea, toast, omelettes and pancakes, other items on the breakfast menu did vary from day to day. Also worth taking a trip to Kanto the Filipino bar, they do karaoke there some nights and that was a lot of fun. The Lavazza cafe is a good place to chill for a bit though nothing to shout about. These restaurants are also where you will be able to use the hotel's wifi connection. The not so good: Rooms: while comfortable, you can see they are a bit worn and could do with redecorating/refurnishing. Though they do have modern flat screen TV\u2019s and a few English channels to watch. You only get two complimentary bottles of water on your first night, after that you have to buy them from the expensive minibar, so I would advise taking a visit to the local supermarket and stocking up. Also, our room wasn't vacuumed properly on arrival (check next to the beds, and behind chairs and curtains). We had to call housekeeping to rectify this, which I must say they did very quickly and after this there wasn't a problem with the cleaning throughout the rest of our stay. Internet: There is NO wifi connection in the rooms, only in the communal areas (restaurant, lobby etc). If you want internet in your room you have to connect via a lead and it's quite pricey. For a hotel that advertises itself as 4* with 5* service, surely wifi connection in all rooms would be standard? I've been able to get wifi in my room at much cheaper budget chain hotels. Elevators: there are only 2 lifts that service the entire hotel. There is always quite a wait for the lifts, but I suppose this is to be expected as it's such a tall building. Overall it is a decent hotel and a good base to explore Dubai from. I would recommend staying there, however make sure you don't pay over the odds if you do.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delhi", "Title": "\u201cON VARIOUS PARAMETERS\u201d", "Author": "aaloknigam", "ReviewID": "UR119074112", "Content": "Excellent on Cleanliness and Orderliness;Staff is friendly;Breakfast included in Tariff and is good;We stayed for 4 nights and had a variety of food;Lobby is small if you have to wait;sofa's are not too clean-my wife noticed that;have to take Taxi for even going to Metro Station;better buy Bottled Water from outside (too expensive in Hotel) as after complimentary 2 Bottles are finished they are not replenished. the major issue I had was with the DEPOSIT of AED 800 which was insisted upon on check-in even though our Full Stay was paid for in advance;the Check-in Manager (James) was arrogant and his body language was as if we were \"THIEF'S\" It was if you don't deposit you cannot check in.I even offered to deposit equivalent Dollars or British Pounds in Cash and would take it back on Check Out.I was very curtly told that Dollars would be converted into Dirhams @ 3.38 as against 3.61 at Airport or 3.65 at Money Changer( the official rate is 3.67);No option and I was given impression that the matter could be settled by giving my Credit Card as guarantee;I thought that it is like only a Guarantee as it has happened in many Hotels else in USA (they do not ask for guarantee if booked thru Agent in Singapore or Malaysia traveled recently).Next when I come back and see my emails I come to know that I have a debit of AED 800 along with Foreign Exchange Transaction charge.On writing to Hotel it was reversed but I again lost money as Hotel now exchanges it at 3.67 (the official rate)so they buy at 3.38 and sell at 3.67.Imagine how many guests fleeced this way every day and each guest looses even US$ 20 what an amount.the Hotel.

We spent early evenings at some Iconic landmarks at it was a breeze to travel from the Hotel to our destination, the location was indeed very strategic! The food was great too! I eat healthy. I am glad thay are pro-healthy foods! Lastly, as we are so engrossed with all our escapades, we hurriedly checked out on the last day. Whilst in the plane, while rummaging through my stuffs, I thought I have lost my DIGITAL CAMERA - MY MEMORIES OF DUBAI. Then I remembered I have placed it on my bed while collecting my hand carry. I immediately notified the hotel's info address and have informed of my item. The Management have responded immediately and have gone the extra mile in order for me to get my Camera back! I sooooo, appreciate their effort. In a week's time, I have received my VALUABLE CAMERA via courier - though they charge me collect for the courier cost, I sooooooo dont mind, I had my MEMORIES BACK!!!!! I hope, through this message, I would be able to sincerely express how much I appreciate their efforts. KUDOS to the entire Management and Staff of the Majestic Hotel! I will definetely come back to experience a Majestic Service soon!", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cThe Service is the Key\u201d", "Author": "nicolo1209", "ReviewID": "UR113442317", "Content": "The hotel is situated on the district very strategic to the shopping places and the airport.

They also have a buffet breakfast which has a wide selection however not attractive for someone who is not a fan of pork-less dishes. But what made the stay memorable is the service of the people. The reception was not as friendly to guests as they were cranky at times, but the service in the restaurant is heart-warming. Waiters and waitresses smile to you all the time and attend to your every concern. During my stay, the hotel elevator broke down. Since my room was on the 14th floor, I had to endure traveling the stairs which, in retrospect, were a claustro-nightmare in the event that there was a fire in the building. The stairs were very narrow and I felt that it might be hazardous to people who would be using this as an emergency exit. It is very accessible to some of the supermarkets, money changers, coffee shops, fastfood outlets and clothes market (5 minutes on foot).

Arriving at the hotel (via a \u00a311 airport transfer fee), which is half that in a taxi. I was Impressed with the hotel, the check in and initially the room, which was spacious with what seemed like a massive bed (two singles together) a brilliant balcony and a bathroom which contained a bath which was the biggest i had ever seen. However, the balcony had no furniture in it so we had to move the chairs out there, which where moved back in to our room as soon as we turned our backs!. The bath! well we discovered that it was fed with hot water from a tank 1/4 the size of it! therefore it took about two hours to fill, with about ten kettle loads of hot water added aswell. (the kettle had to be put on the floor as the cable was too short to reach the socket) I had to leave a note for houskeeping to get my tea/coffee replenished daily Do not attempt to use the inroom internet connection as it is extremely slow and very expensive, however the WIFI is good in all public areas in the hotel we ordered room service which was adequate but nothing special. The food in Barrels bar was not much better. we ordered what was descibed as 'irish pork sausages' and turned out to be german frankfurters fried!!! gross! the chicken caeser salad was dressed in what tasted like the deep fat frier residue and the cans of coke came in at \u00a34 a can!! Breakfast was OK but if the hotel is full be prepared for a battle for tables and also dodging other guests whilst carrying your french toast in one hand, you fruit juice in the other and your tea/coffee on your head. If you leave your table it gets cleared so carrying all your supplies is standard. The swimming pool is a waste of time. don't plan on lazing by the pool all day as you spend the first 2 hours 'chasing the sun' around the patio!, as the building next door casts a huge shadow before you go inside defeated. The lift; again if the hotel is busy you will have a wait, two small vehicles ferry guests from the ground to the 27th floor! it became so bad we had to use the stairs a few times(we were on the 14th floor!) we stayed new years eve and attended the party by the pool! The main barman was rude and ignorant and charged my fiancee 4 times for a glass of wine than what the other staff charged. then ignored our arguments.

Regards the location it is not the best it is surrounded by Indian and Pakistani people no arabic people at all and lets just say it could be a cleaner area. It is around a 20 minute walk to the creek area where you can get a traditional water taxi which is a small wooden boat across the water to the gold and spice markets. There were call girls on the street outside the hotel at the weekend but these never caused us any bother and never approached us. There is a large super market 5 mins walk down the road that is very very good like a Asda style super market and its open 24hrs, there are also a few different shopping centres a few minutes walk away with some very good and cheap food courts in them with everything fron KFC, McDonalds and lots of little indian, chinese and pizza restaurants we used these quite a lot and had some fantastic cheap food. The rooms were very clean and spacious for the money BUT the main problem was the air conditioning system was very very noisey it sounded like every so often someone was emptying a bucket of water with ice cubes in it which would wake us up. The lifts were not the best only 2 lifts for all 24 floors and they got very busy at breakfast and other busy times of the day. The pool area was very nice and never got crowded so there was always a sunbed available. the room service was very quick and the prices very good and the food was a very good standard and plenty of it. There is a free shuttle bus to various shopping malls, beaches and other points of interest every day which leaves the hotel at 10am and picks you back up at 2pm, but taxis are very cheap and the metro line which is a 20 minute walk from the hotel was very good value it cost us around \u00a32 each to go 1st class (gold class) and that was to the furthest point around 20 miles away to dubai marina. Overall my opinion is that the hotel is good value and very clean but the area it is in is not the best but its very easy and cheap to get a taxi to where you want to go so why pay silly money for a better location when you can stop here for a lot less, would i return yes i would but i would also check out a better location just in case there were any simular priced hotels in a better place.

We arrived at 2am and the staff we were welcomming and helpful. Our room was situated on the 12th floor, with excellent views looking west over Dubai. Facilities within the room were what you would expect from a 4 star brand, but were nothing special (no flat screen tv, for example). That being said, other facilities within the hotel were excellent and excelled above its star listing (pool, gym and various restaurants and bars). We were particularly fond of the Greek restaurant 'Elia', and were pleased to celebrate its 2nd birthday. The 'Music Room' was lively and the karokee bar was an added benefit! My only criticism was the deficiency of lifts within the hotel. By design, 2 lifts serving 24 storeys can only be described as deficient.

The breakfast at Tirquaz had everything you wanted. We tried Elia - the greek restaurant for dinner and the service was absolutely mind-blowing. The service by the girl's (don't remember thier names), was simply outstanding. The food and it's presentation excellent and very peaceful ambiance. I think the management under-rates this restaurant and it should advertise a bit about this restaurant in Dubai. - The only place which was a bit slack in its service was at the pool.

Plenty of other hotels nearby, if you fancy something different to eating in the majestic, although the food there was great. Breakfast choice was amazing, and we never once ate lunch as we were still to full after breakfast. The hotel does a bus to a different place each day, either a mall or beach. We got the bus to Mall of the Emirates and then took a taxi to Wild Wadi. We didn't get the hotel bus home, as it returns at 1pm, but the return taxi from the Mall of the Emirates to the Majestic was only 37AED - and that's for a 30 minute/20KM journey! Only two negatives: the pick up at the airport didn't turn up, but to be honest it's as easy to just jump in a taxi.

The hotel is very clean, rooms are adequately equipped, beds are comfortable and the staff are very helpful and friendly. We emailed ahead and asked for the hotel to supply us with a transfer from the airport. This was good value and cheaper than getting a taxi-as we found out on the way back! There is a pool, but due to the height of the surrounding buildings it is quite shaded with only a small area getting any sun at any one time. Not conducive to a good sun tanning session. A nice pool however, although a little lacking in sun beds. Check in was straight forward and we were able to get into our room at 12.00 midday. The first morning we were there we went to breakfast at around 10am. We were unable to get a seat/table as it was packed. There was no queuing system and we ended up going without even though it was included in our room rate. The second morning we got up earlier and were able to get a table. Breakfast was a good selection of all the usual items on a self service buffet. The hotel itself is 10/15 minutes drive from the airport. It takes about 30 minutes to get to the beach and the only transport option is a taxi. This cost between 50-70 UAE dirhams each way. There is a hotel shuttle once per day to the beach or other areas of interest - it leaves the hotel at 10am and returns at 1.00pm and only goes to one place per day. Jumeirah Beach Park is a good option, nice beach and clear sea. Very clean and nicely landscaped park area. Wafi Pyramids are in fairly close proximity to the hotel (you'll need a taxi though) and a really good option for a few restaurant choices. Try Asha's-well worth a visit.

The lobby is always active, if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke you may have an issue-many europeans stay there and smoke in the lobby...so beware. You will usually wait for an elevator, there are only two for 24 floors. Get the breakfast option, it is buffet style and very nice-enough choices that it won't become rutine over a few days. The pub in the lobby has four computers that allow you to acess the internet for email-sometimes they will ask you to buy a drink to use during busy times. Bellmen are very good, they hustle for you, and are grateful for a couple of dhs tip. By far the worst of this hotel are the front desk staff. My first stay at this hotel I waited over two hours for a room, they claimed none were clean and kept promising \"ready in 30 mins.\" My second stay I was assigned a smoking room even though I require a non-smoking, and after one night I was given a better room (nice) but it had a thermostat that was stuck on full cold and you could hear water running from the floors above occasionally.

We booked the Majestic mainly because of the location in the city and the price was excellent for what we could see from the photos. We booked a deluxe room for an extra few euros per night and it was worth it. Apart from our flight being delayed and the ordered pick up not being there to collect us when we arrived we thoroughly enjoyed our 3 day stay. We had an early check in (6am ) which was accomodated with a smile, all the staff were extremely friendly and our room (on the 22 floor) had fab views over the city and was really very comfortable, spacious and the bath tub was huge (although not a jacuzzi unfortunately) The pool was small but not cold as previously reviewed, and during the hottest hours it was partly shaded by the tall building beside the hotel. The breakfast buffet was great and the menu changed every day to allow for something slightly different. The evening buffet was quite good too, but nothing out of the ordinary, The pub did not serve alcohol until after 7pm (as was Ramadan) but was thronged with people enjoying the cricket matches and staff catered for everyone as there were tvs for those who prefered to watch the footie instead. I had a massage (or two) at the salon which was needed and very reasonably priced and the husband treated himself to a good cut-throat shave. The best thing though was that a copy of Time Out Dubai was placed beside the bed informing us of other places to go and eat out during Ramadan... which we did - on our savings at this 4 star during the holy period we treated ourselves to an evening of dinner and drinks at the 7 star Burj Al Arab !! (and that was also heavily discounted during Ramadan) We also took advantage of the free shuttle buses to the beach from the hotel - as it was Ramadan (sounding like a broken record I know but..) we practically had the beach to ourselves. We would definitely stay at the majestic again but only at the price we got it for .... 3 nights for the price of one outside of... yup...
