My problem with this hotel is that the hotel management is clearly catering to certain groups of old age Canadian retirees ,therefore I had the overall feeling that we are not staying at a hotel, but that we are staying complementary at an old age home. We felt somewhat exluded and generally not being paid much attention to, unlike their permanent Canadian old age contingent-unacceptable, considering that we are all paying the same price! I would highly recommend the Management to pay more attention to their \"solo traveller\" guests, because at the end of the day we all give the hotel the same business so there should not be any separation of the guest categories.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWill come back and stay again!!\u201d", "Author": "Sweetshorty1465", "ReviewID": "UR138560502", "Content": "We are a family of 5.

Our balcony had a great view and we watched the sun rise and sun set right from our room. Breakfast was great, I think the muffins were home-made.

When my son, pulled out the sofa bed, the linens were used and full of cookie crumbs. To their credit, a staff member came up immediately and changed the linens. The rest of the room, the common areas and the pool area were very clean. -The inn claims to be recently renovated, but the d\u00e9cor in our room was very dated.
