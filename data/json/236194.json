For some reason, this weekend it was extremely hard to find ANY hotel room in Barcelona, so the Catalonia Park Guell had to suffice. The hotel just looks old and tired, with everything reminding me of the late 80\u2019ies or early 90\u2019ies. Definitely not my first choice of d\u00e9cor. The rooms look cheap and overused, definitely not cozy and inviting. Even though everything was clean, it just doesn\u2019t feel nice. Internet connection (free) was slow and erratic. Breakfast was not included (it costs \u20ac13) and if you want to use the safety box, you will be charged 5\u20ac. No comment. But the worst was the noise. The rooms are very poorly isolated and you can hear every step and conversation in the hallway, every car driving by in the street, and even the running water in the room next door! It\u2019s a shame actually, because the staff is very friendly and professional, and everything was smooth from check-in to checkout. Service is the only reason I rated this hotel 'poor' and not 'terrible'. I probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered writing a review at all, but at \u20ac180 for one night, I just feel this was a total rip off.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBasic hotel -- great pool rooftop\u201d", "Author": "BeautifulnRyan", "ReviewID": "UR126469581", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here as part of the travel package to Spain. The hotel itself was fine \u2013 we had a great view of the hill and it was basic and clean; that plus free wifi was all we needed. The staff was very nice and helpful. The breakfast was fine \u2013 nothing special, but it was also a buffet so you can\u2019t really expect too much anyways. The metro was close and it was a quick ride to the city (it was also about 7 to 10 euros for a cab ride back from Las Ramblas). The only issue we had was the noise -- the walls are very thin, but for the most part, everyone was pretty considerate on their noise level except the first night, which had to have been the last night of a school group. Our favorite part of the entire hotel was the rooftop pool at the 6th floor. It was March and still cold (even though it was unseasonably warm, it was not warm enough), but I wanted to see the pool anyways. We got up there and were amazed on how nice it was (and shocking compared to our room). We ended up spending two hours relaxing with a glass of wine (and him \u2013 a cigar) and watching the sunset and the view. It was a perfect ending to our trip! FYI \u2013 using the metro: When you arrive to the Vallcarca exit, go to the doors to the right and take the long escalator up. When you get to the top, look behind you and you will see a bridge. You need to head towards that, turn right onto it, and go along that bridge until you reach a small traffic circle. You will see a sign that says Mare de Deu del Coll pointing up and you will follow up that one more block up to the hotel. My husband and I made the mistake of going to the shorter set of stairs and went a long backwards way through the neighborhood when we arrived.

Especially for people that do not plan to spend their time in Barcelona staying at the hotel. The service: The staff was really friendly, but only the receptionists had English. The personnel in the breakfast place was speaking only Spanish, sometimes typically loud. I stayed for 6 nights, on the 3rd the fire alarm killed everyone's sleep in 5 am. I had my all luggage ready with me down into the lobby just for 3 minutes, but I was the only one. Most of the people were dressed with their sleep clothes, without luggage, using the lift, not the stairway. The reason for the alarm was the kitchen where the cook had done some smoke, so no real fire. If it was for real I guess the slowness of the people's reaction would have lead to many victims. I am not sure though that the staff could make something about people's reaction. The receptionist were helpful with tourist hints, there were a lot of maps and flyers into the lobby. The room: Not large space, but enough for people that are outside most of the time. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean too, although I could recommend a little renovation there. There was a little table where I put my laptop. There was free WiFi, but the signal was weak into the room (and good at the lobby). The air conditioner was a little bit noisy and old, but still efficient. The breakfast: Really tasty and variable food, a good choice of juices. The location: Well, the center of the city is far, but there is the Vallcarca station of the Underground's Green Line at 5 minutes walking. In Fridays it is working till 2 am and in Saturdays the service is non-stop, so the travelers that prefer spending for food, museums and activities could use it. Being distant from the heart of the city, the hotel is about half kilometer away from the impressive Park Guel. The whole area looked calm and safe (typically residential one), but be aware of the traffic on the hotel's street and the habit of Catalonia's citizens to leave their dogs' dirt on the sidewalks! Construction works made some noise in the mornings, but I do have a good sleep. The amenities: I mentioned already the WiFi and the air conditioner, there was satellite TV, but the parking was not free. As a resume, I was satisfied from the hotel because I received a good service for the price I had paid.

Kovac, General manager/Project leader Evaluation day: 134 Subject: 31/13 Europe Our rating: 8,70 Verbal evaluation 1. Location Location is easy reachable. Parking however seems a bit difficult. If you will arrive by taxi which we suggest it will be the easier way. We could reach hotel also by metro, however, prepare for a bit of physical performance. Make no mistake; this walk to the hotel will not take more than 10 minutes and its pretty nice walk. Hotel is reachable. Our points for the location and all mentioned above are: 2. Reception Reception is placed in the easy reach of from the door. Personal was very helpful, kind and smiling. I have to say, that after our travel this was one of the best receptions. Information we requested were answered with friendliness, customer concern and care. I have also give credit for the professional approach to the day shift with no difference. 3. Hotel\u2019s hall and others Generally hotel\u2019s hall to the way to the elevators was clean, taking care of. Atmosphere was as expected in the hotel of this category. There is possibility to use internet and PC terminal. We did find also board with touristic suggestions. 4. Elevator Elevator is small, but under circumstance is adequate to the category of the hotel 5. Room I have to say we were pleasantly surprised. Room was spacious and clean. Bathroom was clean and nice. Room had a sufficient balcony, which came as complete surprise and was a big satisfactory. Surroundings were not noisy. Furniture was a bit out of date, but that is not major problem. However, the TV should have some possibilities of reach more international channels. A/C was however not sufficient at all and was very out of date. Plugs were very reachable. Room had telephone which was working with all expectations. The rest of equipment was present as bathroom amenities etc. We consider the storage space very helpful. 6. Room service Room service was very efficient and for its category very helpful and also informative and with no disturbance present. Cleaning was satisfaction and in case of not disturb sign, which is as we had experienced not considered in many of the today\u2019s hotels, was handled with not just no disturbance but feedback from room service was very informative. 7. Lobby bar x Kitchen Lobby bar personal was very helpful and professional too. The environment was nice and good design touch. As we experienced kitchen food was tasty and its appearance satisfaction. We do have one remark thou, there was one staff which was helpful, but did not answer all the time on simple things like thank you etc. It seems that it depends which leg he get up in the morning. Mood is not good guide. However, although those troubles we got used to it, not because it was not present, but because in general even this person was helpful. We do think that even he did not smile a lot, or his customer care understanding is not that good at least with us, his behavior toward other people was very correct and even towards us he was professional all the time. Also, if you are to offer one day bread while customer wait for food with butter, you can not offer the same thing without butter and other day again with butter and so on. It is confusing GENERAL COMMENTS This hotel is satisfaction and I have to say that so far from the same company it is the best we\u2019ve been to. I have feeling that I would be not shame to recommend and I would return. There is some space for making some steps to be better, however it will be always. I do miss corporate thinking. I would recommend also to place hotels souvenirs shop, with coffee mug with company logo, papers etc. which we can provide very cheap with our sources in Asia and it would be very nice for the hotels catalunya as corporate marketing. I would place this sign in the lobby. Internet is available and functional.

Please can someone offer me a chiropractor now as i have such back pain from sleeping in the most noisy uncomfortable broken bed for a week. I booked into the hotel thinking it looked close to town and from the photos it looked ok. The reception area is very misleading, its nice there, that is until you get out of the lift and onto your floor, where you step into a time warp. the wooden doors are all bashed up, the wallpaper is some type of rattan wicker nightmare with browning cream walls. the first room i was given was a strange triangle room, where if i closed my eyes i felt like i was alongside the grand pre circuit. it was so loud from the traffic. As i was there on business i asked for a quiet room as i couldnt sleep. I was then given a small coffin room where there was enough space to just get out and into the bed, which was broken. It was quiet from traffic, but this time all you can hear is everyone else talking and making noise. After another sleepless night, and worry of impending impaling from the coils in the mattress i asked for a new mattress, or some help flipping the old one over, the lady at reception moaned at me to the maid, thinking i didnt understand them, then sent the handy man up, who confirmed that the bed was broken and he would fix it tomorrow, he didnt come the next day or the next or the next after that. i complained each day and i felt like i was being annoying to them! they werent bothered at all that i was sleeping on a broken bed, infact the staff give you the impression that you are getting in their way , especially if you want to go down in the lift whilst they are doing the cleaning, there are no seperate lifts for them , so be wary of making them wait, one cleaner was quiet annoyed that i happened to join her in the lift. other than all that, the food was cheap if you like your burger to swim in its own grease you'll be fine..

The hotel was actually further up north in an area called Vallcarca. There was luckily a metro stop that could get me into the city, but it's about a 10 minute walk (up and down hill) to the metro station and not a convenient mode of transport on weeknights after the metro would shut down between 11pm-midnight (make sure to check the schedule!) The staff at the hotel, especially one dark - haired/brunette lady, was not friendly and not very helpful when I asked her about tours, or even things in the area. (She just guessed or assumed and gave me the wrong time that a tour office would close and I missed booking the tour.) When I asked a man at the front desk to show me on the map which way to walk to something, I verified the direction with him twice, but he had sent me the wrong way. Also, I was given a room where the toilet was not working and when I addressed the issue I was told it would be taken care of. Then I left the room for a few hours and came back at about 10pm, only to find that the toilet was STILL not working. I told the hotel staff about it again and a young man from the front desk walked up to my room with me and took a look at it, but then I was told I would have to wait until morning to have the toilet fixed. When I complained and asked for another room, I was informed that there were none available - and the guy said this without even knowing or checking at the desk. Then I raised a ruckus and FINALLY got a room (but it was smaller) with a working toilet. The bathroom was old and cracks were apparent here and there. Then - to add to the fun (NOT!) - on 2 days in a row I found bugs crawling out of the bathroom drain into the tub. YUCK! Another problem was that in the new room the phone was not working and I complained about it 4 times until someone FINALLY came to take a look at it. On the fourth time I marched down to the front desk and told the dark haired lady about it, only to be answered with, \"...if you really need to use the phone then you can see we have a phone booth over there,\" and proceeded to point towards a wall opposite the desk. I told her that was not the point. The point was that I paid for a room with basic amenities included - and that would mean a working phone as well. She didn't say anything back to me at that point, but just went back to whatever she was doing. As a final blow, she couldn't check me out of the room correctly. It was a pre-booked room and she kept insisting she needed the credit card I booked it with. The problem was that I did not have that credit card as it was booked for me by a relative. After about 10 minutes of struggling with her on the issue, I decided to call the relative whose credit card it was and have him read the credit card information to me over the phone and hoped that the lady at the front desk would be able to type it in directly. She said no at first, but then I just asked a man who was at the desk behind her and he said it shouldn't be a problem. So that was that and as the final icing on the cake, that brunette woman had done one thing right (called a taxi to take me to the airport), BUT because of her issues on checking me out the taxi started charging me so I ended up paying 15 Euros more than I should have to get to the airport by taxi.
