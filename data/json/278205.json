I won't go into details here because you can read the other review and I don't want my experience with this factory to take away from the experience I had with this hotel, because it had nothing to do with them, but I just think that people should be aware because this hotel will continue to offer the trip to this factory and people need to be aware when buying from there that the costs are not only what you pay for on the day. We really loved Venice and there is so much to see and do there that I could have stayed longer than 3 nights. If you get the chance I would suggest getting an all day ferry ticket and visiting Murano (ready my review of the glass factory before buying anything though) and Burano (Burano is a very cute island with lots of brightly coloured houses). The other thing is to make sure if you do a gondola tour to barter with the guides. They started off their prices at 150 euros and we ended up getting a 45 minute tour (up through the little canals onto the Grand Canal and under the Rialto bridge) for 80 euros. Be prepared to say no and walk away if they don't give you the price you suggest because they will follow you (usually a different person, not the one you originally spoke to) and agree to the price you offered.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Telford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ci can't reccommend this hotel enough\u201d", "Author": "kathrynanna", "ReviewID": "UR48963335", "Content": "Initially I was unsure about stating so near to the tourist loop, but the location of this hotel makes it overwhelmingly easy to get anywhere within a tiny amount of time.

We somehow missed out on coffee and toast and croissants one morning, as the staff didn't seem to spot us arriving. Our only slight problem was that we arrived late on the first night, after reception had closed and had to go to the sister hotel to check in. It would be useful if there was a sign in the window, alerting late arrivals that this is what they should do. We ate at the sister hotel one evening, making the most of the 20% discount. The food was excellent, if a little pricey, but being so close to St Mark's Square, we expected it would be. The location is excellent, close to the vaparetto stop at San Zaccaria and only a short walk from St Mark's Square. The staff were friendly and helpful and had a great grasp of English, meaning we had to use very little of our phrase book Italian.

The recent reviews on Villa Igea were all good and our stay lived up to expectations. We were there for 4 days from 8th April 08. The room we had (611) was small but it was a standard room so I wasn't expecting too much. It was spotlessly clean and being so small, presented the staff with a daily challenge with our stuff being in heaps on the floor. They managed magnificently and returning every afternoon, the room was clean,tidy and the bathroom was immaculate. Breakfast was excellent -- very varied with 3 choices of cereal, yoghurt, fresh fruit salad, fresh fruits, cheese, cold cuts, breads, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, bacon, sausage.... The only slight downside is that the breakfast room is a bit small and one morning we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The location is superb as other reviewers have described. There is a snag to this though. We had terrible weather -- rain and cold most of the time, and there wasn't the incentive to roam far afield in the evening for somewhere to eat. The result was that if we chose to eat close by, then we had to pay St Marks area prices. The Igea's sister hotel (Savoia and Jolanda) gives Igea guests 20% discount but it still cost us EUR 46 for 2 pastas, 1 dessert, 2 coffees and a (small) bottle of water!

Lugging four suitcases about five blocks in the summer heat through the crowds was a real treat. We were upgrade to an apartment which was very large and required walking up a flight of steps from the elevator. Room was clean and AC worked well. Biggest problem was the lobby closes at around 7 each night and the hotel in front of Villa Igea takes the calls and request for wake up calls. We did not get our wake up call our last day and with jet lag slept to late and nearly missed our train to Florence. No one seemed to care about this and they would not pay for a water taxi (the water bus takes about 40 minitues to get to the train) to get us to the train. The hotel was OK, overpriced but everything in Venice is. Be prepared to pay $7 for a coke, $6 for a cappucino, $25 a person for pasta at lunch. Venice was wall to wall people in June and not sure why. Once you had seen the canals and maybe the castle there is not much else to do, unless you want to walk into about 200 shops selling clay mask. Almost everyone we spoke to during our two weeks in Italy agreed that Venice was the low point of their trip.

It is always my first choice for Venice and I have already rebooked for another stay there this coming December. It is a real bargain out of season. The rooms are appointed with typical Venetian furnishings and decor and have great bathrooms and I have always found them comfortable and very clean. You can forgive the odd mosqito which sometimes are quite prevalent across the whole of the Veneto area. Each time I have stayed Villa Igea, I have had a different room, with twice being located at the front and once at the back . Athough they have varied in size from small upwards, I am never disappointed. Hotel rooms in Venice, because of the great age of many of the building i.e. going back many centuries, can often seem cramped and dark unless you pay a huge fortune. But what the heck, you haven't come to Venice to stay 24hours a day in a hotel room. The Villa Igea is so convenient to find on arriving from the airport. Take the Aliaguna direct to San Zaccaria and the hotel is less than 30 seconds away. During my first two visits, guests of the Igea took their breakfast at its larger sister hotel Savoie and Jolanda facing the lagoon and bacino with marvellous views across to San Giorgio Maggiore. So although the quality of the breakfast is the same, it is perhaps now a little disappointing to take it in a little room at the back of the Igea. But I would say that the service is better than at the S & J. If you are staying for 24 hours or more, I recommend you buy a Orange VeniceCard at the Vela window at the airport (to the left in the arrival hall). Although initally this will seem expensive, it is not when compared with buying ad hoc vaporetti tickets, museum, Doges Palace and art gallery admission, entry to public toilets etc. You also get discounts in some shops and restaurants. (NB the public toilets in Venice are very well maintained and clean but cost a euro to get in if you don't have a VeniceCard) Eating in Venice is expensive and not always value for money, but if you get a no 82 Vaporetti from San Zaccaria and get off at the Zatterre on the Giudecca Canal (about 10 mins away) you will find some nicer and cheaper restaurants with floating pontoons and great views away from the crowds that congregate along San Marco and the Riva Degli Schiavoni. Also if you get off at the Zattere stop and walk straight down the Rio beside the Gesuati church within a minute you are at the Accademia Bridge and the Grand Canal. This can be useful as the 82 Boat is often far less crowded than the No 1 that goes from San Zaccaria to the Accademia down the Grand Canal. Along the Zattere just past the Gesualti going West, is a great ice cream parlour called Nico. Three fairly large scoops of real, mouth watering ice cream cost 2.20 euros, which is very reasonable given the quality of it.", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNot so great\u201d", "Author": "expertreviews", "ReviewID": "UR8224901", "Content": "Not a way to spend your European Vacation...spring the extra bucks for a 4 star.

The Hotel itself is a boutique style, very comfortable room (small) but we were lucky as attached to our double room was an extra room with single bed (room 504 )which was great to use as changing room. Room decorated with silk fabric walls, murano glass light fittings, just fab.Breakfast was at the Hotel Savoy + Yolanda just 4 doors down , breakfast was good enough buffet with fresh fruit salads, fruit, breads, ham cheese the only hot food was bacon and scrambled eggs. We ate lunch a few times in Robertos just turn left from hotel and about 3 mins on corner, coffee was good and pastas. We tried to eat at Alla Rivetta from hotel turn left over first bridge as u come to last step on bridge its on your right, this trattoria is used by locals ,but it was full , with queues waiting to be seated so never got the opportunity to eat there, mores the pity ! Carnival was on for our first 3 days , brilliant atmosphere. It was a real mardi gras with everyone dressed up, with masks etc. I must say around St Marks area at night ,even during carnival it got quiet at 11.00 pm .The two days after carnival at night it was very quiet. You can walk everywhere in Venice , its the best way to see the place. Get good map as its easy to get lost , you will find some fantastic squares, churches and cafes. Just enjoy the maze of little streets , bridges, and canals. Venice is a wonderful place to visit.

We were given room 606, which looked like something out of a fairy tale with its decor. The room was spotlessly clean, with sat TV, mini-bar, power-shower and fresh towels delivered every day of our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and arranged a booking to a concert for us on the Saturday night. The location is unbeatable, 1 minute walk to St. Marks. The hotel was quiet and I can imagine a lot more peaceful than it's sister hotel Savoia & Jolanda, around the corner directly on San Zaccaria. Breakfast is actually served in the Savoia & Jolanda, and although basic, well prepared and very tasty.

From what I've seen and talked to other tourists in Venice, it's probably the best place to stay due to many factors: - unbeatable location, you have the privilege of being just 5 minutes walking to San Marco, or if you will, the privilege of walking through San Marco every time you return to the hotel - the easiest access from a vaporetto stop (you take 1 minute walking from the door to the vaporetto stop, very good and important, considering most tourists have heavy luggage that is infernal to carry out in Venice, I felt really sorry for all the tourists I saw muscling out their huge luggage up and down all the bridges, totally lost trying to locate their hotel in the labyrinth that are the little streets of Venice) - prices excellent for the quality provided (I've stayed in a superior room in the top floor and I must say it is worth the money, facing the beautiful if under reform facade of San Zaccaria church, 4 windows, very spacious which is a rare thing in Venice, and the Campo San Zaccaria where the hotel is located is a surprising world of peace and beauty right next to the \"hell\" of thousands of tourists passing by in the main street outside the protective sottoportego) - breakfast in itself is just satisfactory (3 star ordinary breakfast in a 4 star hotel...) but the place where you eat it, Villa Igea's \"mother-hotel\", the over-priced 4 star Savoya Jolanda, is just amazing, either inside or even better, outside, facing San Giorgio Maggiore and the lagoon, just great and another privilege, eating breakfast every morning with one of the most amazing sceneries in the world.. - as to the staff, they are quite nice and although I speak italian I saw that they all speak english and can provide you with all the info you require.

Close to St. Marks to be in the middle of the action when you want to but located on a side street so that you are away from the crowds and it's quiet in the evenings. - Excellent service and very clean room. The staff at Villa Igea could not have been more accomodating. - The breakfast was the best complimentary breakfast I've had in Europe. The fruits, meats, and pastries were excellent. There was nothing negative about the hotel. The room was very small by American standards, but I knew that going there and I would have had to pay more than twice as much per night to get the extra space and the same ameminites.

If you are like me and you've read all of the reviews...and like me you wonder how much is true, then wonder no more. It really is a great location...it really is less than five minutes stroll to St Marks Square...yet it really is a peaceful haven, even though it is less than 30 seconds from the canal, the water bus/airport bus station and the view in the photo! One other really attractive plus point is that San Zaccaria is one of four stops made by the airport transport boat (alilaguna), so it stops literally in front of the hotel, maybe 75 metres away. 12 euros and 57 minutes later and bingo, you arrive. The photos of the room don't really do it justice. This room, 606, is a superior graded room and cost 237 euros per night. The bed is over 2 metres wide, the walls covered in a paded sillk effect paper, very luxurious! The breakfast was pleasant and really not a problem having to duck out into the street and walk the 30 seconds to the venue in the adjoining sister hotel. Sorry, I know it's not always a good strategy, but I have to make a few recommendations.... for lunch....my wife and i went here for lunch on Thursday, arrived about 1.45 and had a fabulous time; a real seafood delight, plus other exquisite food - we really enjoyed it, drank too much of the 8 euros a litre house fizz too - great fun, great food too. 60 euros for both of us - we tried lots! The location is turn left out of the Hotel, follow the street around (50 metres-ish); as you go over the bridge, you'll see it tucked away on the left hand side - Trattoria alla Rivetta. Ponte S. Provolo 4625. for masks - the best - [-]camacana[-] for art - Ca' Pesaro. International art and all up real close (surprisingly little security and some stuff without glass etc)..I'm not saying this as a potential art theif, more as someone who assumed that the work of artists like Klimt; Matisse and Kandinsky would be more secure.

We were skeptical and he told us to look at the room and then decide. It was actually in the adjoining building but looked out over Campo San Zaccaria. The room was HUGE (probably 1,000 square feet) and had a separate sitting room with a piano, a kitchen with table, an entry hall and a washing machine (no dryer). We took the room and later saw the others we passed on and were happy with our decision. The other rooms (some which had balconies) were attractive but very small and all had carpet - which in Venice is not a benefit because of the moisture and possible mold. The hotel (3 star) was very nice and was owned by the same people who own the 4 star Savoia e Jolanda that overlooks the Grand Canal and is where you eat breakfast every morning (great view!). Because of the two hotel ownership we got a complimentary trip to the island of Murano to see how they make their famous Murano glass (very cool, but beware that you will get a sales pitch at the end to buy a chandelier). The hotel is literally less than a 2 minute walk to the Grand Canal where there is access to vaporettos, ferries, water taxis and gondolas. This is also an excellent location because it is a 5 minute walk to St. Mark's Square where much of the action is. Tomasso was very helpful at identifying and booking restaurants and his English was great. They also booked our 4 am water taxi for the morning we were leaving and a bell hop came to our room to collect our luggage and carry it to the canal at that insane hour. The room was clean (with the exception of mold on the ceiling in the bathroom) and comfortable, and it had a couple of beautiful glass chandeliers (makes me wonder if they own the chandelier glass maker we visited). I recommend this hotel to anyone, including families, going to Venice -- incidentally one of the most incredible cities I've seen in my extensive travels. By the way, the Gritti Palace terrace bar is an excellent place for a romantic sunset cocktail on the Grand Canal and a nighttime gondola ride is great after 10 pm because it is quiet and you feel all alone on the canals.", "Date": "September 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!\u201d", "Author": "WSG34", "ReviewID": "UR5829035", "Content": "If you're looking for a hotel that's close to St. Mark's Square but still in a quiet location.
