Everything I needed for business purposes was available and convenient. I will set aside (well almost) my pet peeve of high end hotels charging for internet when mid-range hotels do not, but that is not unique to the St Regis. Common areas, while very modern, were nonetheless warm and inviting. Service was excellent and friendly. My room was very comfortable and quiet. The shower is outstanding and the bathroom spacious. When I told the front desk that I was extending my stay and that my wife was joining me for the weekend, they offered to move me into an upgraded room. These folks know how to win your loyalty. Make me look good to my beloved and you get my repeat business in a heartbeat. Plus the room was so pleasant to my wife it resulted in her choosing to use the hotel spa as well.

The whole stay blew me apart. Having stayed at the MO and FS SF previously, this design and decor of this hotel is definitely more modern and tasteful. The lobby, the lobby bar and AME (their Micheline starred restaurant) are very nicely furnished. The staff greeted me warmly upon checkin and had all my details and documents ready in no time. The standard room was very nice, and the room service I had from AME was definitely one of my best room service meal ever. The next day I moved to the Astor suite and was introduced to my butler Jenny. She and the butler team was definitely very attentive and responded to my requests swiftly and professionally. The suite itself was very nice, with a big dining table and a spacious living room so when my friends came over it was perfect for a group gathering in the suite. The bathroom in both the room and suite were modern and nicely done (unlikely the relatively old fashioned ones at FS and MO) and the staff at the reception could recognise me by greeting me with my first name, I think a rarity nowadays even in 5 star hotels. I was given the suite on the top floor (20th) which has a very impressive view of the city? So, FS, MO( soon to be renovated) or the St.R? I think if you like breath taking views, go for MO. Convenience to shopping area/union square, go for FS (Although to be fair St. Regis is only 2 minutes away from the FS). But if you want to have convenience, classy decor,modern technology, world class staff , St. Regis has got it all--I think it will easily be my first choice when I next visit SF. Definitely should try this without a doubt.

The hotel is very modern and cool. We were told we would receive an upgrade to our room and of course we were very excited. We get to the room and it is a normal standard room...... we then worry about what sort of room we would have been in to begin with. After a day of shopping we return to our room to find that it was not cleaned. We look at the room controller to see that we had accidentally left the do not disturb button on. Our bad. So one of the girls calls to have some fresh towels sent up and ask to just have our beds made. No one comes. The next day we ask the concierge to book us to see Alcatraz. She gives us the number so we could do it. Wait a second...... No we need you to do it..... So she does. We taxi down to that area early to go ahead to will call to get our tickets so we could have a nice lunch before Alcatraz. At will call we find out that only two tickets were purchased and we needed three. Of course it is now sold out. One of the girls calls the concierge to find out what happened....they say this is a normal occurrence that the Alcatraz tickets are mixed up (what?!?) but they apologized for our waisted time and said we would have a gift waiting for us in our room. That evening we come back to the room to find that yet again it has not been cleaned........with no gift. We have now had it. We talk to a manager about it he of course apologizes and sends a bottle of wine and a stress ball and candle. We brush the afternoon off and get ready for dinner. We have been so excited to use the house car (a bentley) for dinner so we go downstairs 20 minutes before our reservation to let them know we would like to use the car. We over hear them ok-ing the couple in front of us to go out side the 2mile radius the car is limited to. We wait for over 45min. We start a new with the driver and he is amazing. We return and the valet now apologize for our wait and offer to buy breakfast. I feel like there were so many other smaller things that happened that really put a bad taste in our mouths about the St. Regis. The whole place is not horrible the restaurants, bars and of course the Remede Spa are top notch.

My husband forgot cufflinks for his shirt and asked to borrow some, but was told none were available at the time. Although, we had to improvise using other materials (we were running late for dinner reservations) we found a box of cufflinks in our room upon our return. They sent someone shopping at the nearby Macy's to get us some. Even though, it was too late, that kind of service was still very much appreciated! Thank you, St.Regis! Due to the closure of the Bay Bridge, we took the BART into the city and got off at the Montgomery station. It was super easy and there was no hassle with parking. Of course, we packed light and were able to walk the few blocks to the hotel. We loved the high end marble flooring, leather walls, and luxurious linens. We didn't hear much noise from others in the hotel room, but you could still hear the sounds of a big city below. So keep that in mind. 13th Floor was not high enough to buffer the sounds of sirens from fire engines and police trucks. But it was very quiet after midinight or so.

It dominates both the newspaper and their local television \u201cnews\u201d channel Kron4. Which in my opinion is the worst \u201cnews\u201d channel in the English speaking world (and that\u2019s saying something). That said, from a consumer perspective, when looking for a hotel, one should not underplay the potential depilating effects \u201chospitality fog\u201d can have when it comes to choosing a 5 star hotel in which to spend your hard-earned dollar. One can get disorientated in the \u2018fog\u2019 of glossy P.R. material that emanates from all these establishments-reassuring you that their hotel is the one you should seek sanctuary in until the \u2018fog\u2019 has lifted. So what to do? My wife and I spent 11 nights at the St. Regis hotel during the festive season Dec/Jan 2012 on the strength of the reviews on Trip Advisor, as well as the soothing and reassurance words published in their in-house publication: \u201cBespoke.\u201d From the moment we stepped through the lobby doors we knew we had made the right choice! While outside the air was frigid an cold, upon entering, we were enveloped in warmth of subtle brown tones, which underpins the d\u00e9cor, giving the entire hotel a warm, understated contemporary luxury feel. Check in by Alan was fast, efficient and friendly and most of all welcoming, and after an 18 hour flight from Australia-that\u2019s important! In fact during our entire stay not once did our presence go unacknowledged by any of the staff we encountered. As we left of a morning, eye-contact by at least one employee was made, be they front desk, concierge or door. It was always: \u201chave a good day\u201d or \u201cgood morning\u201d and again on our return in the evening we received the same warm greetings. In large hotels such as the St Regis it\u2019s the little things that are very important. Our room was on the 10th floor. I could really stretch the thesaurus here with all sorts of superlatives to describe it- safe to say it was lovely! Plain white pastel walls, capped off the delightful open-air feel the room had. Again, very important if you are going to spend 11 nights in the room is not to feel claustrophobic. Being first time visitors to San Francisco, (and being totally unfamiliar with the vagrancies of \u2018fog\u2019), we felt that we needed to employ the services of a: \u201cfog-master\u201d to ensure that we continued to make the right choices when it came to choosing where to go and eat and what to see in San Francisco. The \u201cfog-masters\u201d of the St Regis concierge ensured that we never took a faltering step. In no particular order: Antonio, Caroline, Kathleen, Mariah, Eric and Selena \u2013 who recommended probably the best steak house we have ever eaten at (5A5) - all of them really known San Francisco!! Every time, their recommendations on whatever we asked (tours, places to eat et al) were right on the money. Collectively they were the foundation upon which a wonderful holiday was constructed! Thank you!! Food at the hotel is a serious business. We ate a couple of times at Vitrine which serves local Californian-fare with the freshest of ingredients. We also enjoyed a lovely room service one evening brought to our room by the very hospitable Casey. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t get the opportunity to dine at their signature restaurant: Ame. My wife and I hope to rectify this on our next visit at years-end. The hotel is in a good location, a short walk from Union Square and all the public transport facilities. So in short: If you are planning a trip to San Francisco, pray for \u2018fog\u2019 and enjoy the refuge that is the St Regis.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cHotel Bliss!!!\u201d", "Author": "WBM", "ReviewID": "UR122629868", "Content": "This place is wonderful - such an amazing and beautiful property from lobby to rooms, to the impeccable service.

I received a most shocking reply, a non-sequitur, and no, this wasn't an automatically generated reply. I couldn't believe this was the famed St Regis Butler Service. I won't go into the details but have since written to starwood corporate service department and would like to hear back from the hotel management. To be fair, once we checked in and went past some very odd guest experiences (which I'll attribute to the butler we communicated with), the service improved tremendously. The other butlers, concierge, front desk, porters, etc were all professional and helpful. However, something just isn't quite right about the St Regis. The room per se was lovely, that is to say the bed, the bathroom area with the open tub, huge shower room, luxurious bath robe and slippers and view. That's it. I was surprised that such a high end hotel couldn't provide tea bags but could provide numerous sachets of coffee for free, didn't have a fruit bowl and no turn down delights.

I kept having to wake up to turn it back up. On our 3rd day, water from the shower leaked into the toilet and I also noticed that the light fixture in the toilet was dangling slightly off the ceiling. I should have brought it up right there and then but actually didn't fancy packing up and switching rooms, plus we didn't spend too much time watching TV or in the room anyway, so it's partly my fault for keeping silent. I guess I just had great expectations given the reputation and you know, it isn't cheap.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cFiner, more thorough service than before\u201d", "Author": "UpperWestSiderGuy", "ReviewID": "UR122433108", "Content": "I am reviewing this property again after doing so a year ago.

One morning a small plate of biscotti on the tray, the next morning not. The next morning a very small tray, the following morning a big tray with ice waters--not a complaint but I wish the presentation had been standardized.

This is a stunning impressive hotel. I like the location the best - proximity to BART station (Montgomery is closest although my friend thinks Powell is - go with Montgomery) makes it quick to SFO and Yerba Buena park is across the street. The room is absolutely stunning and spacious. Separate huge soaker tub and spacious shower. Ours had two beds and was spacious and bright. My friends had a king bed - somewhat of a weird L shaped layout in her which seemed to waste a lot of space. Beds were comfortable, lots of towels and all amenities. There are a few concerns though which stop me from rating this a 5 star hotel. A large 40\" wall mounted screen in the room. Very nice. But then.....the channels do not match up to the program guide nor do they identify the channel on the TV. So lots of channel surfing - the old fashioned way. Even the online TV guide the channels did not match up. OK, so that's annoying but then all the channels were fuzzy and nonHD and the TV was showing analog on the screen. They tout the butler service but read the fine print....a lot of the services are for suites only. I called the butler service to ask if it would be possible to get a single cup of coffee. They said \"no problem absolutely we'd be happy to\" but when the coffee came up there was a room service bill for $15. Now I understand if I had called room service but anyways.....they did take it off the bill after I called them (I was actually going to return the coffee if they didn't) There is no express checkout in room either by phone or by the TV and you do not receive a bill in your room on your last night. You must stand in line which sounds like no big deal (and I usually like to do it to check the bill anyways) but when they have only 1 person working at the desk at 9am and there's a lineup of 4 people....... We used the pool and really enjoyed it. There are public showers (3) on the pool deck. When I enquired about if guests are allowed to use the changerooms in the spa they told me it would be $20 to use the spa to shower. Uh, no thanks. So, I would say the St. Regis, while fabulous in terms of the rooms and room amenities (but no coffee maker) falls short of the level of a Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula or Shangri-La. P.S. As for the conference, they provided one screen for Powerpoint for the whole large room.

I specifically asked to stay at the St. Regis because my husband and I had such an unbelievable staying at the one in Shanghai for our honeymoon. (It was also close to the Moscone Center where my husband had to attend meetings.) To be frank, it's not a fair comparison because Shanghai has access to cheaper labour and supplies. The St. Regis Shanghai was palatial and their butler service was literally that - on call, at any time of the day or night, white glove service - they were there to ensure we were pampered. We had complimentary coffee brought up in the middle of the night (time change was brutal) and they refused to let us pour the first cup for ourselves. Everything in the US is more expensive so I don't fault the St. Regis SF for not being the same. That being said, it still meets what one would expect of a 5 star property in all respects. Our room wasn't available in the morning but they were kind enough to store our bags and a couple crates of wine until our room was available. As promised, they called me when the room was available. The front desk staff were consistently friendly and efficient. We had a regular king bedroom on the seventh floor - I believe they call it the \"superior room\". Not much of a view but the room itself was modern, clean, roomy and relaxing. The bed was comfortable - not too firm and not too soft. There was a 42\" lcd tv on the wall, with another smaller plasma in the bathroom. The rainfall showerhead was wonderful and the separate soaker tub was great. The folding partition between the bathroom and bedroom could be opened so you can watch the big tv from the tub. The toilet and shower were separated by frosted glass enclosures. The lighting, shades/blinds, etc. could all be controlled through a device next to the bed. They offered a complimentary newspaper of your choice each morning, turndown service in the evenings and provided bottled water each day. What happend to me occurred after we checked out. The room has a recessed closet system so the doors are flat to the wall and unobtrusive. I had three silk blouses that I promptly hung in the closet when I unpacked so that they wouldn't get wrinkled. I was preoccupied when we were checking out and completely forgot to check the closet. When I was unpacking at home the morning after we checked out, I was horrified to discover that I failed to pack my blouses. This was the first time I had ever forgotten anything in a hotel. With the closet being recessed and blending in with the walls, I completely forgot to check the closet before we checked out. Ladies, you might be able to understand my pain. These were brand new blouses that I bought within a month or two of the trip - one was worn only once, the second only worn two times and the third only a handful of times. I loved them and had one of them specifically tailored. All from my favourite store which is not readily available where I live! The total replacement value of the blouses was on the order of $400. I called the hotel immediately to report this, hoping that housekeeping found and reported them. No such luck. I was put through to security and spoke with a couple fellows who said that they would need to interview housekeeping and various other members of staff who had access to the room after we checked out. I inquired as to whether anyone else had checked into the room after us and was told that nobody had checked in. This initially gave me hope. I also asked them to let me know what my options were if they did not find the blouses. They later called back and left a voice message saying that housekeeping did not report finding anything and nothing had been turned in and ended with, \"we hope you have a nice day\". Nothing was said about next steps. I decided to call back and ask for the manager. I was put through to Kamal, director of front desk, who promised that he would look into this and follow up with me regarding next steps. When we spoke a couple days later, he confirmed that the blouses are nowhere to be found. He also advised that there had been no prior incidents with the employee in question and when he looked into the possibility of whether this could be submitted as an insurance claim. He said that it's not likely to be successful since the hotel is not liable for items left behind in the room. I understood these issues and the difficult position Kamal was put in. I told him that I have no motive whatsoever to make a false claim. We are financially very comfortable. He insisted that he's not accusing me of lying but that his hands were tied with respect to how the insurance company would treat the claim. What bothered me was the fact that it was my fault originally for forgetting to check the closet and I simply wanted my blouses back because I knew it would be difficult for me to replace them. Kamal was nothing but forthright and polite during our discussions and, since an insurance claim would likely fail, he offered to refund a portion of our account as a courtesy. Although the amount would not be enough to recover the cost of the blouses, I felt it was fair under the circumstances. He went further and extended an offer to be our point of contact should we decide to return to the St. Regis, SF in the future at which point he would ensure that we had the best and smoothest service. Although I'm very disappointed with the dishonesty of someone on their housekeeping staff and the fact that I will never see my beloved blouses ever again, I have to say that Kamal has redeemed my faith in the franchise. In my view, he not only achieved a fair compromise to resolve a bad situation but he also demonstrated grace and professionalism throughout the course of our communication.

A close relative of mine recently passed away from cancer, WE DO NOT SMOKE. At this point proof from the St. Regis is necessary that in your words \"you and your guest appeared to have smoked in a non-smoking room\". I am completely shocked....The first room we were given the whole floor smelled strongly of smoke, also we had no cell service. We asked to be moved promptly, which we were NOT and the second room also smelled musty / smokey in addition to being dirty. Also the whole 12th floor smelled of smoke. My wife and I had several problems staying at the St. Regis San Francisco . First was asking to be moved and our \"butler\", or the front desk dropping the ball. We checked in at 1pm and were not moved until approximately 7pm. The bathroom and the window ledge were filthy and we had to let housekeeping know to come and clean it again. There was never ice or water in the room, after we made a point to let housekeeping know we wanted it there. Several times we ran out of toilet paper and had to call the front desk, half a roll was left in the room and not an extra anywhere to be found. We ordered room service once, the order was all wrong, they forgot my fries with the sandwich, and also the dressing for my wife's salad. We had to wait another 30 minutes to get the ordered items, by that time the food was cold. Never once were we greeted by the doorman when we walked in after a long day. Both floors we were given rooms on smelled of smoke. The final problem was when we were checking out and you Julie -- were helping and there were bogus charges on my bill. This is extremely unprofessional and completely the opposite experience I've had at other St. Regis properties . I am a frequent traveler and I have never been treated so poorly by a supposed 5 star property. As I told you when I was checking out yesterday I am in Napa Valley for few more days of vacation. Your email this morning pretty much ruined my day. I would expect the St. Regis to solve this today amicably and issue a complete refund asap. I would like you to forward this email to the San Francisco hotel manager and St. Regis head office. I will be contacting them as soon as I return to Los Angeles .", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent highend modern hotel near Moscone\u201d", "Author": "DrRonMath", "ReviewID": "UR118130619", "Content": "Beautiful, modern hotel in the heart of SF near the Moscone center.

The hotel is top notch from the rooms to the atmosphere to the staff. From the moment you arrive, you are treated like royalty. Well dressed bellman open your door, help with your baggage, and even provide Evian bottled water. The rooms are absolutely amazing. The bathrooms are well kept and have everything you would ever want in a hotel bathroom. Everything is controlled by a bedside unit that allows you to turn off lights, open the shades, control the room temperature, make phone calls, and almost everything else. The location was a little out of the way if you want to be near Fisherman's wharf. However, there is a street car about 2 blocks from the hotel that drops you off right in front of the wharf. Union Square and the shopping district was a short 10 minute walk away. The concierge, Kathleen, was very helpful and answered all our questions. The rest of the staff was also very friendly and welcoming, with the exception of a waiter we had for breakfast for two mornings. It almost seemed like he was too good to work for the St. Regis and was just not very warm. The restaurant is very expensive for breakfast. On the first morning, my wife and I shared a continental breakfast and the kids had just waffles. That ended up costing $70! I left the standard 15% tip (because the service we received was not up to par for 20%). The next morning, the same waiter treated us even more coldly than he did the morning before. It just didn't seem like he should be acting that way at an hotel the caliber of the St. Regis. Also, another reviewer had mentioned this and it was a problem for us as well. The hotel must be located near a fire station because each night we were awakened to sirens. If you are a light sleeper, be forewarned and maybe ask for a room away from the street.

We are supposed to get a welcome gift and a room upgrade when we check in (if available) and although these items may seem trivial we have come to expect them. As we were leaving for the evening we finally had to ask them and were told they forgot and our welcome gift is a chocolate bar but that there were no upgrades available? So I passed on the candy and when I looked online and there were plenty of suites available? This is typical of some other lower end Starwood properties but I would expect better from St Regis. The next morning I called down and asked if they had a club lounge wanted to grab a cup of coffee while the wife was sleeping and was told they didnt have one so I asked if I could get a coffee maker brought up was informed that would not be possible? OK no biggie took a walk to get some fresh air and when I returned ordered some from room service and that's when I noticed it was $16 for coffee but I had to suck it up needed to get the wife up and going so 40 minutes later when it finally came (barely warm) they charged a 21% service fee as well as a $5 delivery charge on top???? I could of had some delivered from Starbucks for less and would have been much better!

The hotel is conveniently located in the San Fran downtown area with walking distance to pretty much all of the attractions in the city. The hotel itself is modernly decorated and well maintained, with an atmosphere that is almost more like ones typically seen at Mandarin Oriental than St Regis. We booked a Metropolitan Suite and the room was very specious, with a nice dining table and comfortable L shaped couch. All of the phone dialing and lighting were controlled by digital pads. The bathroom was bright and nicely done as well. Although there was not a second bathroom we were pleased to see two sinks in the spacious bathroom. So with such a nice hotel, how come I only gave it three stars? First it had to do with room service. Both my bf and I are late risers and thus we ordered breakfast in every morning during our stay. Although the food itself is delicious, getting the food itself is not such a smooth process. There is only one day, out of 4, that the room service department got our order right. The first day they missed the pastries. The second day they miss the Maple Syrup (to go with pancake, which is stated in the menu and should come without a special request). On the third day, even though I specifically asked for some honey to go with my French toast over the phone, the honey was missing when the order came. I understand that this may not be the delivery person\u2019s fault and feel bad that we have to send the person back every single time to pick up the missing items, but the person who took the order and the person packing the order should really take the responsibility of checking the completeness of every order. Since this is a five star hotel that charges 21% of service charge (& I believe there is a $5 delivery fee in addition to that) for room service, this type of service is really Not acceptable. A 5 star hotel should be able to \u201cearn\u201d its 21% service charge instead of getting it by default. It was especially disappointing that when we addressed this issue during check out, we merely got an answer of \u201coh we are surprised to hear that and will address this issue with room service\u201d without a word of sorry or any apology from a supervisor (which is surprising to see for a five star hotel). There are a couple of other things in addition to that. In terms of the room itself, although the room is nice/bright/high tech as previously stated, there was a huge crack in one of the sinks (and I have a picture to prove that) that was obvious there since the installation of the sink. Although it did not affect the functionality of the sink, it was surprising for a guest staying at a room with rack rate of over $1k a night to see that in the bathroom. In terms of the hotel service, although the service mostly live up to the name of a five-star hotel, has its high and lows. The staff at the Concierge desk (I believe his first name is Steven) was extremely helpful and gave us all sorts of tips in addition to the maps and explained thoroughly with regards to different ways to get to places. On the other hand, the bell guys at the Parking area were not nearly as nice and often opened the door with a stone cold, annoyed face. Overall we definitely enjoyed the room and the location of the hotel and had a wonderful time in San Fran. However there are a few things (as stated above) that really need to be addressed by the hotel management for us to consider staying at the hotel again or to recommend it to others.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Annivesary Weekend\u201d", "Author": "johncindyaz", "ReviewID": "UR107867459", "Content": "This was our anniversary weekend and we decided to splurge on a nice hotel and weren't disappointed at all.

When checking in we've been informed that the hotel was sold out and therefore, even I'm holding Platinum SPG status, we would get only a Grand Deluxe room - but top floor (20th). Holding Platinum status, at US$ 389.00++ there isn't even breakfast included nor is there a Club Lounge with all-day snacks, drinks... When entering the Grand Deluxe room I asked myself where they've lost the \"Grand\". The room was small, maybe one of the smallest I've seen at SPG during the last year.

I switched off the aircon - but the noise remained. I means not a bit of noise, I mean real noise.

I called again and informed again about the noise. The manager at the front desk told me he trusts me - but he couldn't do anything about it.

It was my first stay at a St. Regis property. I was traveling alone and was looking forward to staying at a nicer hotel than normal for a medical conference. I was not disappointed! The location was a nice 5-10 minute walk to my meetings. The hotel is fairly new and has a modern asian cosmopolitan feel. It seems to cater to the business travelers. Every part of the hotel I visited was spotless. My room was immaculate. The bath was luxurious with a soaking tub, travertine marble shower with rain shower. There were plenty of soft towels, bathrobes and a flat screen tv in bath. Housekeeping was great with turndown service every night. The bed and linens were amazing. I heard sirens during the day but I didn't notice any at night, guess I slept really good! I liked the touch screen controls at the bedside for the blinds, lights, temperature. The radio wasn't that great, not great reception, no ipod dock. The only thing I didn't like about my room was the view. I had a fifth floor room with a view of the air conditioning vents and of people in the museum of modern art looking out and taking pictures. I found out later when I visited the museum that there was a where's waldo sculpture on the roof of the building behind the hotel! I asked for a different room with a better view after I checked in, but was politely told that there were no other rooms available due to the conference. I had expected to maybe get a smaller room since I was paying the conference rate of $349 night. So, I kept my blinds closed the whole trip. I paid for internet the first night then used the free local sites the rest of my trip at Starbucks and the Grove. I spent two post conference evenings in the Remede spa getting a pedicure and a massage. The spa was very relaxing, with very nice friendly staff. I loved the champagne and chocolate truffles! The infinity pool was very cool! I used the fitness center one night to work out. I thought it was clean and well serviced. I ate dinner at Ame and had a very nice meal with amazing service. I also had dessert and a drink in the bar one night. It was a weeknight with a calmer, quieter crowd, unlike the weekend when the bar was packed. There are several restaurants within walking distance of the hotel like California Pizza Kitchen. It's San Francisco so there are coffee shops on every corner, Peet's and Starbucks. The Grove is a really cool restaurant next door that serves all day and has wireless internet with your meal. I had the best chicken pot pie I have ever had there! There is a walgreens a half a block away, and an italian market across the street where you can buy a bottle of wine or get deli food. As a single woman, I felt very safe walking around the immediate area of the hotel and convention center. I only saw a few street people, not as many as I had expected. The area around the hotel seems a bit saner than the Union square area. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to stay here again. I felt very pampered and well cared for! All the staff I encountered were friendly and professional. The doormen were friendly and welcoming. It isn't a place I would take my family on vacation, and it probably wouldn't appeal to everyone. But, for the solo business travel or for a couple it is very nice. It is definitely for the traveller that expects a higher level of service.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittstown, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Hotel\u201d", "Author": "NJ_Visitor", "ReviewID": "UR81825732", "Content": "I have nothing but good things to say with one exception.

St. Regis. My wife and I went for a romantic weekend from 9/23 - 9/27. We did not realize it was \"Oracle Week\" at Moscone Center, right across the street. Huge convention. It was jam packed at the hotel, but that was not their fault. We reserved an executive premier king, which is supposed to be one of the larger rooms. Our first room had a smashed table lamp and bacon crumbs on the duvet cover. The carpet had dirt on it. We had to wait at check in for the room while it was being \"inspected\". Some inspection. They clearly did not wash the duvet cover or vacuum the room. We complained and they moved us to a different room that was absolutely smaller with no seating. We complained again and were told that it was the last room available and that it was the exact same size as our previous room, it was not. It was definitely a down grade. We are Starwood gold members, but the front desk did not want to hear from us again, they were overwhelmed, so the director of guest services (Ken/Kevin?) called. He was extremely polite and professional, he apologized profusely. He offered 100/night off our bill because there were no other rooms available, (Oracle week), so we accepted. We really did not have a choice. The 100 off per night was nice, but we really like nice hotel rooms, and this kind of ruined it for us. We had planned to have some friend's up for cocktails because they wanted to check out the St. Regis, but since there is no seating in the room we met in the bar. We were embarrassed to show them our room. Some of our main complaints about the room: there is no I-Pod docking station in the room. Shocking! This is San Francisco, Apple/ tech center of the world. You have to clumsily plug your I-Pod into the back of the T.V. after calling the internet butler to get a cable. The T.V. is your stereo system. Lame. The bathroom only had one sink, there should be two at this category of room The closet is miniscule, we had to jam our clothes in. You have to call for an iron and board. There should be one in every room. These rooms are clearly designed for a single traveler attending a convention right across the street, and if that is the case, and your company is picking up the tab, it is convenient. There is no luggage storage. The lighting is dim. The bedside room controller (clock, phone, lighting, automatic drapes) is clumsy and awkward to use. (If you have ever stayed at a Peninsula Hotel, they have those system controllers down.) They charge 14.95 per 24 hour use of internet. That is a robbery when you are spending 550/night (plus a whole host of taxes and fees, not their fault). There is free internet access pretty much everywhere in S.F. Overnight parking is 50/night, ouch. Also, BEWARE, the hotel is right next door (literally) to a very large fire station. The trucks/ambulances come and go all night long, sirens blaring. It is very LOUD and we wore ear plugs. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable. The rain shower in the bathroom is the best I have ever encountered, very strong with tons of water, and I don't usually like rain shower heads. The staff is excellent and friendly. You never see a maid's cart in the hallway, very classy. We left our room for about 30 minutes and the entire room was made up upon our return. They are a little stingy with soap/ shampoo, when the soap in the shower is down to a sliver, they should leave a new bar. Plus we left 10/day on the nightstand for the maid. Whatever. Great turn down service in the evening. Room service is excellent. The restaurant AME off the lobby is incredible and highly recommended. Great crudo and seafood, loved our waiter. If you are going for a convention at Moscone Center and your are alone, it is convenient. If you are going for a romantic/leisurely weekend with a loved one, this is not the place.

Overall, the St. Regis wasn't bad, but there are a few shortcomings. Service - the staff was friendly and very helpful. I did not experience any problems with those at the front desk. I was always greeted warmly and provided with the assistance needed. Definitely better than the Ritz Carlton, where staff seemed as if I was an annoyance. My main issue with the St. Regis was with the concierge on duty, as they all appeared unwilling to provide any additional information unless asked directly. For example, they did not let me know that tickets to the de Young Museum's exhibit was sold out when I specifically asked for directions and indicated that I needed to go purchase tickets; instead, I had to find out when I arrived at the de Young and was told that I could have pre-booked. In contrast, the concierge at the Four Seasons were more proactive. Room - stayed in a Grand Deluxe room and had a nice view of the city and the water. The room was very comfortable and large, similar in size to that of the Four Seasons. However, its furniture was showing some wear and tear with scratches evident. The closet was also smaller than those of the other hotels. The washroom had a great soaker tub that looked directly into the room, so you could have a view of the city. This was a nice feature that opened up the space and made it seem more spacious and bright. Plenty of towels that were nice and thick... I make a note of this because the towels at the Four Seasons should really be replaced. Extras - one small bottle of Evian was in the room during the day and another was provided at turndown. While a little more generous than the Four Season's one bottle at turndown, its still quite a bit more stingy than the Ritz Carlton. There is complimentary internet access provided through the business center - can't seem to recall if it's on the 2nd or 3rd floor - but you log in for 15 minute sessions with a countdown clock appearing at the bottom right hand side of your screen. You can extend the session, but you end up feeling rushed. Unlike the Four Seasons and the Ritz Carlton, there was no morning coffee/tea service in the lobby. I believe it is located on the 4th floor where the hotel's restaurant, Vitrine, is located, but it is quite awkward to walk past the hostess in order to get coffee. The gym is quite nice, but is shared with the residences. A full range of equipment is available 24 hours a day, which is a nicer option than the Four Seasons (contracted through Sports Club/LA with limited hours) and the Ritz Carlton (located in the basement and is much smaller).

They replied \"sorry, no, we are fully committed\" They would put a \"rush\" on the room and that they would be happy to get a few drinks for us in the bar while we waited. At 6:30 no one had come to tell us the room was ready so we went back to the front desk...where our keys were waiting in the Rolodex and the gentleman who had originally checked us in was MIA and we were helped by a young woman.

We proceeded up to our room, they hotel itself was gorgeous.

I said \"fine\" and then she asked \"would you like to come down to get the keys?\" HMMM....NO. You f*ed up, you bring the keys to me..talk about bad service! The second room we got into had no problems but the arrival experience had already left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think I would have been so angry if they had just been more up front and honest with us about the room situation. Not to mention the fact that they tried to charge us the rate for the more expensive room we had booked and not the lesser room we ended up in. For the money we spent here I was shocked by the attention to detail or lack- there-of. A month ago we stayed at a Marriott for a wedding. We were informed on arrival that the room wasn't ready because someone had smoked in it and were immediately offered a different room (saving us the trouble of waiting for cleaning and moving rooms). Guess what...they also offered 50% off the rate without us even asking!! Now that is customer service. So...bottom line gorgeous hotel...top of the line luxery...service was aweful and not worth the $$, we will never stay again. oh did I mention the people in the room next to us were still partying at 3:30 am and after two calls to the front desk and a 45 min wait security finally came up and made them quiet down.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cDecent rooms, but service with a begrudging smile\u201d", "Author": "Baobab88", "ReviewID": "UR72383251", "Content": "Had high hopes of this hotel, but came away with a mildly disappointing opinion versus our expectations for a St Regis.

I looked at just about every 5 star hotel in the city, and couldn't really seem to find what I was looking for. I wanted something that was centrally located, with spacious, modern, fresh rooms and amenities like pool,business centre, gym. A lot of the other big hotels seemed not to be up to scratch, they were hit or miss, or the rooms weren't really that appealling. The St. Regis, however, fit the bill and had good reviews on TA, which I can now verify. Situated just a few minutes walk to shopping in union sq, it's close enough to the centre without being right on top of it, and it's in a safe area. I was really happy when I saw the room, which was the 'entry level' category, but was large, modern, and done up in a soothing palette of neutrals. No fussy clutter and gimmicky furnishings, just an elegant space with adequate room to store both of our suitcases, and a lovely bathroom. Exactly what you see on the website photos. It was very quiet, although not 100% sound proof-you could hear sirens etc from the street, but not your neighbours. It also didnt feel too large and corporate/anonymous- it was still fairly intimate, given that they have a reasonably large number of rooms. I think this is because the lobby is so cozy. As for dining, I really only experienced the bar and the breakfast at Vitrine. Cannot recommend the lobby bar highly enough, the bartenders are excellent. I had a glass of wine by myself and made friends with Linda and Hector, who were the epitome of friendly, gracious bartenders. The gave me the inside scoop on what to do and where to eat in the city. Breakfast on the other hand, I must confess, was rather expensive and very formal - ie we got given amuse bouche at breakfast, spent aprox $80 for 2 people!!!) I would skip this and go out to one of the many cafes for a local brekkie instead. Service as a whole was pretty good. We were there for a while, and also came back after our trip to Napa, so we did get to know the concierges. We especially liked a female Asian American concierge who was very helpful. Michael, the door man was great and it was nice seeing his smiling face when we came 'home' everyday. As a whole, not too many negatives to report-there was a mix up with our room service, but they did their best to fix it. I try to avoid room service as it's usually error prone, even at 5 star hotels! WiFi was at a cost, I believe, which seems to be the norm in San Francisco. However there is a computer station that you can use for free + printer.

Upon entering the room, shades were closed and lights were dim, already arranged from a turn down service, even though it was around 4 PM. The room was spacious and immaculately clean. Many features of the room were controlled by a central touch screen computer that can operate the blinds, lights, alarm, and call the butler or room service. The bathroom was huge with a deep bathtub and separate marble rain shower. There was also a television in the bathroom which was a very nice feature. Toiletries were Remede Spa products from the Spa in the hotel and at other St. Regis properties. The hotel is also home to condos in the upper floors which shares the spa and gym facilities. Took a swim in the indoor infinity pool of the hotel. The pool had the clearest water I had ever seen before. Almost seemed like they filled the pool up with bottled water everyday. It was an incredible experience to swim and dry off looking out a window to Yerba Buena Gardens right across the street and the Metreon in the distance. This was an experience I had never thought I would go through. Enjoyed cocktails at the bar in the evening.

It has absolutely everything you could want. It has elegant decor, attentive service (excluding final check-out), great food, a spacious swimming pool, gorgeous rooms, a central location, and a tranquil atmosphere. The claims made in previous reviews about a poor location are false. The hotel is only half a block from the SFMOMA, across the street from the Yerba Buena Gardens, a fifteen minute walk to The Embarcadero and the Ferry Building, and a five minute walk to Union Square Shopping. The claims of street-noise are also mostly false. The only noise we could hear was the sound emergency sirens, which we only heard during the day. Our first room was absolutely amazing. It was very spacious and well laid-out. It was very tastefully decorated in a scheme of creme, pale green, light blue, and light brown with chrome and wood accents. The beds were extremely comfortable and the art in the room was quite nice. The televisions were great and had many channels. The bathroom was ideal. It was enormous and had a large soaker bath, a stone tiled shower stall, and a separate lavatory. The vanity was very large with a nice sink and elegant fixtures. One of the other great features of the bathroom were the doors in front of the bathtub. They were nice because you could see out of the windows from the bath. From our room on the sixteenth floor, the view was very panoramic. We could see the Yerba Buena Gardens, the Bay Bridge, and many of the surrounding hills (as long as it is not incredibly foggy). The service was also amazing. Almost every single experience we had with the staff was great. The housekeeping staff is fabulous and the butlers were great. Though, the some greatest of all the staff were the Concierges. They were all amazing. The greatest were Caroline and Mariah. They were extremely helpful. Caroline booked tour reservations for us to go to Sausalito, the Muir Woods, and Wine Country. None of their dinner recommendations disappointed. They always sent confirmations of our bookings to our room and also gave us walking directions to all the restaurants. The pool at the St. Regis San Francisco is also great. It is very large and the space is very light, airy, and elegant. The food at the hotel was also phenomenal. We ordered from private-dining several times and both the quality of the food and the service were consistently fabulous. The only complaint was about the mysterious 21% \"Service Charge\" that was automatically added to each cheque. (We enquired about the charge over check-out and the employee at the desk rudely replied that \"It is generally customary at four or five star hotels\". If that is so, why have we not experienced a similar charge at the many other five star hotels we have stayed at!?! Other than the latter experience, I would highly recommend the St. Regis San Francisco to anyone looking for an amazing San Francisco luxury hotel in a convenient location.", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunnyvale, CA", "Title": "\u201cNot that great of a property.

The St. Regis is a breathtaking hotel providing a relaxing experience. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re at a 5 star hotel. I've included some pictures so check them out as well. On our way to the St. Regis we actually drove past the hotel the first time since you enter the hotel through a side street and not directly from 3rd Street. As we entered the hotel we noticed that the main entrance/lobby/bar had breathtaking floor to ceiling glass windows. The decor was very modern and had an upscale feel. We were escorted to the front desk where we were quickly checked in. The man who helped us told us we would get connecting rooms since we had reserved 2 rooms. Additionally, one room had been upgraded to an Executive Premier room (a corner room). I couldn't wait to see the corner room. After check-in we were escorted to the elevators. Our rooms were located on the 9th floor. The first (smaller) room had 2 queen beds and had views of the Yerba Buena Gardens, Metreon, St. Patrick's Church, and the city. The materials, detail, and quality of the room was amazing. The decor is very modern, warm, and relaxing. The wall against the beds are lined with stitched leather panels, the wall/cabinet doors opposite the beds are made from Mozambique wood, and natural stone is used throughout the bathroom. The best feature of the bathroom is the rain shower. I could take a shower all day long. The second room, the corner room (Executive Premier room), was about 20% larger and had a king bed instead. The room had the same design theme and materials as the first room. The bathroom layout was about the same with the exception of it being just a little bit smaller. The view from the room was also the same as our first room with the exception of the corner that had floor to ceiling glass windows with breathtaking panoramic views of the Yerba Buena Gardens and the surrounding area. Lighting, temperature, clock, alarm, phone, hotel services, etc for both rooms were controlled by a touch pad beside the bed. Very convenient to control everything from one point. Like other high end hotels umbrellas were provided in the room which came in very handy since we had rainy weather during our whole stay. Additionally, the rooms had DVD players in case you are in the mood for watching DVD\u2019s. Service throughout the hotel was excellent.

We live in the East Bay, but have only been in the area for a year and have yet to see the sights. So we chose this weekend to catch Jim Gaffigan's performance and visit Alcatraz. We checked in about 6pm. The people at the front desk were very nice, and we were escorted to our room by one of the men who works there. He smiled the whole time, and was a bit pushy when it came to carrying our bags. He would not take my husband's no as an answer. Once at our room, he showed us the electronic system they have set up, and finally left. I'm the kind of person who likes to be left alone to figure things out for myself, so I didn't really enjoy this part of the hotel stay. The hotel room was beautiful. They have a deep soaking bathtub that can fit 2 people in it. The bathtub has doors next to it that open into the bedroom. This was kind of cool. There's also a t.v. in the bathroom. The only drawback about the bathroom was that the toilet and shower were cornered into their own little room, but the door that slides to close-off the these things from the rest of the bathroom leaves a little crack, so if I'm in the bedroom and the doors next to the tub are open, I can see my husband using the toilet. This disturbed him to no end, but it is easily solved by closing all of the bathroom doors. Also, on our first night, we decided to run a bath. The water was very dirty, which we deduced was from an incomplete washing of the tub. After we washed it with a facecloth, the tub was fine. Another drawback was the electronic screen that controlled everything. When we used it to turn off all of the lights in the room, we would awake in the middle of the night to lights turning themselves on. So if you do stay here, turn off the lights manually. It's really annoying to wake up multiple times during the night to lights. This happened on both nights of our stay. We ate breakfast at the Vitrine on Saturday. I got the french toast which was very good. My husband got eggs benedict. He didn't like the food, but that's more his fault than theirs. He had never had it before. Overall the service in the restaurant was good, and the food was very good. The only thing I must complain about is the staff's disrespect for privacy. My husband and I have stayed in many hotels, fancy and not. We expect more from hotels that we pay more for, but unfortunately that is where we get the least. This hotel has an electronic \"Do Not Disturb\" and \"Make Up Room\". We value our privacy a lot, so for every hotel we stay at, the \"Do Not Disturb\" goes up as soon as we enter and comes down when we leave (it does not come off any time in between). For all of the other hotels we've stayed in with the exception of The Palace in NYC, our \"Do Not Disturb\" has been honored. However, it was completely disregarded. Before leaving for Alcatraz, I made sure the \"Do Not Disturb\" was on. When we got back a few hours later, it was off and our room had been cleaned. When we approached Ron at the front desk, he apologized \"sincerely\", said he would report the incident, and offered nothing. Once I got tired to the whole thing and left my husband to argue, Ron offered us free breakfast or a reimbursement for the night's stay we would not be using if we chose to leave at that moment. Needless to say, a $50 breakfast is nothing compared to the $580/night I was paying to stay there... ...We had to speak to 3 different people before they would finally offer us a free night (and that only because we had to ask for it). After Ron, we spoke to Craig (the non manager, I don't remember his last name). He spoke to some woman in charge of hospitality and offered us a 50% reduced rate if we stayed. Finally, we spoke to Craig Chang (the front desk manager) who offered us the night for free. He even sent us a hand-written note apologizing for everything, and left a note at the front desk confirming that the night was free. If it had not been for him, this hotel would receive a star of \"1\" and we would never go back. I have not decided if we will ever stay here again. The room was great, and for the most part so was the service. Just make sure if you ever stay here and there is a problem that you ask for Craig Chang ASAP. Some other good things about the hotel is they have a 24 hour pool and 24 hour room service. We unfortunately did not take advantage of either of these things, but it's nice to have them.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palma de Mallorca, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat Property & Great restaurant, but service off & $15 for internet\u201d", "Author": "DepDawg", "ReviewID": "UR21650143", "Content": "The St Regis is a good location, directly next to the Moscone convention center and 5 minutes walk from Union Square and all the shopping.

On business, I also object to the $15 for 24 hours internet access charge - why do properties do this ?? Finally, breakfast is also not worth it and too expensive.

I guess the best part of the entire stay is that there was no pretense...just smiles and a helpful attitude that definitely deserves 5 stars.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elk Grove, CA", "Title": "\u201cSuperlative hotel!\u201d", "Author": "InstantNoodles", "ReviewID": "UR13718398", "Content": "The St. Regis San Francisco is a Mobil-rated five star (the most highly coveted award in the hospitality industry) property located next to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Moscone Center. I believe the hotel\u2019s location is categorized as SoMa. The hotel is in close proximity to the Embarcadero, Chinatown, the financial district, and Union Square. The St. Regis San Francisco\u2019s main competitors are the Four Seasons on Market Street and the Ritz-Carlton on Nob Hill (the only other properties in SF that are Mobil-rated five stars). Of those three hotels, the St. Regis is the newest with the more competitive rates. I hear the Four Seasons is renovating as we speak and the Ritz just finished their renovations not too long ago. Valet parking at the St. Regis is roughly $52 (average rate to valet park) per night and should be inclusive of taxes (there is a base amount plus tax). Average time to retrieve car is 10 minutes. There are several public parking garages on 3rd Street where guests can park their cars for $20-$25 dollars per 24-hour period. The only caveat is there are no in and out privileges and the garages may close and you will not be able to retrieve your car until the next morning. San Francisco hotels charge a 14% accommodation tax. In addition there is another tax that is also levied but skips my mind but it is less than one percent. Upon arrival, we were generously upgraded to a Metropolitan suite. Check-in was especially quick. I was in my suite in less than 10 minutes after I arrived at the hotel. The hotel was able to accommodate an early-check-in (normal check-in is 3:oo pm). If you need a late check-out it\u2019s advisable to inquire upon check-in so hotel personnel can see if that request can be accommodated; otherwise check-out is at 12 noon. The generic description of the Metropolitan suite on the hotel\u2019s website is accurate. Normally suites of this size (980 sq ft) include 1 \u00bd bathrooms; however, in our suite, there is only one full bathroom. There is enough closet space for two people traveling for several days. The suite is starting to show some signs of wear and tear (to be expected as this hotel opened in 2005?). Some of the wood paneling was smudged and dented (wall and floor). In addition, double vanity sinks are only included in suites. Standard rooms (Superior to Executive) only have single vanity sinks. There are two 42\u201d LG Plasma televisions in the suite (one featured in the bedroom and one in the living room). Also, there is a smaller television in the bathroom. (I have found that this hotel and the Four Seasons offers a better selection of channels to its guests (the last time I stayed at the Ritz, they only have a fraction of the available channels that this hotel offers). The bathroom toiletries are of the \u201cLaboratoire Remede\u201d brand which is the name of the Spa that operates in the hotel. The windows shades and lighting are controlled by an LCD console located next to the bed (in room and suite categories) and on the desk in the living room (in suite categories). As this suite is located on the corner, there are an abundance of windows. The windows DO NOT open. Even from the 12th floor, like many other hotels, street noise can be heard especially emergency sirens. As a previous reviewer mentioned, if you opt to close the shade, be it the sheer or blackout shade, ALL the shades will close in unison. You cannot choose to leave one corner of the shades opened and the others closed. However, you can choose how much of the shade you want drawn. Thoroughly and thoughtfully placed recessed lighting and lamps illuminate the room just fine. FYI: If you require ice, the butler will retrieve it for you; otherwise, during turndown service, ice is refreshed and free bottled water is replenished. The concierge has a DVD library available to hotel guests. The hotel also has a house car, a Bentley, which can shuttle guests within a limited radius of the hotel. Room service charges are as follows: expect to pay a $3 delivery charge, taxes, and gratuity to ANY order placed through room service. For your convenience, 3 cups of coffee is $8, make your own ice cream sundae is $10, and gourmet mini-corn dogs is $17 (all prices exclusive of the applicable service charges). Dry cleaning a sweater is $11 whereas pressing costs $9. There was no price list for the items in the mini-bar. There is an indoor swimming pool, a gym (stocked with fruit, water, and magazines), and a spa (additional cost) available to guests at this hotel. All facilities were immaculately maintained. I had breakfast in the hotel\u2019s restaurant Vitrine (serves breakfast and lunch only). Ame serves dinner. I did not try the bar so I cannot comment on that. The food at Vitrine and room service were of good quality/presentation, but nothing spectacular. There is a Peets coffee shop one block up the hotel for those who want coffee and simple breakfast pastries. The service is definitely on par with what I would expect from a five-star property. Before arrival, a guest relations associate will contact you to solicit information to try to make your stay even more comfortable. Everyone is friendly and helpful (from the front desk to concierge) and will do everything they can to ensure you have an excellent stay while in San Francisco. Housekeeping did a great job maintaining the suite. I look forward to returning when I can.

Everything about the St. Regis is stylish and modern (though not as great as the St. Regis in Manhattan). I loved the TV in the bathroom. Minor annoyances - the tv remote didn't work - probably dead batteries; there was no price list for the overpriced wine in the wet bar - it took 20 minutes to have one sent up; the electronic control center on the nightstand acted up a few times, turning the lights on in the middle of the night; and I find it annoying to be charged extra for the wi-fi use ($15/day). Regarding a couple comments posted earlier about the hallway carpeting, I loved it - a really fun design element. (will post a photo of it) We had the best meal of our stay in the hotel restaurant.

The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is next door. Union Square, Market St. and the Ferry Building/Farmer's Market are within walking distance. The hotel deserves high praise for its location, design, style, technology, amenities and especially its service. The St. Regis and Luxury Collection are the Starwood group's high end chains. Having stayed 3 times at the wonderful St. Regis New York and having visited the St. Regis Monarch Beach CA and Washington DC, I was looking forward to my stay here, and at a convention group rate to boot. The hotel is about 2 years old and located on the corner of Mission and 3rd. Directly on the corner, the facade of a historic 8 story building was preserved and a high rise tower was integrated behind, beside and above it, on what once was a parking lot. The hotel occupies the first 20 floors of the tower; the top 20 or so floors are St. Regis residences. Within the older building are the hotel's 2 restaurants--Ame (dinner) on the first floor and Vitrine (breakfast and lunch) on the 4th--as well as the 2 level spa and offices. There is a landscaped terrace on the roof and another larger terrace on the 4th floor which was tented for an outdoor dinner party when I was there. The lobby in the newer building is compact but stylish and well-designed. A design feature of rose petals is echoed throughout the public areas. Our convention rate was for the superior room category on the lower floors (5-8), so I was pleasantly surprised when I was upgraded to a deluxe room--same size but on a higher floor (15). I also was able to check in early. My room looked similar to the photos posted on 1/1/06 by a TripAdvisor member from Sunnyvale CA. My room faced west with a view of Yerba Buena Gardens, Moscone and points beyond. The east facing rooms face the Bay, but several employees told me the views are often obstructed by the high rise office buildings of the Financial District. The room itself was not too large but contemporary and sleek. The entry foyer had a table, wooden floor sculpture and leather walls. There was another wood wall hanging in the bedroom. The bedside table held the St. Regis signature phone/computer that can control the thermostat, lights, window shades, alarm clock, etc. via a touch screen. There were 2 desk chairs and an easy chair, but no chaise lounge or \"fainting chair\" as seen on the hotel web site. There was a large marble window ledge--great for counter space. One wall held the 42\" flat screen TV (which did not swivel) and 3 recessed doors--one was a too small closet (only about 2 feet of space), another held a safe, fax machine (out of ink) and 3 drawers, the third held the minibar and fridge and DVD/CD player. The spacious bath had an enclosed WC, a tub that opened onto the bedroom, a separate shower stall with marble bench, rain head plus hand-held head. There was a 2nd flat screen TV, but only one sink. In the room and bath, there were not enough places to hang clothes or towels. Technological glitches included: 2 remotes did not work but were quickly repaired (batteries?). With the phone/computer, the party I was speaking to occasionally could not hear me, though I could hear them. The hotel turned this glitch into an example of great service when I requested a wake-up call and the operator called twice but could not hear me, so she sent someone up immediately to give me a personal wake up call at the door. Alas, the phone still was acting up on check out day. Overall service was top notch--quick, courteous and professional--especially the front desk and housekeeping. The problem of a constantly barking dog in the next room was handled well and with many apologies. The doormen were not so attentive--often talking with the valets. No one helped me when I walked up with my luggage when first checking in. Some of the concierge staff, while helpful, were a bit aloof. I believe all the St. Regis' offer Butler Service. In New York this is quite formal, but seems less so here. One Butler I spoke to on the phone was rather unprofessional--when she couldn't answer my question, she yelled/asked another employee without putting me on hold, so I could hear every thing. The public facilities include a medium sized fitness center open 24 hours with the friendliest staff, and a wonderful indoor infinity lap pool, also open 24 hours. The whirlpool, steam room and sauna are within the spa--all are on the small side. The \"Business Center\" consists of 2 computers and one printer squeezed into a 3rd floor alcove by the elevators. This may be a temporary location. Regarding the sound of sirens mentioned in other reviews--yes you can hear them, but I imagine the other nearby hotels--W, Four Seasons, Westin, Marriott--can as well. I have stayed at a few other high-end hotels here--the Ritz Carlton, Campton Place, the Palace.

Check-in went smooth. The views from my corner room were exceptional. Hotel was in a good location. Overall my experience was rather enjoyable and I discuss the room, restaurant and spa in detail below but the Noise level alone might keep me from returning to this hotel in the future. As others have discussed the fire station is located just a few blocks down from the hotel. I am not sure if it has to do with the fact that my room was located on the corner facing the street and that the windows were floor to ceiling but the noise level from the fire engines, police cars and ambulances is unbelievably loud. And the problem is that it is rather frequent and at all hours of the night. All I can say is that I hope they put in better sound proofing for the residences because if I had to listen to these loud noises in my home I would go crazy. Since we got that out of the way I will give you more detailed info about the specifics of the hotel. The Room: The bathroom was of average size with a nice shower and an individual size tub. I found the closest to be a bit small. I was the only using the closest but I imagine that it would be rather cramped for two people. The Plasma was a nice touch but was a bit small given the distance from the bed. The bed was very comfortable. The Maid service was great every time I stepped out I returned to a clean room. The control panel was a nice touch and very easy to use. The black out shades kept the room nice and dark all the way into the morning hours of sunshine. I like the complimentary water bottles they provide every time they clean the room. The internet was a bit pricey ($15/day) but I did like the wireless aspect. The Restaurant: I ate at AME one night and had a great experience. Although it was expensive the service was great and I had some of the best seared albacore I have ever had in my life. The menu is a bit exotic so if you are more conservative you might struggle to find something you enjoy. The Spa: I went to the spa for a 60 minute massage. I found the Men\u2019s locker room to be a bit small and did not like that fact that there was nowhere to sit. You have to leave the locker room and take an elevator down to the waiting area, which is very small and underwhelming. The steam room had an odd smell. The sauna was adequate. The massage was one of the worst I have ever had. I feel that the masseuse did not really listen to my needs and her technique was just odd. I don\u2019t believe it is my responsibility to have to tell the masseuse how to do her job. The bottom line with the spa was that it was expensive and I went there out of convenience but in the future I would probably make the trip to another spa as there are many nice spas in the city and most of them are less expensive. Should mention that a friend of mine (woman) had a massage and enjoyed it so maybe my experience was not the norm. Conclusion: So there was good and bad. I guess the moral of the story is stay here if you don\u2019t care about value and you own some ear plugs then this could be the right choice for you.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel but don't stay here with the kids\u201d", "Author": "Danicro", "ReviewID": "UR8656449", "Content": "My wife and two boys (ages 10 and 11) stayed here in mid-August on the first leg of a California coastal vacation.

Because of my job I don't often have time to do any research for restaurants to go to when travelling. I rely a lot of the time on the advice from the concierge where I'm staying. In the past I've never had an issue. But the concierge staff at the St. Regis needs a major overhaul. It was some of the worst service I've ever had. And that it was in a St. Regis is very surprising. The room was nice and clean. The rain shower was divine. The LCD screen by the bedside didn't always work. When selecting certain lights to go off, they wouldn't work - so we had to unplug lamps. Too bad the windows don't open and the AC blower isn't so strong. For the full story - keep reading. Otherwise, that's about it. FULL STORY: When we checked in, I asked the concierge for a restaurant where we could get Halibut. And maybe something with pasta. He sent us to a place called Rose Pistola in North Beach. When we got our menus we noticed there was no Halibut on it. That was irritating. We asked for a restaurant with Halibut and he sent us to a place WITHOUT it. Very strange. The only other item on the menu that looked decent was the Risotto. They were out of it. By that point it was nearly 9 PM - our choices were to eat there or go back and order over-priced room service. We asked our waitress if the chef would make us \"Aglio e Olio\" (an italian staple). He did, but it wasn't very good. In fact, we didn't see any garlic in it at all. The atmosphere in the restaurant was similar to an Applebees and the food wasn't much better. It was not authentic Italian. When we got back to the hotel I called to speak with the Concierge to inform him that he'd really let us down. He'd left for the day so I told the person who answered the phone. The man said the concierge would call us at 8:30 AM so I could tell him what kind of lousy dinner we had. No call from the concierge the next morning. The least he could've done was apologize. So I called him. That day (Monday) there was a new concierge working. I asked him to find us a place for lunch that served Caprese (that typical italian buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad). He gave us his favorite place, Scala's - and another one down the street. On our way to lunch we walked to a chocolatier given to us by Concierge Number 1 when we asked for a place to buy truffles. We said we wanted the best truffles - but NOT Joseph Schmidtt truffles. Well... We arrived at the address and noticed it was a candy store. They had chocolate items, yes, but none of them were truffles. Not a single one. We then walked all the way to the restaurant for lunch and noticed there was no Caprese on their menu. At this point it was like a running joke. Now Concierge Number 2 had failed. After running a Wild Goose Chase due to unaware and incompetant concierges we decided to just go back and look up Fodor's and Conde Nast online. Though Concierge Number 2 had booked us a place for dinner that evening, I didn't want to risk it. Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is insanity! It was our last night in the city and we were determined to find a good restaurant in San Francisco. Within 10 minutes online we'd found the best rated place in the city that was open on a Monday night (Jardiniere) and booked a table. Back in our room, Jeremy the Front Desk Manager sent his apologies and some wine and cheese. It was a very thoughtful note. Simply the mere mention was nice. Neither of the Concierges apologized. I got the feeling they don't like to admit fault. The trouble is = the database used by the concierge staff is not good. They need to compare that to Fodors and Zagats. Rose Pistola got 2 stars (out of five). That would've been nice to know. Had I known that, we'd have never gone there. Halibut or not. The other problem is they think about their personal tastes... Never once considering the tastes of their clients. They also need to ask better questions. Simply typing in the word \"chocolate\" into their database isn't going to bring up the best truffles in the city. Obviously it's my fault I relied on the concierges. But as a filmmaker, I don't often have time and in the past it's always been a great experience to rely on concierge wisdom. I shall think twice about returning to a St. Regis.

But there are some areas that can need improvements. But first lets get to the positives. full disclosure: we got upgraded from deluxe corner room to metropolitian suite due to SPG Platinum status. Postives: the suites are very large with two flat screen tv and 1 small tv in the bathroom. the bathroom amentities are probably the best I've seen among the luxury hotel chains. everything in the room is controlled by electronic key pad (windows, lights, alarm, do not distrub sign, etc). The property is new so you will have updated modern decor and new furniture. The bathrooms are huge! Almost 1/3 the size of the room itself. Everything was clean and housekeeping came twice a day. it seems like they know when we're leaving and when we're in the room. Turndown service always included bottle water. There was not a morning when they forgot to bring my Wall Street Journal and my requested US Today (you'll be surprised how often hotels forget or don't care). Towels are soft and constantly refreshed and well stocked. Wireless internet in the room! The doorman, bellman, and parking attendants are very nice and knowledgable. This property is walking distance from the shops at Union Square and the SF Moma (but very far from Fisherman Wharf, the piers, Golden Gate Bridge). The decor is very modern, clean, and intricate. They definitely spent alot building and decoring the entire hotel. The pool is open 24 hrs (no lifeguard). The pool is very clean and nice. It is also ideal for swimming laps. The valet service was FAST and front desk always personally called for our morning \"wake up call\" (not a machine). Cons: No ice machine. Unfortunately you have to call to have ice delivered to the rooms. Sometimes its just easier to walk down the hall to get it youself. The shower did not have a curtain or door, so you end up splashing water everywhere. My wife complained that it took her forever to wash her hair b/c of the \"rain showers\". Since the showers did not have doors or curtains, the whole bathroom fogs up, preventing you from using the mirrors afterwards. Most upscale luxury hotels have doors where the toilets are, this one did not. May be inconvient when you're sharing the bathroom with someone else or would prefer more privacy. I like the open feel but not in this area! Internet still cost additional $15 when you are already paying $800+ per night (whereas internet at low end properties like Hilton Garden Inns are usually free).. a bit backwards. Overnight parking for guests is $51. This is the highest I've ever paid for overnight parking at a hotel. The butler service that comes complimentary wwith the room is a bit annoying. She went through the entire routine of showing us where every single thing is down to the light switch and how to plug in your ipod in the dvd player. Wasted about 15min of our time when we arrive in our room. The hotel needs to realize when guests arrive to their rooms, they just want to relax and not be bothered. Breakfast was insanely expensive ($5 for OJ and $16 for Pancakes... before tax, tip, and service charge). I'm sorry... but no plain pancakes are worth $16. The house car (Bentley) was always out or busy, so we did not get to use it at all despite asking every single day for 3 nights. One night we lucked out and it was available but the driver said they are restricted to a 2 mile radius around the hotel (so its pretty much useless in my opinion). Not sure if that was true or if he just didnt want to do his job. The rooms did not have and ironing board, iron, or coffee machine (maybe ppl that pay $800+ a night do not iron their own clothes or make their own coffee?).

When I asked about it at first we were told it was through room service only. Then we were offered a coffee maker with starbucks which we took. It seems that there are 8 butlers on staff in SF compared to 62 in NYC. I do not consider there to really be butler service here. I have read several reviews concerning noise at this hotel I agree that there is an issue with a fire station down the street and when they blast their sirens it is loud even on the 19th floor where we were. But this is city hotel and street noise in SF as in NYC is to be expected. What we loved was the corner floor to ceiling windows in the room we had. It only had one sink in the bathroom but the soaking tub, shower and flat screen were nice. The hotel car was a new Bentley and they took us to dinner each night. The concierge was friendly but gave some inaccurate info on time and distances. The breakfast was good but expensive.

An excellent location, and although guests can hear the sirens from the streets below, I'm not sure what any inner city hotel could do to avoid all such noises. I was lucky to get a corner room which had large windows fully across two walls. The room design and decor were beautiful and delivered a \"zen like\" aura....very calming. I used the large bath tub every day, but also loved the rain shower. I found the room commander screen complimented the hotel's contemporary design, easy to use and state of the art. Several reviews on this site have mentioned the screen was too bright, but they must not have seen the option to dim the panel which fully reduced the light for sleeping. The comfort of the bed was superior, both mattress and linens. My flat screen was positioned directly in front of the bed, and it was very easy to navigate the programming. I found the lobby to be quite intimate and loved the fire wall near the cocktail area. I enjoyed sitting on the sofas, sipping a glass of wine, warming by the fire and watching all of the activity in the lobby.

First let me state that the noise that is mentioned in other reviews is correct, not quite sure why so many fire engines are out and about on a Saturday evening - but I was on the 18th floor and they were loud. But when I look at the amazing view - well they did stop at about 2am - so a trade off of sorts. On to my review. I arranged with the hotel to have a car and driver pick me up at the airport who was there waiting for me upon my arrival in the baggage claim area - sign in hand - and off we went. When we arrived at the hotel (which is about a 30 minute drive) I was quickly greeted and brought to the check-in desk, which was quick, professional with just the right amount of friendliness. My \"butler\" was off with another guest so I agreed to let myself in to my room and my \"butler\" would meet me there within a few minutes to show me how everything works. My room, the executive level premiere, was located on the 18th floor - corner room - just spectacular! Floor to ceiling windows, with a view of the city and mountains in the background - surreal - especially at night (as odd as this may sound to some, I would certainly tolerate the sound of the sirens for this view again). My room was large, beautifully decorated, and spotless. King size bed, beautiful delicious linens, huge bathroom with a large tub and separate large shower stall - stocked with lots of towels, large writing desk, huge flat panel television in the sleeping area (also a small flat panel in the bathroom perfectly placed so that if you were taking a bath the television could be viewed), cd player and a mini bar that was stocked to the extreme. When my \"butler\" arrived he then proceeded to show me how to operate the touch panel that controls various functions within the room - from lights to drapes and everything in between. He also asked if I had any pressing (complimentary) and what time I would like my bed turned down. Their lobby bar is chic and lovely, perfect for a relaxing drink. And their restaurant, Ame \u2013 was just grand with fabulous service, fantastic wine list and food that was truly amazing. The staff and service at this St. Regis goes beyond what anyone would expect and carries it all out with perfection. They pay attention to every little detail from remembering your name to your morning paper arriving bright and early (in the cutest little cloth newspaper bags hung on your door). Lets say that they do more than try \u2013 they succeed!

We live in the SF Bay Area. We arrived a little before check-in time and was told our room was not ready. They offered to store our rollerboard, took our cell phone number and would call us when our room was ready. Check-in was fairly quick and easy. My parents were going to take my toddler home with them for the night. I took my daughter to the restroom in the lobby area to change her diaper. There was absolutely no place to do it. When I returned to the front desk to ask where I might be able to change her, I was told that our room was ready and that someone would take us up. I liked how your need to pass reception to access the elevators - always nice in busy city hotels. As others have described, a \"butler\" escorts you to your room and explains the room to you - in particular, how to use the computer touch pad by your bedside to control practically everything in the room. Mu husband had to remind the hotel about the champagne that he had pre-arranged. We expected it to be waiting for us when we arrived. However, it did appear that the hotel was ready for us b/c the champagne and chocolates showed up less than 2 minutes after my husband reminded them. The room is clean and spacious for a city hotel room. We were on the 18th floor facing the street (not the alley). I agree with the person who noted that the tv was not mounted in an ideal place on the wall for viewing from the bed. Also, it's an expensive high-definition tv but the hotel receives none of the HD TV stations in the area. Unfortunate waste of money. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom only has one sink, but that was not a big deal for one night. The bath amenities are generous - large bottles of shampoo, conditioner, bath gel and lotion from the hotel's Remede Spa. TV in the bathroom a nice touch. The movable wall between the spa tub and room opens the room up. The shower is large with both a \"rain\" shower head and your traditional shower heads. The decor is clean, modern with great stylish small touches. The closet is on the small side, but sufficient for the business traveler or people not staying long. The room had your usuals - slippers, bathrobe, umbrella, safe. Nice selection for the in-room bar and snacks. You also get your own fax. Breakfast was included for us. We ate in the restaurant. Not a large restaurant and we had to wait a few minutes for a table. We were directed to the coffee available at the restaurant entrance, but they were out of coffee so we stepped out onto the outdoor terrace for a looksy. When we returned a minute later, the coffee, table, cups, everything!, was gone. Odd. We went back out and someone came to get us a couple minutes later. The pool looked amazing - wish I had time to partake. The locker room was nice too - clean and had salon products. The lobby bar area looked cozy - did not have time to enjoy. The gym had a ample variety of equipment. As another reviewer recommended - there's plenty of Evian at the gym for you to take! Overall nice experience. People remembered our name and greeted us throughout our stay. Friendly staff. Our past hotel experiences include the Four Seasons, the Peninsula, the W Hotel, Hiltons, Marriotts, Hyatts.

The decor is very modern, with a Zen quality; light, simple lines, fresh, natural, peaceful. The bathrooms are luxurious, and bedrooms, though not huge, are spacious and comfortable. The beds are comfortable and fabrics rich.
