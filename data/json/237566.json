All we knew was the address of the hotel and that it was close to Leidesplein. Also, in one of the reviews, they mentioned it was close to the Marriott by Leidesplein. After finally finding the Marriott, they directed us to the Owl which is just behind the Marriott on a back street. Bottom line, if you can't find the hotel ask where the Marriott is and inquire there for the Owl's location. Throughout our stay, the gentlemen at the front desk were wonderful with directions and tourist information. The trams to connect to any location in Amsterdam are around 3 blocks from the hotel at Leidesplein so it is extremely easy to get anywhere in the city from here. The major museums are within walking distance of the hotel at Museumplein. Despite being close to the trams, the hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood - the best of both worlds.

Before the trip, I have googled about many hotels in Amsterdam and have read few hundreds of comments on various websites. Maybe because it is in the month of August, many of the hotels were full (i checked 6 weeks before the actual traveling date) and the remaining ones cost around 180 to 250 euro per night. So the 132 euro (including all taxes) of the owl hotel seemed like a good deal, plus with all the favorable comments in the trip advisor, I thought it would be a safe bet. To go to Owl hotel from airport, you can get bus no. 197 from bus stop B11 ( outside the airport towards the right ) and get down in the stop 'Leidseplein'. Bus fare is 4 euro per person. After you get off, walk towards Marriott hotel. When you are in front of the Marriott, take the left lane down and the hotel is facing Best Western Hotel on your left hand side. It will be a 4 -5 mins walk. We arrived at 10:30 am and since the hotel was not full, the lady checked us in immediately. Check in was smooth and efficient. The room was about 20 sq m with two single beds pushed together. There was a small closet and desk and chair. The room was small as mentioned by other travelers but at least it was not claustrophobic. We had the view of the back garden and it was rather soothing. There was a small tv (22 \") on the wall and a hair dryer in the toilet. No toiletries aside from soap and shower cap. Beds were comfortable and linens were clean. However, there was no air conditioning in the hotel, so if you arrive in the hot summer days (not that many in Amsterdam) , there might be a problem. We were in room 54 ( 4th floor) and unfortunately the entrance light and the table light didn't work, so we had only 2 small lights above the bed and the room was kind of dark. However, it didn't bother us as we were out the whole day and we only slept in the room at night. I love the fact that the hotel is 'smoke free' so non smokers like me will not be disturbed by stinks and smells of cigarettes and hemp. They also have an elevator so if you have heavy baggage, there will not be a problem. Breakfast was included and there were 3 cold cuts, slices of cheese, cereals, milk, orange juice and a coffee / tea machine. There were slices of bread and some fruits and also boiled eggs. Nothing extravagant but enough to start the day. It would probably be ideal if they could have a Nespresso machine ( seems pretty standard in other hotels) rather than the current one they have because the coffee is quite awful. ( you get weak american coffee even when you select espresso) Location wise, the owl hotel is on the quiet side of the city centre and its close to Van Gogh museum and Rijksmuseum (about 10 mins walk). The amsterdam casino is a 5 mins walk and to the left the casino, there are many restaurants. There is a canal cruise right next to the casino. Going to the city centre Dam area, it will be around 10 mins tram ride. We really liked the location because it was away from the hustling and bustling of the 'Dam' and 'Red light district' and central station and yet close to tram stops and you can walk everywhere. The only negative thing is that the wifi internet cost 3 euro an hour and you need to buy a card in the lobby. They do have one pc in the lobby for guests use. All the people we met in the reception were friendly and could give good recommendation of restaurants. We went to one indonesian restaurant near the hotel which was recommended by the young guy at the night reception and it was very good (not authentic but very tasty). Overall, I do like the owl hotel especially its location though its price is a bit high for a 3 star hotel. If it is within 100 euro then it will be perfect.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "colentina", "ReviewID": "UR116324402", "Content": "We enjoyed our 3 night stay in this hotel situated centrally but in a quiet area.

We arrived at 9:00am, after an overnight flight, and were told that the room was ready so we could have it immediately - that is such a nice feeling to be able to get settled in after travelling for so long. The woman on the front desk told us to go and get settled and then come back down and she would give us a map and help us get our bearings and point out some of the main sites in the city. As everyone has said the rooms are small and basic but they have everything you need and are clean. I wanted another pillow and ran into the housekeeper who dropped everything and went and got me one. Everyone on the staff was very friendly and helpful and were always available to answer questions and give directions. I was impressed with the breakfast - I admit I'm not a big breakfast person but I thought there was a very good variety of foods available. It's good to be able to start the day with breakfast in your hotel and not have to go out searching for it. The lounge and backyard were very nice and I'm sure if we were staying longer we might have made better use of them. I also appreciated the free computer/internet and made use of it several times. The location was very good. It was about a 5 minute walk to the Leidesplein and there was a grocery store a few blocks away, which was handy. We didn't use the trams during our stay because everything was so easily reached by walking.

We arrived there for a spring break and were largely satisfied with our experience. Note, ALL Amsterdam hotels are very expensive , so while we felt that the $132 price tag was a bit much, it certainly compared well to other hotels in Amsterdam. Location- The location of the Owl is brilliant. It is located within a 5 minute walk to Leidseplein -the buzzing entertainment district, but its so quiet in the lane of the Owl, you'd never guess. From the airport, a quick ride by the 197 bus brings you to the Marriott, from which it is a convenient 2 min walk. You're also 5 minutes away from the Museums and the Vondelpark. It has a lovely garden to sit in on a warm day Service- Good very friendly on the whole.Initially, they told us we wouldnt get a room until noon when we reached around 8 am , but later the lovely Marina sorted us out into one immediately. We were relieved not to wait after a long flight. On our way out too, they gladly checked up timings of the 197 Bus for us. Generally very helpful with maps , travel directions etc Breakfast- a bit repetitive- toast, cheese , cereal and fruit everyday but wholesome. Rooms- Our room (double) was a bit smaller than expected, and the bathroom absolutely tiny. But we are generally not fussy about it since we tend to be out most of the time,but this maybe a challenge for people with children or intending to take it easy indoors.Rooms were cleaned regularly.

The first is the wireless Internet, which costs 3 euro for 1 hour and 10 euro for 5 hours. It would be far simpler to pay one amount for the entire stay, or to have free WiFi. The second comment is about the 'twin' rooms - they are not really proper twin rooms. I shared a twin room with my brother. There are two single beds, but they are right next to each other - there is no gap between them, and no way to move them.

We found this hotel in 2007 and have stayed here ever since. This year we arrived mid morning and expected to have to wait till the afternoon to get into the room. However we were asked to wait just a few minutes and then were able to get into our room. This made a very pleasant start to our holiday. The hotel is a few minutes walk away from the tram lines and also a few minutes walk away from the shops, restaurants and nightlife at Leidseplein. The hotel is medium sized, with a small lift which was quite adequate for the two of us and our luggage. The rooms are good sized, particularly for city hotels, with decent lighting and flat screen television. In common with most European hotels they don't supply a tea/coffee maker so we bring a kettle. We have now stayed both in the back and front of the hotel, either side is very quiet at night. Both room and en-suite bathroom are very clean, the housekeeping is quick and efficient. There is a very convenient safe in the room. The breakfasts are of very good quality, slices of Dutch cheese, ham, numerous varieties of bread, and crispbreads, boiled eggs, cereals, fruit juice etc. The breakfast room is light and airy and you can go out to have breakfast in the garden. However although the whole hotel is non-smoking people can and do smoke in the garden, even over other people's breakfasts. There is also a small bar next to the reception where you can get both alcoholic and soft drinks and tea and coffee. There is one PC next to the breakfast room where you can access the internet for free, otherwise there is wi-fi throughout the hotel but you have to buy vouchers to use this. If this had been free I would have given the hotel maximum scores for value.

Also, be sure to get your suggestions for where to eat, where to go and how to get there from someone OTHER than the daytime front desk staff at the Owl. However, the night staff at the Owl was quite helpful and smart by comparison. Part of the problem is that three-star hotels in Amsterdam simply are not of a very good quality when compared with three-star hotels at comparable prices in other European cities.

Check-in was super-fast, but we were apprehensive when we saw the small room that had a musty smell.--opening the windows cleared the mustiness, and once we accepted the small European size room, we began to enjoy the experience. The location of the hotel is unbeatable--5 minutes walk from Leidseplein, with its many bars and restaurants, and the same distance from Vondelpark. 10 minutes walk to Rijks and Van Gogh Museums, the Concertgebouw and the canal cruise, and a 15-20 min walk to Anne Franks' House. Super connectivity to Centraal Station via the no 1, 2, and 5 trams and a 15-20 minute ride. Since pretty much all trams converge at Centraal, that makes it a convenient place from where to get to any part of the city.A nice Jazz bar called Alto close by (in the lane which has Burger King on the corner of Leidseplein). The staff is super efficient and extremely helpful--we asked for extra pillows and sheets, and got them very quickly. My wife sprained her ankle on our visit to Anne Franks' House, and when we asked the hotel reception for a doctor, they arranged the appointment, the taxi, and had us in the doctor's clinic in 20 minutes flat. The reception is manned around the clock, to a large extent by what seem to be family members, who's frendliness and warmth make you feel as if you are living in a Dutch family home rather than a hotel. The entire hotel exudes the easy grace and charm that typifies Amsterdam as a city. Breakfast is the only meal available in the hotel--there are cereals with milk or yoghurt, a fruit mix, boiled eggs, tea, coffee, juice, cake, and three types of breads, cheese and cold cuts, making it an adequate, if not extensive, breakfast. The food was always fresh, and the rooms were cleaned daily, and very thoroughly. The entire hotel is extremely clean and well maintained. There is a safe and hair dryer in the room. The stairs are very narrow, and the lift is good enough for three people, or two if there is luggage. Internet in the room is paid for, though there is free shared internet behind the breakfast room (with lots of Owl figurines to keep you company). There is a small sitting area/bar next to the breakfast room, and another small outdoors sitting/smoking area beside it. The resident cat sometimes can be found here, and seems popular with the guests. A couple of irritants I faced were the light switch built into the bed's headboard which kept switching the bedroom light off and on every time I shifted position while watching TV in bed, and a switch hidden in the top of the bathroom shaving light which took me quite a while figure out.

Leidseplein is a convenient place to be as it has constant trams to the centre running through it and plenty of restaurants & shops. In the other direction, the Owl hotel is less than 10 minutes walk from the Van Gogh museum. Being neatly tucked away makes the Owl very quiet, it's also very clean, nicely decorated, it has wireless internet that actually works, it has happy & friendly staff and it has the 'stairs of doom' as we named them...but it also has a lift so you don't have to brave them. The room I stayed in was adequately sized, clean and comfortable with a lovely bathroom you could actually move about in and a pleasant view out of the window. The Owl Hotel does not provide tea & coffee making facilities in the rooms though which did rather upset my colleague. As I drink neither, I hadn't actually noticed. Included breakfasts are very good continental style breakfasts and they're served between 7:30 & 10:30 which is handy for people slow to leave their bed in the mornings. Really though, the staff are the hotel's greatest asset with their cheery hellos when you arrive and friendly goodbyes when you leave. I spent a couple of evenings at the bar chatting to the staff & other guests that stopped by. Here's a little example of quality customer service... On my second visit to the Owl, I brought my family with me. My daughter is still small so she sleeps in a travel cot usually in our room when we go away.

That might not seem like a big deal, but it is indicative of the staff's attention to detail at the Owl. When we toured round part of the US back in 2008, not one of the half dozen hotels we stayed in had the cot ready for us despite us making sure they had these cots and specifying very clearly we were bringing a baby. Always we had to phone reception and remind them to bring one up.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, VT", "Title": "\u201cNice little place with great staff\u201d", "Author": "Ramblingman99", "ReviewID": "UR56711959", "Content": "Very impressed with this little hotel.

They have free internet access but no printer attached to the computer, so when I completed online check-in for my return flight, I emailed it to them and they kindly printed it out for me.

The location was very good I thought - it wasn't right in the historic center but it's only a short walk away, and it IS just a few minutes walk to the Van Gogh museum and the National Museum. The first room I was given I did not like - even with the heat on it just would not heat up, and the room was not in a corridor like the others but in a stairwell. Based on the temperature of the room (FYI, it was something like -15 outside, there was a blizzard all weekend, it really was freezing) I managed to have my room switched. The second room was much warmer thank goodness, and both rooms were quite nice and modern. The only 'complaint' I have is that they suggested I take the bus to the airport instead of taxi because it would be cheaper, but they didn't tell me that no buses would be running because of the blizzard! I waited in the snow for 45 minutes before walking into another hotel and ordering a taxi (much cheaper than hailing one on the street) - I almost missed my flight. I suppose it's not really their fault, but the second hotel I walked into to order my taxi said that all the locals should have known about that, including them. Oh well...

As Amsterdam is a relatively small city, the location is very good as we walked to Leidseplein and beyond to shop for food or clothes/gifts; visited major museums nearby and caught a wonderful photo exhibit at the small FOAM gallery. The hotel has a computer with internet which you can access for 15 minutes per one euro. The main door is locked at night but the receptionist is always near the desk to let you in.

It was above a continental, but only barely. My other complaint is probably just a matter of personal preference, but the pillows were HARD.

Our room, (a standard double - two single beds pushed together) on the top floor at the back of the hotel, was not large but it was bright and clean, with a modern desk, wardrobe, colour TV, and a spotless bathroom that was positively huge by European standards! The room also had large windows which we could open, as well as a retractable window shade. We had a nice view down to the hotel's little patio and garden below. It was a pleasure to be able to access the garden from the breakfast room - made it feel like we were visiting someone's home! The staff were polite and friendly and were always willing to answer our questions. Our room was cleaned every day and new towels, etc. put out for us. The classic Dutch breakfast consisted of bread, cheese, various cold cuts, coffee and tea, fruit juice, cereal, fruit salad, and boiled eggs, all of it tasty and plentiful; definitely filling enough to fuel our walking trips through Amsterdam! We particularly liked the location of this hotel - close to the Leidseplein in a quiet, treed neighbourhood, yet within easy walking distance of the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Canal Boat Tours, the Holland Casino, and Vondelpark; trams were also available just a few minutes away near the Leidseplein. If you stay at the Owl, be sure to say hello to their friendly kitty cat, Puck. He's a real charmer.

Wonderfully our room WAS ready, and it was spotless. The bathroom (room 26) was more than spotless, with a powerful shower and lots of hot water. The room size was moderate, but we spent little time in our room. The double was two twins pushed together, but that's not that uncommon in most non-chain smaller hotels we've stayed in in Europe. The location was wonderful, away from the noise of the center of the city, yet close to the museums, Leidesplein (and the trams). We walked everywhere and found wonderful restaurants nearby. Breakfast was fine: bread, cheeses, eggs, meats, coffe, juice, and cereal. Certainly enough to get your day going. We would certainly stay at the Owl again if we're lucky enough to get back to Amsterdam. We took the train from Schipol Airport to Centraal Station for just over 3 Euro per person each way and then hopped either the number 1, 2, or 5 tram from Centraal Station to the stop near the Marriott Hotel.
