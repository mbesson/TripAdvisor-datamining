They are operated by the same people and lie only about a 100 meters form each other, however different buildings, so check if you don't want to have any surprises. The location is superb and very convenient to take the metro, only about 250m away. I would say it is a good value for money hotel at a good location, the breakfast is also just average. Personally, I would recommend hotel Lirico over this hotel, it is just around the corner.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut shore", "Title": "\u201cReally good hotel value in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Peachey5", "ReviewID": "UR112222426", "Content": "Sonya Suites is an overflow place for the Hotel Sonya. It is convenient, a few minutes walk to Repubblica where you can get the metro, not much longer walk to Termini. The only down to this hotel is the hard beds although I understand that this is common in Italy. There is a lovely breakfast room where really good expresso and capucchino is available. The front desk staff is very helpful and knowledgeable.

The rooms are a bit jaded, and dated, but very clean. They were cleaned every day, and fresh towels and toilettries every day. Sheets were only changed every second day, not a big issue. We left the window open on the first night, not a good idea as I got bitten quite a bit by the mozzies. Once we worked the air conditioning, we left the windows closed all the time. The air con was great, and not at all noisy, which is a nice change. The room was small, but we were only there to sleep and freshen up, so suited our purpose. There is a safe on the room with a long key, bit inconvenient, as we didnt want to either leave it in the room or be carrying it around. Again not a big issue though. There were plenty of extra pillows, and blankets, and an ironing board, you will need to ask for the iron though. The staff were really nice, and very friendly, and there was always someone around. They have a wake up call service, and free internet also. The breakfast was fine by Italien standards, fresh fruit, some cereal, cakes and breads, juice, tea 4-5 different types, coffee all available. The only thing is the meats are prepacked, I thought they might be fresh, as they are readily available outside the hotel. They were still nice though. The Suites are close to alot of sights, and near the metro for going to the vatican. I did feel we lost out a bit with not being in the hotel. The Suites are on a side street, from the trucks seemed a bit loud. In saying this, the location was perfect, the hotel was clean, and overall it ok. Im not sure we would book here again, as we were moved on arrival, and I kind of like to stay where we book. It suited our purpose for this trip though.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago, il", "Title": "\u201cNot quite what I expected\u201d", "Author": "feismom2008", "ReviewID": "UR62585973", "Content": "I had booked a room at Hotel Sonya. When I got there, they said my room was really at their sister hotel down the block. The room was huge and clean everyday. The marble floors felt good on our tired feet at the end of the day. Not sure what is which European showers, but this is that 1/2 door thing that gets the entire bathroom wet. Since all the hallways were also marble, you could hear every sound. My balcony looked out to a graffiti wall of the opera house. On Expedia, the picture of what I thought was the hotel was actually the Opera House. Gated door required you to put key card in AND ring a bell to get in. I think from a safety standpoint we would have felt safer on the main street than down the block. Breakfast was fair, a few cereals, some buns, sweet cakes, hard boiled eggs, coffee & juice. It was all we needed though. FREE INTERNET in the lobby was key for my teen at the end of the day. Oddly, every day, I assured the balcony doors were locked before we went out, and every night they were unlocked when we got back.
