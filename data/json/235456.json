If you need to 'pop to the supermarket' (or anywhere else) expect at least a half an hour drive. Another reason why we booked this hotel was because it had a pool and 'spa'. We didnt use either once. Check out our pictures to see why! We were only in the room at night when we were completely exhausted after exploring L.A all day long but I would seriously recommend avoiding this place. At weekends it seems its a place where the locals come to party, play their music REAL loud until 6am and deal drugs. Its ok for a few nights but if your staying in L.A for a while look for a good hotel near West Hollywood.

I stayed for four nights on the third floor. The room was pretty mediocre but that was to be expected for the price, but the bathroom was terrible, it had mold, the ceiling was cracked the drain had rust, the water would change temperatures while showering, there would be static on the television when I walked around the room. Im a trooper, I can handle a lot, but I packed my items at 4:30 in the morning when I discovered TWO BED BUGS in one of the beds the last night of my stay. When I relayed this to the front desk, the attendant did not seem surprised of the problem, I was simply given a card and told to call the manager. I also had a room right next to the elevator and could hear everything passing. Compared to all the other reviews, I am hoping that maybe I just got a bad room.

There is a Denny's next door & a McDonald's across the way, as well as a gas station close by. We were about a 20 minute drive from Universal Studios, so the location is pretty good. The hotel is right next to the freeway, but with the door and window shut, the noise was minimal. Upon arrival, we waited to check in for about 25 minutes...and there were only 2 groups ahead of us. It didn't seem that the check in lady had any sense of urgency at all...she was slowly checking everyone in. However, she was nice, so it's okay. The hotel looked pretty nice from the outside...the pool area looked good and the parking lot felt safe. The elevator was a bit musty & scary...we ended up taking the stairs the rest of the time. When we entered our NON SMOKING room, I was taken aback by the stench of cigarettes & cleaning supplies. It smelled like the room hadn't been aired out in months. I immediately turned on the bathroom fan, air conditioner, and opened the windows, and it seemed to help a bit. However, the smell in the bathroom was even worse...like a combination of cleaning supplies and a moldy drain. I actually resisted using the bathroom until I absolutely had to simply because of the smell. The bed felt unclean, and there were cigarette burns in the plastic that covered the mattress. While I was sitting on the bed watching TV, I found a small black bug on my arm, and that pretty much did it for me as far as using the sheets were concerned. I thanked God that I brought my own pillow & slept ontop of the sheets. The sink in the bathroom turned on if you turned the knobs both left and right, so it was tough finding that magic \"in-between\" spot that wouldn't leave the sink dripping all night. I had to sleep with the windows open because the smell of the room was literally making my stomach churn. There are no safety mechanisms on the windows, so I felt a bit unsafe doing this, but I didn't have a choice. Also, this made the sound of the freeway deafening. I don't think I've ever had a worst night's sleep at a motel/hotel. Checkout was prompt and the checkout lady was very nice. All in all, you get what you paid for.

People were walking and talking loud and the phone rang at 2 am. We hardly got any sleep. THE MOST HORRIBLE THING WAS, what they call \"house keeper\" opened our door after we told her NOT TO COME IN and she still opened the door while we were undressed. We were so angry ! When I gave back the key I told at the front desk all about the situation and room condition and that I am going to leave a very bad feedback about the hotel and the very poor house keeping service.

I had to cover them with towels. The room smelled like cigarettes even though it was a non smoking room. The carpet was disgusting do not walk barefooted. The bathroom floor was stained. There was someones elses shavings all around the sink. But the worst was that you could not sleep!!! The hotel is right next to the interstate 5. It is loud especialy with a broken window.

I would not reccommend this hotel to anyone...if all you want to do is sleep you might be ok if you stayed on the east side as the west side faces I-5. We weren't particularly inteterested in amenities and the hotel could have been alright for the price except for the fact that the internet only worked for a out a couple of hours while we were there. I brought this to the attention of the mangagemnet who seems to be under the impression that just because he is transmitting a signal means the room can connect. Not True!! Something as simple as resetting the router might have solved this problem but was not done. Clean enough I suppose but the shower was plumbed backwards and only a trickle of water came out.

I had asked for a non-smoking room but the room reeked of stale smoke (esp. the bathroom). Someone had carved grafitti into the inside of the door and the screens on my window were broken. THere were stains on the cieling and obvious red wine stains scrubbed out of the bathroom counter. The linen really stank of cigerette smoke as well and the bed was pretty stiff. I was a bit nervous by the neighborhood, but basically it was a quiet night and no one bothered me. I got into my hotel at midnight. There was a security staff patrolling the parking lot at night, but that actually made me feel better about staying there. They were nice enough.

The tv in one of the rooms didn't work using the remote and it couldn't be used manually because most of the buttons were missing. When we complained to the front desk they supplied us with three extra remotes, none of which worked either,(the problem was the tv not the remotes), they wouldn't send someone to check the tv, wouldn't replace the tv with one that worked and wouldn't give us a different room. All the doors have good locks with electronic card key access and peep holes, but the rooms have windows that are single pain aluminum sliders. There is no secure place to lock up valuables when you are not in the room. Seems to be the place to stay if you like wild parties.
