Our stay began around 9pm at night. We had contacted the hotel staff to let them know we wouldn't arrive during their working hours (staff is only there for a few hours every morning). They left the room key inside this little combo lock box that was built into the door frame. Weird. From there it took us about 45 minutes to find our room. The hotel is inside a larger building that has regular residential apartments. The main lobby and 1st floor rooms were easy enough to locate, but we were told that we were on the 3rd floor. Back out to the main stairway we went and up... lights were out on the floor... super. Two doors on the floor: one normal looking room and one big glass door leading to who knows what. Our key by chance opened up the normal door... which was a storage room or something. No lights, and stuff thrown all over the place. We reasoned that this couldn't be our room; but were kind of freaked out that our key opened some random room that wasn't really part of the hotel. Made us wonder if the same key opens every room. Tried the glass door next: this was the correct door. More rooms beyond this door. This place really needs to put some signs up in the hallway to guide guests to the rooms. Our room was ok, but gave us the feeling that it wasn't built for people to stay in. The sink and shower were stripped down to basic copper piping and garden faucet style knobs (supposedly the art part of room)... looked like it was made from dumpster scraps. The shower head needed fixing as it spurted out only a few tiny streams of water. I laughed when I inspected the bed: it was literally a 2 inch thick piece of foam on a wooden frame. That's not a mattress. Again, suggesting that the room was built from salvaged scrap material. I think we saw one staff member upon check out. So that's something to consider... you are pretty much on your own at this place. This was certainly a unique hotel, but you couldn't pay me to stay here again.

No, not in the least. Frankly, all I wanted was a room in which to sleep. And as far as rooms go, these are certainly special.

Though there might have been more convenient hotels I had a unique experience and left happy that I choose to risk staying here. For the purpose of my review, please note that I stayed two nights in Freedom (actually a prison cell) and two nights in Therapy. If you are considering staying there, remember forewarned is forearmed: The registration desk is only open from 9-12 and they mean it. If you need help at other times call the mobile and don't waste your money with the main number -- no one's there and you'll just hear a long message directing you to the mobile anyway. Pack a travel alarm clock. There's nothing telling time in the rooms I enjoyed. The first had a TV with a couple channels and the other didn't. When you arrive, listen to the whole introduction to the hotel before asking questions. The staff has a prepared set of instructions and most of the things you need to know will be covered -- just be patient and save questions for the end. The main downside of this hotel is the location. The street is kind of boring and in an expensive, not-really-happening part of town. It's also not too dodgy, so that's a plus. You can easily catch the train to the big tourist spots and Propeller Island City Lodge makes a great jumping off point for the rest of Berlin. I'm American so the lighting system (very normal in Europe) threw me for a loop. Lights on motion sensor and timed to shut off meant I got startled by lights going on or off when I wasn't ready for it. The upper levels of the hotel and the fire escape were intimidating as well, when I went exploring one night. (Who wouldn't in such a place?) There's a glass door in front of a barred door that was as frightening as any haunted house I've gone through back home. I like haunted houses, actually, so the fact that the hotel seems relatively safe and quiet despite the scary atmosphere made for an entertaining night. A couple things, in relation to earlier reviews: the staff (who some have called clueless) were very helpful in all of the times I dealt with them. And the noise level (some people mentioned it was noisy) was not a problem at all. I didn't hear one other person at night.

(Incidentally, the shower taps in Forest are, for some reason, labelled backwards. The hot tap turns on the cold water, and vice versa. A little disconcerting, yes, but okay once you've worked out what to do!) The rooms could have been a little stuffy, although both of mine had their own private balconies and I had no issue with leaving the balcony door open for ventilation overnight.

The lodge is only a couple of minutes from the Ku'damm. The tour buses run along it but leave from the other end. It is a pleasant 15-20 minute walk (which would've taken us a lot longer if it wasn't Sunday and the shops were closed). I loved this place and would definately consider coming back. This apartment didn't have an overtly sexual undertone unlike some of the other rooms. It is in a peaceful and sedate area so the only drawback is if you want lively night-life on your doorstep.", "Date": "September 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cReally did not like this place\u201d", "Author": "SFVoyager", "ReviewID": "UR5880767", "Content": "I stayed here during a time when there were NO other rooms to be found in Berlin, so i am grateful that they had a place for me. Also, the staff was very very friendly. BUT, i ended up in a single room (#38) which was exceedingly small, and had no shower in it. The shower was down two flights of stairs and through the lobby. There was a toilet, but if i had been just a few inches taller, my knees would have hit the opposite wall. The sheets didn't seem that clean, and the hallways had a slight but persistent smell to them due to lack of ventilation. The room looked out on an interior courtyard, so i had to keep the curtains closed all the time, and the light was not particularly strong. The room wasn't particularly \"creative\" - just cramped and tired-looking. I would have preferred a youth hostel, and for the price, i do not think it was good value, particularly compared to the Ku'damm 101 just around the corner.", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cHand crafted for fun sex romps.

A fourth bed is tucked under the top bed with a pulley system to open the bed\u2019s door. Like sleeping under the stairs. Two tall, thin windows side the sink and a barred window is by the middle bed. The windows look into treetops and vines. Each single bed has a metal shelf with a candle and reading light. The switch for each light operates with the main room light by the door, not independently, meaning you walk down the ramp to turn out your light. The wall paint is mottled wrapping paper with safety zone diagonal black and yellow tape going every which way. Overlapping corrugated panels cover the ceiling lighting. There are two yellow and black wall sconces. The custom audio system didn\u2019t work in the room. The room was clean and smelled fine. Location was close to the front desk. Room doors are thin, heavy and close loudly. A key deposit is required. The rooms have no clocks or alarm clocks, nor does the desk supply one upon request. With the doors closed you can clearly hear tiptoe footsteps, people quietly having sex, outdoor noises and the previously mentioned loud doors. Perhaps this hotel isn\u2019t intended for sleeping. The computer is in the stairwell on the way down to the gallery. Use it during the day since it is locked up at night. The breakfast room is large, bright, and attractive and has a two-chair porch. Meusli, cold cuts, cheeses, pumpernickel/pinon nut bread and some fruit are available. The hotel location is South of Adenauer Platz, a lively location off the Ku\u2019damm. You can buy ordinary supplies or groceries nearby, plus expensive furniture and clothing. There are cafes, restaurants and theaters. Bus M29 and the U7 subway line are close. People walk around the area at night. The hotel is visually fun and creative but the audio aspects (noise, no \"included\" hotel music offerings, no alarm clock) and having to walk down the ramp to shut off the light would deter me from staying a second time, unless a travel companion really wanted to.", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWeird, fun, friendly and did I mention weird!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4326754", "Content": "This place is great.

We stayed at the Glass house. Gallery Room is also great. However, I was disappointed when I asked the staff to show me around to several rooms and they only showed me a couple of them, with the excuse that they were too busy. When you visit such an intriguing hotel you may want to have a quick look at other (unoccupied at the moment) rooms, especially if you intend to come back and stay at another room for a different experience.
