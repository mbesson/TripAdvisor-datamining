The tv was adequate and the room was weirdly cosy in it's own way. I had the best 2 nights sleep in a long time! Oh and the shower pressure was great! The man on reception (who I presume is the manager as I never saw any other members of staff) was absolutely lovely. The hotel is in a great location with just a short walk to the Prado, Reina Sofia and Thyssen-Bornemisza museums, the Parque del Retiro, and the Plaza Puerta del Sol.

The lobby was very homey looking, but maybe due to the holidays we never saw anyone there except when we rang to check in the first day. This was the wonderful thing about the place--it was so quiet, like our own private hotel. We only saw the desk clerk when we checked in, and on the night before we were to check out, he came to tell us he would not be available early in the morning so very conveniently had us settle the accounts at that time.The rooms were cleaned and made up every day when we returned.

Small balcony and \"French doors.\" WiFi available but sketchy. We requested a room NOT overlooking the street but didn't get one. Perhaps it was the language barrier. We had little exchange with the proprietors who were lovely but spoke no English. We were there in November so a/c was unncessary.

It was a little more posh than I had expected for the price. The reception area is very nicely appointed, as are the rooms. Our bathroom was clean and well-maintained. We had a large closet and a small writing desk. For the most part it was quiet. The street that runs in front of it is mostly residential, but there is a restaurant across the street and a bar several doors down. The large windows are double glazed I believe, and it really blocked out any street noise that might have been an issue. The only night that was a problem was the night Real Madrid lost the match against Barcelona to decide which team was going on to the European championships. There was some major rowdiness going on down the street from soccer fans (drunken, depressed and angry soccer fans from the losing team I suspect) which neither the thick windows nor ear plugs could totally drown out. BUT, that being said, we didn't have a problem with noise any of the other nights we stayed there. They also have courtyard rooms available. The door to one of the courtyard rooms was open when it was being cleaned after the previous guest had checked out and the courtyard view looked pleasant. The owner is friendly and attentive but unobtrusive. The lobby is very nicely scented - with what, I'm not sure, but it's a very pleasant smell - but it can be strong at times. I mention this as just a heads up to anyone with sensitve asthma that can be triggered by strongly perfumed scents. The Prado and Retiro park are a very quick walk (10 mins) from the hotel, as is the Plaza Mayor, Puerta del Sol and other centrally located Madrid attractions. There are also some decent tapas places scattered throughout the neighborhood.
