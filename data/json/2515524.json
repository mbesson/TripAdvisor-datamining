Upon arriving in sunny San Diego, I gave the hotel a call (be sure to keep the phone number handy), and the free airport shuttle was dispatched. The driver was very courteous and knowledgable. The person running the front desk asked me about my room preference ... I wanted it quiet, so he gave me a room on the third floor away from the current street maintenance. I found my room and went to the pool ... well kept with plenty of lounges. Upon returning to my room, I asked for a room change to be closer to the pool and still on the quiet third floor. The front desk was very gracious and accommodating, and I had in the blink of an eye, a room to my liking ... far from the street and close to the pool. I didn't see any free popcorn, but there was coffee, TV (with HBO), microwave, refrigerator, hair dryer, iron w/board, beach towels, and a room safe. The office lobby also had free internet and WiFi. This was certainly nice when I checked out as I was able to download and print my boarding pass. I went to the zoo. A free shuttle to and from was provided. Actually, the hotel provides free to and from shuttle to all the local attractions. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel, but I walked the short distance (perhaps 4 - 5 blocks) to the trolley station and easily accessed downtown. In fact, the \"Blue Line\" goes all the way to Tijuana. The cost was $2.50 each ride, or $5.00 for an all day pass ...a great deal! The other review didn't care for Bunz (hamburger/hot dog restaurant on the property). I ate there twice. The prices were reasonable and the food was good. Although I had a late departure, they let me hang out in the room for two hours past check-out. I would most definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cThis is a great Days Inn\u201d", "Author": "AnnArborMiBob", "ReviewID": "UR128347824", "Content": "This place advertises itself as the highest rated Days property in San Diego, and it is easy to see why. The room was big, had a decent desk at which I got much work done, also had a small round table surrounded by two cushioned chairs, had a relatively new refrigerator and microwave, and all of it worked! (That included the drain plug mechanisms in both the bathtub and sink, which I've had trouble with in far ritzier hotels.) The folks who run this place are taking care of it. The free microwave popcorn, granola bar, and bottle of water (replenished daily) were another nice touch. And the rate I received (with my AARP discount) was spectacular. My business had originally booked me at a Hilton about 0.6 miles east, for about 2.5 times the rate, and I don't really feel like I missed much. (And the Hilton would almost certainly have charged me for parking and Internet, while this Days Inn did not, and the wireless connection was a quite reliable five-bar signal.) I'm perhaps stretching a bit to find things to gripe about, but here are a few: The window heating/cooling unit was a bit cranky, requiring some experimentation to get the temperature right, but once I did it stayed right. Also, I arrived before check-in time and discovered that my luggage was going to be stored in a room that was indeed locked, but that the routine for retrieving it was that the staff unlocked it and I found and removed what was mine myself; that made me a little nervous. Also, I do *not* recommend the new in-hotel restaurant, Bunz (which is not actually run by the hotel, but only renting space from it) - The Amigo Spot in the Kings Inn to the west, and the Seven Seas restaurant a few doors to the east, are both better choices. But all in all, the experience was at least as good as one would expect in a hotel somewhat more upscale than those in the price range of this chain. I will stay here when I come back to San Diego next year, and again forego that Hilton.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denare Beach, Sask", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, Great value!\u201d", "Author": "LaurieAnn70", "ReviewID": "UR128027443", "Content": "Hotel was clean, staff was polite, pool and hottub was very nice and the free shuttle service was great!

The room also came with a fridge which was extremely convenient since we had a lot of food stored in an ice chest from the day we spent at Sea World. Upon reading reviews I was informed to ask for a room in the back, which I did. I can't compare it to the rooms in the other buildings, but I did like being in the back near the pool as it felt a bit more private, almost like an apartment complex. I especially liked being able to use the covered parking. Disappointment: One thing I had been especially looking forward to was breakfast, which was supposed to be provided in the pool area, but when we asked the woman at the front desk she had said that was no longer available. It was not a big deal, but I really had my mind set on some muffins or orange juice. Tip: Being that I was sharing a room with the family we went to Sea World with, we only received one parking pass. If you want another parking pass, the hotel requires you to pay an amount which I can't remember. Rather then doing that, I just opened the lid of a trash can and found a parking pass that someone had thrown away. Call it what you will, but I didn't want to spend anymore money here. Overall: As I had mentioned and there was nothing to blow me away. I believe though that I extremely overpaid for this room though.

The motel itself is overall disappointing (my room was way in the back of a parking lot- and in all honesty I didn't feel tremendously safe hiking over there at night)- the carpet/tv etc was \"fine\"- and I wasn't really expecting much. This review however is because this was literally the WORST customer service I've ever experienced. I was traveling for an interview at UCSD- and they have a shuttle that goes up the hill. When I asked the front desk about it- they replied that I could just call 15 minutes before and that would be adequate. I called them at 7am on a Saturday (presumably a time when the shuttle wasn't probably too busy)- it was POURING rain actually- and I just called to \"inquire\" if there were anyway that the shuttle could come around to the back- about 100 feet- but given my suit + suitcase etc it would have made a big difference given the rain. The first guy told me he would check and I should call back in 5 minutes. When I called back- the lady on the phone told me \"she didn't think it could work\"- but when prompted she agreed to just ask- because it was POURING- and I don't see how it made much difference at all for the shuttle driver (literally on the way out of the parking lot)-- especially given that they had said I was the only passenger so far. Then some other lady- named \"Joy\" came on the phone and asked \"what my problem was\" -- and that now the shuttle had other people to take and it needed to leave immediately. I replied that I would run over there that second- and although she said \"ok\"- when I got there (soaking wet)- the shuttle had just left. Furthermore Joy and the other lady told me to be \"patient\" while I was waiting there soaking wet for a shuttle I had called about 30 minutes before. Like I said- I've never been motivated to write a complaint- I think it's ok to ask for something politely that would make a big difference in pouring rain- but I didn't act insulting about the question-- and I felt they went out of their way to be difficult and insulting. Another person interviewing with me had a similiar experience with them trying to arrange the shuttle. Anyway- they are grouped with at least 10 other cheap hotels- their price I'm sure is not so much cheaper to warrant this degree of poor service. I would definitely look at any of the other motels in the vicinity- because although you might not expect much from a motel like this-- it's reasonable to expect them to at least try to be nice (or have some BASIC service skills).", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guildford,Surrey", "Title": "\u201cOnly OK...\u201d", "Author": "KarenBeachcomber", "ReviewID": "UR120452299", "Content": "Stayed here in August with my family for a couple of nights.

The shuttle bus would have been good but only if you tipped the driver very generously.

However, when we tried to arrange this, the colleague was really rude and said said he was busy and made us feel ridiculous for mentioning it.

Secondly they only willingly go to destinations of their choosing ie. SeaWorld, the Zoo, Lego Land and a couple of other places I wasn't interested in.

Beware of the paper thin walls as well--if you have noisy neighbours it might make it difficult to sleep in peace. We also were unable to make use of the outdoor pool as it was quite chilly outside and it is in the shade. It is also quite small. I wasn't crazy about the fact that housekeeping didn't replenish things like sugar, stir stix, cream, etc. on a regular basis. Also, despite a written request to please provide decaf coffee instead of regular we kept getting the wrong kind. Tea was available on request only and didn't come in the room. This was bothersome.

But we had a fridge and microwave in the room. The best thing about the hotel is the comfy bed, the cleaning and the location. The best mall (Fashion Valley) is just a 2 min drive away and so is another mall with bigger shops like Target and Best Buy.

The Good: The hotel was easy to find. Located on a strip with tons of other hotels right off the highway. The staff was very courteous and friendly. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and conducive to sleep. Microwave and small refrigerator. The Bad: The hotel is right on the highway. We were issues a room on the second floor, closest to the road, which meant closest to the highway. On the first night I thought a Police car was going to come through the door into the room . The highway noise is very loud. I mean, very. I suppose if you were in the back of the complex, or even on the side away from the oncoming traffic it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, maybe not even noticeable. In defense of the hotel, our room and the room above it were probably the worst for noise so it may not be fair to judge the whole hotel this way. Speaking of noise, I don\u2019t know what this hotel was constructed from. I bet it wasn\u2019t originally a hotel. I say this because of the squeaky floors. I could hear every step the family above us made as they traversed the hotel room continuously. Walking with their heavy steps, pounding across the floor, boom, boom, boom, squeeeeek, thud. It was like a bad apartment building. We\u2019ve stayed in a lot of hotels, and I never remember hearing anyone above. So, ask for a room on the top floor if this kind of thing bothers you. Thank goodness I sleep like the dead. Parking. We arrived late on the first night and found the last parking space in the hotel complex. I know it was the last space for sure because we drove through the whole complex. While we were always able to find a space, it was tight and not always near our room. On another note, I think there is a conspiracy in southern California to weed out large cars through the application of small parking spaces. We were given a luxury car at the car rental as they were out of what we purchased. So we got a big car. Good luck in those tiny parking spaces. You may fit into the space but have to exit your vehicle through the trunk and hope you don\u2019t run into whoever you parked next to. No breakfast. Some of the reviews mentioned a continental breakfast and I could have sworn I read something on a website about a breakfast, but when I inquired about its location with the front desk, an eyebrow went up along with that \u201cwhat are you talking about look?\u201d So, no breakfast, but there was coffee in the lobby as well as a coffee maker in the room. We looked at the pool and Jacuzzi, they looked nice but we did not experience them. Would I stay here again? Maybe, as long as I was on the top floor and away from the highway.

Booked here due to the above-average reviews on Trip Advisor and the rate with the AAA discount was probably the best I could find booking just six days away from arrival date. Also, this property doesn't show up on any of the bedbug report websites, which was another big reason for booking. Booked directly through the hotel toll-free line to ensure we got the AAA rate (though the ihotelier.com booking engine showed a slightly cheaper rate, I opted to stay with the res I called to make; I'm a big believer in booking directly w/ a property vs. relying on a third-party system or agency website). We arrived slightly after 6 pm to check in; front desk clerk was polite and efficient. Stayed in 2 rooms on third level of the next-to-last building (note: the last building \"the Sunset Wing\" has enclosed hallways, which is probably why the management can call this a \"hotel\" when the majority of the rooms are clearly motel-style and open up to the outside). There are elevators in each building, but they are not large -- if you need to ride up in a wheelchair you might want to call to verify you'll be able to fit in the lift. A computer in the lobby for internet access is available for checking in for flights or looking up local restaurants or attraction info. Bedding linens and bath towels were all clean; carpet looks recently installed -- no stains or bad odors. Standard room has mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, iron and ironing board. Doors had working locks and felt safe (yes, there was a _tiny_ gap at the bottom of door, but I'd attribute this to the building settling over the years - and the door frames followed suit). The couch in the room was the only sore spot for us: there were clearly white stains on it and it was very old and faded -- management should swap these out or just get rid of them altogether. Disgusting -- we laid towels down on this just in case. We ordered a grilled cheese sandwich for our son and a bottle of wine from Pam Pam to accompany the pizza we ordered from one of the chain pizzerias -- they delivered without issue right to our door. Parking is still free. Bed was very comfy and at night the room was quiet aside from room AC we turned on or bathroom flushing. Rude neighbors insisted on allowing their door next to ours slam shut in the morning despite the fact that we had our doorknob \"quiet please\" sign out, but that's not the property management's issue. We didn't try the pool - no time for that. Didn't bring laptop computer, so can't speak to how good the wifi coverage is, but used my AT&T Blackberry for looking up info -- good strong signal coverage for AT&T wireless users. For breakfast recommend Ricky's Restaurant on Hotel Cir. South nearby -- very good! Overall, drove away the next morning thinking we got great value for the price we paid. I'd come back and recommend to travelers on a budget, but there's another major property in Hotel Circle area I want to try also that is suppose to have had major makeover on their rooms recently. My one last comment to management: consider moving the cigarette butt receptacles AWAY from the elevators: non-smokers do NOT want to smell cigarette smoke as they exit the elevator; consider putting these at the end of each building (maybe one day San Diego will follow Santa Monica and Culver City's examples and ban cigarette smoking in public places altogether).", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burnaby, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel for good value\u201d", "Author": "juliechen", "ReviewID": "UR94303627", "Content": "Stay in this hotel for 2 nights before our Mexico crusie vacation.

My only compliant is I wish they played the movie a little earlier. It didnt start till 830pm so wasn't over until close to 10pm. My younger two passed out both nights around 9pm so it wasn't worth it for them. And I have to agree, the resturaunt was not very good at all.

The food wasn't very good and when we got our bill, were upset to find out that the Happy Hour specials were not combinable with the Kids Eat Free specials.

I have had my reservations since February and since that time; I have been asking questions making sure that I made the right choice in staying here instead of the Host hotel. My judgment has proven me wrong. My stay started on June 21. When I checked in at 1130pm, I advised that I would need the shuttle service tomorrow. One of my main questions that I continued to ask before my stay was questions about the shuttle. Even the week before we came, I received an email advising me about the shuttle and I emailed back asking if I needed to make reservations before my arrival. Ingrid, responded no do not worry about it you can do it when you arrive. Okay no problem. Now when I tell the agent I needed the shuttle at 145 and 730 he states, it only runs every two hours and there is no room on the 730. Never once was I told that the shuttle runs on certain hours and I was told not to worry about shuttle reservations. He further proceeded to tell me I could stand on the shuttle. I have two children with me that are under 10 years old. How safe would it be for them to stand? We took our chances and caught the 730 without standing. However, the driver was almost 15 minutes late! If we were 15 minutes, late the shuttle would have left without us. The room. That is a sad model of your hotel. We first were in 351 but after I complained, we moved to 130. The problems with 351. The bathroom door would not open or shut. I finally had enough when my 7 year old was stuck in the bathroom. The crack under the door was so large I could see outside lights through the bottom of the door. My kids had a great time slipping papers back in forth underneath the door. Same problem with 130.The toilet constantly ran. I advised the agent of these issues and he stated he would put in a work request. The next day we were gone from appx 930 to 630 and the repairs were not completed. After that, I requested a room change and moved to 130. In that room, the issues were the door and the mold in the shower. By that time I was so frustrated I just gave up. At the restaurant, I was charged for my children every breakfast that we ate there. According to the email that I received, it states Kids Eat Free at Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner at the Pam Pam Caf\u00e9 and Grill! Children 12 and under receive one free kid's meal from the Children's Menu with each adult entr\u00e9e and beverage purchased. Why was I charged? Isn\u2019t that false advertising? On my departure, my flight had changed and I spoke with the agent to change the shuttle. I told her that I needed to be at the airport by 7:10 and I knew the shuttle only ran every 2 hours but if it didn\u2019t have anyone else at 6 or 8 could they possibly take me. I was told no. No explanation straight out no. Fine I reserved a taxi and that was that. The next morning on my check out, I saw the shuttle sitting there even thought I was told they could not make an exception for me. My taxi arrived and off I went. I had friends still at the hotel and I called them at 8:00am and asked them to go see if the shuttle was still there and it was. Instead of offering a courtesy since I had prior issues with my stay, I had to spend $ 25.00 on a ride to the airport that should have been free. Overall, my stay was one of the worst that I have ever experienced. With my daughter on gymnastics, we stay at numerous ones throughout the year and if I ever end up back in San Diego, I will make sure to avoid this hotel at all costs. I truly believe my entire stay should be refunded because of this experience. They responded with a run of the mill answer and never reimbursed me even though I had written proof.

We came to enjoy 8 days of vacation time after a busy seminar in Los Angeles. Here are the GOODS: The location is close to the main highway and good shopping sites such as Fashion Valley Mall and Mission Valley Mall (which I HIGHLY recommend for any fashionista who wants amazing deals...go to Loehman's outlet and Nordstrom's Off the Rack....prepare to spend a lot of money but on dirt cheap deals!). Parking is quite ample and FREE with a pass given by the hotel. There are MANY rooms and different wings to the hotel. This hotel is one of the few that offers a kitchenette which includes 2 hot burners, a good size fridge and 2 sinks...along with pots, pans, dishes and cutlery. They also provide soap but no sponge! The whirlpool is decent. NOT SO GOOD: There are elevators located at the far end of each building...which can be a walk away if you have a lot of suitcases. The rooms are very basic with extremely old furnishings and beds that are hard as rocks. Rooms with kitchenettes ONLY come with 2 queen beds which was a waste of space as it was just for my husband and myself. Both beds were equally terrible. Pillows were so old that you could literally roll them up in a small ball. The hotel advertises a heated pool and free internet...the pool was NOT heated-rather cold but your body temperature adjusted. One family had purposely booked the Days Hotel because of their \"heated pool\" but were disappointed. Even though it is quite sunny in San Diego, the initial walk in to the water is VERY cold. The pool is small but situated away from the hotels in a fenced area with excellent landscaping. Be prepared to have many kids jumping in the pool and splashing you in the face...there is a NO DIVING rule but the kids don't care and dive in anyways...constantly. The internet is free...which was the main reason we picked this hotel-however, from the get go our connection was terrible. We would either have to stand in the bathroom, in the tub to get a signal, or go outside our door...very inconvenient. The front desk were helpful in trying to get us connected with IT support...and offered us a chance to move rooms which was nice. We didn't want to haul around all of our stuff and chose to stay there. So be prepared that your internet connection is below par. The closet was TINY. Overall, this hotel is quite old even though it boasts itself as being \"the best Days hotel in San Diego\" which is probably untrue. The staff is quite nice and the location is EXCELLENT-very close to Sea World and always within 15 minutes of other hot spot areas. We also got an excellent deal through priceline where we only paid $69 a night for a kitchenette room...the normal price through other services was $109 a night which I would classify as a bit too extreme for an old style, very plain hotel. I wouldn't pay more than $75 a night for this place. If you want something cheap and don't care about the hard beds, small and old rooms (the bathroom always smelled like urine), and don't use internet...this hotel is good for you. In future, I may come back but not to spend more than a few days here. At least we had a cheaper price and the free parking/sub par internet to tide us over. There are many other hotels right near by, it would make sense to keep an eye out.

I'm not sure what the qualification between Days Inn & Suites and Hotel is exactly, up till we got there, I had no idea they were affialiated at all, but there were hints all over - similar logo, actualy pamphlets of Days Inn lurking about, etc.. Regardless, we chose this hotel because we got a deal through work for it - And when your family is big enough that two rooms are a requirement and you plan on staying multiple nights, that is a good thing. I did read up, on this site, actually about it prior to booking, and decided it was worth the value. Our first night there (Friday) we arrived about 30 minutes before check-in, though it wasn't a problem at all. We booked 1 room with the mini-kitchen, one without, and got what we expected, though one of the TV's would not 'function' with the remote (remote DID work in the other room, so it wasn't the remote) - but we didn't care enough to complain - Watching tv isn't what brought us to San Diego.. When we returned Saturday night, however, because we arrived back in the hotel between midnight and 1am, the hotel reared it's ugly head, as a previous poster said, and was the main reason for my post. Previous poster wasn't kidding when they said not a large vehicle friendly place. We have an extended Expedition, and while I had no problem on Friday, because all the 'regular' parking spots (in front of the rooms) we vacant it was a non-issue, fit right in - But Saturday night, in the dead of night, I found NOTHING I could fit in. Yes, there were about 4 spots open, and if I was travelling by myself in a sub-compact miniCooper, I might've fit in. So large/wide/big/long vehicle owners take note - You will NOT want to arrive after everyone else. Now the good part. A security guard, I believe, was VERY helpful at getting me parked. He saw me drive around 2-3 times and later stopped me and had me meet him by the entrance. He 'created' a parking spot for me up by the front - I say created because it's the best way to describe it :) I'm no fool, and there was no actual spot there, but he chizzled me into an unmarked space that was deep enough (kinda over some of the foilage) that I didn't stick out enough to be a target bumper for the 1st person not paying attention. I truly thank that gentleman for his assistance and only wish it wasn't 1am so I could have gotten his name. Ironically, there were a few more he had to tend to after me, and whoever the employee from inside was that he dragged out of the office, well that fellow must've had a spot in the lot, because the two were bickering about the employee needing to move his car out of the spots to free them up, and he was unwilling. Another big plus. Admittedly the rooms weren't the greatest (I suspect this is what gives the place the \"Hotel\" name as opposed to \"Inn\" in the Days food chain - But we didn't mind - When you are getting a hotel at a fair price less then most others, you just kind of assume \"room quality\" is why - And there was nothing to complain about, mind you - but nothing to brag about either. Except, that is.. for the outside area. The outdoor pool and hot tub were both nice, encased in a mini-outdoor paradise. It was well landscaped and really was a shining star. As if that wasn't enough, they had a 'to-order' BBQ grill going, with decent food and decent prices - Something rare! AND... Although we missed Saturday's feature, on Friday and Saturday, they play movies out there by the pool as well. Probably on a 70-90 inch projector, it was a good size, well viewable by all. I don't know who's idea that whole area is or was, but they deserve a raise. We've been to San Diego may a time (and elsewhere) and stayed at many different 'level' of hotel - This was really nice. While the parking bugged me, it was NOT a deal breaker. I knew thanks to this site it might be an issue - But they DID assist me and get me parked somewhere. (though in the morning, when a few cars left, I did scurry down there and move to a 'regular' spot pretty quick, for fear of being banged into by one of those other cars I was next to, not the same spacing as you find in the lined regular parking lot area). Factoring the pros and the cons, I'd stay there again, though I will watch my time on returning at night, for fear of missing the night that helpful gentleman works. :)", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Twin Cities", "Title": "\u201cAvoid this hotel\u201d", "Author": "vikingsfantwincities", "ReviewID": "UR71482873", "Content": "The room we initially had was disgusting.

We were looking for a great value, clean, comfortable rooms, and great service for a stay of 5 nights/6 days. Boy did we find it! The front desk staff were always helpful in answering our many, many questions about the area and the shuttle drivers should be commended for their friendliness and flexibility. Even when looking to go to areas that weren't noted as specific shuttle locations (Old Town, nearby Fashion Valley Mall), they still offered to take and pick us up as their schedules allowed. For those worried about the WiFi availability, I didn't have a single problem with it whatsoever (and was located in the middle of the 2nd floor). I was taking an online class that extended through our stay and needed to submit daily assignments, as well as take a 2-hour exam one of the days. The connection was always stable, as well as the speed, even during peak traffic times such as the evening. I was actually quite surprised by this as some of the reviews speak negatively of the availability. This was the only location I accessed it from, however, so I can't be quick to say that I would have been just as lucky in other areas of the property. They also offer a wireless printing service, but I never personally used it. Overall, it was a fantastic experience. I feel as though people are often to quick to complain, as if they're specifically searching for flaws in the first place.

We really enjoyed the pool and especially on the weekends when they served food. It was a decent price and a nice weekend night to sit at the pool and have some food. The only thing we would probably dislike would be we had a room below one of their restaurant. It wasn't extremely noisy, but once in awhile you could hear things moving around below. The restaurant itself was really good food and we are normally picky on what we eat. I would highly recommend to anyone visiting the San Diego area to try and take a look at this place first.

The price and location were both good so we gave it a shot. The rooms were OK- clean and functional. The pool area was very nice. The parking.....well let's just say that the parking lot is for small cars. Very small cars. It was a very tight squeeze to drive through the parking lot aisles between cars at night. And most of the vehicles were average size, not huge. It was very difficult to find parking anywhere close to the room unless we got back to the room by 5pm and didn't didn't leave again. The service- well even though the room was a good value we expected friendly service. It was truly hit or miss. Some front desk interactions were friendly; others were frustrating. We had friends that also stayed in this hotel and they went to breakfast at the diner because they were told that kids eat free with a paying adult. When they got their bill and realized they had been charged for the kid's meal, they were told (rudely) that this policy did not apply to breakfast. That would have been nice to know before! We had to request items from housekeeping several times and it was usually because they missed it when straightening the room. We had to go to the desk twice in 1 week for toilet paper because they never left it in the room...even if we had less than 1/2 a roll. Overall, I think their communication was off. I kept trying to overlook most of this by reminding myself of the great rate. In the end, it was a $10 parking charge that made me say \"never again\". Our parking pass flew out an open car window while driving, so we were charged $10 (per day) to replace it. Thank goodness it was our last night there, or I would have left anyways. I understand the charge is stated on the pass, but that $10 charge seems like an insult....charging us to circle the lot 5 times before finally finding a spot 2 buildings over.

We chose Days Hotel because it offered the best value for the nightly rate. First things first: If you are looking for a luxury room with a luxury price, look elsewhere. There are several luxury hotels and resorts nearby where the room rate will be much higher and you will pay even more for parking and Internet access. The Days Hotel is conveniently located--it is minutes away from downtown San Diego, Old Town San Diego, Sea World, the zoo, Balboa Park, Belmont Park, and other local attractions. It is located right beside busy Interstate 8; however, we had a room near the front of the building and did not notice any highway noise. The Days Hotel is an older hotel but the rooms have been renovated. We opted for the kitchenette room. The room was a standard (not oversized) two-bed hotel room with a small self-contained stainless steel cooking unit in the dressing area. The cooking unit has a sink, a two element electric cooktop, and a medium-sized dorm refrigerator. There was a microwave oven on the dressing area countertop. Above the kitchenette unit was a cabinet with a skillet, large saucepan, plates, cups, and silverware. The kitchenette was conveniently stocked with dish detergent, a sealed sponge, a dish cloth, and a dish towel. The kitchenette seemed like a good idea when we booked the room; however, we ended up only using the microwave and refrigerator. With two adults, two children, and our luggage in the room, space was rather tight and the room just wasn't big enough to allow us to have a serious meal. If a microwave and refrigerator are included in a standard room, we would skip the kitchenette option if we stay there again. The room itself felt very clean, although the carpet (particularly near the door) could certainly use a deep cleaning. The sheer curtains were very dirty where the air from the air conditioning unit blew on them. The bathroom and dressing area seemed very clean. The shower surround, bathroom floor, and dressing area floor had been updated with modern tile and they were spotless. However, the pocket door between the bathroom and dressing area seemed ancient and it did not operate smoothly. The beds were clean and comfortable--we especially appreciated the way they sandwich the blanket between two sheets. Overall, we didn't have any significant concerns about cleanliness. My wife is rather sensitive to cleanliness and she felt our room was quite acceptable. The hotel has a very nice heated pool and a hot tub at the back of the property. Our children were quite pleased with the pool, even though it was too cold for my wife and me to venture in. We were staying at the hotel at an extremely busy time and the (free) parking lot can get full. If you are renting a car, you might want to avoid the giant SUV or Crown Victoria. Some previous reviewers had mentioned this and it proved to be very accurate. Also remember that you can only park one car at the hotel--this was not a problem for us. Regarding the service, we did not experience any of the unfriendliness reported in some of the reviews. The maintenance staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The friendliness of the front desk staff was about average. One of the nicest things about this hotel is their shuttle service to major points of interest, including Sea World, the zoo, and other attractions. You MUST sign up for the shuttle and space is limited, so check their schedule and sign up early. Even though some reviewers have criticized the shuttle service because of the need to sign up early, it still seemed like a valuable benefit to us. You can also conveniently purchase tickets to attractions at the front desk; however, we were able to beat their prices by using our AAA discount or Internet coupons. Be sure to do your research before you leave home. Overall, we were happy with our stay at Days Hotel. Some of our friends stayed at a nearby resort at twice the nightly rate (plus optional parking and Internet). They saw our room and said their room was not significantly better. The resort had no shuttle service whatsoever and their front desk recommended calling a cab or taking mass transit. We had originally considered staying at the resort and felt quite vindicated having chosen Days Hotel.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buckeye, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBeds are surprisingly comfy\u201d", "Author": "jeromepablo", "ReviewID": "UR68601479", "Content": "I was reluctant to use this hotel after reading some of the reviews but took my chances, I am glad I did, it didn't smell, the beds were comfy and the staff was friendly and informative.

The only real negative thing I have to say is about the PAM PAM cafe, we had breakfast there our first morning, what a mistake. The food was horrible and the staff was RUDE. Days Hotel should be ashamed of this place. We got a buy one adult breakfast and get the kids free deal through the internet booking process as did several other guests.

Pros: We arrived right on time the hotel allows to check in, the receptionist was a little cold but he was prompt and efficient. We did not wait long to enter our room. Our room was small but well managed. The table with 2 chairs are very useful for our diner - not very convenient to watch TV at the same time though. The cleaning ladies were very helpful with my request to have a new bottle of dish soap The location is great : close to everything we wanted to visit : the Zoo, Sea World, minutes to downtown and Cabrillo. I was in need of a new pair of jeans at 9PM to wear to the Zoo the next day, and Fashion valley mall is only 2 minutes driving away. Wi-fi is free, and slow but it was okay for our basic internet uses. It was very quiet at night. We had no problem sleeping and I am the kind of person who is very hard to sleep. Very fast check out Cons: The kitchenette was very small and not very convenient - located on the right of the toilette sink - so very cramped and no place to prepare the food prior to cooking. I do not like the sliding door of the toilette, it was very heavy at first and made me feel claustrophobic. The room was a little bit dusty in my opinion. I have sinusitis so my nose is very sensitive to dust. I coughed the whole night after touching the TV remote control. Pillows were hard and stiff.

I booked the upgraded, business class room with two queen beds for our family of five (two adults and three kids ages 5-9). This room is in the hotel's newest remodeled building and is the only building that opens to an interior corridor. All the other buildings open to an outside corridor. This building is also closest to the pool area, and comes with covered parking. The business rooms include snacks which I thought would come in handy with three kids. We did not get what we expected. First of all, the room was so small, there was no way a family of five could stay in this room. We were on top of each other the whole time. We always travel with an air mattress in case we run into situations like this, and it was good we had it. We had to rearrange furniture to fit the air mattress in. When I spoke to the front desk staff about the size of the room and how it was supposed to accomodate five people, she just apologized and offered to move us to a room with a kitchenette. This room was the same size so we did not switch. She said all their rooms were the same size. The kitchenette room, however, felt a LITTLE more roomy because the bathroom area was laid out differently and seemed to have more space, but the sleeping area was the same. As for the snacks in the room, they were a joke. The snacks were an 8 oz. bottle of water, a granola bar, and a microwave bag of popcorn. For the extra amount I was paying per night for this \"upgrade,\" I could go to the grocery store and buy a lot more snacks than what they provided. As for the room, it was supposed to be newly renovated, but it did not look like it. The carpet was sticky in spots--you know the type of room where you end up putting all your used towels on the floor because you don't want to touch the floor with your bare feet. The bedding and mattress were fine, but the pillows were very uncomfortable. They were really thick and firm--not soft at all. It was better for me to sleep without a pillow, and this may be personal preference, but I did not sleep well for the two nights we stayed there. Everything in the room was older and did not look \"renovated.\" The bathroom area was small as well. We were close to the pool which was nice. It was not noisy being closer to the pool which was a concern of mine. Bottom line, I would not pay the extra money to upgrade the room to the business class. It simply was not worth it. I told this to the front desk staff and they refunded the difference and just charged us the standard room rate. I was happy with this resolution. The staff at this hotel was very nice and accomodating. The pool and hot tub were quite nice and enjoyable. The area was clean. The restaurant, Pam Pam Cafe, was also nice, particularly the staff working there. We were always greeted with a smile and enthusiasm. The people seemed to enjoy what they were doing and it came through in their work attitude. The food was good too, typical diner fare. One other nice thing about this hotel was that parking was included, but the spots are small and tight (this may be a California thing). The parking is outdoor unless you are in the business class room which has covered parking--again not worth the extra money. There appeared to be plenty of parking spaces available. If you choose to stay at this hotel, don't pay extra for the business class room. If you have more than four in your party, you'll need two rooms in order to be comfortable. You might also want to bring your own pillow just in case, as well as a pair of slippers or flip flops to wear around the room.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canterbury, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cQuite happy at the Days Inn\u201d", "Author": "omalleycat_9", "ReviewID": "UR53909631", "Content": "We stayed at the Days Inn Hotel Circle January 5 - 13 2010 Location: Hotel Circle is just that, a huge circle of hotels and their restaurants on a busy road/freeway, not very scenic or within walking distance to much of interest. However the Fashion Valley Mall is 10-15 minutes walk away (there is a trolley station there too), there is a mini-mart/liquor store a few hotels down, and a bus stop outside the hotel. It doesn't take long to get to Seaworld, zoo etc by car or hotel shuttle. Hotel amenities/services: Computer with free internet access in reception was great. We absolutely loved the Pam Pam onsite restaurant, we ate there every night of our 8 night stay and several breakfasts as well. Children eat free with a paying adult. We thought the food selection was great, the prices reasonable, the atmosphere lovely and the staff mostly friendly and attentive ( we especially liked the lady who sometimes had her son in doing homework). TV in the corner if you want to watch sports. Free shuttle service is invaluable, there is only one service a day to each Seaworld and Zoo but it gets you there a few minutes before opening and picks up at closing (we found we needed the full days!) We did have a mix up on our last day of shuttle use, they agreed to take us down to the bayfront (not an official shuttle destination) and said 10AM. We went down to reception that morning to ask if they wanted to add us on to the Seaworld run instead of making a separate trip just for us but the driver said \"No I won't be ready for you until 10.30\" So at 10.20 we duly went down, the shuttle turned up soon after and the driver asked where we had been, he had waited for us at 10. He had definately said 10.30 (my husband and I both heard it clearly) but he insisted he had said 10. He called us a taxi which was nice, but my husband was unhappy and we wished we had just taken a taxi in the first place much earlier! However it is a free service and this was not an official destination so can't really hold this against the hotel. We had used shuttle for 5 days previously and it was very convenient with drivers helpfully making sure everyone knew what time pick up was. My husband was very keen to do the laundry once he discovered the seats and TV in the laundry room, he was most impressed with this! Room: We had a triple all-in-one room with kitchenette on 2nd level. Housekeeping standards were slightly lower than the other similarly priced hotels we stayed in while in the U.S (a few not quite clean pieces of kitchen equipment, bath could have been a bit cleaner , some little bits of paper on the floor in the corner of the room that were there on our arrival and still there on our departure) but this didn't detract from our stay. There were one or two cockroaches around in the mornings but they didn't worry us (we were really surprised at the lack of flies around in California - here in New Zealand they are a big problem in houses in warmer weather). The toilet blocked on first use (a bit embarassing!) but they sent someone up to sort it out immediately after we reported the problem which was great and there were no further problems. The first time we were in our room when someone walked past normally outside on the balcony we thought the San Andreas fault had opened up! The entire floor of the room would shake every time someone walked by but this was more amusing than annoying. We live in an 1800s wooden house which has fairly bouncy floors, but it seems very stable compared to the Days hotel! We had no noise issues from either the road or other rooms. Staff: We were VERY grateful to get into our room 4 hours before check in time, upon our arrival just prior to 12 the staff member sorted a room out within a few minutes, we would have been happy just to have the bags stored until official time. Desk employees were generally a little more abrupt than we had experienced in our prior hotels on this trip, however they did handle everything efficiently and we were impressed with how they dealt with a huge influx of guests coming off a cruise ship. One older lady desk employee could not give us any help on how to take public transport to downtown San Diego ( a fairly popular destination I would imagine!) and told us to look it up on the internet so we didn't seek any further advice from hotel staff about sightseeing, transport etc. So there were a few minor issues which needed to be reported for the full story but we had a very enjoyable stay nonetheless and have great memories of our time at the Days.

Getting to downtown San Diego was a breeze, which involved a 5 minute walk to the tramway station on the otherside of the freeway and a $6.00 day pass allowed you to travel all through the metropolitan area (would recommend the farmers organic market in Little Italy each week....wonderful food). There were sufficient restaurants within a short walk to feed us (although being vegetarian was a bit of a challenge) and the staff at Pam Pams were great.

Shuttle: A big reason we booked this was for the shuttle, as we didn't want to rent a car. Be aware the shuttle runs to limited places, airport, zoo, Sea World, Marine Base and at set times, so the shuttle is not there for whenever you want to come and go. If the shuttle is not busy, they may take you other places, however, we took the shuttle to Old Town and when we called for a pick up, it was not available for over an hour, so we took a taxi back (cost $12). Also, even if you sign up for a pick up time, the shuttle may be early/late and will not wait for you, they pick up whoever is standing there and leave, so be early to your pick up. Also, airport times are also set, every two hours, so we had to take the shuttle three hours before our flight. (or else take the one hour before our fight, that's taking a chance) Con's: Lot's of noise from nearby freeway and streets, (so bring earplugs or run the a/c or fan all night), little choice in eating without a car, their Pam Pam Cafe is just OK, nothing special, another places you need to walk to, computer in lobby was always being used and the night before/morning we left, the computer was broken so don't rely on this to print boarding passes, spa/pool are small considering size of place, so they were very crowded when we went.

After reading the reviews I thought this hotel was going to be quite good, and was expecting the staff to be super friendly as it has been said before. After travelling by car from Las Vegas we were eager to just get to our room. Upon arrival receptionist Bianca was a little cold, no smile, no welcoming just doing her job. We had requested 2 beds, we get to our room and we have a king bed!! Go back down to reception which is a hike as we were on level 3 and very far back from the front of the hotel. Bianca issues new keys and tells me it says on her computer King Bed. I had paper work with me and it clearly says 2 beds. Ok go back up to new room and the keys don't work!! Totally annoying!! Go all the way back down and she wrote the wrong room number down, and said a very reluctant ' sorry'. Finally got to our room. The room has a very musty smell, I think the hotel knows this, as on Level 3 the next day all available rooms had their doors open to air them. Rooms are ok but the smell ruins it. Part of our package was free continental breakfast. I'm thinking cereal, juice, toast, fruit um no.... you get a juice and a choice of toast, muffin or bagel, just 1!!! Another issue we had, was when we were out in downtown we lost our hotel room key with our room number on it! I know silly!! But anyway we rung the hotel and told them to cancel the key just in case someone has found it and gone to our room. But no!! the hotel could not cancel our key because we have to be there in person to recieve the new key?? huh??? It was their 'policy'...after much discussion and getting quite firm with them, they finally cancelled our key. Apart from these issues the hotel shuttle saved this hotel from getting a 1 star!! The shuttle was very helpful and accommadating. I think they should print a timetable so it is clearer on when the shuttle leaves and picks-up. I did hear one family say it did not pick them up from the zoo when it was meant too and they had to get a cab.

It was hard to find much under $150.00 in the area. When I first booked a year ago the reviews on this site were not bad. I had booked a king size room in the business room section because they received the best reviews. We had to postpone our trip a couple of months so when I rebooked those rooms went up past my budget so I went ahead with the standard king size room in the motel section. I will admit I was really worried based on the reviews I had read here. When we arrived we were about an hour early for check in but it was not a problem. They had two rooms available and they gave us the choice of either first or third floor. We picked the third floor thinking it wouldn't be as noisey. I think we made the right choice. The people working the desk were very friendly. The room was pretty clean and much better than what I had been expecting. We had a king bed, love seat, table with three chairs, microwave and fridge in the room. My husbands family owns a motel and he is really picky when it comes to other motels and finding places where they don't clean. He was completely satisfied with the room which does not happen very often. I guess if there was any complaints it would be the crack under the door. It was a pretty wide gap and I would think bugs and other things could easily get in. We didn't find anything in the room though so it wasn't an issue. I read here that people were complaining about the thin walls but we could not hear any of our neighbors other than when they let their door slam shut. It is all non-smoking but I don't understand having all the ash tray containers right outside the doors. When someone would stand out there and smoke it would still come into your room. My husband is highly allergic to smoke and it was a problem a couple of times but you couldn't complain because they were smoking where they were supposed to I guess and not in the rooms. The motel is located near the highway so it was an easy on and off. We only ate at the onsite restaurant one time for breakfast and it wasn't bad. Our biggest complaint with the location of the motel is that there isn't any fast food restaurants any where near the place. We even took out driving and never found anything.

Of the many places we stayed this was our least favorite. I suspect that this hotel has a new area and an old area. Our room was definately in the old part. The room itself was not very clean. The bathroom was old and small, with a sliding door that didn't close properly. The bathroom was dirty (drips of something down the walls) and not very nice. The handle to flush the toilet was broken and you had to flush carefully or it would come off in your hand. We had the type of room where you feel a little uncomfortable because of the wear and tear and cleanliness. The pool area was nice and the kids enjoyed a swim. I'm assuming that there are much nicer rooms at this hotel and we just didn't get one. On the plus side, the front desk staff were helpful in suggesting places to see and eat at. They were also great for giving us driving directions to areas we wanted to get to. We were only in San Diego for 2 nights and really didn't spend much time in our room which I was thankful for. It just wasn't the type of place where you were comfortable going back to your room to relax.

I arrived, showed my credit card and went to my room. Security was really tight. The room card worked after only six or eight swipes. Even though I reserved a room with two beds for my family of four I was assigned a room with one bed. When I returned to the front desk, I was told that my confirmation number was not a reservation but a request. Say what? After a couple of hours of delay I was given two rolling beds. Then later extra towels (it was a room for two remember). Then replacement door keys with still tight security taking a number of swipes to enter. Be careful with the keys. They told me high security was my fault for putting the keys in my pocket with credit cards and a cell phone. Say What? By time the room and beds and towels were arranged, we missed the 9PM closing of the restaurant so be sure you get fed before insisting on beds. You can bypass the security restrictions by leaving someone in the room at all times to open the door. If your needs fit the room design, it is a good place to stay. The toilets are small size so you need not worry about your littlest child having trouble sitting on them. Fortunately we also had the slow draining bathtub. It gets your feet washed during the shower and keeps your feet warm while you dry off. There are three washing machines to serve more than 200 rooms. That's just right for the three loads a family of four generates. You can buy a roll of quarters at the front desk. The last load is at 9PM and the door locked at 10PM so arrive early with your beach wear and travel clothes. We missed out since another family was in before us. Great breakfast at the Pam Pam cafe in the hotel complex. Good staff help there to start the day. Plenty of parking. I was told that morning of my reservation I could get discounted Sea World tickets when I arrived later that night. Oops, they were sold out the week before. If you're lucky enough to get a room near the elevator, you won't need the wakeup call. You can listen to the ding at each floor as people return at night and leave the next morning.

CAMERAS STOLEN!! CLEANING PERSONNEL MADE UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY INTO ROOM\u201d", "Author": "TravelingtheSkies", "ReviewID": "UR17347594", "Content": "My husband and I were traveling from Oklahoma with two other couples and chose the Days Hotel for our overnight accomodations the night before our cruise departed San Diego. Note that their shuttle from the airport doesn't take you directly to the hotel. You may stop at the San Diego zoo, Sea World, the cruise terminal, etc. to pick up/drop off others before you actually get to the hotel 45 mins to an hour after being picked up at the airport. Upon arrival, my aunt (who arrived earlier that day) warned us that the rooms smelled so terrible that she wasn't sure if she could sleep in it. When we got our room, we had the same problem. The smell was terrible. Very strong musty and stale odors. Little did we know the smell would be the least of our problems. The next morning after breakfast (which by the way is NOT free), my husband noticed our cameras had been stolen from our room!! $2,000 worth of cameras and equipment. Gone. Coincidentally, when he walked up to the room after breakfast, which happened to be at 10:45 a.m. and checkout time is 12:00 noon, cleaning personnel were scattering from our room when they saw him coming. After contacting the San Diego Police department, we were informed that this happens frequently at this hotel!! They must be making more money from their camera resales than their rooms!! You would think some of the \"extra\" proceeds would be spent to freshen up the rooms! When we approached the girl and the man in the lobby/front desk and informed them of what happened, they were uncooperative, rude, and inconsiderate. Unfortunately we didn't have time to pursue it before our shuttle left to take us to the cruise terminal. Upon our return from the cruise, I insisted that their management tell me why cleaning personnel were in my room at all before checkout time!! Their representative (I have a name if you'd like to contact me) informed me that there was no way and that they do not enter rooms before checkout time. I told him my husband caught them in there! They finally removed the key lock from the door and electronically tracked the entries into our room. SURE ENOUGH!!! It proved what my husband had said that there WERE IN FACT cleaning people in our room when they should not have been in there! We were checking out that morning, therefore they had no business in there before noon. The hotel representative (again, I have his name if you'd like) claims their time log shows the unauthorized entry at 11:56a.m. (which by the way is still before noon), however I have breakfast receipts showing either #1 the time stamp on their door locks has the incorrect time, or #2 The Days representative \"conveniently\" added an hour to the entry time of the cleaning folks. Either way, my cameras are gone, never to return. My 4-year old daughter's first dance recital DVD was in the camcorder, as well as my son's Kindergarten graduation DVD, and many other moments in our lives that cannot be replaced. Not to mention we took a cruise with no cameras. I asked their representative to fax or email a copy of the key entry report he obtained and that we were discussing, but he said he would not provide a copy to me, and that I would have to obtain it though the Police Dept. or my attorney, which is what I am in the process of doing at the moment. The last time their representative and I spoke regarding the incident (Friday), he became beligerant, accusing my husband and I of having \"changed\" our stories, lying, and basically fabricating the entire story. After speaking with him for the last time, I felt like I was on trial for my cameras being stolen!! Needless to say, I doubt the Days Hotel will replace my cameras without getting our attorney involved. Their representative seemed quite used to the procedure of dealing with customers who have had belongings stolen with his canned responses and defenses for the hotel, which coincides nicely with the statement from the police department. He even mentioned more than once that \"everyone else\" who has something stolen, or \"all the other people,\" etc. I am certain I am not the only one. With this said, I am contimplating contacting Primetime or 20/20 Investigates or Dateline to expose this apparent ring of camera theft at this hotel! If you choose this hotel, HANG ON TO YOUR BELONGINGS!!!! I am a firm believer in what goes around certainly does come back around. I hope whoever has my cameras feels really good about the money they make on my cameras after throwing my DVD's of my children in the garbage. My husband and myself are both employees of a major U.S. airline and have been for nearly 50 years collectively. This is the first time in our lifetimes of traveling the world that we have experienced such as this.

Called from the airport and was told that the shuttle would be there in 35 - 40 minutes. When the shuttle arrived the first thing the driver does is apologize for taking so long. (Got hung up at the cruise terminal) No problems checking in before 4 and asked for a quite room as I am a light sleeper. Gave us a room on the 3rd floor. Room was very clean and no moldy smell as some other reviews indicated. Never had any problem with the maid service. Room was always clean before we got back from our day of fun. Beds, linen, and pillows were all comfortable and clean. The way they run their shuttle service I thought, was great. When you check in they give you little slips of paper with times available for drop off and pick up to the zoo or Sea World and other spots. One little tip for those who might be traveling there. If you need the 7am shuttle to the airport on a Friday confirm with them if it is running because they use that time to shuttle the parents of the Marines Grads to the Ceremony. The shuttle was always on time. I even noticed that the drivers had no problem dropping off some people to other locations after they went to their primary stop. (ie they went go to Sea World first then they dropped off a couple at the intrepid.) The hotel is ideally situated. A simple 10 min walk and you are at the Fashion Valley mall or the trolley terminal. Not that much in terms of name brand restaurants immediately around the hotel but there is a Cheese Cake Factory and P.F. Changs right at the mall. Ate at Pam Pam's twice and the food was good. The front desk staff was more than helpful and always pleasant. I got a fax while staying there and they called twice to remind me that it was at the front desk.

They arranged everything and it work great. The only thing that I have to complain about was the noise. As in previous reviews the level of noise in the hotel is quite noticeable.

Phew!! So after I did the normal checking around the room I determined it was very clean and tidy. I did not find anything wrong. We used the pool in which was very clean and at the back of the property away from the street and you needed your room key to get in. A secure pool area. The onsite restuarant was convenient for the one night a meal and a couple of beers in the room was in order. I would come back and stay at this hotel, although price shop around on the hotel circle as all the hotels are right in one area and next door to each other.

That was a deal and it saved us a fortune on parking. Check in was fast and pleasant. Small lobby with a computer with internet for guests to use. Room was nice size...2 double beds, TV with cable, coffee maker. We had 2 people in each bed and a crib in between them and 2 people on the floor and still room to walk around and room for all of our luggage. They have a shuttle bus that takes you to and from the airport (about 7 or 8 miles away) and Seaworld (only a mile or 2 away). The shuttle bus stops running at 10pm which sucked for us on the return since we had 6 people with bags so we got totally ripped off by Sea-top Shuttle which charged us 10.00 per person for a 10 minute ride. It would have been cheaper for us to take 2 cabs, even 3 but my husband did not want to wait. When you have a group of people, a cab is cheaper since they are not per person. I argued with the driver that I thought his price was too high since we had 6 adults and he told me by the time I hire 2 or 3 cabs it would be the same. We should have just taken a cab anyways. Our return room had a nice kitchenette in it with small fridge and microwave. the next morning though was noisy and we kept hearing alot of loud people outside our door.

This was a good omen of things to come. For about $75 a night, I was upgraded to an inviting business room in the hotel's newer Sunset wing. In addition to a comfortable king bed, blackout curtains, microwave, refrigerator, coffeemaker, hairdryer, light-up magnifying mirror and good-sized TV, the clean and well-furnished room was graced with many welcoming touches, including complimentary bottled water, snacks and toiletries. There was ample counter space and no shortage of places to sit and relax. I was pleased that the building offered covered parking for my car, and never had a problem locating a spot - though the hotel was nearly full with post-Christmas guests. I didn't use the jacuzzi or pool, but a number of guests appeared to enjoy the nicely landscaped pool area. The location was great -- close to the I-8 freeway and Fashion Valley's shops, restaurants and movie theaters. I enjoyed my meals at Gordon Biersch and Sammy's Wood-fired Pizza. A few quibbles: the building desperately lacks adequate insulation. Every time someone shut a door, my room reverberated. No joke. I could also hear people talking in the hallway, walking above me and traipsing up/down the stairwell. When my upstairs neighbor turned on their shower faucet, it sounded like a flood threatened to deluge my ceiling at any minute. Bring your earplugs.

After we made a phone call to the hotel from the airport, a driver from the hotel picked us up at the airport within a short period of time (15 minutes?) Check in was quick and easy. Our room was on the 2nd floor accessible by an elevator, but it was quicker to take the stairs. The room was your average Days Inn room - 2 queen size beds, full bath, tv and enough storage space. We did like having the small refrigerator in the room. As we were visiting relatives in San Diego, we did not rent a car, however, if you are staying here for vacation without knowing someone there, I would strongly suggest getting a rental. There was trolley and bus service right in front of the hotel. We used the trolley to go to the waterfront. The hotel offered transportation to the San Diego Zoo/Balboa Park which we used. It worked out very well - on time and no problems. There is also service to Sea World but we didn't stay long enough to go there. After a day out, we wanted to go to Old Towne for dinner and called the front desk for a taxi recommendation. As the hotel driver was not busy he took us downtown! He told us to call the hotel when we were done, and he would pick us up where he dropped us off. We tipped him for his time. Our room was always neat and clean. There is a small restaurant on the site which served good food at reasonable prices. Nothing real fancy. I think we were in San Diego the only week of the year that it wasn't warm and sunny! We scouted out the pool but never went swimming. Looked nice enough. There was also a hot tub outdoors. There are no stores within walking distance so if you want snacks for the room get them while you are out and about. There was one small convenience/package store that we found, but as all convenience stores, it was overpriced and not a big selection. The day before our return trip, we checked with the driver for a trip back to the airport. When we were ready to leave the next day, we checked out and the driver had our bags loaded and off we went. All in all the hotel was good for a week long stay, but what made it above average was the staff - always accommodating and helpful. I would recommend staying at the Days Inn - Hotel Circle.

Every morning, bright and early, we had a most enjoyable short walk from the motel through the Town and Country Resort and had the choice of either the bus or trolley to almost anywhere. There was a multitude of eating places in the immediate vicinity as all hotels have restaurants open to non-residents and a small mini mart nearby. We arrived just before midnight and were very pleasantly surprised that even at this late hour they had taken account of our request for a 3rd floor room at the back of the motel. The desk staff were consistently friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. As mentioned the shuttle drivers were smart, prompt and very helpful. The room was large (two queen sized beds), clean and quiet. The beds were oh! so comfortable after long days - well equipped with iron/board, hairdrier, coffee maker, fridge, high standard toiletries and plenty of lovely fluffy white towels. Excellent, efficient maid service. The heated pool and hot tub were spotlessly clean and there were plenty of towels, tables and chairs, the best bonus being its tranquility and the beauty of the surroundings which we thought was quite an achievement for a motel in this location. All-in-all you will by now have realised that we were thoroughly satisfied with our 8 night stay and the value for money. We can't wait to come back again.", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salmon Arm", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Location!\u201d", "Author": "Sunny_Okanagan", "ReviewID": "UR5482305", "Content": "We just returned home after spending 3 nights in San Diego at the Days Inn-Hotel Circle. The location was central to everything we wanted to do and so easy to find. The motel is older but seemed to be kept in nice shape from the grounds to the building itself. We found the staff to be very friendly and went out of their way to accomodate our two families by placing our rooms next to each other. We appreciated the easy-to-follow maps with excellent directions to many attractions around the area. Our rooms were clean, but ours had a slight musty smell, while the other one was just fine. This wasn't a big deal as we didn't spend much time there anyway. We did notice some noise from people above us and outside the walkway, but we expected that from an older motel. Our rooms had a small fridge which worked out so well for us for milk and other beverages. The motel offers a complimentary shuttle to a few attractions but since we had a van, we didn't use it. We were told though that people must reserve a spot the day before to secure a spot. The pool was a nice retreat after a long day of sightseeing. There were lots of towels and chairs to use, even though the pool seemed always busy. If you are looking for a good place to stay on a budget, this economy motel is worthwhile to check out. We were pleased that even though the motel is rated at 2 stars, we got a good value for our money.

Their pool was a family oasis in the back of the property with tall trees around and locking gate. I saw families having a great time. It was close to a street which we discovered was a back road into San Diego without getting back on freeways. We bought discounted Sea World tickets at front desk and rode the motel van to and from for no cost. The trolley had a pick up in front but we did not use it as we had a car. I suggest the Business class rooms in the back by the pool if you want quiet and privacy. It was a great place for $69 a night.

We requested to stay in the new section called the \u201csunset\u201d something. This newer part is very nice, mostly everything is renovated in there. The bathrooms are very nice and the beds are very soft and clean. The rooms are very quiet and the pool is clean and heated. There are a lot of people there, the rooms were mostly full. Overall I would highly recommend families to stay there, but request for the new section. Also what was best is that it is very close to malls, old town and the freeway. Very good location! The food around the area is also very good. I would definitely stay there again.

Shampoos, etc were a nicer quality than most.My husband has trouble walking, and we were given a 3rd floor room.... but right next to the elevator.... so it was very convenient. A few things could use some improvement: (1) Luggage... we waited over 30 minutes for help with the luggage and the shuttle driver had to wait, also. Finally carried most of it down ourselves.... and the guy showed up. (2) The bathroom door was VERY annoying!! It was a sliding door, and hard to close. It squeaked badly... was very very hard to close (heavy), and woke my husband if I used the bathroom during the night. (3) Ice machines are inconvenient.
