It started off excellent because we got a free upgrade to Deluxe as opposed to what we booked, which was Superior.We got greeted very well by the staff and the taxi ride from the airport was about 10 minutes away. Security was tight, which assured us.We got our welcome drink but never got our 'complimentary gift hamper'.Our room was just nice, the room opened up to a nice cosy swimming pool and it was very clean. The housekeeping staff did well to preserve the room and it seemed like everyday was our first day checking in.The distance was not too far away from the airport and not too far from the city. Which was a good thing. It was quiet and cosy.The hotel restaurant highly recommends their bbq beef and pork ribs.

I stayed at the Vira in mid 2005 and then again in late 2007. It truly is the best hotel I've stayed at - the rooms are spacious and the sounds of the busy city are completely hidden by the layout of the hotel. Each time, we were greeted with a welcome fruit juice on arrival and the staff remembered us from a stay two years previously! The pool is beautiful and clear, surrounded by a lush garden. The Vira is perfect for a relaxing stay - it is not in the center of Kuta, rather it is about a 5 minute walk away, but it makes all the difference - you can't hear the traffic at all.The service is immaculate - each time we went outside, the security guards would actually clear the way on the street for us to walk across the road (the traffic is very busy). The gardener actually invited me to have dinner with his family.

After experiencing 1 night in Kuta, I found that I prefer the quieter area like Sanur and Ubud. I stayed at The Vira hotel with my fiancee, in the superior room (room 308 at lvl 3). It was nice. New and simple. We liked the bed, cause it's very comfortable. It was not big, but enough (for Asian). Bathroom was surprisingly small but clean anyway. Verandah was super tiny. Breakfast was a spread, with delicious fish and chicken sausages, salad, chicken porridge, fried rice, fried noodle, and potato bolognaise. Too bad we had a morning flight to catch! There were restaurants nearby, but we did not have the time to try. There was a restaurant called Kunyit something with its authentic Balinese cuisine near the Santika Premiere, which seemed promising. We had some problems back then since the staff in the receptionist area told us that there wouldn't be any airport transfer (and now I know that it was actually included in the package that we paid for but the staff was not aware about it), but it was already settled. All in all, the Vira was good and it provided good service.

Daily breakfast okay, although the toaster is broken and there can be quite a delay in organising toast, such a simple thing can be fixed by purchasing a new toaster!

On the morning of my last day after an 11 night stay I was told I could not have the late checkout. Very disappointing, if I had have known this up front I would have stayed elsewhere.

The hotel is only about 7 mins from airport and check-in was quick and easy. We were 3 solo women and wanted somewhere small and personal and the Vira suited us perfectly. We had the ground floor rooms and the pool was 10 steps from our door which I loved. Dont know if there is a view from the upper rooms , it is built around the central pool and has minimal gardens but what is there is lovely and beautifully maintained. My only complaint was that the pool was really cold but many love that, as a lot of guys I know dont like lukewarm swims so it is a personal thing. I thought it would be very noisy being so small n closed in but I heard no noise any nights but I guess that does depend on the clientelle at the time in any hotel. The gradens keep your room nice and private and upstairs rooms had lift accress and seem to have good size balconies. The rooms were large enough and very clean with king size, firm beds, good pillows and perfectly working A/C. In room safe worked fine, 2 water bottles provided free.The staff were efficient and honest, I often left jewellery about (nothing valuable) and it was always there on return. Breakfast was basic but a good enough variety that changed daily and if there was no bacon you could request some, eggs n pancake station, enough to fill you up. We had drinks around pool some afternoons during the happy hour and ate in rest one night which was just fine. The staff all over were lovely and friendly as you find most Bali folks are. The Vira is worth a return visit but not for kids... no where for them to run off to play.Fairly central easy walk or cheap n quick taxi ride into Kuta and security out front excellent at halting traffic and getting you a taxi.
