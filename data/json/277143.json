The bed was a very thin mattress on a wire frame. It resembled the construction that is found in a fold-away bed in a sofa. In addition to being very cramped, the room was also very noisy. The walls were thin enough that we could hear the person on one side of our room snoring and the people in the other side talking. Also the electric trams started running quite early and continued until very late. The bath towels resembled kitchen tea towels both in terms of their size and the type of material. The continental breakfast left a lot to be desired as well. The coffee was very weak and the orange juice was watery. We typically visit Europe 2 or 3 times a year and have stayed in a variety of hotels. The location of this one was questionable and quite a hike from the main entrance of the Termini station.

The desk person went out of his way to be miserable to everyone, being rude, grunting back answers. Day or night he always seemed to be there, and when the hotel locks up at night, you can hear him snoring behind the desk, where he sleeps - there is a partition that hides his bed. On our last day there a young lady was at the desk. She appeared friendly. The quality of food is poor. A crescent, prepackaged toast - thicker than melba toast, orange juice and instant coffee from a machine. There are tv's in the room but you can't use them unless you pay an extra 25 euros to get the piece of equipment that will allow you to access the tv, channels, etc. There is no internet service here. Asking for help from the desk person, can be a challenge, but don't let him intimidate you and he tries to. He turned the lights off a group of people who were talking in the gathering place, it was early evening, they were quietly playing cards. They do have maps at the hotel - ask for one because the maps are very good, much clearer than Frommers, etc, but don't ask the desk person for such things as dining references, etc (unless it is the young lady) as you will be disappointed and frustrated. Ask some of the friendly travellers there who have been there a couple of days. They can be of great assistance. There are hair dryers in the toilets, shampoo and soap. They use odd towels also, they are more like large dish clothes than towel. They are very thin. Our room had a stale smell and was in need of painting. It looked tired, drab and a bit run down. Luckily, the windows can be opened and this helps freshen things up. The beds are extremely small, they look and feel more like cots. This hotel has the potential to look nice with the marble and construction, but is run down and there is no immagination used to decorate. A good cleaning, some paint, some interesting pictures, brighter wall and bed coverings would help improve the look, along with a better breakfast, and most important some friendly, helpful hotel staff who will offer assistance. This hotel is located far from restaurants, bars, shops and is in a poor part of town. You can't just run out to get a bite to eat or shop or to see the sights; It's a long walk into town, although some buses and the metro are not too far away. This is not an area you want to walk at night. The only real positive is, the hotel was cheap and we didn't spend much time there. I'd rather have stayed in a hotel with a smaller room that had some ambiance, with people who cared at the desk; more a reflection of the hospitality and character of Rome. Check to see if there are equal priced hotels that are situated closer to town and have better write ups.

If you are a diabetic is better to avoid the breakfast: a lot of croissants with chocolate and vanilla, some butter and marmalade, orange/pineapple drink and coffee. As location, the hotel is situated at 15-20 minutes walking from Termini Station and 10 minutes from Manzoni subway station. Also, you may take a bus or a tram from Piazza di Porta Magiore (2 minutes walking). My advice is to take the bus 571 from Piazza di Porta Magiore and you\u2019ll reach very easily and in a short time Coloseo, Fori Imperiali, Piazza Venetia, etc. I would not stay here again.

We have both traveled around the world, from the Middle East to the British Isles. We are fairly independent travelers, who dislike group tours and prefer to explore on our own. We had reservations for Hotel Center, and walked there from the Termini train station. The first thing we noticed was how bad the area was. A few blocks from the hotel we passed an abandonded car, all the windows shattered, filled with trash, and walls of garbage surrounding the car. This gives you an image of the area, worse than the usual Roman graffiti. When we arrived at the Hotel Center lobby, we were somewhat relived that the lobby looked nice. Then the receptionist said \"yes, we have your reservation, at our other building, go back outside, walk down the street, take your second right, and ring the buzzer\". This was a short walk, but we were not impressed. This building was much more cramped, and the gentleman at the reception counter was smoking right beneath the no smoking sign. We wouldn't have minded much, but soon we realized that this smoke carried down the hall to our room. We also had a bar underneath our room, which played music until 4 in the morning. The bathroom was not especially clean, and the shower stall was so small you couldn't turn around without opening the curtain (I am an average size male, not obese). The bath towels were paper thin, and when we asked for an extra set, they tried to give us an extra floormat instead. One evening we returned to our room to find that the maid had opened both our window and the metal shutters, which was bad because the window was accessible from the rooftop patios. We wondered if he/she did this to allow someone else easy access later, or if maybe our room was warm and they wanted to cool it off for us. Being in Rome, we assumed the first. Nothing was missing, fortunately. We will not stay here again.
