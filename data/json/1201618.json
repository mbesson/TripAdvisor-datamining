My room was quite large and well appointed. Ask for a room away from the Autobahn to get some peace and quiet. The rooms have doors opening to a \"communal\" balcony (not so good for security and safety?). I opened mine and was soon aware of being joined by very large mosquitos in the room. The door was closed swiftly and, over the next hour, I eliminated five mosquitos in the room. I'm glad to say that no more made themselves known to me. I mentioned it at check-out and the receptionist said that they did have a few and \"they hide in the curtains\". The bathroom was a good size with a large bath and seperate shower cubicle. Breakfast was very good, even with sparkling wine (\"Sekt\") on ice. The breakfast area and restaurant is in the centre of a large atrium overlooked by the walkways to the rooms. Total cost was EUR 60, which I considered good, although if the mosquitos had got me ...", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arnhem, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGood price for this Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "HJenThomas", "ReviewID": "UR81375936", "Content": "The hotel is situated near the autobahn. You have to have a car to go to Berlin. The Hotel is a bit out off date but still clean en quiet. When you want to eat go to the near Potsdam. We booked this hotel because we were going to the Messe and not in the inner city. When you like to explore Berlin take a different hotel. This one is just to far away.

I got a babycot for an extra 8 euros and passed on the extra single for an extra 20 euros. I paid 138 euros for the night including breakfast. We only stayed one night en route back to the UK and ordered room service (extra 3.50 euros). The food was unbelievable. I have never eaten that well in Germany before. We ordered 2 traditional German meals and 2 childrens meals. No starters or desserts but did get a bottle of Reisling. It came to 70 euros which is good value for this type of hotel. The hotel was pretty much faultless which is expected for the price. I couldn't help but think it was slightly expensive as the location is on the Berliner Ring motorway (A10 I think) as opposed to Berlin itself. The staff were remarkable and they pride themselves on this. I think it is a perfect stopover from those travelling West in Europe. The swimming pool was excellent and they have an indoor and outdoor activity playground for kids. They also have a pond and a farm with goats and sheep. Breakfast was buffet style and plentiful. We didn't eat again until Belgium as we were all stuffed! 2 slightly petty niggles - you have to pay for wireless internet through T mobile and there were no robes. Other than that, can't think of anything. The reception are very helpful and guided me in as my Tom Tom was taking me to the other Eschenweg in another part of Berlin. REMEMBER - TYPE IN DAHLEWITZ NOT BERLIN!! I drove 25 miles past it and had to go back!", "Date": "February 12, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Van Der Valk Hotel Berliner Ring", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1201618-Reviews-Van_Der_Valk_Hotel_Berliner_Ring-Berlin.html", "Price": "$89 - $142*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Eschenweg 18</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">15827</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1201618", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/23/34/f9/family-room.jpg"}}
