{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great expereince, hope to return! I booked this hotel solely for the convenience of being so close to the baseball stadium as i was attending the all star game.I really just needed a place to sleep since i would be out and about taking in the sights and enjoying the game. But this hotel surpassed my expectations.Clean modern, fully furnished, and staff that was first class. And the location was hard to beat, it was a bit aways from the downtown area but i actually liked that, it was quieter and if you needed to be downtown the train was just outside the door and you could be hwere you wanted within minutes.Overall it was an experience i very much enjoyed.Im thinking of returning to san francisco next year and if i do i will definitely stay here again!", "Date": "Sep 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR857302518", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mikeydenny"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d571427-r8607483-Synergy_Avalon_Mission_Bay-San_Francisco_California.html", "HotelID": "571427", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
