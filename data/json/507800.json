Since we only were planning on sleeping and recharging in the room we didn't really want (or need) Waldorf-Astoria quality amenities. The room was clean, the staff courteous and nice, free quick breakfast, free wifi, good location to the metro (a 10 foot walk across the street) and close to attractions. There are several fast food and deli type establishments with a block and the surrounding area seemed to be somewhat safe (we weren't out extremely late so it's hard to say for sure). Overall, if you are in Barcelona to see the sights and want an easy and simple room for sleeping and rest, I would recommend staying here.

We chose this hotel because of the good reviews and the very central location, just one block away from Placa de Catalunya, the biggest square in the city centre. There is also a Metro station across the street. The room we got was a twin even though we had booked a double (the lady at reception told us that this was the only room left). We pushed the two twins together though and it worked out okay. The room was small but clean and, perhaps as we were on one of the higher floors, I didn't hear any noise. One of the ladies who works at reception was very friendly and helpful, with good English, and put my girlfriend and I on the guestlist for a nightclub one night and even provided me with a paracetamol tablet on another night when I had a headache! The other staff members who we came across were fine too. The hotel is up one flight of stairs and there was someone on the main desk 24 hours a day so it felt pretty safe. The room rate included a continental breakfast which we only actually ate on one occasion. It was pretty much as one would expected - mainly toasts, a few biscuits and juices, that sort of thing. So in summary I would say that while Hotel Marvi is not luxurious, for the price and location it is certainly to be recommended. If I return to Barcelona, I will probably stay here again. P.S. The nightlife in Barcelona is great - check out the Gothic Quarter one night and the Port Olympic another.

There are many other comments respecting the excellent location. To that we can add proximity to gay restaurants and bars and a welcoming environment for a gay couple.

Our room was on the 5th floor and was at the front of the building - which meant we had a window. I'm not 100% sure on this but the hotel staff seemed to indicate that other rooms may not have had an outward facing window but had windows facing a wall. From our room however, we had a view across the streets in front of the building. The room was spotless and was a fairly good size. The bathroom was also good - a nice big bath to soak in after a long day walking around. It also had a good shower over the bath and again, this was spotless. The room was cleaned every day and the towels were also changed daily. The air conditioning was included in the price and worked! I would probably echo the comments of some other reviews about the staff - they gave us all the information we needed and were polite but I wouldn't go as far to say that they were friendly! The hotel makes an excellent base - it is right next to a stop on the metro (Universitat) and the nearest stop for the bus tour is less than 5 mins walk. It is about 5-10 mins walk from the top of Las Ramblas (the nice end!). If we had any criticisms, they would be that the breakfast wasn't great - a croissant, cup of coffee and some orange juice. Also the beds were two single beds rather than a double. The final thing would be the noise. The hotel is central to Barcelona which is fantastic for sightseeing but the flip side is that its busy! We were woken on the first night by the traffic outside stopping and starting at the traffic lights - however we did get used to it and we didn't really notice it after the second night. Overall, Hotel Marvi is a really clean hotel that is central to the city. It is excellent value for money and we would recommend it but just be prepared to hear the traffic if you're at the front.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corpus Christi, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot my favorite hotel in Spain\u201d", "Author": "Jean_Valjean", "ReviewID": "UR7988335", "Content": "Stayed at the Hotel Marvi for 3 nights, May 18 to 21. Location with regards to the tourist sites and transportation was pretty good. The working girls or so they appeared to be, just outside the door left something to be desired in a hotel, as did the graffiti all over the building. Also having a hotel with a magnetic locking front door and a call button to let you in did not leave you with a comfortable feeling for the neighborhood. That is not just at night but all day also. As for the rooms they were clean enough but reminded me a lot a something you would get in the US at a big city YMCA. Or at least what was available 25 years ago at Y's in many major cities. The beds were comfortable, thats a plus but the window looked out on to the elevator shaft. At least I had a window my traveling companions did not. The maids had a habit of blocking the elevator so it would not leave the floor they were on so you walked the stairs most of the time. The desk clerk had to go unblock the elevator several times in the 3 days we were there to make the elevator available for people who could not climb the stairs. The hotel is not bad but at best it is below average accommodations but considering the price it gets 3 stars out of 5.

Although I spoke in Spanish with the staff, I noticed many tourists speaking in English as they asked for recommendations of where to shop or eat. The staff at Reception was always friendly. * Water pressure is quite strong (which I liked). * There was never a lack of hot water, which was also nice especially when you returned from waking all day long and wanted to soak your feet in hot (not warm) water. Ah.. relief. * They have an in-room safe deposit box big enough to fit a small laptop (with 12in screen - not your 15 to 17in screen laptops.) * A/C unit works quite well and was not too loud. * Hotel has video cameras on every floor, so although the room doors do not seem very safe, nothing bad happened during our entire 4 night stay there. THE NOT SO GOOD: * The hotel advertises internet - they do not offer it. * The hotel beds are hard. Although some people might actually prefer that. We had problems sleeping the first night so on the second night we asked if all beds were just as hard. We were told that they were. My solution was to take a winter blanket they have in the room and placed it on top of the mattress which helped soften the 'blow.' * The hotel room is 'cleaned' every day, but attention to detail is not a main concern. The lights switches and main light structures remained dirty until I cleaned them myself. * We choose a room facing the street because we were told they are the ones that offer a nicer view and have more natural light. We were on the fifth floor and you do have a nice view. If you can sleep without problems I would recommend it. I can sleep through a storm and outside traffic noise did not bother me. My better half is more of a light sleeper and could hear everything. * While it was harder for me to hear the outside noise, it was fairly easy to hear the people next door and what went on the corridors on different floors. * Hotel room has a small color TV but it only shows programs in Catalan and Spanish. Nothing in other languages. * The Hotel offers a breakfast. Coffee tastes terrible and their orange juice gave me stomach ache. So, unless you have a strong stomach or a taste for bad coffee, I would recommend skipping it and choosing to start your day eating somewhere else. THE FINAL WORD: AT 94 Euro a night I can hardly call this 2 Star hotel a bargain. Specially when for 50 Euro more per night I can stay at the Five Star Hotel Jazz just across the street, enjoy the pool on their Terrace and have a very comfy bed to sleep in.", "Date": "June 20, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Marvi", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d507800-Reviews-Hotel_Marvi-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$98 - $145*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Pelayo 6</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "507800", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/8c/11/fachada-hotel.jpg"}}
