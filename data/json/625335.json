The hotel staff was courteous and attentive. The room was extremely clean. The contemporary decor was both fun and relaxing. The location of the property was just what we wanted, near enough to the main action of the Gas Lamp district, while still being slightly off, the more heavily populated area. We took advantage of room service for breakfast daily and for dinner multiple times. The food was very good and delivered extremely quickly. It was however quite pricey (as is to be expected- as room service always is). The complimentary snacks and drinks in the minibar were a nice touch. Complimentary internet access was also a nice feature. I booked our room on-line and was taking advantage of corporate rate program. There was a discrepancy with our confirmed room rate, but upon showing my confirmation, it was corrected without question. I usually utilize the hotel concierge for recommendations and reservations. At the Andaz, there was not a formal concierge but everyone I spoke with was more than willing and able to make our stay at the hotel and the city a wonderful birthday weekend. Instead of having access to one person to assist us with special arrangements, we seemingly had an entire staff who were ready to take care of our needs.

There is an excellent sushi/Japanese restaurant in the lobby, Katsuya, which will do take out so that one can enjoy dinner in the room. There is complimentary wine in the lobby from 6 to 8 and always a changing array of fresh fruit in a large bowl at the small business centre in the lobby. I ordered room service breakfast once and it was delivered promptly at the requested time. This is a hotel with a heart, and I truly enjoyed my stay. It is located in the \"Historic Gas Lamp District\" with many nearby restaurants and in close proximity to the Convention Centre. It is also close to the San Diego trolley system which takes you to many locations, for a $5 a day pass.

The room was very comfortable and nice, but I did not like the lack of privacy in the bathroom. The sink area is enclosed in clear glass and the toilet and shower were only separated by frosted glass and a door with no lock. The cool thing about the room is the surround sound speakers for the TV. You could listen to the TV from the bathroom and the sound was like a movie theatre. The rooftop was definitely a scene with mostly young attractive couples or singles getting some sun before a night of night clubbing. This is definitely not a hotel for families or folks that want to hang around in jean shorts and tennis shoes. You will feel under dressed at night if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decked out in club attire for the nightclub that pretty much consumes the hotel at night . We were the only people wearing jeans when we returned from the Comedy club around 10PM. The lobby had turned into a \"velvet rope\" entrance to the night club.

They made the excuse that they were overbooked that weekend, but I thought since we booked so far ahead we should've gotten the room we wanted. In any case, the queen room was super small (it felt too cramped for 2 girls) and the bed was pretty standard. The bathroom was designed kind of awkwardly, since I could basically watch my friend through the glass between the sink and the bed. I did have a major issue with the shower-- I don't know if they did it on purpose for a design element, but I HATED the showerhead. The placement of where to put the shower arm was so inconvenient (and I am only making a fuss because I kept getting soap in my eye since I was too short to reach the shower head and had to hold it the whole time while trying to shampoo, so annoying!!!!) I do have to give the hotel some stars: the service was attentive especially when I asked them to get my car charger from our rental car, they knew just where to look. Also the location is excellent and super convenient, right in the heart of the gaslamp district and close to all the shops and restaurants, that deserves a star in itself.

The customer service at this modern boutique hotel was absolutely the best thing about it, not to say that there was really anything bad about it. From the moment you walk in the door, the staff does everything possible to make you feel like you are the only person in the room. They offer you refreshments as you are waiting for your room and make sure that you know everything the hotel has to offer. We arrived before our room was ready, so they stored our luggage and took our information so they could contact us when our room was ready. The room we requested was not available (a king bed) so they offered us a queen and, for the trouble, brought up a bottle of wine and cheese plate. The rooms are not very big, again not a big deal to us, but they are modern in their decor, beds are very comfortable and have plenty little extras (refreshments) to make up for the size. The bad - lots of noise at night (which is why I gave it very good instead of excellent). 3 nightclubs on the property, I believe. If you are looking for a nice quiet place to get a good nights sleep, this is not it. However, I think most people that stay here are more interested in the night life.

At night, the entire hotel transforms into a mecca for dancing, drinking, and d\u00c3\u00a9colletage. The rooftop lounge becomes one of the city's most desirable nightclubs. The wine bar provides plenty of comfortable seating for stiletto-weary ladies, along with a thumping DJ and a full-service bar. Yet, there is more: downstairs, the Ivy Club is currently featuring a \"Rio-Carnival\" theme, with feathered dancers who gyrate on podiums and staircases, and Capoeira artists who infiltrate the dance floor.

Free water offered anytime at the front desk. Comfortable bed. CONS: Valet was $35!!! The new year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party was pretty fun. But there were some annoyances. 1. We rang in the New Year on the rooftop, but there was NO countdown! Whoever the DJ was they should be FIRED! Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the countdown the best part of new years? No one knew the moment just passed by! 2. I waited 15 minutes for the elevator in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153basement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd club to go back to our room. The elevator attendant dropped off a full load but would not let us ride up even though it was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for hotel only guests elevator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He made us walk up the stairs to the first floor only to catch the SAME elevator there. So annoying. The Room: 1. We had a tiny king room. The rooms are SMALL. There is not bureau to put your clothes. There was a bench with a couple drawers. Thank god we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay long. 2. No floor length mirror in the room, not even on the back of the closet door. How am I supposed to see how my outfit looks? The ONLY mirror was in the bathroom over the sink. There was a magnifying mirror, but I could not use it because whoever installed it must have been 6'5\", and I am a petite 5'2\". The lighting the bathroom was very dim. Bad for bathroom. 3. Clear glass bathroom doors?! Kind of sexy for the shower but not the toilet! I need some privacy there. I would suggest frosting the bathroom door glass, especially since you can see the ENTIRE bathroom from the outside hallway!!! 4. The bathroom sink and shower leaked like sieves! There were giant pools of water all over the floor. 5. There was a refrigerator in the room, but it did not keep anything cold. 6. There is absolutely no sound proofing between the rooms. I could hear full conversations in the adjacent rooms through the walls! 7. No sound proofing in the windows either! All night long there were fire engine sirens right outside. We were on the 6th floor. Granted it was NYE, but it sounded like it was IN my room. One word to describe this hotel is sleazy. Lipstick on a pig is still a pig.

I'm there by myself, what on earth am I going to spend $150 a night on? Most hotels only block off $50 a night. -the bathroom is completely non functional the sink is in a little alcove outside the actual bathroom. Inside the bathroom is a toilet and the shower. No racks or shelves to hang/place clothes or towels. It's really a strange design! That being said, I asked for a quiet room (which I thought might be pushing it with 2 nightclubs in the hotel and staying over the weekend) but I did get a quiet room (with a view of some gravel and a wall) but I heard no noise from either nightclub during the 3 nights I was there. The staff are very helpful and always talk to you when you enter the hotel (which actually can be a little annoying if you are not in the mood to talk - as I wasn't when I had a horror tour and they asked me how it was and I wanted to say \"terrible\" but I lied and said it was fine and quickly went to the lifts to save the hassle).

We had to get past a muscly man in a black suit just to get in the lobby, and another one to get in the elevator to go up to our room. Then the dance music started and we thought we were going to lose our minds. The walls and floors were shaking from the bass beats. Music, conversations, and cigarette smoke just came pumping into our room like there were no barriers. It kept going until 2 a.m. when the club shut down. This repeated again on Friday night.

I also asked what I would receive as a Diamond member of Hyatt and she did a very thorough run down (which I appreciated because I travel frequently and can't always remember which hotel gives what). We had a junior suite (the worst part about this place was that it only has 3 master suites, so not getting one of those even as a Diamond member AND using a suite upgrade award netted me just the Jr. Suite) and I had hoped to get a great room. If I had known this prior to going then I would have saved my suite award and just paid for the room. As I mentioned above the worst part was my high expectations of the room I was going to get, but outside of that this was a great place to stay. The nightclub they have there is a top club to go to (the line was around the corner, but as hotel guests we got wrist bands at the front desk to access all 3: Pool Rooftop, Wine bar & Basement) and the staff was extremely helpful, personable and friendly.

I ended up splashing water on myself and the floor, because I couldn't figure out how to use the modern sink and shower at first, but that's not a big deal. That evening I checked out the rooftop pool and bar and the Quarter Kitchen restaurant downstairs. The rooftop area is awesome, both in terms of the pool and the bar, and the food in the restaurant was really good, probably the best I had in San Diego. However, when I returned to my room for the night, I discovered why my room was so cheap. There is a club in the basement of the hotel, and my room over looked an air shaft/patio area adjacent to the club. From my room I could hear the music from the club fairly loudly, and occasionally also people talking. It wasn't too bad when I was watching tv, but it made it difficult to sleep -- eventually I had to call down to the desk for ear plugs. Luckily I am used to street noise and sleeping with ear plugs, so I was able to get to sleep easily after that, and luckily clubs close early in San Diego, around 2 am, so I only had to deal with it for 2-3 hours.

(There is an Escalade that will take you within 2 miles of the hotel, and the driver was excellent. Very nice.) The rooms are unique, with the exposed showers. If you're staying with a friend or are in a platonic relationship, you probably will have to work around that, but if you're in a romantic relationship it isn't a big deal. I've assume you have seen your partner naked. Don't worry, though, the toilet area is private. No lock but you can't see through the door. While you may look sexy showering when your mate can see you, no one looks cool on the throne, so fortunately you can do that in private. The bed was very comfortable. I was out like a light despite reviews I had heard about noise. About that, the place has a nightclub in it but it didn't bother us. It was noisy in the streets but again, you're in Party Central with all the bars and clubs so if you are upset about that, then you didn't do research. It would be like attending a Steelers/Chargers game and complaining about the experience because you didn't know they would be playing football. My girlfriend and I were in bed watching True Blood on Sunday (we're not as young as we used to be) and the nightlife sounds didn't distract us. The complimentary items were a plus, too. Obviously you have to pay for the hooch, but the soft drinks and water were free. I liked that, usually you have to drop a little for a Coke or Sprite in other hotels if you take it from the fridge . Lots to do in the area. Ask the staff, they'll hook you up. I have read complaints about the security staff being hardheaded when it came to actual guests trying to get to their rooms when the club opened, but I didn't encounter it. I just showed them my room card and they were nice, and would have an elevator waiting. I have a feeling some of the complainers were probably drunk, tired, didn't have the room key handy, and when security just wanted to confirm for safety reasons, the guests copped an attitude. Probably L.A. types. I live there, so I know how they can be. Heck, they even give you a drink (not alcohol, obviously) for the road when you check out. They know you're leaving, they can pull a \"Well, we're done with them, our service ends now\", but nope. A little road soda, juice, or water to send you on the way. So stay here. You will have fun. But remember, this is in a popular location of nightlife. There will be noise. There will be drunk people. But you will have fun. BTW, there is an Afghan restaurant diagonally across the street called Chopahn. Check it out. It is excellent.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jax, Fl", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in Gaslamps\u201d", "Author": "MrT69", "ReviewID": "UR117703196", "Content": "Lauren and Ashley were incredibly friendly and professional hosts upon my arrival.

The Andaz is very stylish and well appointed. I find the concept to be very refreshing and look forward to staying here again. The customer service was superior to any hotels we have stayed in- inlcuding the Ritz Carlton. We also saw a very handsome celebrity that was staying in the hotel- kind of exciting! Check in was a little weird- as I wasn't quite sure where the front desk was but they check you in and escort you with your luggage to your room and explain everything. Most things in the mini bar are complimentary which is so nice to have. Decent sized bottles of alcohol are available for purchase in your room as well. They have a Escalade that will take you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel, so be sure to use it. This is a happening place at night! We counted at least 3 bars one of which was on the rooftop. They have a special elevator for guests (to go to your room OR any of the bars) so you don't have to wait in line. It was great when we were getting tired at the end of night because we would come back here and hang out for a bit and then go to bed. The pool is also a happening place during the daytime, worth going to. Shower: it is open with glass but there is a solid door on the bathroom. It's different but it didn't bother my husband and I. It actually made the room feel more spacious. The rooms are not large (which is normal for downtown hotels in any city) but despite some other reviews we did have drawers at the foot of the bed which we found adequate. Ext vs Int rooms: I requested an interior room based on previous reviews of noise and was totally bummed that there is only a view of concrete walls, so I think I'd probably request and exterior room next time. Customer Service: So good that it was noticeable (and this was before we had any issues). They were great in every capacity. When we did have an issue with our shower leaking and they fixed it once, they had to come back again. They handled it well and I was pleased. It is rare to have good customer service anywhere these days but the fact that is was obvious from the minute we checked-in was refreshing. I highly recommend Sunday brunch at Searsucker down the street. It's about a 5 minute walk on 5th street.

Imagine our surprise when our taxi pulled up to a super sexy boutique hotel. Sleek in design, immaculate and pristine interiors, we were greeted by eye candy staff who were extremely courteous. One offered to check us in, the other whisked our bags discreetly away (our room wasn't yet available) and another made a complementary espresso for us. The rooms are amaaaazing, like something out of Wallpaper magazine. Very hip, urban and tasteful. Dark wood, iPod-friendly, LCD screens, free WiFi and a cocktail bar already set up for you to enjoy. Complementary drinks are available for you in the fridge (everything from pop, juice, cold water ... oddly the only thing not free is Gatorade) and you have a full mini-bar if you want to make your own martinis. Also available is a complementary snack tray - Pringles chips, Toblerone and granola bars. Sure, it's not Whole Foods, but it's more free food than you'd get on a airplane flight these days. For those who forget things easily, there's a menu available in your room of amenities available - at cost - through the hotel. These include a sewing kit and yes, even a vibrator. I guess you can be prepared for just about anything at the Andaz and they won't bat an eyelash. The bathroom is worth mentioning as a whole separate paragraph. The shower head is detachable and is shaped horizontally. It'd make for a great windshield wiper for your car. No bathtub, but very spacious shower. The only downside of the bathroom - gorgeous as it is - is that it is very tiny and there are no doorhooks so you're leaving your towel on the floor and all of your clothes on the floor. Please Andaz - put in a hook on your door or wall! Complementary thick plush robes are available for you in your closet. We pur ours on after our shower, even though it was summer time and arguably the wrong season to be wearing any kind of plush. We couldn't help ourselves. The grandeur of the place was so luxe! The beds were firm and probably the best ones I've slept on since the Hampton Inn and Suites.

Fantastic waffles and great coffee. We didn't get a chance to sample their evening dinner, the on-site night club or the rooftop pool.

On the booking, a quiet room was specified and to be fair, they gave me a street facing room on the 4th floor, so I did not experience any noise from the nightclub. The problem was that the orientation of the room meant that I looked out over a nightclub and a 24hr food place and the double glazing might as well have been non existent.

The \"quiet\" room I had also was on the side of the hotel facing the street so there was street noise (buses going by, etc.) but it wasn't too bad as I live in a metropolitan area and am used to that. I really liked the layout of the room and loved how the bathroom was designed/laid out with the sink in the area near the bed divided by a glass wall so I could watch TV while getting ready. I also liked the speakers in the shower area so I could hear the TV while showering. The biggest nice perk is that all the non-alcoholic drinks and some snacks in the mini-bar are free which is nice. I was there for 5 nights so it was nice to grab a drink and not have to worry about an exorbitant mini-bar meal.

Out of all possible answers including service, comfort, cleanliness, etc., I hope most of you will agree that it is a place you go to so that you'll have a roof over your head at night for some shut eyes when you're away from home. Well, Andaz San Diego fails miserably at the basics of what a lodging's main purpose should be. This hotel's first priority is not with the hotel guests who want to rest after a long day but with the young screaming crew who frequent the night club which this hotel is notorious for. We stayed on a Thursday night (it was not even on a weekend night!!) and the noise level was out of this world. It has the thinnest walls and windows ever!! We could not get any peace from 9pm to 3am. When checking in, we asked for the most quietest room they had since she warned us that we should not be alarmed about the bodyguards standing in front of the hotel entrance due to the night club. She graciously(?) assigned us to an accessible room on the 2nd floor facing out, right above the entrance to the night club!! When we had enough and complained about the noise at 11pm, we were repeatedly asked if we were staying for one night only (not that we would ever want to stay longer), and then moved us 2 floors up but still above the entrance to the night club. Noise level went down from 10 to 9 but not enough to sleep until all the screaming and bickering came to an end at 3am. As an apology, front desk offered us free breakfast and little did we know that this would be the icing on the cake. If noise from the night before wasn't enough, they started drilling and hammering down walls right above the restaurant when there were still guests eating breakfast. By this time, we were packing and running for the doors. When asked how our stay was, I told the front desk, \"Terrible. What good is 300-count European sheets and a complimentary breakfast if you cannot sleep or enjoy them?\" She apologized and asked if there is anything she can do to make amends to our unpleasant experience. I asked her \"What can you do?\" and the reply I got made me wordless. \"I don't know. I'm sorry you're not satisfied but the hotel is new and we are working on the kinks. Maybe your next stay with us would be better.\" Until they work out their kinks, anyone staying here has to suffer? Hmm. Sorry Andaz but we'll never stay here again and neither will any of our friends. So, if you're really insensitive to noise or you just love the vibrations of the nightclub music, stay here. Otherwise, keep away as there are too many better hotels close by that do care about their guests. A friendly suggestion to Andaz San Diego: I would recommend you benchmark Campton Place in San Francisco.

Very plush and plenty of room to relax and work in, with 2 flat screen TVs, high speed internet included in our rate plan, and certain snacks and soft drinks free in the room. One problem was the noise that came from the gym upstairs first thing in the morning - when someone was on the runing machine it felt like a small earthquake was in progress. We tried out the bar and restaurant, and they were suprisingly good value, particularly in light of the location, and a good selection of plates and wines. They also have an happy hour (I assume this might have just been a promotion over Xmas/quiet periods) which cut the price of selected food and wine to half-price, which was excellent value. The hotel is right on the edge of the Gaslamp Quarter, so exploring downtown was easy. Plus, they have a house limo (Escalade) which will transport you for free within a couple of mile radius, which pretty much covers most of downtown San Diego.

Upon check-in, we were given a choice of the $15 wine card or a cheese plate and a bottle of wine for our Diamond amenity. Since we were a party of two, I asked if we could have some extra funds on the wine card, to which the answer was no. In retrospect, I think I should have gotten the cheese plate and bottle of wine, since the wine bar is expensive and $15 is really only good for about 1 glass. Check-in was fine. Parking is expensive at $35/night. We used a Diamond Suite upgrade and at first was put in a \"Large King.\" I refused this room and told the front desk this was not a suite. We were then moved to an Andaz Loft. This isn't really a suite. But since I was only there for 1 night, we took this room. We were proactively warned about the, noise from the club above which was appreciated. Even though the Andaz Loft is definitely not a suite, I liked the room. I liked the decor, layout and the bed was comfortable. I don't know what this hotel was like before the conversion to Andaz, but i think Hyatt did a good job at renovating this property. I checked out the rooftop bar/pool and the gym. Both were nice, but nothing memorable. In the evening, we went to the wine bar. There wasn't a soul there, so we had the bartender to ourselves and got some good service. In addition to trying out the wines, we got some appetizers and the pizza and cheese plate we got were very good. One word of note: make sure to only put money on the card that you are prepared to use. Any leftover money on the wine card cannot be refunded, which I was a bit upset about because I saw no reason why they couldn't provide a refund. In terms of the noise, yes it was loud. On the night we were there, it ended at about 1AM. For one or two nights, it would be ok for me and my sig other, since we are both heavy sleepers, but i definitely would not be able to take that noise every night. The next morning we had breakfast and got the best service that we ever received throughout our stay from our waitress that morning. She was very courteous and gave us carte blanche to order whatever we wanted. We gave her a nice tip. Unfortunately, at checkout, the front desk erroneously charged us for minibar charges which we did not take, and also erroneously charged us for breakfast. For some reason, it took a long time for this to be settled, and I left the hotel a bit annoyed with the staff.

(The night before I stayed at Andaz San Diego, I stayed at Andaz West Hollywood... and the two hotels are totally different. Read my review on Andaz West Hollywood) The bad 1) Worst Check In Experience I've ever encountered. We waited for 10minutes to check in. We checked in at 12pm and the hotel staff told us the room wasn't ready yet because the hotel was sold out the night before and check in technically doesn't start till 4pm. My bf and I decided to wait for a room so we can clean ourselves up before we go to the zoo. We wait till 2pm in the lobby and no front desk staff gave us an update on the rooms or offered us a drink while we waited. So we decided to go to the zoo instead of waiting for the room. At about 4:30 we got a missed call from Andaz and I called them back and it appeared that we did not check in yet, however our rooms were ready. I was confused. 2) THe hotel has a nightclub and on Friday and Saturday evenings, it is full of people ready to go dancing and drinking. We got back from the zoo dressing like tourists and we found that you do not get service if you aren't decked out in a cocktail dress with heels or in a suit. No one opened the door for us and when we walked in, the door man asked \"how can I assist you today\" in a tone like, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwtf are you guys doing here dressing like this\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? The next night my boyfriend and I got dressed up to go for dinner at Nobu and we found that we got better service if we dressed up. 3) They do not cash travelers cheques. When we went to cash one of our travelers cheques, the front desk agent was confused on the cheque and he went to ask another agent and the other agent said \"I don't know, I never cashed one before\". So he came back with the answer, \"we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cash travelers cheques\". This is the first time that I was unable to cash a travelers cheque at a hotel that I stayed at.... 4) They offer complimentary coffee but why offer it if they don't refill it? We went to grab coffee and there was none in the pot. The front desk agent did not acknowledge us with the front empty coffee pot... but by that time my bf and I were already so disappointed with this hotel we didn't even bother asking them for more coffee. 5) When I went to go check out, the front desk agent (Phil) did not acknowledge me whatsoever. When I told him I was there to check out, he asked for my name and room. I told him my name and my room # and I told him that I would not be leaving my room till half an hour later. All he said was \"Ok, your checked out\". He did not greet me or asked me how my stay was, and instead I saw him on the laptop surfing when I was waiting for him to help me AND after he helped me. Five minutes later I went back to the front desk to ask them for a receipt, (I can't believe Phil didn't even offer me a copy of my receipt) and another check in agent help me. He told me that I was not checked out yet. UNBLIEVEABLE!!!!!! Apparently Phil did not check me out. (I was so upset, I asked the check in agent what his name was, and that how I know his name was Phil.) LOUD LOUD LOUD! We stayed there from Saturday to Monday. Saturday was horrible. When I was heading back to my room at 12:30am I saw a girl, drunk out of her mind, crawling in the middle of the hallway and screaming to someone to open the door room. My boyfriend heard people slamming the walls while he was sleeping. The hotel staff were very snobby, unprofessional and stuck up. They gave us a feeling like - you should tip me for opening the door for you, or you don't belong to this hotel because you are wearing shorts and a t shirt. This hotel is not catered to tourists but to locals who like to get dressed up and go to the Ivy Lounge and get really drunk and make loud noises in the hallways. The Good 1. Location was awesome. Central. Close to 5th Ave where all many restaurants and boutiques were. 2. Clean. Hotel was very clean and trendy. 3. Complimentary mini bar in your room which includes pop, juice and 1 can of small pringles and 1 Hersey Chocolate bar and one health bar. Complimentary wine between 6pm-11pm. Complimentary coffee and baked goods in the morning but they don't refill it quickly. 4. They offer a complimentary ride 2 miles within the hotel.

Our room wasn't ready when we got there so we left our bags with her as we went up to the pool to get some drinks and some sun. About 30 minutes later, Tasha walked up to the pool and personally handed us our room keys and let us know that she had put our bags in our room. COOL RIGHT!? BTW, for those who haven't been to the Ivy (It is now called the Andaz Hotel btw for those who didn't know), it has one of the best rooftop pools we have ever been to and trust me, we've seen some all over the country. The staff there is all very nice and friendly and might I add very good-looking. The room itself was perfect for a young couple like us.

After having a little tour earlier last month I decided it was time for a stay to evaluate the hotel upon eventual pros & cons as I had to stay a day in SD anyway. I booked 2 Rooms on a Thursday departing friday. To say it upfront: I did not find too many pro-arguments. First, the web check-in did not work. Upon personal check-in I was explained that the rooms are not ready yet (12:15pm). I advised the staff that I reserved with an arrival time of 11:30a after arriving from a long haul ex Asia. Suddenly they found 2 rooms, though not on the same floor but so be it. Then they proudly mentioned I have been upgraded to a \"Loft\" to which I responded that this is not really an upgrade per se, I used a Diamond Suite Certificate and if they could elaborate what \"Loft\" means. It ended up being a regular room with a diverter in the middle and a desk/couch behind it. The bathroom was smaller than in the other (Standard) room. The second reservation did not receive a Diamond Upgrade. Also my \"Loft\" did not have a bathtub which I specifically requested. They offered a downgrade to a room with a bathtub - great option! The whole CI process took 40 minutes. An embarrassing situation to say the least and just proof of the low key performance many of the Andaz properties are providing on a daily basis. The parking is 30$ - not too bad for SD but not cheap either. Facilities: The roof is supposed to be the crown jewel of the hotel. It consists of a restaurant/bistro area, sitting area, bar and the pool with the well equipped but not very airy gym on the same floor. The pool is roughly 1.20m deep. To give you the picture, this reaches barely the top of my shorts. Swimming is possible on 2/3 length of the pool. Beware of your knees! My impression was, that the pool is more for a quick \"cool down walkthrough\" and \"cocktail hangout\" than serving its purpose as an actual swimming pool. There are ~ 7 sun beds, 3 Cabanas without shields and 3 half open sun chairs plus a sofa area with a TV. The Audio system surrounding the pool changed its volume level every 3 minutes - maybe they were probing \"The Apprentice\" for San Diego's DJ scene. The breakfast was served on said bistro area the next morning. Service was ok - not more not less. I am Hyatt Diamond so the breakfast was included for my room automatically, the second room had the breakfast included per the AAA Rate I booked. The bar staff created proper drinks. The food which has been ordered poolside was of good quality and freshly prepared. It missed the special touch regarding presentation though which somewhat would be expected considering the pricing model. We did not use the restaurant downstairs as we ate out but ordered a dessert later from room service. A chocolate tart that was supposed to come with Hazelnut Ice Cream. The night staff had their creative Thursday so they decided to substitute the Hazelnut Ice cream with a spoon of almond/nut mix. Nice try but that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fly. After an interesting discussion with the room service operator the ice cream was delivered ~ 25 minutes later. Short before the cake dried out. \"The IVY Nightclub\" on the roof is one of the hip spots in San Diego - At least this particular Thursday night I could not tell you why. Maybe it gets a bit better once summer settles in and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need the heaters anymore. Guests receive a fancy IVY wristband so no ID checks etc are required anymore. You will get these starting at 8:30pm at the Front Desk. The beds are the biggest plus of the Hotel. Very cozy and comfortable. The bathrooms are compact but nicely assembled paired with hardwood flooring. Assorted bathroom amenities were available as well as plush bathrobes and good towels. All rooms are individually designed and in the hallways are original art pieces and individual carpets. The furniture already shows some usage but is still acceptable. Within the hotel there are certain sources of noise, the nightclub being one of them. Especially in the interior rooms with the windows towards the inside courtyard are in the target line of this. The carpets in the hallways are somewhat noise redeeming so that the guests returning from the various night venues are not alerting everyone on the same floor. The hardware is good - however the hotel seriously lacks in one important field and that is unfortunately in professionalism and customer satisfaction. There seemed to be no senior management on site. At least none that comes from a full service Hyatt. It was all pretty junior staff and the Andaz specific IT is not making their job easier. 3 hours after I left the hotel I received an email alert from my credit card the hotel just authorized more then 200$ - again. In the meanwhile this charge hit my account permanently even though the manager assured the reversal of the charge. The bill looks like a ping pong game as they already credited and debited my CC \"by accident\" more than 5 times. Greetings to the accounting! Bottom Line: It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter what demographic group you belong to - there are standards that a full service property in the Hyatt chain (even if under a different name) should fulfill. Servicewise, this particular place needs serious support from Hyatt Senior Management in nearly all fields of daily operation. From a professional point of view, the stay was a disaster. My friends enjoyed it though which I am very glad about and if you look at it the casual way then there is some leeway and the property get\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s away with some things. As a guest who knows other Andaz properties as well I can just say there is more than just space for improvement. When every second phrase has to be an apology then something is fundamentally wrong.

The bed was super comfy, except the pillows could have been a little firmer. The shower was relaxing. The free wireless was fast and reliable. There was also an ipod dock in the room. The coffee maker yielded just okay coffee, but it did the trick. The hotel also had a great little exercise room, with a few treadmills, elliptical machines and bikes, plus a couple of weight machines. Each machine had its own television and there were complimentary headphones provided. The machines all seemed very new and in great condition. My boyfriend and I treated ourselves to room service the first night and were floored by how delicious it was. The cheeseburger and mac 'n' cheese, especially, were exceptional. The $30/night for valet service seems pricey, but luckily, I didn't bring my car. Andaz's location makes for a very walkable vacation. I easily got to the zoo, Balboa Park, the Casbah, movie theatres, and tons of restaurants and shops on foot. The hotel was exceptionally quiet. I barely even heard other people staying there. Overall, I would enthusiastically recommend this hotel to friends and would gladly stay there again, and would also try other Andaz locations.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cDon't plan to sleep!!!!\u201d", "Author": "jimdav", "ReviewID": "UR64334071", "Content": "This hotel is nice if you are in your twenties and plan on partying at the club on the roof then in your room till 5am!

The hosts were very friendly, asked us to come down for free wine, and helped us with local restaurant choices.

We didn't use the hotel bar or restaurant, but the by the glass wine bar looked very enticing. The rooftop pool area waas very secluded, and there were great sitting areas on the rooftop.

I accidentally booked the wrong nights and the assistant manager with hotwire on the phone agreed to a reduced rate for 2 nights. The Andaz still received my hotwire payment and we agreed I would pay the difference since it was my mistake. I reiterated with the assistant manager I was traveling on business and needed to stay within a specific rate. Thought everything was OK since 2 colleagues recieved hotwire rates even much lower. Instead I was hassled and basically told I was a liar about the agreed upon rate by the general manager. On my second day I was contacted to leave the hotel 3 times. I explained I booked for 2 nights and confirmed again my rate. Upon leaving the general manager looked at the note about my rate, noticed the exact agreed upon amount I mentioned yet INSISTED there was a mistake. I told him I was responsible for the amount above my already paid hotwire and he said the assistant manager who was not there should not have provided my lower rate. He then proceeded to bill me over $100 ABOVE the rate HE SAW IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. When I approached him about this twice he said the assistant manager was not there and that until he figured out why I received such a low rate he would be forced to charge my credit card. I mentioned again my two colleagues actually stayed through hotwire for a rate even lower and that I was willing to pay more just not the $100 more he was trying to charge me. I also mentioned hotwire was on the phone to confirm and he even has a note in system with the agreed upon rate. He said it is \"complicated\" because the manager should not have had the authority to do this. Essentially after the second time I stated it is an internal problem with the hotel and that he was essentially saying he did not believe the other managers note. His response was that he would not bill my credit card until later that day and confirm with the manager. So when I left I was charged over $100 above what was agreed and he wasted over 30 minutes of my time trying to explain this. I had an afternoon business meeting and left without continuing to argue since it was clear he was going to charge my card anyway. Terrible customer service. In addition the hotel was not that great. The bathroom is weird and the shower points straight at your face so I basically had to duck to wash my hair. The entire hotel is very snooty. On the first night at the supposed \"hot spot\" rooftop bar the bartender told us the next night would be \"off\" and the greatest place in San Diego and there would be a line, but since we were in the hotel we would be good with wristbands. Well good thing we had wristbands for the lame 25 person scene the next night. When we asked him he was like, well come back on the weekend sorry!

About half of the things in the minibar in the room are complimentary including water, juice, candy, and snacks. The minibar even has an erotic kit thing. I can only imagine what is in it. The toiletries in the bathroom were excellent and there were lots of little packets of creams and lotions that smelled really nice. Of course the only drawback was the noise from the club downstairs. The rooftop party space was closed because of the rain. Since we hotwired the rooms we were given low, third floor inside rooms all around the small atrium that opens to the club. I had ear plugs in and the music was still loud. I didn't fall asleep until the music stopped around 2:00am I think.

There is some high and low points to this hotel and I can see it will not be for everyone, but I wanted to share my experience. STAFF: My girlfriend and I pulled up to the valet and were instantly greeted by a friendly attendant. Check in was a breeze: The staff noticed I was a Gold Hyatt Member and offered me a complimentary 2p check out (I didn't end up using it, but was quite happy with the offer). The staff escorted us up to our room and gave us all the instructions on using their complimentary Cadillac Escalade service and setting up a time for us to pick up our VIP passes for the club (included with the room). We ended up taking up the offer on the Cadillac service to and from a restaurant in down town and had great drivers that saved us the hassle of walking or cabbing, well worth giving them a tip! Location: The hotel is right in the heart of Gas Lamp. Tons of great restaurants, pubs and nightlife to get yourself into. We did end up at the roof top club of the hotel. It was a great time, but the drink prices were RIDICULOUS. A mixed cocktail (Crown & Coke) is around 12-15 bucks so most of our drinking happened before the club. However, if you are here to party on a Friday/Saturday night, it is well worth checking it out. Room: I was not a big fan of the room. We were in an Andaz Queen and it was real cramped (see pictures). The bathroom was also real compact and for some reason there was an open hole towel holder on the glass of the shower. This caused the whole bathroom to get full of water whenever we used the shower. I'm not sure about the other rooms, but I would probably consider trying to upgrade to a King if I stayed here again. Surprisingly, I did not here any noise like other reviewers from the night club. I think it all depends on where you are located in the hotel and we were on the 3rd floor.

Check in was no prob and they served complimentary Evian while I waited. Staff was very pleasant and courteous-- not like some of the reviews i had read on here. Despite our lower rate we did not have a room facing the inside, but instead had a city facing view which i thought was great. As many reviews state, the rooms are pretty small, but given the decor and layout I found them to be very cozy-- great for a weekend or night of romance (all you need is a great bed, right?-- and the hotel did not dissapoint). They had great toiletries and robes as well as complimentary snacks and drinks (pretty rare for such a highly rated place). Definitely caters to adults as there is a \"booty kit\" with \"intimate\" items i found to be amusing :) At night you could slightly hear the music from the roof, but not bothersome at all as it didnt wake me from the little sleep i got anyway-- but i am a twenty-something (although not for long) :) Overall rooms were comfy, clean, and beautiful. My favorite part of the stay, however, was the roof top pool. Great decor and great view-- plus its heated (although no jacuzzi) !Despite it being vday, a holiday weekend, and incredibly warm weather for february, it was virtually empty, so we felt like we had the area to ourselves. we ended up lounging around in the cabanas and pool beds even after we checkout. it was just very peaceful and romantic-- not as obnoxious and crowded as it typically was during the summer. Also-- awesome Kobe burger, but of course you'll pay 12 for it! Overall, I highly reccommend. Probably not worth the regular rate since the rooms are small.
