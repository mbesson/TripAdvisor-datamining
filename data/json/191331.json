We were delighted by the reception we received on arrival, spontaneously congratulating us. Our room was delightful, situated on the 5th floor and with marvellous views of the Vatican area, and other famous areas. As requested our room had a balcony. A bottle of champagne on ice was soon brought to the room with a red rose and a welcoing hand written note from the manager! Such a lovely touch. We were very impressed with the overall quality of service, which was impeccable. You are made to feel like royalty! Concirege and reception were most helpful in giving advice on where to eat / visit. Nothing was too much for them. The restaurant was fantastic with stunning panoramic views over the city, and the food was very good indeed. On our last evening, we decided to have dinner in the restaurant La Terrazza dell'Eden and chose the Gourmet menu.

We wanted to stay at top hotels as we were willing to splurge and really celebrate on this trip. The concierge was friendly, informative and attentive. The lobby impressive and clean. Restaurant/bar/garden on top floor was elegant with beautiful views of the city. However, the size of our deluxe room very disappointing ... quoted at @ 344 feet, it felt like a box with no extra sitting area/space. We expected a bigger bedroom/living space for this very pricy, deluxe room that was advertised as spacious. The balcony had french windows that opened up to a large window ... not a true balcony to sit out on, which we had hoped for. The bathroom and closet area was roomy and that must have made up much of the square footage. Additionally, the room faced the street and both mornings at @ 6 a.m. you could hear the garbage and recycling trucks across the street doing their thing for about 15-20 minutes, which really annoyed us since we wanted to sleep in a bit. Aside from that, great location. We had some odd encounters too ... like upon arrival they could not accommodate an early check in as requested (@10:30 a.m.) and were told to come back around 2 pm. Upon our return, we were very excited to shower since it had been a long trip. Unfortunately, a water pipe had burst at that moment and we could not use water for about two hours. When we checked out a false fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate our room to the panic of alarms and announcements. All in all it did not feel like a 5-star hotel because of the room size and the price attached to this box-of-a-deluxe room. We felt it did not match the room description on the hotel website accurately. You can probably get more for your money at other 4-5 star hotels.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHotel Eden\u201d", "Author": "UK_AS", "ReviewID": "UR127713668", "Content": "Nothing but praise.

There was a seriously gorgeous roof terrace on the 6th floor, with amazing views out to all of Rome. Nothing is allowed to be built higher than the cross on the Vatican, so there are no sky-scrapers to spoil the view. We splurged on a cocktail on the roof terrace and were provided with silver dishes of chips, olives and nibbles - very nice. If I'm looking for a negative it would only be minor, the marble bathroom has the obligatory huge shower head, but no real water pressure - it took a while to wash the shampoo out of my hair.

The hotel is located within walking distance of the Spanish Steps, Trevi fountain, great resaurants and shopping. The only tip I have is to double check your invoice. They billed my roommate twice and didn't bill me at all. It was an easy mistake and easily rectified between friends.

We were put directly underneath a room that was having construction being done to it. We were woken up at 7 am to pounding and hammering for the first two day we were there. After complaint to hotel management Mr. Pietro his first remark was this hotel is open 24 hours a day and we cannot close it for repairs. I had to educate this highly ranked manager of a category 6 Starwood hotel that you don't need to close your hotel just do not people directly underneath it especially if they plan on hammering away at 7 in the morning. I had to complain to starwood corporate for the manager to even acknowledge my complaints. We then decided to cancel the rest of our stay and move to the Hassler hotel.

Our room would not have been changed if I didn't call Starwood corporate numerous times to complain about Mr. Pietro's Arrogance.

The rooftop restaurant has stunning views (and stunning prices) of Rome. You are right around the corner from the Spanish Steps. I booked this well in advance as this was a 10 year anniversary trip to Italy. We had eaten dinner there 6 years ago on our last trip to Rome and had always wanted to stay there. The concierge were nice and helpful. It is a very expensive place and the rooms are small for the price you pay, but we tried not to spend too much time in the rooms any way. We had one complaint about the hotel. We have two young children at home and one of them wasn't feeling well so we decided to check out a day early. As I mentioned we had booked well in advance, and we had prepaid the room. I tried to get them to give us credit or any consideration since they were getting the room back over a day early (as we left the hotel at 4:30am). They were very unaccommodating and I made a point in saying I am not asking for you to refund a nights stay but some consideration. They were very abrupt and completely unhelpful. I would NOT recommend anyone stay there because of that reason along with the size of rooms. As I mentioned the location was amazing and the rooms are nice, but very small. I was soured on the Hotel by the way we were handled and the stuffiness of the front desk/reception personnel. They were very cold. After that discussion the night before the front desk person when we checked out was also very unfriendly. I would also like to repeat the concierge people were very friendly and helpful.

Service - Personal....a nice word in a cold world...no feeling of large corporate here, just well trained \"people\" who want to /or appear to want to help...not quite home but certainly made to feel welcome and able to relax...and in some style - reception/Concierge/Doorman(doesnt do justice but not sure of proper title) and especially the Bar and waiitng staff in La Terrazza were fabulous. - Superb Cocktails Rooms - We had courtyard views on the second floor..In hindsight and if you can upgrade you will benefit Im sure - but this standard of room is of nice standard - only issue is that the main reception (ground 0)is a temple of Cool Marble whilst the entertainment centre (Bar) is on the 6th. So you spend alot of time in the lift Value - We were a party of 4 in the mood to celebrate and therefroe this was not a priority - I have spent more in places and felt less satisfied therefore I feel it was worth it - it has been a week since we returned so I feel some of the rose tinting/hangover has faded - however for several moments I was alllowed to feel a sense of international \"playboy\" at this special hotel without ever feeling frustrated or ripped off...I know this seems an odd metric to use but for this weekend it was exactly what we wanted and as such have nothing but fond memories..but take your your own pinch of salt and decide what you want...if this is your first/only trip to Rome then this might be a little off the beaten track ( but use Google Earth not my measure of distance before you decide....does anyone know where the centre of Rome is by the way??) - Gourmet Dinner with Flight of wine was 165 Euro a head in La Terrazza when we were there.....and most excellent it was to Alternatives - Have stayed at the \"Exedra\" before and found it a beautfiul bulding with better rooms (in our case) but worse/differnt location - the fact you walk past the \"Hassler\" as you go down the spanish steps has got to raise the question ...why didnt I stay there? (its a bit stuffy but Im sure a couple Martinis would change that ) In short - a rare touch of exceeding expectations, based on the staff as opposed to the bricks, mortar and marble - will struggle next time we go to a 5 star for 2 days where everyone doesnt know your name.

Despite the diminution in size, the room was well appointed and comfortable. There was no complimentary water so it was good that there was a small grocery nearby where we were able to buy water and snacks. The hotel is very near the Spanish Steps and Via Condotti, and from there it's quite easy to walk to other areas. The housekeeping staff were zealous in maintaining cleanliness in the rooms and in the hallways. The Terraza at the rooftop where breakfast was served everyday and where we also had several lunches and dinners had a beautiful view of Rome's skyline. The staff at the restaurant were quite friendly and efficient and the food was delicious. I cannot say enough about the concierges Alessandro and Bernardo. Alitalia had misplaced one of our suitcases and upon filling in a form at the airport, they told us that they would forward the luggage to our hotel. Alessandro and Bernardo were most solicitous in following up Alitalia for us constantly and patient in reassuring us about our misplaced luggage. Bernardo was so joyful when it finally arrived and he even called us at our room to inform us about it. When we discovered that Alitalia had damaged the lock on our suitcase and requested Alessandro to send out someone to find us a lock that would fit, he did so immediately. The bellboy that he sent went to four different stores but was unsuccessful but when I met him at the elevator, he was cheerful about his fruitless search and seemed surprised and quite pleased when we gave him a tip upon check-out. Bernardo also recommended an excellent restaurant to us for dinner, Girarostro da Fiorentino, which was 10 minutes away from the hotel.

Nice gesture for sure, but shouldn't the (inexpensive) bottle of prosecco have been in our room upon check-in anyway?

We had some friends staying in a different room, completely decorated in a different, modern fashion, that made us want to see further room designs. The rooftop is a great place for lunch or just to grab a drink. When we ordered an espresso martini, Walter the bartender came over to our table to ask how we liked it and what improvements he could make, as he had never made one before. We recommended that he shake all of the ingredients together to make the \"froth\". 10 minutes later he arrived at our table with two incredibly frothy martinis. It is nice to see someone take pride in their work. The business center is incredibly easy to use, no codes or passwords like other hotels. The exercise room is small, but open 24 hours. There are individual televisions on each treadmill, so bring your ear buds. The hotel is a few minute walk to the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, high end shops and many restaurants.

The 85 euros were worth it. (Although I wasn't informed of the charge until check out.) The Hotel Eden is a stunning facility with very ornate & elaborate furnishings. One will feel like royalty upon entering the Hotel Eden. That quickly ends when you meet the early daytime mgr. I had politely requested if there was an upgrade available for Starwood Gold Members? Loudly he broadcasted that since we were staying at the Hotel Eden using our Starwood Points, that an upgrade was not possible. It was both embarassing & degrading to make such an announcement. It was obvious by the look of his female assistants desk agent that she was also embarassed by his reply. I understand that other hotel guest pay for rooms, but so have I many many times before. There should be no preferential treatment for someone who is paying with the Euro or with points. Upon check out, the same mgr was at the desk that am. We requested if there was transportation to the Sheraton Roma where we schedule to stay close to the airport because of an early flight. He claimed they were not affiliated with the Sheraton.

The lobby and sitting area is gorgeous, with elegant marble and furnishings. The front desk staff were incredibly helpful and kind. There is a concierge available to call taxis, provide directions, and offer recommendations for eateries and things to do. We were in a room on the 3rd floor with a gorgeous marble bathroom and great tub/shower combination. The room itself was huge in comparison to other hotels in the area. The ceilings had to be close to 15 feet high with a chandelier and 2 windows. Once with a view of the courtyard area and the other with a view of the park and University across the street. It was a stunning view. I was fortunate enough to get a tour of the hotel from the sales manager, Stefano. He was so kind and gave me a great deal of information about the hotel. I was able to see the penthouse suite, a few studio suites, and a three level suite. Almost all suites connect to a double deluxe room, which is excellent for people traveling in groups or for parents who was a bit of luxury with the kids nearby. I also toured the upstairs restaurant which is renowned as a great place to dine with spectacular views. It certainly did not fall short on the views aspect. On the 6th floor of the hotel and with no obstructions around it, you can see over Rome for a few miles in all directions. We only had a day in Rome before our flight back to NY, so we wanted to see all we could in the Vatican. It is a short walk from the Spanish Steps (and the Metro Stop-Spagna), which we used to get around for the day. It was a very hot day, and after about 6 hours of touring, we returned to the hotel to find a complimentary bottle of red wine waiting for us. It was a very nice gesture, but we were so tired and dehydrated that drinking wine probably would not have been the greatest idea. Plus, we had just come off a 12 day Mediterranean cruise, so I think my liver had all it could take at that point :). There is a turndown service in which you are given a pair of slippers. This might have been the best part: it was a small touch that made a real difference after walking around in Rome all day and night. I recommend this hotel to everyone.

She performed all of this with an extremely understanding and positive attitude. The efforts they put forth to rectify the issue were much appreciated. You can be sure that you will get what you are expecting, or else the staff at the Eden will make it right. Location -- We took cabs nearly everywhere from here for convenience.

Business services -- The have wireless internet throughout that works great. It is 15 Euros for 24 consecutive hours. Restaurant/bar - Nice location on the rooftop.

We had researched hotels looking for someplace special, centrally located, lots of amenities, and a great reputation for service and comfort. We thought Hotel Eden would fit the bill. What a disappointment. Ok, there was a doorman to greet us, someone escorted us to our room, probably because it was located around so many corridors away from the elevator, they figured we'd NEVER find it. The room was lovely, but very noisy. Our room was in an uncarpeted hall area and heavy doors from other guest rooms were always closing 'hard and noisily\". Thought we'd have to ask for a different room, but eventually it quieted down late in evening. After returning from dinner figured there was no turn down service since room was exactly as we had left it, so we started to get ready for bed....then someone starts ringing our door asking us, at perhaps 8:30, if WE want HER to prepare the room. Hmmm, a little late. Hotel staff not particularly friendly, upon arrival we were never told of food credits we were given (that way we could enjoy a complete breakfast) so we thought we were only entitled to a \"continental breakfast at 33 Euros each\" consisting of few croissants and coffee while a nice breakfast buffet was available just behind us. Finally, since we were sooo hungry, we asked how much breakfast was, only then did they \"check\" to see of we could have breakfast with our room price (which was rediculously expensive), which it WAS!! Next day, stiff, awkward servers showed us to a table where there was a total LACK of service. Someone brought over coffee, never offered juice, never came back to refill coffee or ask if there was anything we needed. We were on our own. Second night asked concierge to make dinner recommendations and reservations for us. He called a cab for us only to realize (once we were on the way) that the driver had NO idea where this place was (concierge should have given him (and us) a written name and address of this restaurant) So he drove around, couldn't understand or speak English with us, and just pointed for us to go down some alley to find it somewhere over there...We had to call concierge several times to try to talk to the cab driver, and us for additional directions. No help. Never did find this restaurant, never got apology from concierge. Wished we could have dropped bread crumbs along a path, would have helped us find our way back to the hotel. Not a good feeling to dropped off in a unfamiliar city after asking for assistance from the concierge to find a nice restaurant for dinner. Don't waste your money at this hotel. It's WAY too expensive and there are LOTS of elegant, less expensive and friendlier hotels in the area. It's defintiely NOT worth it. Very sad and disappointing for us as we had such high hopes for a fantastic welcoming stay at Hotel Eden.

We had many sites that were on our don't-miss list, and the Eden fit our needs for a number of reasons. The taxi to the hotel was a bit nerve-racking once we entered the city proper. After the overnight flight we were ready to relax in the hotel a bit. The taxi is \u20ac40 as a standard fee (within the walls) but he got us to our hotel with good cheer (he was patient with my Italian) and was quite proud of his city. The hotel is lovely when you enter after a very pleasant greeting from the door staff. There are a couple of attractive rooms right off the lobby to sit and read or relax for a bit. The front desk staff was efficient and helpful; much more formal, too, than the staffs at our subsequent hotels in Florence and Venice. They were ceaselessly helpful which we much appreciated. Our room was lovely with high ceilings, a nicely situated desk, plenty of closet and drawer space, and a very comfortable bed. The only drawback was the heat - the room was uncomfortably warm and the air conditioner controls did not seem to help matters. We often slept with the windows open, pulling the lovely and extravagant drapes off to the side and opening the shutters. The bathroom, with a bidet, was large and spotlessly clean at all times. There was a long two-sink counter, with nice toiletries and plenty of towels. The tub was high, making getting in and out of the shower a bit tricky. Make sure you're holding onto something! Good water pressure, which is always welcome. The towel warming racks were helpful, too, as it poured rain while we were there and they helped to dry socks and shirts. The Terrace on the 6th floor has marvelous views of St Peter's and Rome down to the Tiber. It was a treat each day to start with coffee and to be greeted so warmly (there is full breakfast service and a buffet that was quite attractive, too). I popped my head in one evening to see an elegant crowd enjoying the jazz combo in the bar. I meant to return but was always too tired from sightseeing. The Eden has a nice location - the Spanish Steps are five minutes away, and the Via Veneto is up at the end of the Via Ludovisi. The hotel is also near the Villa Borghese, home of the exquisite Galleria Borghese, a must see. A nice amenity that many hotels could and should follow is the free Internet access in the business center. Ask at the desk and you will get a username and password for unlimited time online (others may be waiting, though). I loved this feature and, all things being equal, would be the reason I return to the Eden before trying another hotel. A good choice, though it is expensive. Its location means you can walk to many sites and it is near a number of transportation hubs for farther destinations.

There's a great deal of personal attention paid to guests due to the relatively smaller size of the number of guestrooms. By no means is this a small hotel (120 rooms), but its size does help manage to avoid some of the \"hotel mill\" of many of its larger sized competitors. We're a 3 person family, and the Eden offered one of the best deals on a junior suite that would accommodate us (about $600/n).

I have to say a few more words about the concierge staff all of whom showed us genuine hospitality in looking after every detail of our stay whether they were planning our a visit to the Galleria Borghese or suggesting an excellent restaurant or trattoria known better to locals than tourists. The front desk staff and Mr. Levy the general manager, impressed us even further by remembering my husband's birthday with a delicious bottle of wine which we enjoyed from our balcony overlooking gorgeous Rome in the early evening.

We absolutely love Rome! We stayed at other five star hotels in Rome, Lord Bryon(nice hotel, inconvenient location) the first time and Hotel de Russie(pricey, great location) the second time. We prefer Hotel Eden because it is a discrete and elegant hotel and conveniently located. If one is looking for more flash and a hotel right in the middle of things as soon as you step out, then Hotel de Russie is probably a better choice. Eden is tucked away on a quiet street but if you walk a couple of blocks, then you are by the Spanish Steps, the best shopping, restaurants, etc. I know some people have been disappointed by the small size of the standard room at the Eden or the room being nothing particularly special for the high price. I think there is some truth to that for the basic standard room. However, keep in mind that European hotel standards are generally lower than those in America. Also, the Eden is a \"grand dame\" hotel (which is part of its charm) and not some ultra modern property in suburban Florida. We paid for an upgraded room and it makes all the difference! It's much bigger and better appointed. I understand the suites are even nicer but obviously more expensive. There are no two rooms that are alike though at the hotel. The big downside is how exorbitant the breakfast (as well as the minbar and lobby drink service) is at the hotel. Breakfast was roughly $70+ per person, and we decided it was not worth having at the hotel . We instead went to a local bar/cafe a 5 minute walk from the hotel and had a wonderful capuccino/espresso and warm panino and saw the bustling local scene which was more interesting to us. Someone mentioned on Tripadvisor that they thought the sheets were rough. This is probably due to that reviewer having never encountered linen sheets before. The hotel uses actual linen sheets which was crisp and cool and especially inviting on hot summer nights in July. As far as the staff, we thought they could be more polished and accomodating. They are a bit standoffish, which may be unintential on their part Conclusion: We would stay at the Eden when we go back Rome but opt for an upgraded room/suite.

We were not on business, we are younger than the average guest at this hotel but this is no excuse to be treated poorly.

Here we are expecting a fairytale experience at a 5 star hotel and it was just so poor and so sad for us. My husband called down three times and was hung up on(first night of our honeymoon in Italy.. yes. true story) and had to call starwoods directly to be put on hold for an hour to address the rate and the random fruit basket for the guest the hotel actually cared about. We were then told by starwoods customer service that they would not adjust the rate but would send us a box of chocolates to ease our pain. Real words said to a starwoods gold member. We packed our stuff and left the hotel. When we checked out for our hour stay the manager on duty at the front desk was the most sarcastic jerk I have ever met. Should not be working in hospitality at a fine hotel. This was probably the worst experience I have ever had traveling and I don't think anyone, honeymoon or not, should ever stay here.

Next time I will be staying somewhere else and you should too!", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "FL, USA", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel... and Very Expensive!\u201d", "Author": "brytpa", "ReviewID": "UR68261761", "Content": "The overall impression I came away with after staying at the Hotel Eden is that it's an extremely nice hotel, yet also incredibly expensive. Mind you, pricey Rome hotels are by no means a rarity! But travelers should be warned costs can most definitely add up at the Hotel Eden - beware those incidentals! Booked in to Hotel Eden for 6 nights in November, 2010. Booked through a Starwood promo (pay for 4 nights, get 2 additional nights free), so I felt pretty good about things heading in as I'd saved a hefty chunk of money by getting those last 2 nights free. At check-in, I was told I'd been given a larger room than I'd reserved on account of Starwood Platinum status. It was to be an interior courtyard room, though. I asked if they could still give me the smaller room-type I'd originally reserved, yet with an exterior view. The front desk happily obliged that request, and the views are definitely worth it from this hotel! Wonderful views from many upper floor rooms and from the restaurant/bar on the top floor. It's located on a higher point of Rome, so the views from our window were wonderful and well worth a smaller room. The actual room itself was a bit small, but having stayed in many a European hotel room it didn't strike me as unusually small - if anything, it was quite normal and as expected. Bathroom was almost as big as the room itself! Huge bathroom, and quite a luxurious one at that. Room was very quiet (no hallway noise, and windows did a good enough job shutting out street noise... unless there was a car horn honking marathon taking place out in the street... it happens often enough in Rome!). Service was great throughout the stay - helpful staff, friendly staff, attentive and efficient. Hotel Eden has a reputation for being one of the nicer hotels in the city and quite the history behind it, and it seemed to me the staff were genuinely proud of that and interested in maintaining it. They always seemed eager to accommodate various requests - for additional room amenities; moving a table closer to the window in the bar to better soak in the better views; a pot of coffee delivered to the room at specific times each day, and so on. Now... on to those incidentals! Breakfast is anything but cheap! It came out to over 80 Euro per person! Needless to say, we did that only once. A Coke from the mini-bar? Around 15 Euro. Those daily pots of coffee? OK... not cheap, but quite a bargain relative to everything else! Internet connection came at a price, food, drinks, etc. Despite any savings from those 2 free nights, incidentals most definitely brought the total price back up quite quickly before the end of the trip! I should add that some friends were staying at a nearby hotel of similar standards, and found their experience there to be the same. So it could very well just be how it is with higher-end hotels in this part of Rome. Just be prepared! Location-wise, it's great. Short walks to many sights. Many other reviews mention the Spanish Steps being just a couple blocks away. Indeed, they are! But many other great sites or also just short walks away, and there are great streets and neighborhoods to stroll through all around. Mind you, walking to the sights from the hotel will almost always be downhill - which makes for an uphill return! If you tire yourself out walking around, a taxi back to the hotel could be worth considering! So, if you're aware of how expensive this place can get and are ok with it, I think you'll be more than pleased and happy at Hotel Eden. If you're the savvy traveler who can find good prices on rooms, and then avoid incidentals (ask hotel to clear out minibar so you can use it as a fridge... stay off the internet... don't order any movies... never dine at the hotel... etc), I'd imagine you would also be very happy here. But if incidental charges are a problem and you don't want to pay too much more than the cost of room itself, either stay away or be prepared!", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "el dorado hills, ca", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "candacegar", "ReviewID": "UR67727711", "Content": "We were celebrating a special anniversary and planned a 5-star trip to the UK and Italy.

As we were getting on the plane, we booked the hotel for 4 nights through American Express Centurion requesting a deluxe room facing the front with a balcony. AE informed us that the requested rooms were available but couldn\u2019t be guaranteed. The booking also included \u201ca stay 3 nights, get 4th night free\u201d special being offered by the hotel. Imagine our surprise when we got there the next morning 12 hours after we booked and were told there were no rooms with balconies available. We were offered an \u201cupgrade\u201d to a suite on the first floor looking out to a municipal garage or a studio room looking into an interior airway. We chose the suite, simply for size as none of the standard rooms had a view much different than the upgrades. We were warned that it could be slightly noisy due to traffic on the street adjoining the hotel. Since we live in New York, that didn\u2019t bother us. But we were not warned that there were two other unusual noise problems we discovered that night: you could hear the water pipes in the wall all night, and that, starting at 5:30 am until midnight or 1:30 am, the room shakes from a nearby metro line which rumbles by underground every few minutes. In general, while the size of the room itself was adequate, it needed a major renovation. This room (room 114) was what would generally be called an executive suite, with a small bedroom separated by French doors from a sitting area; it could hardly be called a nice suite. The furnishings were old and dowdy. The wood floors were faded and worn. The draperies looked old and tired and were made of cheap fabric (think Wal-Mart). The king bed was not, but rather two twins put together with ugly stripe twin fabric headboards attached to the wall. There was no hairdryer in the bathroom due to \u201csecurity\u201d reasons (The real reason was that there was no plug in the bathroom). We stay in the very best hotels throughout the world and this definitely would not qualify for five stars in any of them. When I asked for a different suite and offered to pay additional, I was told that they were all booked by families with kids. Needless to say, I saw only one child in the four days that we spent at the hotel. Also shocking were the \u201cextra\u201d prices. A coke in the bar on the roof was 10 Euro; internet service in the room, 26 Euro; pasta in the restaurant, 35-45 Euro; appetizers in the restaurant, 45 Euro; a tiny bags of chips in the room\u2019s minibar, 10 Euro. Even without considering the times and that the Eden is a Starwood property\u2014so they are certainly aware of what is going on in the world\u2014I find these prices ridiculous. When we went to check out, I was not surprised to see that we had been charged for all four nights despite the fact that we specifically confirmed the special when we checked in. After disputing the charge, the hotel went back and checked the original reservations, or so they said\u2014I think they were trying to see if they could get away with it either because we might not notice, or more likely they have learned that not every American makes a scene to get what what was agreed to. In any event, whatever the reason, I shouldn\u2019t have had to find the \u201cerror\u201d and get it corrected. On the plus side, the hotel is very well located and the staff is generally pleasant and seems to try hard. However, for a five star hotel, their concierges really don\u2019t seem to understand what is considered a high-end, foodie restaurant. They steered us to restaurants that may have been great in the past, but certainly wouldn\u2019t be considered gourmet on the international level. It would behoove the hotel to have the main concierge person actually eat at all the top restuarants. Also it would be helpful to have copies of the menus from the top restaurants available at the concierge as most fine hotels do. Unfortunately, we did not get to see any rooms with a balcony (all on the fifth floor), but I do believe that those and other rooms on the fifth floor may have been renovated as the hallways on the fifth floor have been redone. So if you stay at the Eden, insist on the fifth-floor with a balcony (even if they say they won\u2019t guarantee it, insist on the reference in their confirmation, or take the Presidential suite if you don\u2019t mind spending too much for a room in this hotel). Also, know that if you book through American Express, you will in all likelihood be given a studio with a horrible interior view, or a \u201csuite\u201d upgrade, which will likely be room 114, as that seems to be their method of operation for dealing with the upgrade.

This was our first time in Rome. We booked our room at the Hotel Eden via the Starwood Preferred Guest program's Cash & Points offer. THE LOCATION: The Hotel Eden is located on the Pincian Hill, off the Via Veneto in the northern section of central Rome. While it is not far from the Spanish Steps, with its tourist groups, honeymooners, designer shopping bag-toting ladies, loitering teens and hustling street buskers, the Hotel Eden feels a world apart. The street in front of the hotel, Via Ludovisi, can be busy during the day as cars fly by. The closest Metro stations are at Spagna (Piazza di Spagna / Spanish Steps) and at the foot of Via Veneto (Barberini). This is useful for getting to/from sites like the Colosseum and the Ancient Roman Forum, Vatican City, and so on. However, the hotel is on a small hill so if you have heavy luggage, make arrangements with a taxi or car service instead of tuckering yourself out on the incline. The 116 bus stops along Via Veneto en route to the historic center of Rome; sometimes it was a small electric \"taxi\", which we often had to ourselves to/from the Pantheon. The reservations-only Galleria Borghese is a nearby treat if you are interested in High Renaissance and Baroque art (particularly sculptures by Bernini). THE LOBBY: The hotel exudes class from the moment you step in past the uniformed porters and are greeted by the front of house. There is a Brioni boutique on the ground floor, should you need an Italian suit. THE ROOM: We stayed in Room no. 404, a corner unit facing south, with a partial view of \"Il Vittoriano\", the moment to Vittorio Emanuele II near the Ancient Roman Forum. The room was decently sized, with a plush bed, walk-in closet, dresser and modestly sized LCD TV (the personalized greeting on the TV was a nice touch). The room itself was handsome, with beautiful wallpaper and corniced ceilings. The marble bathroom was beautiful, with toiletries by Penhaligon's and Marvis. We were also impressed by the hot water delivery in the shower/tub combo. High-speed Internet was available for a fee (hourly or flat daily rate). Street noise was somewhat audible when the windows were open, but when closed it wasn't a bother. FOOD & SERVICE: The concierge desk was charming and aim to please; they made great conversation (in good English), including letting us know who won the Spanish F1 Grand Prix the previous weekend (we missed it when our prior accommodations in the Cinque Terre didn't have a functioning TV). The welcome gift was a box of pates de fruits. The hotel's restaurant, La Terrazza dell'Eden, boasts a Michelin star and extraordinary views of Rome, but we were content with splurging on a bottle of red (with complimentary apertivi) in the piano bar and watching the sun set behind St. Peter's. One of the great highlights of our trip. If I didn't snag a SPG awards room, I don't know if I'd ever have thought of staying at the Hotel Eden due to its high price (normally out of my price range), but I would recommend it to friends and fellow SPG members who have the means to experience this slice of Old World elegance.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cEnjoy the view\u201d", "Author": "hgeslin", "ReviewID": "UR49991607", "Content": "I stayed one night at this hotel for business trip.

The sheets were crisp linen which I thought was unusual and would be uncomfortable, but we slept just fine. I was worried that since we were on the first floor that traffic noise would be a problem, but the drivers only seemed to love their horns during daylight hours. I would have liked to stay on a higher floor for the views, but there was not one available for our stay. We walked all over Rome and rarely used the public transportation. Hotel Eden has a great central location. It is on a hill so when you walk away it's always downhill and when you return it's always uphill. That makes the views more enjoyable, but when you are tired at the end of the day the climb seems steeper. We didn't eat in the restaurant on the top floor. It is very expensive (minimum 110 euros apiece plus wine), but we did go up there before dinner guests were seated and allowed to look around and take lots of pictures. I would agree with the reviewers who have said it has one of the most spectacular views of Rome. The staff was very helpful with any request we had.

The hotel has an airport limo but it is just as easy, and half the price, to get your own taxi by waiting in the designated line at the airport. The concierge can book rail transport or there is an American Express office in the Piazza di Spagna that can help with travel reservations.

I was very wrong. The location of Hotel Eden is very central. However, from a walking point of view, be prepared for a lot of hills and stairs getting to and from the hotel. It is located at the top portion of the Spanish Steps, but you still have a very hilly area to navigate if you are a walker. That is all I have to say about the location, because after all, Rome is so beautiful. My complaints are with respect to the staff. They were incredibly rude to us. My husband and I booked one night. We were with our 14 year old son. The front desk immediately said we were not able to check in because we had three people. They further denied any possibility of upgrading the room. My gold status with Starwood meant nothing to them. I asked about transferring our reservation to the other Starwood property in Rome, and they said I would have to attempt that myself. They would not call for us. Mind you, when in Italy, most do not have direct access to phone lines like we do in the US. So although it seems like it would have been easy to start calling about for another hotel, we did not have mobile phones and Hotel Eden would not help us out. After practically begging them to let us stay at the hotel which we had booked and used 20K star points to reserve, we were ushered to the smallest room I have ever seen at a hotel. We requested some blankets for our son to pad himself from the floor, and they treated us like vagabonds. We brought to the attention of the front desk that the leg of the chair was broken, and we were accused of breaking it, even though it was caked in old dried glue from a previous attempt to mend it. I know I am sounding petty, but please understand we were in Italy 3 weeks and encountered such warmth and friendliness from Italians. All the other hotels treated us like honored guests and with common dignity. Please expect the opposite from Starwood's Hotel Eden. We moved to a hotel in Vatican City the following day, and were delighted. Save your points. Don't even consider throwing away your money at this Hotel. Yes, from the outside it looks very beautiful.

When I arrived, the host wanted to sit me in the back of the restaurant with no view.

The host said \"that isn't possible\", because those tables were already reserved. Two tables with a window view were open. I pressed, and the host finally sat me at a table per my reservation.

The hotel is in a nice location just off Via Veneto, a main thoroughfare of Rome. The reception staff is exceptional. The concierges are a little rushed and could be more helpful. For example we asked about the OpenTour busses and they showed us where the bus picked up, but neglected to share that you need an advance ticket (?). So we waited for 20 minutes before learning we had to buy a pass. We thought this was odd. However, they did get us into a fabulous restaurant our last night, La Pergola-- a real treat. The restaurant's views are incredible. Food was good. Sadly, we were seated next to the waiter's station and had to listen to credit card machines and the waiters chatting most of the meal, especially for the price. There is a garden restaurant but it was extremely hot on the deck. The rooms are attractive with lovely antiques and a nice flat screen tv. The issues we had were: The shower was a converted tub and very narrow so your feet were on angels up each side of the tub making it a little hard to stand. The sheets were the most uncomfortable we have ever slept on--my daughter nailed it when she said they felt like sandpaper. Where are the Heavenly beds??? Also, on two of the mornings, we woke up to drilling and hammering. And although they moved us once, it didn't fix the issue. I just felt that we should have been offered some compensation for that from the manager other than a free breakfast one day. Also, we were on Starpoints and although we booked months in advance and requested a view room--we did not receive that. We found after 3 Westin stays in Europe that it seems the Europeans get the view rooms and there is some mild bias against Americans still. The other issue that really bothered us was that normallky breakfast was not included (even though we were spending 12,000 points per night) and it was 57 EURO (about 80US) each person for a very simple buffet breakfast! We just don't think that it's smart for a hotel to insult us with such pricing. And there wasn't any coffee available. So we had to go up the street to get croissants and coffee for 5E or so.

It met our expectations for a Roman hotel in this price range except that the cost of breakfast from room service or in the restaurant is outrageously expensive for some reason and definitely not worth it. You'd be much better off wandering around the neighbourhood and taking breakfast at one of the many little authentic cafes near the hotel instead. We can highly recommend the Cafe Greco. Their cafe latte is a definite must! The hotel is located in the downtown core, close to the Spanish Steps and is nicely situated on top of a little hill giving it great views of Rome's skyline. Our room on the 4th floor faced the front of the hotel so in addition to the skyline views we saw some beautiful sunsets too. The room had a high ceiling and had tasteful, but not elaborate, muted furnishings, all in good condition. However, there were two problems with the room: 1. the thermostat was not working properly so even though we set it at 20 degrees celsius, by the middle of the night our room was like a sauna. We opened the windows for some fresh air but the second problem we discovered with the room was the noise: at 3:00AM there were garbage trucks emptying bottles from bins! Also making noise day and night were groups of tourists waiting for tour buses to arrive on the opposite side of the street in front of the hotel. There was also continuous noise from cars and people entering and leaving a popular public parking garage. The problem is that the front of the hotel seems to have the best views so you need to chose between noise or a good view. The public areas in the hotel were nice. The lobby was beautifully furnished and well maintained and they serve afternoon tea on an upper level. The concierge was really on the ball and he was very helpful for securing reservations and providing general information.

I stayed at Hotel Lungarno in Florence which is part of a mini-chain started by Ferragamo ... and they have a hotel in Rome that I would probably try on my next visit.

This is truly a superb luxury hotel. Our room was one of the larger rooms, and was very spacious and elegant. The marble bathroom was huge and very nice, with luxurious towels, robes, linens and amenities. Everything was absolutely top-notch. Had we been on a higher floor (we were on the 2nd floor), we would have had great views over gardens, to church domes and other sights of Rome. As it was, we could see palm trees and other greenery, and the twin towers of the Trinita dei Monte at the top of Spanish Steps. (Be sure to reserve an exterior-view room. The interior view is not so appealing.) The hotel's location beside gardens and in a quiet area of beautiful, elegant buildings and greenery was excellent, and was a welcome respite from the traffic and concrete of the city. Most mornings, we walked about 2 blocks down the tree-lined and relatively quiet street to a small bar for coffee and chocolate-filled croissants for breakfast. This elegant and peaceful setting in such a bustling city really made a difference in our stay. Yet we were less than a 10-minute walk to the top of the Spanish Steps, and within easy walking distance to the Borghese Galleries and the Trevi Fountain. The service was outstanding, from everyone we encountered. After only one day, the doormen recognized us, and consistently greeted us warmly. The concierge's restaurant recommendations were very good, and in line with the price range of other restaurants we inquired about. We were made to feel like welcome guests each time we entered the hotel. The hotel had a smaller, more intimate feel than most large luxury hotels, which enhanced our stay. We enjoyed cocktails on the rooftop terrace at sunset one night, with a wonderful view of Rome, including the dome of St. Peters. This was my third trip to Rome, each time staying in one of the top-ranked hotels, and the Eden was by far the best!

As with other reviewers, having arrived before our room was ready we were escorted to the roof top terrace for complimentary drinks - Vintage Krug champagne went down rather well as a start to our break. The head concierge, a vital part of a well run establishment, was courteous, charming and efficient and recommended two superb restaurants during our stay, one tucked away in a back street for a light lunch which was exactly what I had requested. We dined in the Eden restaurant on the first night and had a splendid meal; having had an early start to the day we had crashed out in the room at 5pm and were woken by a call from reception at 7pm gently \"reminding\" us of our dinner reservation, my wife thinks she vaguely remembers housekeeping trying to come in for turn down and we are sure that they told reception that we might need a little nudge awake!.

We felt like the hotel fleeced and abused us. Considering what we paid, we had expected first-class service with commensurate amenities. Here's what we got instead: - The hotel concierge was irresponsible and utterly useless. He was brusque, sent us to a wrong location for a purchase (wasting about 1/2 hour of time) and told us wrong information about the Borghese Gallery (wasting another 1/2 hour of our time). - The hotel has a gym. Stay away from it -- it is dangerous. In the 19 years since I began working out regularly with weights, I've never been injured -- until my encounter with the weight machines at the Eden. Several are seriously miscalibrated, with uneven tension. The Eden machines caused me to suffer a painful strain. - Poor value: Our reservation was inadvertently booked for just one person (it might have been our error), so the hotel asked us to pay a \"supplement\" (about $140) because we are two people. No problem. But hotels that do that typically provide something of value for the extra money, such as an extra bed, or in the case of a couple, a larger or more comfortable room. Not so at the Eden. We got the same tiny room for a single person (among the smallest, according to the hotel's own floor plan), with a bathroom so cramped that my husband and I could not both be in there at the same time. The bathroom door slams into the toilet if you open it too wide. There was barely closet space for one (and we traveled only with carry-on bags). - Annoying nickel and diming: We made several long collect and toll-free calls from the hotel phone to report lost credit cards. We were told there would be a phone \"connection charge.\" Of course. But the \"connection charge\" is not a small one-time fee, it turned out. The Eden charges you for the *entire duration* of your call, even if you use a calling card. Our final phone bills were shocking. - A certain coldness and attitude among the front-desk staff and concierge that was a bit unnecessary and frankly, off-putting. I honestly think they try to make some of their guests feel like they are nobodies, which they probably thought we were. If they only knew.... What we liked about the Eden: - Old World charm (but we could have gotten that at many hotels in Rome), meticulously restored. - An amazing combination of shutters and black-out curtains on our window.

For those who have remarked in previous reviews about the aloof, elitest and snobbish attitude of the staff, I can only suggest that perhaps you received service that reflected your own personalities. I simply can't speak highly enough about the welcome that we received upon arrival and this theme continued throughout our stay. Warm, friendly, accommodating, professional, efficient.... I could go on forever! Also take into consideration that we were staying there on a special \"Starwood STARHOT\" rate reserved for Starwood staff members (my wife) and so we paid considerably less. This had no bearing whatsoever on the treatment that we received from the staff. Old world charm and ceremony abounds and one really feels that they are living in the luxuriant lap of some bygone era. Now, to say that The Eden is in the norm expensive is an understatement of the highest order; usually a room will set you back in the vicinity of 700 Euro per night but remember that this is an hotel that markets itself toward the rich and famous, politicians and high-end executive types. That said, 8 Euro for a Snickers from the minibar is simply taking the mickey... A continental breakfast for 1 with coffee, 4 pastries and juice was 30 Euro plus 6.50 for room service delivery. Full English breakfast was 50 Euro plus delivery per person A mini can of Coke from the minibar was 8 Euro.... Suffice it to say that by any standard these are outrageous prices but again, remember that usually they are dealing with customers for whom the price is not a factor. In terms of the accommodation, elegant and simple period decor is in evidence everywhere and while the run of the mill rooms are not jaw droppingly gorgeous, they are spacious and comfortable. Bathrooms are large with marble floors and features, and enough goodies to open your own beauty parlour. Housekeeping come in during the evening to turn down the bed, leave a little chocolate treat alongside the following days' weather forecast, fix up the room and bathroom, lay out your slippers and jim-jams and generally make you feel special. To summarise, Hotel Eden is a fabulous example of how an hotel should be run but at the price is only available to the privileged few who can afford it.

In summary underwelming and overpriced.If your thinking about staying at the Eden my advise would be choose 1 of the other many luxury hotels in the via veneto area and visit the Edens outdoor restaurant which has the same view as la teresa is served from the same kitchen in my opinion has better ambiance and is certainly better value.", "Date": "September 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "RoadWorrier", "ReviewID": "UR5508182", "Content": "Stayed three nights at the Eden while in Rome for business.
