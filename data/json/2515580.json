There was a television in the living area where our son slept and an additional television in the separate bedroom. Bathroom was large and very clean. We slept well, but one should be aware that this hotel is basically across the street from the airport. Our room was facing the airport, so we were very close. The noise did not bother us and it entertained our son for quite some time. However, you may want to ask for a room on the opposite side of the hotel is you are sensitive to the noise. Did it sound like a 747 was going to come into our room? No, but, we could hear the dull roar of jet planes. They seemed to stop from about 10pm-6am (though maybe I was too tired to hear them?).

From the MGM you can get the monorail or Deuce bus to the central Strip [too far to walk] The 'pool' is merely an unheated plunge pool, no bar service [indeed no alcohol in this hotel at all!] and no dining room, just a self-service breakfast area. Food can be ordered from your room for delivery by courier. So for just B&B this is fine, as long as you don't plan to lounge around in the hotel. We booked one night only, based on price and convenience for getting away to the airport for an early flight. For a longer stay, we would look elsewhere, preferably as near to Bellagio as possible/affordable if the Strip is your bag. Bear in mind that once away from this hotel you probably won't be returning for lunch, rest, shower, dinner, etc, so you may be better in a more central hotel with more amenities.

Yesterday when we called the hotel to book a room the front desk agent (name is available if needed) told us there were no rooms available when we were simultaneously checking rates online. Needless to say we booked a room on line, however this the first red flag. After checking in, we called down to the front desk, same guy answered as we inquired were the nearest place to get a sandwich for takeout would be after a long day of traveling. We were told to press *611 on our phone? After trying X611 for about 20 minutes I realized this was not working from the room phone. It was not until later that evening when I noticed our room key card that showed Dial *611 for Sunset Pizza. I was not expecting Ritz-Carlton service however this was a joke. I went online and found 20 plus places to grab food all within 1 mile radius of the hotel. Did you know your room windows do not open, or crack for that matter? I live in Colorado and like fresh air, I have never stayed at a hotel that the windows don't crack. Will they open in the event of a fire? I can see with the airport being so close the nose could be an issue. However a stuffy hotel room in Vegas is not ideal.. Last but NOT least, the property is advertised as dog friendly. This should be changed, ASAP or upgrades need to be made to accommodate dogs. There is NO grass, when I inquired a nice lady at the front desk told me were in the desert... Again, not really what I wanted to hear, luckily I had a car and was able to drive down to Sunset Park to let my dog go potty. P.S. I wasn't even going to mention the kids running up and down the halls of the hotel all evening long or the party that took place downstairs that had someone throw up all over the hallways and elevator.

The beds rival any big name, big price hotel which is great after a long day on the strip.

We noticed that the staff was all quite young but don't let that fool you. This staff is top notch! They are all very pleasant and helpful and are not at all jaded by years in the industry.

Great rooms...clean, very comfortable beds with pillow top mattresses. I had a great sleep here, and that's saying something since I don't usually sleep all that well in hotels. The bathroom included a bathtub and shower, which was great since I've found that many of the business type hotels that I've encountered lately only have showers installed. The free breakfast was nice, and goes beyond the usual continental fare. Saved myself a fair amount of money by eating breakfast at the hotel every morning. The pool looked nice though I didn't use it personally, and the hotel is still quite new, so everything still appears clean and fresh. I also consistently do a bedbug check in every hotel I stay, and there were no signs of any at this hotel nor online on the bedbug registry. This hotel is bedbug free. The free shuttle service to and from the airport as well as the strip was a big bonus for me--and you guessed it--saved me a another chunk of money not having to pay for taxicabs. Best of all, the staff were excellent throughout. Front desk, breakfast, cleaning, and shuttle service staff were all very friendly and extremely accommodating.

Read all the good stuff from other reviews and brush off the bad. This hotel overlooks the runway. But unless you are used to sleeping in cave or a pillow warehouse, the sound is not intrusive at all. Sitting by the pool, it's cool to watch the planes come or go. Hell, the kids yelling in the pool is noisier. Traffic is noisier on the strip. And the air conditioner in the rooms more than covers any remnant noise from the planes. The hotel is new and has new hotel smell, new sheet feel and new furniture firm. And the price is great at $89 plus gov't extortion fees. For me this time, it was free with La Quinta Frequent Sleeper points. But you need a car here. It is 4.5 kms from the strip, 6.6 kms to Mandelay Bay if that works for you as a reference (No my American friends, I don't know what that is in miles..or football fields). Book the car on-line cuz it's waaaay cheaper than booking in a hotel or just showing up. Use a premium charge card to avoid the insurance that will double the daily rate of the rental. All the hotels have some free parking. And you'll end up seeing more of Vegas instead of just the carpet weave passed out in a drunken stupor. Also...this is not a fault of the hotel but of the Las Vegas Airport. Find out exactly where \"Level O\" is at the arrivals level as that is where the La Quinta shuttle arrives. There is no one at the baggage claim to ask except workers (I HATE asking workers. It's not their job to act as tour guides to dopey tourists). I called for the shuttle but grabbed a cab as Level O wasn't worth the exploration adventure. The exit from the airport, the road network to the hotel and the ignorance of my driver resulted in a $25 cab ride...and I can see, with binoculars, the arrivals doors from my window in 303! Apparantly, you can't get here from there. But it would be a 10 minute walk across the runway. Returning to the airport though is a snap as the road layout works that direction. So...the room...3rd floor, 1 room away from the end wall to the runway, noise not a problem, nice sofa and 2 chairs, big flat screen, granite counters and shower stall, lots of lamps for light for Geezers-In-Training like myself, fast internet, microwave, fridge, coffee, iron, all new, all clean, decent breakfast...it's all here. It's a small walk (long walk for my American friends ;-) ) to a couple of largely vacant new shopping malls on the corner. The economy really is in the tank isn't it. MacDonalds close, a 7-11 on the corner, a pub and restaurant nearby. I like this place. I'm spending the next 6 nights at the Luxor.

We chose this hotel for its non-smoking designation and I was so disappointed when I could smell cigarette smoke making it's way into our room. In the morning, as we walked down for breakfast, I found a guest waiting for someone with his room door opened. They were trying to cover up the cigarette smoke with an aerosol spray.

The front desk staff was very helpful from check in to check out. They were great with questions and replacing lost room keys and getting our rooms close together. They even hand delivered our welcome bags to each of the guests rooms so that they were waiting there when the guests arrived. On our wedding day we were supposed to take a shuttle to the wedding location just a few miles from the hotel, at first there was some confusion on the shuttle but instantly the front desk staff remedied the problem and got me (the crazy bride) and all of my bridal party to the wedding on time. Adam was our shuttle driver and although it was his job to drive us he acted as a counselor and was so pleasant to talk to he actually helped calm me and my anxious mother down during the drive to the wedding which was so helpful. (Lots of good wedding Karma going in Adams direction!!!!) We also had the opportunity to use one of the meeting rooms for a luncheon the day after our wedding for about 45 people who watched a slideshow, ate lunch and watched us open our wedding gifts. Adam (I am unsure of his last name) was so helpful in setting up the room exactly how we wanted it and making sure we had everything we needed to make our event run smoothly. The hotel and rooms were very clean, A MUST if you know my family. The pool was clean and nice, the beds were very comfortable. The breakfast area was always tidy and the food was fresh and delicious. The location is very convenient for people traveling from out of state and getting to and from the strip on the shuttle. I cannot thank you all enough for your kindness and outstanding customer service. You are all amazing and my family loved staying at your hotel!!!", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western NY", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location for catching an early flight & needing to return a rental car!\u201d", "Author": "Sedonamoon", "ReviewID": "UR109876427", "Content": "This is a new hotel & the entire place was super clean & pleasant!

The free hotel shuttle which runs 24 hours picked us up at Terminal 2 (the hotel phone number listed at the courtesy phone at that terminal was incorrect), and we used the shuttle for other trips to and from the MGM, and also to the McCarran Rent-A-Car Center. There was a cooler with bottled water for passengers in the van. There is comfortable seating in the attractive lobby while waiting for the shuttle. Do allow extra time when using the shuttle as the driver tends to combine stops at the Town Square, strip, and airport on his run. We were delighted with both rooms we had: they are spacious, spotlessly clean, comfortable, equipped with large flat panel TV, good office chair and desk, microwave, fridge, Keurig one-cup coffee machine with assortment of coffee and tea, blackout drapes, comfortable bed with quality linens and pillows, and iron and ironing board. The bathroom is also tastefully appointed and has granite topped vanity and tub surround. There was no aircraft noise in our first room (#261) but there was faint noise from about 6am onwards in our second room facing the airport (#240) but nothing to complain about. Being a new hotel everything is in great condition. There are elevators, and the whole facility is non-smoking. Guest parking is free; there is no resort fee (unlike many strip hotels) and there are no slots. A business centre with computers and printer off the lobby is handy for internet use and printing boarding passes, etc. The breakfast available from 6 to 10 is very good, and the breakfast room kept clean and tidy by the staff. No Styrofoam or plastic cutlery is used. Hot and cold cereals, fresh fruit, juice, yogurt, various baked goods and bread, hard boiled eggs, waffles, coffee and tea are available. There is no restaurant at the hotel, but a local pizza place will deliver. For us the location was ideal, as it is close to the on- ramp to the I-15, the airport, and the car rental place. The hotel check-in time of 1pm was also convenient. Without exception we found the staff to be friendly, professional, helpful, and genuinely welcoming. The cookies in the lobby each evening, and the bottled water and cookies supplied in the room were little touches that enhanced our stay. For the AAA rate of $71.10 per night (plus tax) this hotel was a real bargain.

Be aware that there are TWO Airport La Quintas in Las Vegas, and I must have been looking at the other one's reviews before, because I expected a lot worse. As many others have said, the facility is very new (it still has a \"NOW OPEN\" banner hanging outside), and it was spotless. It is right across the street from the runway of the airport, so you can see the big planes landing all the time, which my kids loved. The soundproofing is pretty good inside, too. You can hear the occasional jet engine humming, but it's really not bad at all. The only downside to the hotel is that they are so new that they still have a problem showing up properly on GPS and Google Maps. My Google map printoff took me to the north side of the airport, when the hotel is on the south side. When it was clear that we were lost, though, a quick call to the hotel put us in touch with a helpful front desk employee who very kindly gave us great directions. My Dad's GPS also sent him to the other airport La Quinta, so be sure you specify the South location. Breakfast had a lot of choices, and was good enough. We never went away hungry, and a free meal is hard to beat for a family of five. The WiFi is also free, which is not usually the case in most hotels I stay in. And, the price was terrific. We got my family of five (wife and I plus two kids and a baby) into one room for <$60 per night! That is a killer deal, and coupled with all the free perks, can't be beat.
