Preferring private rooms to a hostel, we looked for cheap options. This led us to Hotel New York. Honestly, we are picky people, but don't expect luxury when we pay very little. All in all, this hotel was perfect for what we wanted. It was right by the train station (literally 3 minutes away), it was quiet, and it was spacious enough. I wouldn't rave about how nice it is, but we really had no serious complaints. While in a rougher part of town, it felt very safe with 3 layers of locked doors. If you want somewhere romantic or beautiful, don't come here. If you want a cheap place that is nice enough to sleep in at night, this place is perfect. With somewhere as amazing as Rome, who needs to spend much time in the room outside of sleeping? The only complaint I have is that it is quite confusing in regards to knowing where you are booking. When we booked our hotel, it was under a different name and location. We met the owner (right in the center of town!) and he then told us to follow him to where we'd stay...10 minutes back towards the train station. We didn't book to stay at the Hotel New York, but once we were there, it was nice enough to satisfy our needs!", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lausanne, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cOK for moderate standards\u201d", "Author": "Duncheg", "ReviewID": "UR22672902", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel 1 night in July'06 and it was really OK for 1 night.

The room was pretty clean, nothing special, no new furniture, but OK Overall, I would say if your standards are moderate, this hotel will be pretty OK with you.

We contacted the hotel and asked to change the room without penalties as Venere could not do so already. The hotel said it all depended on Venere only. We contacted Venere again but they assured us that this depended on the property only. As the result, the hotel provided double room but took money from the credit card of our ill friend for the tripple room. The case is that we have stayed in that hotel last year and this year we booked it again and also 2 more people came from another countires to meet us in Rome and they booked the rooms there too - all because of us. I judge this hotel thinks only about their money and is not \"human\" to people, with their attitude they have just lost 5 people of their customers. The location is in the dirty trainstation area with \"druggies\" in front of the door, the property is located on the 4th floor with old and small elevator, the door is looked in the night and you have to stay outside with those \"druggies\" waiting for someone to open the door. The rooms are shubby, the breakfast is just tea and bread. We stayed there as it was the cheapest opportunity and because we liked the reception woman last time, but now we will never come back there.

I guess you get what you pay for. For one night in Rome it did the job. The single room was furnished with a simple, rather narrow but clean bed. The carpeting was threadbare and the wall mouldings scratched and chipped. There is no air conditioning but a fan was furnished in the room. Despite the hot temperatures, I took a shower (in the bathroom in the hall) and with the fan I was out like a light. At first I completely missed the shower in the bath room and thought the room came without a shower. The next morning, though I did notice the shower head on the wall above the toilet. It worked o.k. and the bathroom dried quickly due to the temps. The towels provided are thin but in fact, this is completely normal in Italy. I've seen these same towels in hotels which charge a lot more. I had no problems with the staff and they were quite friendly although I made no exceptional demand on them. I saw no bugs and didn't feel unsafe at all so I might consider it again when needing a cheap place to stay in Rome. The coffee at breakfast was quite good. Everything else you could skip if you were hungry. I wasn't hungary due to the temps so I ate the piece of rusk with butter and jam and drank the plastic cup of orange juice. There is nothing more. As I normally get much more for my money in rural Germany, I rated it as a 2. The hotel does not accept credit cards.

O.K. its not five star but then we didn't plan to spend our days lounging around in luxury. The hotel was clean, the staff helpful, the breakfast plenty to keep us going til lunch, our three bed room had every thing we needed, the bathroom was clean and the shower hot.

It's two minutes walk from the Station so no money wasted on taxis and whatever you read in other reviews the three of us felt perfectly safe walking back to the hotel each evening about 10.

We were SO glad that this hotel was just a way for us to stay close to the train station in order to catch our flight home the next day. As everyone else has mentioned, the reception is on the third floor and the elevator is like something you would see on the Titanic. It's ancient beyond belief. Once arriving, don't let the red carpet and furniture fool you into thinking that there is any remote class to the joint. The people at the reception desk were cold and uninviting. A smile from you would be responded with a glare from them. We were given keys to yet a different floor (5th floor) and upon entering, found two twin beds pushed together (which is somewhat common in Italy) with mattresses sagging in the middle of both. The TV was placed high above (which I have heard is common as well) but we could not find the remote control for the life of us! The \"night stands\" were not screwed onto the wall properly, so they hung at an angle. You couldn't put anything on it that didn't want to follow along with the laws of gravity. The bathroom attached had all the facilities, but to use the toilet, you're knees would be in the shower. There is really no shower \"stall\" just a curtain separating the \"showering area\" from the rest of the bathroom. When you shower, it is a miniature flood. Don't think about doing anything else in there after any shower. Afterwards, the whole room (bathroom and bedroom) smelled like mildew. The window we had faced the other side of the building, which was littered with trash and dirty clothes hanging from a line. Since it was facing a courtyard, if you can even call it that, we had no view of any street, or just ANYTHING! The next morning we went early for breakfast only to find one lonely lady being scolded for not clarifying that she wanted \"American coffee\". There was nothing there to eat but pre-packaged biscotti. The coffee looked like mud in a cup so we just left and ate at McDonalds at the train station. Would we ever go near there again..?? What do you think? I know that there are some people who have given this place 5 stars, and maybe they had a better room or different people at the front desk.

I went to Rome in May, the high tourist season and couldn't find anything available for under 300 euros a night. So this was affordable. It was convenient to the train station. I did not see any bums or drug addicts - they were all at the train station - in fact, the hotel was located on a quiet street. One shouldn't expect otherwise when selecting a hotel near a train station. The elevator is small by American standards, but quite large by European. One should not expect an Otis 8 passenger elevator in a 19th century building with many owners - who will give up space in their apartment to put in such a big thing? The staff was friendly and helpful. The room had old furniture, beaten up but serviceable - it was large and had a terrace. The sheets were clean, the bathroom was spotless. The shower was in the bath, but this is typical in older Italian hotels as are the thin but absorbent towels - my father so much loved the concept of the shower in the room while visiting Italy that he had one installed in our house. The walls were paper thin, and that was unfortunate but one should always travel with ear plugs. In conclusion, the hotel was exactly what one would expect for a 2 star italian hotel that has not undergone renovations to cater to American tourists (i.e. big elevators, lobby at the ground floor, poofy towels and a separate shower). If one wants things to be exactly as they are at home, then why not save money and stay ay home?
