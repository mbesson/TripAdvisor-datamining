We stumbled on this fantastic hotel this past March during bike week. We were booked to stay at another hotel but upon checking into out room it was the most disgusting place we have ever seen, when you walk into a room that has a 4 legged critter running behind the stove YOU GET OUT. this led us to find Sea shells beach club. Upon us telling them of our experience they very quickly, professionally and compassionately attended our request for a room last minute during bike week, they only had 2 rooms left and gave us a great room with a discount because of what we had just experienced. It made our vacation,(we were ready to go back home) they saved our vacation is what we should say. We have just retuned back from staying there this past weekend and when the manager saw my husband the first thing he said was\" I remember you your back, so nice to see you back here\" once again we were treated with the best service ever, from having new front dest staff to the housekeeping crew, always with a smile and how are you doing today. I could go on more and more so instead you have to stay at the hotel to see for yourself, the rooms have all been renovated and the pool, the ocean view is spectacular. All we can say is THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING US THE BEST SERVICE EVER. NEVER HESITATE TO STAY HERE.

There was beach access from the courtyard and we spent most of our time walking the coast. There is a bar a few hotels to the north that was a lot of fun. Or you could walk a mile south to the pier. The kitchette is perfect for an extended stay. There is a grocery store just a mile up the road. The taxi cabs are expensive, $40 each way just to go 8 miles. I would definately come back with the entire family to spend more time here but I would stay in the suite.

They also have an activities director onsite that plans activities for both kids and adults. We had intended to go on the wine tasting trip but my son got sick beforehand. Our first day here we spent the morning on the beach then went over to St Augustine and toured around and did a ghost tour. We had a blast. The second day we spent the morning on the beach and then came in for lunch. the resort grilled hot dogs and had a hot dog social with all the trimmings for the guests which was awesome. That evening we went to Ocean Walk and ate ot Bubba Gumps which was great.

Beach towels, chairs, boogie boards, etc are available for check out at the front desk. James, the night manager, was friendly and provided excellent service. I would say the other two women were worthless, but that understates the situation. The pregnant one lied to my face about housekeeping coming to our room and refused to acknowledge her error even when all possible options were presented.
