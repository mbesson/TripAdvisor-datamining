I spent a long time searching websites for hotels that were within my price range, and found it hard to find one that was a single room as opposed to sharing a dormatory with 8 people, and one that had its own toilet not a shared one. I was in room 210, a single room with en-suite shower and toilet. I booked directly through the hotels website and also got 10% by doing so. Before I went, I read the reviews on different sites for the hotel, and the main negative points were that the rooms where small and dark. This was true, the room was dark and quite small. However, when in Amsterdam, you dont spend all day in your hotel room and it was prefectly adequate in size to be able to keep your luggage in (some places charge extra to store your luggage as you cannot fit the bags in the room in Amsterdam). The other negatives I saw on here were that the flatscreen TV was tiny. This is also true, but who cares? They had about 36 channels, a mix of Dutch and English channels, what more do you want! Again, you dont go to Amsterdam to spend hours watching TV surely? My room was clean and tidy, lovely fresh and clean bedding. I had my bedding and towels changed even thought I was only there for 2 nights! The staff were friendly and spoke good English which made it easy to check in and out of the hotel. The hotel is in a fantastic location. Right next to VondelPark, and a 3-4 minute walk from the Leidseplein and PC Hoofstraat is known to be the most expensive shopping street in Amsterdam! On an evening around 22.00hrs I walked back from Kerkstraat (central) to the hotel approxiamtely 5 minutes walk, and I felt very safe which was brilliant as I was travelling alone (female). I am returning to Amsterdam shotly to visit family, and I will definitly be staying in the Hotel RoberRamon again.

The following are my notes: 1) Fairly easy hotel to find once you have your bearings in Amsterdam. I got lost trying to get here from Centraal train station. I just arrived from Paris and did not realize that Amsterdam is a fairly small city in comparison. 2) Good access to tram that connects to rest of Amsterdam. It is about a half block from the hotel door. Ask front desk for map and directions. Keep in mind that after midnight it becomes a bus service and not the tram. 3) Wifi worked really well in the room. No problem using the facebook chat option to communicate with family in Canada. 4) Room is probably small for North American standards at that price point, but was more than large enough for me (traveling solo). Room had two beds, a television, desk and was actually quite spacious. Bathroom was decent, although the mirror is mounted too high. I am about 5'5\" and could not see the mirror standing in my bare feet. The Dutch really are the tallest people on earth! 5) Close to higher end shopping area. Literally across the main street where the tram travels on. 6) Hotel allowed me to store my belongings after I had checked out. Lobby/reservation area was small but was adequate for its purpose. Staff spoke English. 7) There was no where within a block or two to have food at night. However, for a less than 5-7 minute walk, food could be found. Overall, a good hotel to stay that does not break the bank but is well above a hostel (nothing against hostels).", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cSimple, Clean, Modern & Friendly\u201d", "Author": "scotteach", "ReviewID": "UR124773870", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights and were given two rooms on the top floor, a twin and a single facing the front street.

First of all, the location is fantastic, close to the Rijksmuseum and the Leidensplein (for food & drink) and on the Amsterdam equivalent of Bond Street. We took the train from the airport to Amsterdam Zuid (2.50 Euros from the machine, 10 minutes) and then the 5 tram, direction Amsterdam Centraal, 7 stops (we had bought 48 hour tram passes from the tourist information in the airport). Checking in was fine, the receptionist had a good sense of humour and all the staff there seemed friendly and very helpful. The stairs are horrendously steep but there is a lift. Our room was a triple, basically it was a room with three beds in it (and a TV on the wall, we never did find the remote control). It had dark walls, a black carpet, black curtains and black bed covers. And one inset bulb in the ceiling and two bedside lamps. I had to get out my pocket torch to read the instructions for the safe, not that I ever got it to work. If any of us had dropped a black thing (like a sock) we would probably never have seen it again, it was rather depressing. The beds were comfortable, the room was warm, the hot water was scorching. Unfortunately the other hotel guests were not considerate, we were woken both nights by other guests either going to bed in the early hours or, on the second morning just before 6am, what sounded like some kind of tour group jog around the second and third floors of the hotel. Not the hotel\u00c2\u00b4s fault of course. We didn\u00c2\u00b4t have breakfast, on the internet it had been offered to us at 15 euros a head a night and so we thought we could do better. When we arrived at the hotel, we were offered it at 9.50 euros a head. We were able to buy a bagel and coffee around the corner for around 6 euros.

There is no bar; only a small lobby area with a drinks vending machine (soft drinks and lager). The dining room is small and in the basement (serves breakfast only).

The website clearly says it is a 4 star hotel. The lobby was very bland and plain. The elevator was not working. The room was the real kicker though. Their idea of a triple room is a single with 3 small beds. The third bed awkwardly placed without even a lamp on the bedside. The flat screen tv mentioned on the website is in fact a very small and cheap tv (Im including a picture). There were no cupboards or dressers to fit the clothes of 3 people. I complained to the receptionist and wanted to cancel my stay. Conveniently, the Robert Ramon charges for your full stay as soon as you check in. No wonder... they probably have to deal with a lot of clients who want their money back. I was told that I would not be able to get a refund for the first day as there is a 48 hour cancellation policy. I asked for a better rate for the second night and was told that when I booked I knew what the rooms looked like from the website. The rooms look nothing like in the website, never mind the false advertisement claiming it is a 4 star hotel.

We did not eat breakfast at the hotel - initially we thought 12.50 euros was a little pricey but after eating breakfast out each morning this is actually a good price.

I believe you can get a transfer from the hotel to the airport by taxi for 40 euros but the public transport was so easy to use. Allow up to an hour when using tram/train.

The bed 'sell by date' had passed '20' years ago. You could clearly hear what the guests were doing next door. Paper thin walls.... To cap this we were badly bitten by an infestation 'fleas' during the night. We ended up 'sleeping' in our clothes on top of the bed because the bed wasn't clean. The hotel needs to be closed and fully refurbished. The location totally misrepresents the appalling quality of this disgusting 'hotel'.

The only compensation for entering at this level is that there is one less floor to climb to your room since the lift is out of action. Stairs are narrow and winding, making it difficult, and potentially unsafe, for people with luggage. My single room was very small, about 6m x 2m. The furnishings were old and the shower room smelled badly. Workmen were noisily working in the room opposite me and the corridor was cluttered with building materials. While the renovated rooms looked fresher and more modern, they were still small. Once renovations are finished the hotel might deserve a higher rating but I would certainly not recommend this hotel while it is undergoing such extensive work - indeed, I feel that it should have been closed down during this work.

The hotel does look terrible from the outside at the moment as it is covered in scaffolding and nets, and you have to access it via scaffolding steps at the side, but inside the room was fine. Be warned though - I checked in at 11am (the stated check in time) and was given a key to a room that had not yet been cleaned, though this was quickly rectified by friendly, efficient staff. The room (once done) was clean and comfortable for the price, and was quiet at night. Unfortunately it is not the best choice if you plan on spending any time in the room during the day. I attempted an afternoon nap but was disturbed by the builders knocking windows out in the room above, and felt the need to have the curtains closed as the builders were walking past my window all the time.

The lift was out due to the reno's so I had to lug my luggage up crazy steep stairs but the room was clean and warm and enough room for me and my big suitcase! I had a single room on the second floor which is designated smoking, so the hallway stunk of smoke (of various origins) but the room was just fine (and I am sensitive to smoke smell!) There was a tv in the room with usual dutch channels and BBC and CNN which was nice. The bathroom was clean and typical european, a shower nozzle sticking out of the one side so the whole bathroom got wet whilst showering. This is not a 5 star hotel so do not expect 5 star north american standards! The breakfast was a fine spread of meat/cheese/bread/cereals/juices/fruits/coffee/tea etc and enough to keep you going until lunch. The chap at the front desk was pleasant and told me where to find a wireless cafe, the van gogh museum and everything else I inquired about. He let me leave my luggage behind the desk for a few hours after check out as well. All in all, this hotel was worth the money I paid (got a good deal on ratestogo.com) and much better than staying in a hostel with my computer and other expensive equipment.

The painted boarding around the exterior of the hotel can be a bit off-putting upon arrival.

It had a single bed, a chair, a desk and a tv (wall mounted). The walls seemed a little thin but luckily during my stay the noise was fairly minimal. There was a big window but no view as my room faced the backside of the hotel. That said, I must also say that the room was very clean. The bedding and towels appeared new. The attached bathroom was tastefully renovated though the shower was an open stall with no curtain so the bathroom became kind of soaked when used. The location of this little hotel is ideal for tourism. It is just a few steps from a tram that goes through the center of the city (to central station) and near some fabulous shopping, eating and sightseeing. Several designer stores are just out the door and both the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum are within 5 minutes walk... which will make it easy to be first in line if you fail to buy advance tickets.

I have learned from this experience that 4 or 5 Star is the only way to stay in Europe.
