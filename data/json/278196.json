The AC did not work and opening the window wasn't going to work due to all the cigarette smoke coming in from the outside.

The hotel has a small lift but the stairs are easy and wide. It was just what we wnated to experience the romance of Venice, in a quiet almost secluded location, but so close to the vibrancy of the main attractions.

We knew that our room wouldn't be ready for us due to the time of day. Because of our itinerary, we had to leave our bags at the hotel and leave for the day. We were promised that our bags would be brought to our room and should be waiting for us when we return later that day. This did not happen. In fact, that night we were taken to a different building, which the hotel claims to be their latest premises. Our bags were not there yet and we had to wait for about 10 minutes as the bell-man (he appeared to be the only one on duty that night) had to attend to other customers first. We were assured that the building we were assigned was the newer, better one. I really doubt that's the case. The room was very tiny. The information / floor plan hung on the wall showed that the room was supposed to be a single room. But there were two single beds in the room. The air conditioning wasn't working. The bell-man who took us to our room said that it was deliberately turned off due to time of the year. In Summer the cooling system is on and in Winter they turn the heating system on. In April unfortunately, there's no air-conditioning although the room was so hot & stuffed. We had to open the little window open for ventilation. The paper-thin walls meant that we could hear every single word the people next door were saying. And I reckon they must have heard us too so I'm sure the discontent was mutual. When we asked for wi-fi codes, they didn't have any in this \"newer\" building. They suggested we used one of the wi-fi providers around the hotel. We supplied our credit card details and no connection was ever available for us. Breakfast was average - your standard European breakfast. Toast, coffee, juice. The only good thing about this hotel is the female receptionist in the morning shift. She is helpful, very informative, and provided us with a Venetian map. She even helped us with waterbus routes. She is the only female staff we met during our stay. The rest of the staff is male. The male receptionist at the later shift is very snobbish and not helpful at all. When we checked out the next day, this male receptionist didn't provide me with a receipt. When I asked for one, it took almost 10 minutes to produce it. It actually took longer to print the receipt than to pay. If you're thinking of booking your stay at this hotel - don't! It's overpriced for an undersized room.

My girlfriend had always wanted to see Venice and as I had been once before I decided to treat her and plan a trip for her 28th birthday. I used lastminute.com to book us a long weekend (over Easter bank holidays) to Venice. I stressed over the accommodation for weeks and held off making a booking until the very last minute to try and ensure that we got the best deal and the right hotel. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t normally state prices etc. but for the purpose of this review i think it is necessary. In the end we paid \u00c2\u00a31800 for a 3 night stay in Venice (incl. flights). The hotel stay was by far the largest chunk of the bill! Now we had been to Mexico for a week for less than this so my expectations were high. I had booked the Ca' Dei Conti hotel and paid for a suite in the \"Conti-Querini\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section of the hotel. The pictures looked amazing, trip advisor reviews were gleaming and so we set off (slightly poorer than usual) to Venice with high expectations and a lot of excitement. When we jumped off the taxi boat in the centre of Venice and made the short walk to the hotel i was overjoyed with the reaction from my girlfriend to Venice and the surroundings - it was a good start and i started to feel that the cost was worth it for her birthday as it was clear she was blown away by the city. We arrived at the hotel - and again - pleasantly surprised! Unfortunately - this is where the good stuff ends!! At check-in I was told (by a very nervous young woman) that the hotel had a burst water pipe and there was no water or aircon to the room we had booked. At first - trying to be sympathetic and understanding I didn't react badly and simply asked what they could do for us. The lady on reception explained that we were being moved for one night to another hotel in the city - OK so far - not too bad..... The porter moved us over to the other hotel - which was fine and we went to check in there.... although the other hotel was perfectly satisfactory it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best start to the trip! To start matters off we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check in for 2 hours as no rooms were ready so we had to leave our bags there and wonder around Venice in the clothes we had travelled in without freshening up or changing etc. I grinned and bared this as it was my girlfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday and i didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spoil things. When we finally did manage to check in to the \"temp\" hotel we were given a standard room! - strike 2! - We have paid through the nose for a suite and the first night was in a standard room - I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m already out of pocket! I complained to our hotel (Ca' Dei Conti) and they assured me the next two nights would be with them and in an \"upgraded suite\"..... After the first night we moved back to the Ca' Dei Conti and initially all was good - we went over early in the morning and they said we could have the room immediately - FANTASTIC! Until i entered the room that was! - It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a suite - i didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resemble any room described on trip advisor and certainly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean - there was mould growing on the walls in the bathroom, the walls were scuffed and dirty, the aircon had living organisms growing inside it and the bed may has well have been on the floor as it was sooooo low! I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kick off a the hotel staff as at this point I still thought this was due to a burst water pipe in the other section of the hotel and apart from move us to another hotel again there wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be much they could do and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to ruin what was left of the trip jumping from one hotel to another - however - my frustrations and disappointment hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet reached its maximum. Whilst speaking to one member of the reception staff on the 2nd morning I noticed the other receptionist pass a key over to a new guest (a French couple) - they key was clearly labelled \"Conti-Querini\"! I then watched in diss-may as the porter took the French couples bags out of the front door of the hotel and down the canal towards the building housing the \"Conti-Querini\" suites!! At this point I was FUMING! .... The cost of the trip is what has upset me and the fact I was lied to for no good reason! I can only imagine the hotel was over booked and hence us being juggled about.... If we had booked a trip at a smaller cost and had not paid through the nose for a suite etc. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be writing this review. I very very rarely am so extravagant with holidays etc. but on this occasion as it was my girlfriends birthday and Venice was somewhere she had always wanted to go I felt very let down. All in all we had a good trip and I made sure we enjoyed Venice - all be it the hotel was a massive let down. In summary.... if you want a normal hotel and an empty bank account - book this hotel - HOWEVER - if you are expecting a GOOD hotel or a 4 Star hotel for that matter - DON'T BOOK THIS ONE!!!!! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a total rip off!

We arrived at the Venice train station, and took the vaporetto waterbus to the San Zaccaria drop-off near Piazza San Marco. This method of getting to the hotel was a little awkward since we had luggage, but it was a nice way to get a look around since it was our first visit to Venice. And the 6.50 euro each for the trip was probably as reasonable as any other method of getting to the hotel. It is possible to walk to the hotel from the San Zaccaria dock without having to climb any of the large stairs over the canal along the waterfront (which we learned the hard way). There is a dedicated, unavoidable staircase over the canal to get to the front door of the hotel. Once you start walking around Venice, it was clear that walking between the hotel and the waterfront near Piazza San Marco, where you can catch the vaporetto, was pretty convenient. Our room was #103. It is directly off the lobby, in a corner next to the front entrance. We were a little shocked, initially, because it felt as if we were being placed into a closet off the lobby. The staff asked us to give it a try, and let them know if we would like a change. We were scheduled to stay two nights. Good stuff about the hotel/room: - The room itself was nice and clean. - The bathroom was large and modern. - The breakfast, provided on the second floor, was good. - Although the staff acted a little stuffy, they spoke OK English, and satisfied all of our requests. Not-so-good stuff about hotel/room: - The hotel charged a pretty steep price for wireless internet access. For the price we paid for the room, we thought it was poor to charge for what has become a basic service at most hotels. - The window in the room looked out onto the narrow canal and walkway in front of the hotel. We could hear tourists and merchants walking and talking on the walkway. Once in a while, a water taxi boat parked outside would start up and drive off. We could hear this also. - The room was right off the lobby. Guests often sat in the lobby and talked. We could hear this in our room clearly. It did not continue into the night, but was mildly annoying. - On the second morning, a vacuum-boat parked directly outside our room's window in the canal. It had a loud motor that was sucking fluid from a business down the way that appeared to have flooded. There was a very strong smell of sewage during this event. Not really the hotel's fault, but a reality of the location. We slept well in the room. Another room on one of the other floors might have been quieter. However, on the second floor, the rooms opened directly into the seating area where breakfast was served. So one issue might just be traded for another issue. Space is a real premium in Venice, so this might have been a reality at any hotel.

We felt like being in our little palace, surrounded by nice furniture, a king size bed and all the amenities one would expect - the room had even a chandellier!

I had originally booked directly with the hotel but found it 100Euro cheaper on the internet. I contacted the manager and he willingly agreed to reduce the tariff for our stay. We arrived at the hotel quite late in the evening after getting very lost. It is not easy to find and the Venetians are not the most helpful people in the world. Check in took some time as others had arrived at the same time and we spent around a half hour waiting in the small foyer. We were allocated the Green Room and it was beautiful with a lovely living area and nice bathroom. We only had breakfast one morning in the hotel as I was stuck down with salmonella food poisoning on the third day and spent the last couple of days the trip very unwell. Still unsure where exactly I picked this up, as any food we ate in the city was tastless and extremely overpriced. We paid over 70 euro for a bottle of white wine and a shared dish of pasta! Still to this day we cannot believe how expensive one meal was and this was not anywhere near St Marks Sq or the waterfront- absolutely scandalous! In summation the hotel was fine. The staff did their jobs but were not friendly and never went out of their way to offer advice or even have a conversation with us. No one was in the slightest interested or cared that we were celebrating such a special ocassion and we found the Ventians quite arrogant. We did not particulary enjoy Venice and would never return. Yes the food poisoning was a nightmare but besides this we found Venice to be lacking in atmosphere and warmth. It was very difficult to find anywhere nice to dine or have a drink ( I had bought lots of lovely honeymoon outfits and never got to wear them).

I was given incorrect information by two rude staff members. When I pointed out later that the information was wrong, both guys just pretended like they had never given me the wrong information in the first place. It was bizarre! In fact, RIGHT after I came in and said that the directions on their website left out a step for how to find the place, two Americans complained that the place was hard to find. The night staff guy actually said, \"no one has complained before.\" I couldn't believe my ears. Moreover, several trip advisor reviews discuss the difficulty of finding the hotel. \"Climate control\" didn't work. Our room was swelteringly overheated. We had to alternate between opening the windows (the heat would cut off then) and getting too cold, then closing the window and getting too hot.

They say the city is sinking and the water is rising and that it will one day disappear becoming a piece of history. Because of this, just about EVERYONE in the world DOES visit which is easily noticed by the crowds of tourists (even in the off-season) meandering their way through the narrow and pedestrian-congested maze-like streets. In turn, the local businesses cash in on this by inflating prices on EVERYTHING moreso than any other part of Italy. Since tourists are the majority in this magnificent city, the locals tend to be much less friendly and only acknowledge your existence if you are spending your Euros in their establishment. Because of the crowds and prices, Venice was by far our least favorite city in Italy. In our opinion, Ca dei Conti was the \"saving-grace\" of Venice. We will most likely never return to Venice, but if we do, we will without any hesitation choose to stay again at Ca dei Conti! LOCATION - If arriving by water-taxi, the closest connection point is San Zaccaria pier. The hotel is tucked away in its own little corner of Venice and one of the street names is incorrect in their directions, so even following their directions on their website, we had to stop and ask a couple of locals for directions or we would have never found it. Even with the directions from the hotel's website, it took us about 25 minutes to finally find the hotel. After learning the streets, we returned numerous times to the pier in 5 minutes walking. St. Marks Square is considered the to be the center of Venice and the premier location for accomodations. Since St. Marks is the center, the area is jam-packed with tourists at all hours. Ca dei Conti is in San Zaccaria, far enough from the crowds that the streats seem amazingly empty, yet close enough to all the major attractions by walking. St. Marks Square and the San Zaccaria Pier are 5 minutes walking and the Rialto and Grand Canal are about 10 minutes by walking. Do not go back to San Zaccaria pier to follow the water to St. Marks! There are \"backstreets\" to take which will lead you to St. Marks in less than 5 minutes. Also, if you are taking a water-taxi in the direction of Piazale Roma (Santa Lucia RR Station) you may want to walk to the water-taxi pier at Ponte Rialto and catch it there rather than at San Zaccaria. It can cut about 20 minutes off the slow water-taxi ride. Inquire with the reception the first time you venture out to find the quickest routes to attractions and where to catch the water-taxi. ROOM FEATURES AND AMENITITES - Upon entering room 303 (Double Superior) we were amazed at the spaciousness and elegance of the decor. The room was absolutely beautiful - decorated in royal blue and gold giving a feeling of elegance without being \"over-the-top\" which can happen in many Italian hotels trying to acheive an atmosphere of \"refined elegance.\" In the entry, there were large closets which provided ample space to store all our luggage; also where the minisafe was located. The mattress and linens were comfortable and of quality. There was ample space for sitting and lounging either on the sofa-sleeper or in one of the chairs around a small end table in the corner of the room. Two windows opened up to a charming view onto the Ca dei Conti's private bridge crossing the small canal below and directly across at a typical Venetian building. The bathroom featured marble countertops, heated floor and towel racks, bath amenities, ample quality towels and a relaxing hydromassage tub and shower combo. No details were missed - soft carpet covered the floor AND walls were covered in fabric wallpaper. There was even a remote control next to the bed that controlled the lights and television (it may have controlled the heat/ac also, but I never had to use it for that so I don't recall.) BREAKFAST - Featured breads and pastries, fruits, ham, salami, cheese, dry cereals, milk juices and coffee. Eggs and bacon were available for a fee which seems to annoy many American visitors, however, it's typical of most hotels in Italy. PRICE - Higher than most from the US are used to paying for a hotel, but, when compared to other similar Venice hotels the price is quite reasonable and in my opinion, well worth it! CONCLUSION - Ca dei Conti is perfect in all aspects considering price, amenities and location. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique boutique hotel with rooms loaded with local charm.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marquette, MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat Spacious Room!\u201d", "Author": "kaychris", "ReviewID": "UR53820588", "Content": "This was the last spot we stayed for our honeymoon and it was terrific!

I tend to believe they may have overbooked this hotel, or this was a method to keep the sister hotel more fully booked-- be warned. I expect if this is a tactic, the reviews will ferret it out. Now, back to the review. This hotel is superb. Absolutely beautiful. Nice location, a very short walk to St. Marco, but just enough out of the way to be very quiet, cozy, and romantic. Our room was HUGE even by American standards, and finely appointed. The only thing small was the bath and expecially the shower. I \"dropped the soap\" and was not able to bend down to reach it-- instead I had to exit the shower to retrieve it! The room had all the bells and whistles, everything you need, and just absolutely comfortable and lovely. Very helpful staff, and a reasonable breakfast.

Unfortunately, having booked a six night stay at a cost of \u00c2\u00a31,600, we didn't actually get to stay there! Despite having paid 300 Euros for an upgrade to a superior room (\"overlooking the canal\"), we arrived to discover that we had been assigned to the Conti Querini, an overflow building a couple of minutes from the main hotel. While the room was a decent size, it certainly didn't match the description on the website. Rather than a canal view, we overlooked a small courtyard and the wall of a nearby church. The en suite bathroom was pretty two star, with a very dodgy floor and a pair of saloon style doors which just didn't close. When we arrived, despite having booked a twin room, we were shown to a double, although this was remedied while we went out to dinner. A minor issue, but it does show a lack of attention to detail which wouldn't be expected from a hotel which describes itself as a four star establishment. The disadvantage of being in the annex hotel is that it lacks any reception. Instead, every hall and corridor is monitored by a rather creepy CCTV system (rather like being back in surveillance obsessed Britain, in fact!) There is no bar. The guest lounge was a two armchair affair which failed to impress. On two days of our stay, the public rooms did smell strongly of overflowing lavatories. It could have been the nearby canal, but... The breakfast room was very basic and right outside rooms 605, 606 and 607, so if you are given these rooms expect to hear the staff setting up from around 7 am each morning. There are only six tables provided and these are packed together, so if intimate breakfasts are your thing, look elsewhere. On one particularly bad day, we actually had to set our own table and there were other guests hanging about waiting for a free table. Definitely one star, not four. Other reviewers have commented on the requirement to pay for eggs and ham... again, not an impressive touch. On the plus side, the cleaning and laundry service were very good and the rooms were quiet at night. It is also well placed and genuinely close to S. Marco's Square. Our recommendation is that if you decide to book this hotel, you absolutely ensure you are booking a room in the actual Ca' dei Conti.

The member of staff who showed us there said that people always think they are booking something different as the picture on the website is that of the suite. I told him that there were two pictures on the website and on the strength of that I had booked, not the suite but the comfort room. It turns out there are several rooms, including I believe 2 suites in the Palazzo Conti Querini. Some of these adjoin the breakfast room, which I wouldn't have liked. We had room 612 on the 2nd floor - it was very nice - a small double but adequate. The en-suite bathroom was very stylish and clean. There was a corner bath but no shower apart from a hand held one but this wasn't a big problem. Air conditioning was nice, even though you had to get reception to alter the temperature. The room was pretty quiet, apart from it seemed we could very clearly hear the people beneath us.

The hotel itself is just a couple of minutes walk from St. Mark's Square in Venice. To get there, you can take public transport from the Airport and get off at San Zaccaria, just a couple of minutes walk from the boat station. Getting to the hotel might be a little tricky, as it is a couple of blocks off of a major thoroughfare, we found it by accident. But once you orient yourself, it's no problem. We stayed on the fifth floor in an attic room with two twin beds. The room was spacious by European standards, with the layout planned in a way to take advantage of the architecture. In addition to two beds that were on opposite ends of the room, there was a little sitting area and a good amount of open space. One nice feature is that they had two flat screen tvs next to each bed, so two people could watch different programs (if you can deal with the noise). The bathroom was mid-sized; it wasn't spacious and it wasn't cramped either. There was even a window in our ceiling, almost akin to a skylight, with motorized panes and blinds that could be controlled with a console on the wall. The hotel has five floors, with the fifth level being the attic rooms. There is an elevator in the hotel, but it doesn't go all the way up to five. I also noticed that the hotel had a reading area and balcony that were for use by guests, but I didn't use either, so I can't comment on them. When we arrived, the staff at the front desk were helpful and friendly enough. No complaints there. The hotel is located on the other side of a small canal. To access it, you will have to go over a small bridge, so if you need handicapped access, this will not be the hotel for you. Breakfast was available at 7:30 a.m. in the morning with freshly made croissants and rolls, cold cuts (hams, cheese), fruit, juice, milk, and cereal. Bacon and eggs are also available, but you have to pay extra to consume them. There are some nice places to eat if you walk a couple of minutes from the hotel. The hotel does not have a restaurant on site. Since we arrived shortly before the Venice film festival, room rates were quite high but the Ca' de Conti was one of the more reasonable choices available to us. My only complaints with the hotel was that though there was air conditioning in the room wasn't as powerful as we would have liked. It took a long time for it to get noticeably cooler in the room and it never got as cool as we would have liked. Despite that however, the Ca' dei Conti was enjoyable to stay at and I would definitely recommend it to friends and other travelers on tripadvisor.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "honduras", "Title": "\u201cDon't even think about it!\u201d", "Author": "gring0mama", "ReviewID": "UR36841437", "Content": "We arrived in Venice, and took a $80 boat trip from the train station to the San Marco dock.

I'm not convinced that it is worth paying for location, unless you have a view of one of the main sights. The hotel itself is pretty, and the better rooms are well decorated. Beware, however, that a number of rooms lead directly onto reception or the breakfast rooms, which can be noisy. I was awoken at 7am on the first morning, and asked to change rooms.

A couple of other reviews mentioned that the staff were unhelpful or unresponsive in dealing with problems, and I totally agree with this. I sensed that they saw an opportunity to make money from the room switch. We were shown an absolutely awful box room which apparently was the only other Classic room available; the only viable option that they offered was to upgrade. My advice would be to pay less for location - Venice is small and fun to explore, especially away from the crowds of San Marco and Rialto; and use the money on a better hotel.

It had been a terrible, overnight Delta flight from JFK to Marco Polo Airport. The water boat ride into Venice, past Murano, through the Grand Canal, helped to wash away the 9 hours of cramped, stuffy, uncomfortable SkyMiles. Our walk, with luggage to the hotel was a bit clumsy. (When advised to travel light in Venice, listen!) But once we settled in to our beautiful room, all was well in the world. The staff at Ca' dei Conti, specifically, Pietro, Marco and Vladimir were so helpful and friendly, making our short, three-night stay that much more enjoyable. They directed us to very good restaurants and were always ready with a map to draw the way. The lobby of the hotel has two stone columns and an old well which date back to the 13th century. The well is enclosed behind a glass wall, but the columns are out in the open - though one of them is a little bent into the wall. But - it's over 800 years old - I'd be a little bent, too. Initially, we looked at a standard room, which was very nice, but opted to treat ourselves and upgraded to a superior room. It was well worth it. Outside our room was a large, comfortable and elegent sitting area. There were a few other rooms off of this community space. Just inside our room's door was a small walkway and closet. Another, seperate door, led into the main room which had a king-size bed, couch and coffee table, beautiful antique writing desk, a flat-screen television as well as two plush chairs and a table next to one of the two windows in the room that both looked out onto a canal. The bathroom was large with a hige sink, deep tub/shower, toilet and bidet. The walls and bed were dressed in green and gold. Normally I find that kind of appointment a bit much, but in this case, it was perfect. Down one floor was the breakfast room. The food was pretty standard - eggs, breads and cheeses, meats, some pastry, VERY good coffee, etc. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for it's attention to detail, beauty and, most important, high-level of customer service.

The Vaporato is great for getting around once you are in Venice, but spend the money and do the private taxi for the aiport. IMPORTANT HINT: Buy your Dige Palace tickets at the hotel.

Hotels are all pretty easy to find after a day there...Love finding our way around. Nothing to be worried about. Our room was amazingly beautiful, great view of the canals down below...you hear the men working with their gondolas singing in the mornings, a cute fat cat enjoying the sun with flowers everywhere, opposite our buidling...overall a very quiet place compared to the hotels out front of San Marco square and less crowded too, thank god. Yes, the bathroom was beautiful.........and super clean! Price is definitely the most expensive of this vacation....but worth every penny. Breakfast is yummy, very important for my husband. =) Highly recommended. Oh yes, we love having our own boat, compliments of our hotels ( Westin and Cadei Conti) to take us to the Murano islands, of course.. to buy Murano chandelier and vases! Our friends had a super noisy and overly crowded area in San Marco, more like a 1star hotel instead of 3. They wished they had booked a better hotel.

If you're a tea drinker you will need to ask one of the waitresses for this as they traditionally serve coffee. The staff were also exceptionally helpful in assisting me by arranging for a guide to take us to a complementary Private Water Taxi pick-up point and organising a trip over to the Munaro Glass making factory. The trip was excellent but the 'sales-man' who showed us around got a bit full on with the sales bit - until my wife kindly pointed out we were just looking today - at which point he asked to show us the exit...My suggestion with this experience is to go in the knowledge they will try to sell you the glass - enjoy the free demonstrations and then expect the sales push resulting in a swift end to the tour if you decline the offer to purchase... In addition to the complimentary tour of Munaro - the staff helped me arrange some surprise flowers in the room for my wife on her birthday - this was a lovely touch and I am glad they did the ordering, otherwise who knows what we would have ended up having delivered...

This hotel is not difficult to find - but you cannot simply walk into the streets of venice and know where you are going instantly - it's a totally different experience! I noticed a couple of mentions of a room that opens into the breakfast room - this exists and personally i wouldn't want it. Hold on before you make your judgement. There is also a room that opens literally into reception near to the entrance - these rooms are not any less luxurious, but perhaps privacy would be an issue. Initially we were offered this particular room - I said no - the hotel said no problem and moved us with no hassle at all to an equally stunning, and much more private room, on the 4th floor. Just remember you are the customer and don't be afraid to politely ask to be moved - the helpful gentleman on reception wasn't bothered at all...though I'm sure the porter might have objected moving our bags again :-D Breakfast is a buffet style - a selection of cheeses and hams, cereals, warmed croissants and breads were readily available. Fresh coffee, juices and tea is the perfectly adequate choice for drinks! If I recall correctly, they serve relentlessly from 7am until 10:30am, leaving plenty of time following perhaps a little too much vino the night before. Overall this is a fantastic place to stay - lots of character - superb location - its absolutely perfect. You are close to the shops, a choice of bars & restaurants as well as feet away from St Marks - you will be laughing once you are out and about. Rialto bridge is about a 10 minute picturesque walk. Our rooms were cleaned at least twice each day and the hotel is spotless - stay here, enjoy it, and enjoy Venice!", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birches Head", "Title": "\u201cRomantic Getaway\u201d", "Author": "auroa", "ReviewID": "UR6119658", "Content": "We travelled to this hotel in March 06 for my birthday and i couldnt reccommmend a better hotel than the Ca Dei Conti.

Every night when we got back to the hotel after a lovely night out the bed would be folded and the bedlight would be on. The breakfast is lovely with crossiants, salami,cheeses, yogurts and cereals... A diet is needed after a trip here. The location is fantastic just 2mins walk from St Marks square and 10min walk to the Grand Canal.

Our room was first class. The hotel was excellent value, the breakfast buffet was unlimited and varied and the service could not be bettered. The situation for a tourist could not be more convenient as it is so central and most sites can be walked to within minutes. When transport is required the Grand Canal is 5 minutes away. As the hotel has no restaurant it is necessary to eat out (no bad thing when visiting a new city) and the recommendations of the concierge can be trusted. We followed their advice and were very happy indeed. It helps to allow them to book the restaurants, as they managed to get us in at our preferred time, when we could not.

Quite a confusing location (although Venice is generally very easy to get lost in - a map is essential!!) but we found it okay if you follow the directions on their website. Lovely little private bridge over a canal to get to the entrance. All done out in a very ornate, Venetian style. Our room was small but it felt quite special, with lots of gold, rich fabrics and chandelier style light fittings. There was no bath in the bathroom, but a very good shower. No view over the canal either, so it is worth requesting this if it is important to you. But nice and quiet and the turn-down service at night was a nice touch. We also enjoyed using the lovely terrace which was a shady godsend from the heat and the bustle of the city.

My room, although adequate, was small, and there was no place but the floor to put our suitcases. My firends were put in an attic room, which could be reached only by a steep staircase, and the lack of a formal room number indicated it was probably an illegal room. It was iincredibly small with slanted roof and no place for suitcases except on the floor. The bathroom fixtures were so close that one had to sidle their way to the toilet, just barely enough room for your knees to clear the bidet opposite. Air conditioning did not work, the room was terribly hot, and opening the window invited hordes of mosqitoes in. At midnight my firend went to complain to the concierge, who was very cavalier, one might say rude, about the situation -- sayng there was no other room (even though we had booked months in advance), and eventually stating that a better room would cost them an additional 40 euros per night. A word of warning: in reading other reviews of this hotel, I see that ours was not a unique situation. Unfortunately, we learned this too late. We paid for a four star hotel! What a joke. I do have photos that show how bad this room really was and, I understand, other rooms in the hotel have problems with noise.", "Date": "July 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "FARNHAM, SURREY", "Title": "\u201cPerfect, perfect, perfect!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5338031", "Content": "I can only reiterate most of the reviews on this site so far.

It is only 5 minutes from San Marco or the Rialto Bridge. We found it difficult to find as we arrived at Midnight and could only see the map in the light from the shop windows! But the next day in daylight it was easy. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was lovely served in the beatiful dining room. There was lots of choice from juices, hot drinks, cereals, breads, meats, cheeses, yogurts, fruit and croissants. We stayed in room 105 which is on the ground floor. To get to it you had to leave the hotel at the rear, cross an alley and enter another building by our own key. We had our own entrance area shared with one other room. Room 105 was lovely. Decorated in Gold and Creams. The curtains, bedding and padded wall coverings were beautiful, there was lots of cupboards and wardrobes and everywhere was very clean. We had a television but the only channel that was in english was CNN. This did not matter as we did not have time to watch TV anyway! There was an extra small room just off the main bedroom which had a chair, wardrobes, another TV and minibar in it. We stored our cases in here.The bathroom had a whirpool bath and a shower attachment. The only complaint we had was that the shower tended to leak onto the bathroom floor and that the room was too cold. There was no heating and with the ceramic tiles on the floor, you had to keep your shoes on when walking around. When we asked about the heating/air conditioning, we were told they were not allowed to put it on until May! Unfortunately when we were in Venice at this time, the weather was cold wet and windy! Upstairs in the main part of the hotel you could sit and relax in a lovely lounge complete with a painted ceiling and just off this lounge was a lovely roof terrace where you could sit in the sun. (Unfortunately there was not much sun for us!) This hotel was a brilliant place to stay for our 1st visit to Venice and I would definitely stay here again. Perhaps when the weather was warmer!", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ca' dei Conti", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d278196-Reviews-Ca_dei_Conti-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$166 - $556*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "278196", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9c/a2/9ca27b758346f6726ee6bffacabc8ca84large.jpg"}}
