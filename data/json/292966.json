We decided to try a regular hotel this time and thankfully we found the best one \u2013 Luna Blue. We found it via Trip Advisor and booked through Expedia. With hotel, air, food, drink (we did not skimp on what we wanted), we ended up $200 - $400 than the other all \u2013inclusives we had previously been to. We had a garden view deluxe room as we had 3 adults. It has a trundle bed so we all had a bed to ourselves. Room included a kitchenette with a decent size fridge, sink, stove and 4 seat table. We hit the Mega grocery store the first day and got a few things, mostly for breakfast and snacks. Bottled water is provided in the room and it was great to fill our bottles and have them cold in the fridge. Bathroom had a large storage area which was appreciated. No closet, but an armoire and side tables held the rest of our items. Another set of shelves in the main area would have been nice. Room was cleaned daily, front desk was managed by Alex who is very helpful, bar pours a great drink and there is live music some nights which stops at 11. The cats, Freddy and Oso are very friendly and visit you. Breakfast was coffee, tea and a few types of breads which we supplemented with yogurt and fruit. Then, the tough decision for the day \u2013 what beach club to go to! Luna Blue has arrangements with 4 of them and we went to all. Just ask Alex for a pass when you pick up your towels every day. Mamitas = closest, no food minimums, food was just OK, nice bathrooms. Grand Coral = taxi needed, very quiet, 2 pools, great food. Wicky\u2019s = our favorite, bit of a walk, food minimum, nice chairs, watch where the speakers are or you can\u2019t chat, large portions of food; Canibal Royal = bit of a walk, nice palm trees, food OK, music too loud at 10am, fun bathrooms! At night, you are \u00bd a block from the main restaurant and shopping street. How wonderful to have a wide choice of restaurants and bars. Playa del Carmen has really upgraded itself since we visited 2 years ago. We were highly impressed. The service, the lighting, the decorations all fit and make sense. It also has amazing Italian food \u2013 go figure! We always felt safe no matter what time of the day or night we were out. Well done, Playa! We will definitely be back to Playa and will stay for sure at the Luna Blue. I can see where all inclusives in remote areas like Tulum are still necessary, but if you are staying in Playa, book at Luna Blue, save yourself some money and enjoy!", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cNice Place but the beds are hard as Rock\u201d", "Author": "Devon S", "ReviewID": "UR126183265", "Content": "I just got back from the Luna Blue, this place was beautiful, the Garden's were so relaxing & the staff were amazing.

I travelled with my boyfriend and another couple. This was my first time away from the all inclusive deal, and I loved it! We were only able to stay 3 nights there, it being an add on to an already booked trip to the Grand Mayan. I won't repeat what you've already heard here, just reconfirm that if you are looking for a clean, no frills, reasonably priced place to stay this is definately it! Pictures do not do the courtyard justice, it is truely beautiful. The rooms are old, but kept spotlessly clean, and how much time do you really want to spend hanging in your room anyway when you are in one of the most beautiful places in the world? The location was unbeatable (well, other than beach front, but then you are paying big bucks)with 5th ave right around the corner..There was coffee and fresh baked breads every morning available, but you had to get down there early for the cornbread..it went fast! soooo good! I did not have the privilage of meeting Cheri as she was not feeling well when we were there, but Toni was on hand with lots of good advice on where to eat and the best beach clubs( he sent us away from Mamita's to another one a 10 minute cab ride away (coral beach I believe,) that was great, with practically no one there we had the beach and the bar service to ourselves! When it was time to go I did not want to leave, and once we made the journey to the Grand Mayan( that review to follow) I found myself wishing I was back at the Luna Blue. I will return, hopefully over and over.

(Actually, we spent 2 nights at an expensive hotel as Luna Blue had no openings for the week-end and it was wonderful too as it is on the beach but for funky and fun, this is a great place.) The rooms are basic but very nice--tho the beds are hard! The great tropical courtyard and the friendly bar are the highlights. (However, a few more chairs and hammocks would be nice.) The courtyard and balconies have several levels, all looking down into the bar and pool. People start gathering at the bar around 5 and some come from other hotels. Most have been coming back for years. We were there 5 nights and there was great live Blues 4 of those nights so you better like the Blues! (Stops by ll pm, tho. so you can sleep.) There was a special birthday party all Sunday aft with several groups playing so it was 5 hours of the Blues plus food. We were fortunate to have Rm 35 some of those nights and it has a great balcony overlooking everything. However, you aren't far away with any of the rooms. Just off 5th Avenue with all the shops and restaurants but toward the nicer part of the avenue. Terrific selection of beaches with free chairs and we didn't get to all of them. (If you have a car, drive down to Tulum and visit the beaches--gorgeous and few people. Try Ziggy's Beach club but it's a ways.) Our only minor complaint was that we hoped to be able to sort out some of the parks and attractions with the staff and there wasn't that opportunity. However, want to mention that Alex, who handles the front desk is just wonderful! He is very helpful--and all the staff is so cheerful! This is a great value for the money mainly for the fun atmosphere.

Location is just a \u00bd block off the 5th Ave. business area and the beach is about 4 blocks away, lots of great restaurants & shopping in walking distance. We stayed in a \u201cTropical Hideaway\u201d room which is at the courtyard level as the larger rooms were booked. Our room was clean, functional and made use of the space very well. The bathroom clean, the shower was great and always plenty of hot water. The hotel provides organic soaps, shampoo, cream rinse and body lotion that were very nice. There is no hair dryer (although I was told the front desk has them if needed). There was no closet, instead a functional piece of furniture that provided hanging space with plenty of hangers (one of my pet peeves) and 2 clothing drawers. The room was cleaned daily and when we returned to our room each afternoon there was some sort of lovely towel art on our bed (it is those special things that make a difference!) We had plenty of windows in our room, but since it was on the ground level we found that we kept the curtains closed all the time. Our only suggestion for those rooms would be to add some sort of sheer or blind that allows for privacy and provides natural light. Air conditioning & wireless worked great! A mini-fridge and bottled water was a nice plus. We enjoyed the bar area and nice live music 3 nights a week. It provided a nice opportunity to get to know the other hotel guests and discuss daily adventures and different restaurants to try. Jorge makes a great Margarita! The only downside to the bar was that it is closed 2 nights a week! The hotel provides passes to 3 beach clubs, the closest one being Mamita\u2019s. We used Mamita\u2019s twice, but found the loud techno music a little much for our 50+ ears. We loved the Grand Coral beach club which is just a short cab ride away. Very few people, lovely beach & pool area, and nice peaceful setting (Hint: get a chair farthest away from the club if you don\u2019t want to listen to the music).

They have connections with other beach clubs as well, but the other ones are farther away. I love the hotel garden as it is very relaxing to sit there. The garden is lush and well-maintained. And three nights a week, there is live music at the bar area from 8 to 11pm. There is also a pool which we never had the chance to use. Free cake, tea/coffee is served in the morning as a light breakfast. We stayed in the cheapest room, which I think it's the small rooms on the ground level. Our room faces the garden and there are lawn chairs just outside our room. The room itself is clean and functional. The only minor issue is that it can get stuffy as there isn't a window - the glass door with screen functions as the window. So we can only turn on the air conditioning to keep the room cooler. I think it is probably better with the slightly more expensive rooms as they have more windows. Next time, we'll give those rooms a try. The staff and the owner are friendly, knowledgeable and provide good restaurant suggestions. We stayed away from the restaurants on 5th Ave after the first night. If you want to try out more authentic Mexican food, walk north, away from the touristy strip. You'll find cheaper and better food.

I was impressed by the numerous return guests, the value , and was also pleased that the property owners were hands on individuals and former US residents in case we had any language difficulties. The residents of this community could have not been any friendlier and we could not have felt any safer if we had been in our own home town. We were greeted with smiles and \"hola\" at every turn. We stayed in room six during our stay and enjoyed the spaciousness of both a full size and a twin bed, a large kitchen with a dining area and the most amazing private balcony looking into trees and lush vegetation. Each morning I enjoyed hearing the garden come alive with the numerous birds that live in the tree tops and watching the resident cats at their food bowls. Such a peaceful way to start the day. I don't want to over glamorize this hotel just because I fell in love with it. The room furnishings and fixtures are not perfect and show a little wear. That being the only negative in my opinion. The positives are a tremendous location one block from La Quinta (5th Avuene) with too many restaurants to count, a warm and helpful staff who were quite fluent in English, and a lush tropical garden setting.

I guess I became a bit obsessed really. I started reading online travel websites and forums constantly. That eventually led to rampant use of acronyms and even the occasional emoticon :-). My wife and I have returned at least twice a year ever since. By coincidence, this was about the same time that Luna Blue\u2019s owners, Tony and Cheri, started their expat hotel ownership adventure. Following them online made me a fan even if I wasn\u2019t a customer yet. As a father with young kids, Luna Blue wasn\u2019t an option and the all-inclusive setup suited our style the best at that time. That never prevented us from exploring downtown and I had been by Luna Blue a couple of times in the past. When I finally had a chance to go to Playa by myself last October (2011), Luna Blue was the obvious choice. My original plan was to try two or three of the smaller, forum-famous, boutique hotels throughout the week. Like all of my travel plans, that changed. I ended up having a buddy of mine tag along at the last minute, and we decided to split the time between Luna Blue and one of the adults-only AIs. The hotel looks interesting and friendly when you walk by on the street. The big wooden gate and thatch roof swing bar were a welcome sight when we arrived. Cheri actually handled checking us in while Tony gave us some good tips and restaurant suggestions. It was nice to meet them in person after reading their posts and blog for the last few years. That personal touch is surely part of what has made them successful, and it went a long way with me too. I booked the Treetop Terrace room with the large balcony. The pics online are good but don\u2019t do it justice. That room alone is enough to make sure I come back again. I love that terrace! The buildings wrap around the garden and the view of the new pool below made me smile the entire time. I accidently slept most of my first night in the hammock out there. It was such a nice evening--- the cerveza was going down easy--- and next thing I knew, I woke up at 4:30am still swinging in the breeze. The room was spotless, bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was nice. I always wondered what showering was like with one of those black cistern things on the roof :-) I felt so authentic. This place has style and owners that care. I wish I was a wordsmith and could make it sound better than that. My buddy had the room below and said it was fine but wished he had booked the other Treetop Terrace room. After many trips to AI resorts in the area, I am very glad I stayed at Luna Blue. I plan to return with my wife later this year. She will be able to put this whole Luna Blue vibe into words better than I can. I can say it was a much more personal experience than staying at an AI.

The location of the Luna Blue itself is fantastic - just off La Quinta, but at the quieter and cheaper end (if there is such a thing as the \"cheaper\" end of La Quinta).

Third, the price is right - for the location and quality it is hard to beat $65/night for a double (plus tax).

At many times during our stay we wondered how could such a poor facility get such a high number of positive reviews. We suspect that it has a lot to do with the type of customer that lands here. If the words trendy, modern, hip, comfortable, and trustworthy mean anything to you avoid this hotel at all costs. If you don't care about any of these things than you might like it. We are not confrontational people, and loved our time in Playa Del Carmen which is an amazing town, so we decided not to complain or cause any fuss during our stay, and minimized the time spent in our room to sleeping and showering only. Instead we would like to share our experience with other travelers so they can avoid a major disappointment. The complete lack of attention to detail manifested itself from the moment we arrived. My complimentary margarita was concocted out of re-used plastic bottles of dubious content and served on a chipped glass. The room (so called suite #21) was the most expensive they offered, at 110 bucks a night was the worst hotel room we had ever stayed at, and we had traveled extensively in all five continents. As soon as you walked in the room you were hit by a strong smell of mildew. They had sprayed some kind of air freshener to cover it up and it was nauseating. The light blue curtains on the windows were filthy. The walls were splattered with stains of various kinds and sizes that made us cringe. The oven did not work the one time we tried to re-heat smth. I guess there is not a lot of baking going on at the Luna Blue. Ha-ha! The furniture was gloomy and smelly. The bathroom was so old and run down, that we were wondering what exactly had been renovated in this hotel? The shower is awkward, and claustrophobic, and the water splashes everywhere making it a constant slipping hazard. The sink was cracked. For 850 pesos (less than the price of a night on this room) you could buy a beautiful Mexican style sink on 5th avenue to replace it and give it local charm. But it was apparent that the people running this hotel do not care that much. We visited about five other hotels of the same range in the area and were positively impressed as they all offered better values than Luna Blue. The Coco Rio next door at 105 dollars a night offers a much nicer suite with a modern kitchenette, impeccable bathrooms, and just as nice lush garden environment. And this is just the facilities. We had a negative experience with the two front desk staff. We trusted Luna Blue's motto from their website that \"Every restaurant, tour or activity we recommend is because we like it, not because we\u2019re getting a commission or kickback. \" We quickly found out that this was a lie! Alex who I found initially helpful to book us tours to Chichen Itza and the Catamaran to Isla Mujeres, tried to take advantage of us, even though I tipped him for his \"research.\" First, he told us that ChichenItza was 50 USD, but because we didn't have USD, he asked for 1250 Pesos (for two people). Initially he said we could pay directly Aldebaran tour agency, but then wanted us to pay him upfront. He was too fidgety when asking for the money which we didn't like. We chose to pay the agency the next day and they had no idea how much I should be paying, so when I just gave them 1200 Pesos for the tour to test them they agreed. Makes me wonder how much the Luna Blue's cut is. They take commissions on everything including restaurants. While I was inquiring for my tour a local restaurant representative dropped by his cards and started telling them about how they would get 10% commission on all the customers they sent their way. Jaime agreed that he knew how it worked, and they have been doing this for a long time. I understand Spanish perfectly and was puzzled by eavesdropping in this conversation. We never asked them for recommendations from that point on. On the morning of Wednesday the 9th of February, we had to be picked up by 8:00 AM to go to Chichen Itza, and even though on LB's website it says that breakfast is served at 7:30 there was nothing there until 8:00 so we had to start our tour on an empty stomach and no coffee. One might say that it's not a big deal, but it's just kind of continuous nuisances that showed us the lack of care or attentive service from the management. For the tour to Isla Mujeres on the Catamaran Alex asked us for 65 USD. We were already suspecting that this was not the best deal. Just across the street from Luna Blue, on calle 26, there is a tiny travel agency called Mayaluum who sold the exact same tour (again through Aldebaran) for 55 USD and accepted a better exchange rate of 12 Pesos to the dollar. Obviously, this is not about the few dollars that we saved but about the untrustworthiness of our front desk staff! Nobody likes to be taken advantage of, and we recommend that everybody be very suspicious of doing business with the Luna Blue. Shop around for better rates even if it is to go across the street at Mayaluum travel agency. Another annoyance with Luna Blue, is that even though there is a lengthy description or fine print in the reservation nowhere there it says that you can't bring you drinks to the Beach Clubs. You only find this out after you have arrived. The whole beach club cross promotion is another scheme. It only costs the hotel less than 30 Pesos to provide the access to the umbrellas, and once there you must pay extortionist prices for everything. They gave us grief for bringing our own water. It's almost better to put your beach towels on the sand (all beaches in Mexico are opened and free to the public) and not have to deal with the beach clubs. The only positives are that the cleaning ladies are quite nice and polite, and our room was quiet. The tropical garden is nice, but so is every other hotel's that we visited for comparison. The sheets were clean, which made our stay bearable. Again, we loved Playa Del Carmen, the beach, and the food at every restaurant we tried, and will definitely come back to stay at a nicer hotel for a better price. The hotels that we visited and would consider as much better values would be Hacienda Paradise (20 bucks more per night gets you a chic room with marble bathroom and a swimming pool). Hotel Aqualuna on 10th ave and Calle 14 is a very nice boutique hotel, with much nicer finishes at 70 bucks a night. If you want a very nice hotel even closer to the beach Riviera del Sol is a fantastic choice on 1st avenue and Calle 30.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLuna Blue is a piece of heaven tucked away on a sidestreet in Playa...\u201d", "Author": "janiam_07", "ReviewID": "UR96667531", "Content": "If you want an independent visit to Playa, check out Luna Blue.

It\u2019s a great experience staying here and in Playa in general. The Luna Blue is sort of a \u201cbare-bones\u201d hotel with style. There are no TV\u2019s, phones or pools, but that\u2019s sort of its charm. They replace all that stuff with a lovely jungle in the middle of the hotel which serves as the lobby, and bar. Now this hotel is certainly not for everyone, and if you want things like TV\u2019s, pools, Jacuzzi\u2019s, or phones while you are on vacation, then there are plenty of other hotels to pick from, but if you really just want to get away on the Mayan Riviera beach and experience Playa Del Carmen, this might be the hotel for you. Service at the hotel is friendly in a sort of \u201clet\u2019s be friends\u201d way, rather than the subservient sweetness you would find for service at an all-inclusive. Both receptionists were very helpful, and they helped me plan dinners, beach clubs, transportation and restaurants. Be sure to ask them for suggestions, they know their stuff. Tony and Cheri were great and full of advice for gringos on vacation. The rooms, showers, toilets, beds, A/C and fridges all worked excellently. The maid service was nothing short of outstanding. Perhaps the quickest and cleanliest maid service I\u2019ve ever had (and that includes the all-inclusive). The morning coffee was good, and the muffins were OK (but I\u2019m guessing fattening). The internet Wi-Fi did not work from my balcony, but that was fine by me, because it gave me an excuse to go downstairs and hang-out in the jungle-lobby while drinking my morning coffee and surfing the net on my iPhone. The \u201cswingers\u201d bar was a great place for a quick drink before hitting 5th Avenue. It looked like some of the guests spent a lot more time at the bar than I did, and they seemed to have fun. The hotel is not far from the beach and the best beach resort (about a 5 to 7 minute walk), but it\u2019s not right on the beach. A couple minor complaints would be that the curtains in our room were a little difficult to close completely and there were some ants on the wall (although I think ants on the wall would be common in most hotels in the region). On a few days, the coffee and muffins were out closer to 7:45am rather than 7am; but hey, it\u2019s Mexico and you\u2019re on vacation, so stop looking at your watch. All in all, the Luna Blue is good value for the money, close to the beach and basically right on 5th Avenue. Close to the coffee shops, restaurants and the \u201clittle Italy\u201d part of North Playa.

I did alot of research before choosing this hotel. We always try to choose a place that has everything we are looking for: good location, friendly staff, safe, clean, and reasonable price. I studied all of the negative reviews of Luna and decided that the people leaving those reviews had different expectations than what Luna has to offer. My instincts were correct, as Luna Blue was everything we expected and hoped it would be. I had alot of questions about the culture and what to expect when we got there and the owners were great at communicating with me by email before our arrival. We didnt see a whole lot of the owners after our arrival, Tony made sure everything was going well for us on a couple of occasions. The staff was extremely helpful, giving us advice on anything we needed. By the time we left, we felt that Jaime, Alex and Jorge were old friends of ours. We stayed in one of the treetop rooms, ours just happened to be on the 4th floor. If you plan on staying in one of the treetop rooms, make sure you can handle the climb, it is definitely a workout. The room was very comfortable and well decorated. We had fridge and water cooler in there, it was nice having fresh water anytime we wanted it. The balcony was very private, totally relaxing and even had a hammock. Jorge the bartender makes awesome drinks, I fell in love with his pina colada.

What can I say? It was another epic visit! Our transportation dropped us at the gate, and we were greeted like we were old friends by Jamie and Mayte at the desk, and by Jorge at the bar. Seeing as we had only been here one time before (and that was in January), it's pretty awesome to be getting hugs at check in! We were given our keys and AC remote and before we could even catch our breath from the always stunning gardens surrounding us, our bags had been moved to our room and we were free to start living in Mexico (for 10 days)! Our beautiful room this time was one of the Tropical Hideaway rooms on the second floor. One easy flight of stairs and there you are. The room was stunning! Bright and clean, with lots of windows to let the sunshine stream in (but with curtains that could block it out if you wanna day sleep). There is a luggage rack to put a suitcase on, and the carved armoire had two drawers, giving plenty of room for two people with (once again) too many clothes to hang up and put away everything. For a 10 day stay, we were able to completely unpack...no living out of suitcases! The whole place was spotless and smelled clean...\"for real clean\", not like air freshener or Febreeze (I hate that in other hotels...what are they trying to cover?). The shower was a tile enclosed stand up shower that kinda gave me pause at first, but turned out to be awesome! There's not a door for the shower, but the shower head is angled so that water doesn't go out. Plenty of room and light while you're showing. (This came in very handy, since I left my fancy razor handle at home, and had to master shaving my legs by holding onto the razor head...) Never ran out of hot water, no matter what time of day we showered or for how long. The AC and ceiling fan kept the room very cool, even during the hottest part of the day, and we slept like bebes (bambinos!) in the comfy beds at night. Our patio overlooked the garden area, and we could see everything going on but still provided privacy. It was adjoining the patio for the room next door, but there was a 3/4 fence in between, with some potted plants finishing the separation. But seeing as how it was my sister and brother in law next door, Cheri (one of the owners) suggested we roll the plants to either side and viola! We could wander back and forth to each other's rooms and spend time together on the now one patio! We spent every morning there, scarfing the awesome coffee and muffins ( the orange muffins are to die for!) provided by Cheri and Tony, recalling the previous night and planning our adventures for the day...in a perfect setting. None of us had any problems at all with the WiFi signal when on the patio. I made several Skype call home to brag about my day and just be generally obnoxious to peeps back home, and always had a solid signal. Works better than my signal back home at work. Also, we've used the nice lady's laundry service across the street several times. Absolutely no worries. Just drop it off, and pick up in a few hours. Great prices and it all comes back smelling clean (again, not perfume-y) and folded...with a little lollipop. Have never had anything missing, shrunk or faded. (Wish I had that service here at home!) We enjoyed some great nights at the famous bar, listened to the perfect music of Barefoot Skinny and other local talents. This is not by any means a club. No thumping techno music will ever sully the speakers. This is a bar, where the locals, expats, and tourists looking to get away from the hustle of Fifth Ave come to visit each other and meet new folks. They also know that Jorge is the best bartender in Playa! Sit on a swing, enjoy a pomegranate margarita or a Salty Thong, soak in the music and visit with great peeps...life is so very good! Of course, it all shuts down at 11PM, so you can wind down your night if you're ready. If not, Fifth Avenue is half a block away (far enough that you can't hear it, but literally right around that corner at the end of the street). When you do call it a night, you can enter the now locked and secure hotel grounds through the guest only locked door (you're given a key at check in). All safe and tucked in for the night, with only the sound of an occasional gecko to remind you of your surroundings. The beach is maybe 1/4 mile walk from the hotel, and they provide you with fresh beach towels and passes to the best ones. A few of the beach clubs are further north, so you may want to cab it there but the staff can help you with all that. Tony told us all about the different appeals of the different clubs they have passes for, something for everyone. But the popular Mamitas and Kool are just a short walk away (and you can stop at PG's Sandbox to for lunch on your way!). We ended up only having a few beach days, as we decided to snorkel and explore a lot more area this time (and Tony and Cheri can point you in some good directions for that too!) When my friends ask me where they should stay when they go to Playa, this is where I tell them to look first. I do tell them it's not an all inclusive. If you want more than coffee, tea and muffins right outside your door for breakfast, you won't find that here. No bed turndown service or mints on your pillow at night. There's no swimming pool on site, but the most gorgeous swimming is a five minute walk away, and won't leave you smelling like chlorine or turn your hair green. :-) What you will find is romance, fun, being treated like family, new friends from all over the world and a feeling of being rejuvenated. When i travel, I want to feel included in the lifestyle and culture and I get that here. Tony and Cheri and their wonderful staff go above and beyond to make you feel a part of it all, and I'm forever grateful to them for giving me that. We'll be back soon!

Sadly, we were really disappointed in our stay. I realize now I should have taken the NEGATIVE reviews more seriously as they were a closer approximation of what we experienced. Here are our biggest criticisms: First, the room we were assigned was on the street and noisy. It faced a side street so you wouldn't think it would be that bad, but there was enough traffic and restaurant noise to disturb our sleep. Since we had to be up at 6am to go diving, we were not happy about this. Further, the twin bed in our room was like sleeping on plywood. I tossed and turned all night and woke up sore (again, not ideal for an early morning dive trip). My friends shared the queen bed, which was perfectly fine so clearly there is no shortage of acceptable matresses. I've stayed in a lot worse hotels in Mexico and always had a decent bed. And in fact, when the front desk kindly switched our rooms (perhaps the one saving grace of this hotel), the twin bed in the next room was leaps and bounds better (though still not great). So, if you ever stay here (and I highly suggest you do not), and you have a low tolerance for noise and/or hard beds, make sure you are not in room 5. Our other major issue was that the \"free high speed internet\" was extremely weak. We could only get our emails occasionally if we stood on our porch, and could NEVER get bigger downloads. We found ourselves walking to the Starbucks or Ah Cacao around the corner when we really needed to download information (tip: Ah Cacao always had a stronger signal). Since we were using our email to communicate with our dive master and coordinate plans this was particularly inconvenient. We specifically picked a hotel with wifi because we knew we were going to need internet access. And because the wifi was weak, we had to leave the hotel several times to get updates on dive plans, pick-up times, flight schedules, etc. On the hotel's website they say internet is only available in \"all of the outdoor areas, including most balconies and terraces, reception area and in the bar.\" TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD and do not expect internet in your room or even on your balcony. This means that you might have to stand outside in heat, humidity, rain or all of the above (as was our case a couple times) to check an email and you STILL might not actually be able to get it. If you are really going to need internet the way we did, this probably isn't the place for you. On a smaller scale of disappointment was the sad coffee and muffins on offer in the mornings. Like I said, we're divers and knew we were going to be getting up crazy early some days, so we picked a hotel with coffee and muffins so we would be able to grab some on our way out. Well, they had coffee and muffins, but they were really as minimal as you can get. First, they didn't have fresh milk or cream for the coffee (only fake creamer). I realize that it's really hot outside so maybe they're worried about spoilage, but I've stayed in plenty of hotels in Mexico where they put a little milk/cream on ice and replace it frequently. Or if that's too time-consuming, maybe they could keep it in the refrigerator and let the guests know it's available \"by request.\" I just feel like where there's coffee there should be cream (call me crazy!), but clealy Luna Blue is not of the same mindset. So if you like cream/milk in your coffee plan on doing what we did every morning: walking to the Starbucks around the corner. The same is true for the muffins -- that's all there is so if you don't like 'em, you're on your own. My friends and I all found them to be inedible. They were dense, oily, and overly sweet. I'm guessing other guests must eat them or they would stop putting them out all together, but frankly, they made us gag. If you're like us and don't like oily, super sweet muffins, you probably won't like these and should plan on making alternate breakfast plans (tip: don't expect a good muffin from Ah Cacao around the corner because they apparently sell the same muffins there). It would have been great to see a few pieces of fruit offered to pickier people like us, but again, I get the sense that Luna Blue isn't trying to please everyone or push the limits of service. So, don't stay here if you expect: - that a quiet room with a comfortable bed will be standard (room 5 was terrible, room 6 was ok. Who knows about the other rooms) - that you will have reliable internet access. At best (standing outside) our Blackberries and iPhones had one bar of wifi. - that cream will be offered with coffee - that you will be able to grab a quick breakfast (unless you like the greasy muffins) And in general, CAREFULLY read their website. What they say is EXACTLY what's true. \"Coffee, tea, and muffins\" means ONLY coffee, tea, and muffins. \"High speed internet in all outdoor areas\" means ONLY outdoor areas and NOT in the room. If you mistakenly expect more management will be all too happy to point out why you shouldn't have.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bemidji", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, friendly, wonderful ambience\u201d", "Author": "annieb1111", "ReviewID": "UR76874347", "Content": "I recently visited Playa del Carmen and stayed at Luna Blue Hotel as this hotel had been recommended to me by several friends.

Overall I have to say a positive experience, and I would recommend this hotel. It wasn't a Hilton or Marriott, but you aren't paying Hilton and Marriott prices either. It does have a nice, small hotel feel to it. Likes - 1) Free Wi Fi! I am a big advocate for Wi Fi, and I think every hotel should offer it free. I travel A LOT for dive trips and work, and Wi Fi is simply a must. You need to be able to quickly connect to friends, family, work for \"quick\" updates (or just to check your local news) thus spending time finding a WI FI spot is not an option for me (which I spent 2 hours one time in Cancun trying to just find a WI FI spot), and paying high prices for it is not acceptable either. (See a dislike as well regarding Wi Fi). I am glad that Luna Blue recognizes that it is important for travelers. 2) Friendly Staff - Alex was really helpful and everyone was very nice. 3) Hotel transportation - the hotel arranged for our pick up in Cancun and our return trip. They were on time, they were nice, weren't over priced, etc. I usually drive, but I was concerned about the parking situation in Playa Del Carmen (since Luna Blue does not have their own parking garage). However, you really don\u2019t need to drive in Playa Del Carmen. 4) Spacious rooms with kitchens. I wish I had used the kitchen more. Plus they had \"bottled\" water (not individual bottles) for you so you always had fresh, clean water. Big fridge in the rooms for anything you buy at the store. 5) Surprisingly soft beds (not overly soft or plush). The beds were more comfortable than I am use to when traveling to small hotels in places like Mexico. Last trip to Isla Mejures my bed was so hard; I didn't sleep for any of the 5 nights I was there. These beds felt like they have been changed out and not used for the past 50 years. I think a good night's sleep is a must - especially when I have a big day of diving the next day. Point is the bed wasn\u2019t hard (and if you have stayed in other places in Mexico, you know what I mean). 6) Location. You are just minutes (and I mean short minutes) from the main strip, but you are far enough off of it that you aren't in the middle of the crowds and the noise. Also, most of the main strip doesn't allow traffic on it, so I am unsure how some people get to their hotel (without walking through the streets with their luggage in the heat - which would really suck) for hotels that are actually on the main street (which I think the main street is called 5th Ave). 7) They offer muffins and coffee in the morning. I think it is a nice touch to offer something for people on their way out the door needing a quick snack. They aren't gourmet, but they are good enough. I don't drink coffee, so I wish they had offered some type of juice, but just to have something quick to eat was nice. I am usually running late, and have somewhere to get to (like a dive shop for a morning dive), so having something to eat is great. 8) Cool little bar set up. Swinging chairs and very intimate (not a big Carlos and Charlie\u2019s Bar \u2013 a nice small one that you actually will be forced to mingle with other people). 9) Seemed to attract a good quality group of guests while I was there. Overall for the price and the location, I don't think you can beat this hotel. Dislikes - 1) The Wi FI doesn't necessarily pick up in your room. Normally not a big deal, as I like to go outside anyway (and the WI FI worked great right outside my door, in the lobby, etc). However, the mosquitoes can be vicious at certain times, thus it makes it tough to go outside during these times. I think the walls of your room are so thick that the signal has trouble getting in. 2) Bigger safe for your laptop. However, this is just being nit picky. I have found very few hotels that have a safe big enough to accommodate laptops. You can always check them at the front desk. Everyone travels with their laptop nowadays, and the need to secure them is important. 3) No pool. Hey, but it isn't the Marriott or Hilton, you aren't paying those prices either. 4) Not on the beach. However, they (Luna Blue management) have several properties that you can get towels and chairs (for free) at and they it is only about a 7 minute walk to the beach. Actually we discovered several places that if you ate lunch at their establishment on the beach, that they gave you a chair and towel for the day as well. We knew there wasn't a beach when I booked the room, so it wasn't anything upsetting. Once again, my \u201cdislikes\u201d were just that \u2013 dislikes (being nit picky). But it wasn\u2019t anything I didn\u2019t expect or prepared for. I love that they don\u2019t have TVs in the room (I am on vacation, don\u2019t need to watch the tube, I can catch the news on my computer).

This is my 3rd trip to the area and my boyfriend's 2nd. All things said, we can't wait to go back to Luna Blue. PROs: What we liked best about the hotel was the staff (Jaime & Alex) and the location. The staff was always friendly and their recommendations were always spot on. We tried venturing on our own to find places to eat, and every time we were disspointed. It's really a crapshoot unless you have a recommendation. We really enjoyed the bar and the bartender Jorge. The margaritas were particularly good. The location was unbeatable. Having transportation to and from the airport was very much appreciated. We had planned to rent a car, but luckily we didn't. In the past, we've stayed on the Riviera, where we were far away from everything. Luna Blue was within walking distance or a short cabride to everywhere we wanted to go. So we only ended up renting a car 1 day, and we did it through the hotel. No $1,000 deposit needed. They dropped off the car at the hotel and picked it up from there too. Normally renting a car in Mexico is pretty stressful because they put a $1,000 hold on your car, you have to take them at their word that they will not charge it and you worry about tons of other things. Since the owners of Luna Blue have a personal relationship with the car rental place, it made me feel much more comfortable about the whole process, and enabled us to continue on \"vacation mode.\" Not having TV was great. My boyfriend actually read a book for the first time in a while. We both found great books in their library. Having purified drinking water & a fridge saved us a lot of money & hassle of always buying bottles of water & we were able to keep some thing in the fridge for breakfast & snacks. I loved having the 2 pet cats around, they made me feel more at home. The beds & pillows were the most comfortable I've had in Mexico. CON's: When we first arrived, we were a bit surprised by how small the room was. The next day I told one of the guys at the front desk and he walked me around to some of the other rooms. Except for the rooms with kitchens, they were all pretty small. Not having a \"solid\" door to the bathroom was our biggest complaint. It's a real door, but it has \"slats\" like a dressing room door. I don't want to get too detailed, but we would have preffered not hear hear each other's business in the bathroom. If you and your partner don't have those kinds of reservations-- maybe you do your business with the door open, then this likely won't bother you. The maids keep the doors of the rooms open when cleaning. This allows mosquitos to come in. One night we got several mosquito bites in the room, and could not understand how they got in. I am very sensitive to bites, and whever I would leave the room I'd put on lots of insect repellant and wear long linen pants & shirt. Mosquitoes don't seem to bother locals that much, but I hope the staff would be more sensitive about that in the future. We solved the problem by spraying Raid in the room, and leaving for a few hours. TIP: Don't get a room on the ground floor. You won't be able to open the curtains unless you want everybody to be able to see you and your room. Having the curtains closed all the time made the room feel dark & even smaller. All in all, the good far outweighs the bad at Luna Blue.

The location is still one of my favorite reasons for staying here as well as the friendly, helpful staff and the hospitality of the owners. I emailed Cheri regarding the dates I was interested in coming and she was so accommodating and quick to respond and as you all know, planning a vacation requires a lot of time and coordination so here prompt assistance definitely made that so much easier. They've added access to several new beach clubs which I still haven't had the pleasure of visiting because my friends and I love Mamitas Beach so much but hopefully we will have the opportunity in the near future. The swing bar is in full effect and definitely adds a very fun atmosphere to the hotel. I must say that I always feel very safe and secure staying here. The rooms are very clean and we made full use of our kitchen as we stayed in a deluxe suite which we loved very much. We found the rooms very comfortable. I've been to Playa Del Carmen many times but I must say that staying at the Luna Blue has made it feel so much more personal to me. The North End of Playa is getting more restaurants and shops so the location has become even more desirable.

As we were there for four weeks this year, we did cook and both Walmart and Mega were within walking distance and were great for groceries as well as alcohol. We also shopped at DAC \u2013 a smaller local store that carries mainly fruits and veggies as well as a very nice selection of spices and condiments. We would pick up beer at the local OXXO store on the corner. Tony & Cheri are wonderful hosts and were so helpful in providing suggestions for new restaurants as well as instructions on how to travel on the collectivo which we used for the first time and we took it to both Tulum and Akumul. For Valentine\u2019s Day we splurged and went to Casa Mediterranea which Cheri recommended and it was fantastic. Most meals we ate off 5th which are so much better and definitely cheaper! Our favorite is El Fogon on Constituents for Mexican \u2013 love the tacos al pastor and beef fahitas - Yolanda was our favorite waitress. There is a very nice bakery on the corner before you get to El Fogon that had wonderful pastries we would pick up to have with our coffee in the morning. We also went to La Pesca a few times and had the cazuela de cameron (shrimp casserole) also recommended by Tony & Cheri - it is absolutely wonderful and a local favorite\u2013 but be sure and order the shrimp as one time we got the seafood casserole which is still very good but the shrimp is so much better (very large servings, we had leftovers the first time and the second time shared one). Jamie at the front desk, who we remembered from last year, was so helpful with anything we needed as was Edgar. Another restaurant recommended by a couple we met at the beach is \u201c10\u201d- which is around the corner from the Luna Blue north a couple of blocks on 5th. Unbelievable \u201cOutside Skirt\u201d steak \u2013 so tasty and tender. On our last morning, we went to La Cueva del Chango \u2013 a wonderful little restaurant on Calle 38 \u2013we had a fantastic breakfast and wished we had gone there sooner. Luna Blue has a lovely swing up bar with music three times a week which shuts down at 11pm. Although we are not bar scene people, we did enjoy a couple of drinks at the bar and especially the Mardi Gras evening. We did thoroughly enjoy sitting on our balcony in the evenings, having a glass of wine and listening to Brent Parkin whose music we preferred to Mike Grabow. Beach passes were provided to Mamitas beach club any time we wanted to go, but you needed to go early if you wanted a Palapa or Umbrella. Chairs were usually available throughout the day but I need to have shade, so we had to get there early.

No complaints about the AI's or the condos, they were wonderful as well, and we certainly enjoyed our visits! This time we were ready for another adventure, and we are extremely glad we chose the Luna Blue Hotel and Garden. We read many reviews on Tripadvisor and looked the hotel up on Google earth, and went to the website often, so felt we had plenty of information. We had Sheri and Tony book our transportation, both to and from Cancun airport, we chose the shared type. The driver was right at the airport with our name on a sign, so no difficulty finding him. We shared the trip to Playa with three other couples and our return was by ourselves. Edgar greeted us in the lobby and did the remainder of the paperwork pleasantly and quickly. We paid the remainder of our hotel bill, left a deposit for the safety deposit box, all the while looking at the beautiful garden and listening to the waterfalls. Luna Blue requires a deposit on the key for the safety deposit box , which was returned our last day. We also saw the resident cats, Frankie and Oszo. Edgar carried our luggage up the two outdoor stairways, to our room, which was a Tropical Hideaway. Just to mention, even in most AI's, you don't have elevators, unless they are highrises. The room was spotless, white tiles on the floor, blue curtains with backing for all of the windows and sliding glass door. There was a queen bed, two night tables with a drawer and closed cupboard in them, a two lighted lamp on both tables, and a wicker chair. The wardrobe had two bottom drawers, a place to hang clothes, with plenty of hangers, another shelf, with the safe securely attached to the wall. There was plently of room in the safe for passports, wallets, cell phones, cameras and a notebook, ( small laptop). There was a bar frig, it had plenty of room for cervazas, wine, pop, juice, fruit etc, and a storage shelf over the frig. The water bottle, full sized sat in a dispenser onto of the frig.The bathroom, had a counter around the sink and another smaller shelf to put toiletries on. The shower had a small opening, but would accomodate two, it had a built in shelf as well. I really liked the unique towel rack and tissue holder! We had a private balcony, with two chairs, a table with a candle on it. We were right up amongst beautiful flowering trees and had three chirping geckos to keep us company! We saw many beautiful birds, while sitting on our balconey, even saw some humming birds! We were able to get beach passes everyday, there were three choices of beaches. We didn't go to Wickys at all and went once to Blucacao. The day we went to Blucacao, we took a cab, there and arranged to have our driver return at a given time to take us back. The beach there is beautiful and the facilities were very nice, with a water wall in the eating area and an infinity pool. They supplied our towels and we were able to get drinks and snacks/meals there. It would be roughly a 40 min walk from Mamitas beach, along the beach to Blucacao. We spent the rest of our beach time at Mamitas, a short walk from Luna Blue. You could also have drinks, snacks/meals there. Each day Edgar or Jamie would give us beach passes, for two loungers and an umbrella. We would also get fresh beach towels in the morning, return them in the afternoon and get towel cards. There was 100 peso deposit for each towel and that was returned on our last day. Our room was cleaned each and every day, while we were gone. The maids left towel animals on our bed, we received, two bath towels, two washcloths, a hand towel and bath mat each day. The bar was open each day, we enjoyed drinks there with friends.Jorge does make an excellent margarita, as well as various other drinks. There was live enterment Tues, Wed and Friday evenings, but at eleven PM, the bar closed. We enjoyed sitting on our balconey, with a glass of wine and listening to the live music. It wasn't open on Sundays at all. Liquor is only sold between 10 and 5 on Sundays, but you can order it in restaurants. There were coupons in the lobby to a variety of restaurants. Sheri and Tony had great ideas for different types of restaurants. La Pesca, Babe's Noodles, La Divina Comida, La Vagabunda, Karen's, Los Comolos, and Cafe Sasta, were a few we enjoyed. There is a wine store just east on Calle 26, called On the Vine, we sat there one evening with friends. We also bought our wine there, they would open the cork for us, then recork it for us to bring back, I forgot to bring a corkscrew. There is Mega, Super Walmart to buy groceries, but we used the Oxxo and local stores to buy our drinks and food. We brought an iphone with us for texts and emails. We were able to pick up the WiFi best in the bar. There was also a gym around the corner and my husband bought a pass to use during our stay, very reasonable. The Luna Blue is quiet, clean, friendly and a wonderful place to get away from the hectic day to day world. We really enjoyed our stay, we were able to relax, do what we wanted to do, when we wanted to, no schedules! We had the privacy we wanted, in beautiful surroundings for a very reasonable price! We would recommend the Luna Blue to travellers, who want to get away from it all! On a note, our friends staying at an AI were able to visit us and come up to our room and balcony. We were only allowed at their AI in the lobby, after explaining to the guard why we wanted to visit, although we do understand this for security reasons. Thank you Sheri, Tony, Edgar, Jamie, Jorge, and the ladies for a wonderful visit.

Mamita's beach club worked out very well for us though you need to reserve a chair with towel by 9:30am or so as it was crowded. The hotel was exactly what we wanted. Nice clean room with great view of the reception and garden area. We had terrace room and enjoyed being up, but some might not want the steps. The swing bar was open till around 11pm, so if you like to go to bed a little early, you will be a part of the party for a while, but not a problem for us. We found the front desk people helpful, but you need to ask if you have questions. Wireless internet was fine in the reception and garden areas and sometimes around our room. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at Luna Blue and look forward to going back. Couple quick tips - Beach - They have agreement with another beach club called Blucacau (sp?) and we enjoyed going an afternoon there. You can walk as we did, but be ready for a good 45min or more walk though along the beach one way. Eating - We enjoyed going to several local eating spots for both lunch and dinner.

It was a pretty darn near perfect vacation. The staff was always available and responded pronto to anything we needed.

Sitting out on our patio listening to the birds, feeling the breeze, saying hello to our Luna-mates, drinking coffee.....sweet! We were traveling with our 17 year old daughter and her 18 year old girl friend. Spring break in Playa is a world of difference than spring break in Cancun (been there; done that!) We were very comfortable with them coming and going as they pleased (curfew in place.) We previewed the local clubs and felt (after long talks about don't do this, don't do that) they were safe on their own. They met a lot of other kids from all over the world some of whom we had the opportunity to meet on the beach later. I can safely say the girls loved their trip! and have lots of stories to tell their friends back home. Back to Luna Blue.... having entertainment 3 nights a week was a bonus. The bar scene just lively enough and closes up early (11 pm). Knowing the outside gates are locked at 11pm also a plus. (Truly, the place begins to feel like home away from home and in the tropics!) We were in a ground floor unit facing the courtyard. It was cool enough 4 out of 6 nights we slept with our door and windows open. We love that there is NO TV and hope that never changes! I like that there are purified water dispensers in the rooms instead of using disposable bottles. The rooms are squeaky clean and refreshed daily. Beds comfortable, good pillows. Plenty of hot water. The water pressure in our daughter's room was low; something to do with the cistern. Wicky's was the perfect place to spend the day. Good food (fish tacos to die for!), good service, good music. We thought we would have access to the swimming pool but that was not to be. It's an easy taxi ride to Blue Cacao and we spent one day there.

You would hope that the expectations would at least meet your previous experience. This return did, and more. Our room was exactly as we expected: clean, well-appointed with what we needed, and quiet. The \"more\" happened when we were greeted by Jaime, who was so gracious, warm, and welcoming, that we were immediately put at ease after a long journey. Later on, when the bar opened, we headed over to say hi to Jorge, who remembered us, and extending his hand said, \"Welcome home\". Wow. :) We choose a garden deluxe room again, which offers a nice kitchenette, fully equipped with pots, pans, utensils, even a toaster, coffee maker, and blender. Our room was tucked away in the deepest corner of the hotel, a cozy nook where the trees formed a beautiful natural screen allowing us to look out toward the courtyard, but allowing for privacy. Really, this room had everything you could want for a what we now call our \"home away from home\". Mornings started with a cup of coffee on our private patio, which had a bistro set with two chairs. Tropical birds, the sound of the waterfall around the bend replaced our normal morning background sound of the TV, which (thankfully!) this room does not have. I mean, who watches TV in Playa del Carmen? There are plenty of reviews here about Luna Blue, most of which will outline what's available, the rooms, location, and all the things that people take into consideration when making a reservation. For those people, I will say that The Luna Blue has clean, well-maintained rooms with very good, basic amenities, plus a little more. But, please consider this, if you're after the more \"all inclusive\" resort experience, there might be other places for you. The Luna Blue is a place to \"drop out\" from the everyday mundane life and to allow yourself clear your head. The desk staff are amazing: they can give you plenty of suggestions of places to explore Playa and the surrounding area, but also know that many of us like to make our own way, and so are not in the least bit overbearing. The other thing people need to keep in mind is that when you travel to Playa del Carmen, you need to be open to the fact that you are not in the US, or where ever else you live, and that there are immutable facts that come with this spot on the planet: It's on the edge of a jungle, so that means there is wildlife such as birds who like to sing rather vigorously in the AM (although I see more animals in my suburban neighbourhood in New England); various aspects of the town's infrastructure may not meet your expectations, either, such as water-pressure, which seems to surprise many visitors. Also, Spanish is the first language of nearly all the people in Playa del Carmen, so it would help to be more patient when communicating, as well as encountering another's cultural perspective. To close this, let me say that we are planning our next trip back. We come here because it allows us to make our own party, so to speak. Each night at the swing bar in the courtyard, we met people from all over, no crowds of spring-break students, and above all, the village atmosphere that needs to kept in a town that at times, seems to be bursting at the seams.

The kitchen and bathroom were immaculate, and the fresh water was a real treat - some hotels will provide drinking water in the lobby which is a pain when you need to brush your teeth and forgot to refill the night before! I liked the cool, minimal decor and the comfy hammock. Shower had great water pressure and hot water when I was there. Housekeeping was attentive and thorough, and towel art is always enjoyable :-) The staff was great - Jaime at the front desk helped my friend find his hotel, then provided me with a flashlight, candle and matches when the power went out just minutes after my arrival. Tony was my lifesaver when my flight home was canceled - he helped me call my airline, and then arranged for a discounted room at another hotel since the Luna Blue was (sadly!) fully booked.

The bar is a really fun hangout with a strong expat clientele and Jorge's reputation as a fantastic bartender is well deserved :-) The live music was great - rock & blues - and ended at 11pm each evening. The Luna Blue provides passes and/or discounts to four beach clubs, which is more than I've seen from any other hotel (I highly recommend their newest addition, the Canibal Royal) and will help provide any transportation you might need.

We found this small quaint hotel on the tripadvisor website that was located in the heart of Playa del Carmen that ranked 18 out of 181 hotels at a very affordable price. It looked like an absolute tropical paradise. After reading the reviews and viewing the video and pictures of the hotel we decided this was the place to be. Upon our arrival, we were greeted at the front desk by their friendly and courteous staff. We had the opportunity to stay in three different rooms at the hotel all of which were amazing and very clean. Our favourite is the treetop (#36). We were in paradise the moment we walked in and it has the most incredible balcony. No tvs in these rooms and trust me when I say none are required. The rooms all have a small bar fridge which was very handy and unlimited bottled water. Next there\u2019s the Luna Blue bar.

We were also fortunate enough to hear Mike Grabow play while we were there and he was awesome. Lenny the dog also did a great job entertaining the crowd. The bar closes at 11:00 pm so none of the guests are inconvenienced by noise. There are fantastic restaurants, a beach and great shopping all within walking distance of the hotel. The staff were very helpful in recommending choice locations. No disappointments! We just can\u2019t say enough about the Luna Blue. We loved it so much we are planning a trip back in a few months. To close this review we just want to say \u201cthank you\u201d to Cheri and Tony (the owners) for their hospitality and to all the wonderful staff at the Luna Blue for making our vacation such a memorable one.

To our disappointment, we found the Luna Blue to be average in every regard except price, which was expensive for the area and for the quality of the room and service. We booked a Treetop Terrace with a private balcony. If you decide to stay here, don't bother with the Treetop Terrace. Your balcony view is meager and nearby construction is loud and constant. Plus, the stairs to your room are many and steep -- we're in our early 30's and very athletic; I can't imagine an older (or out-of-shape) couple hiking these steps multiple times a day. The room itself had a hard bed and several hangers in an small, open wardrobe, which was infested with termites or small ants. The safe was tiny, and the lock on the room's door was not going to keep anyone but the mosquitoes out. Bring earplugs if you like to sleep-in, because construction is on-going. The bathroom was minimalist, which is fine, but the water pressure was weak and shower curtain too small -- we mopped up puddles after each shower. The free water is from a 5-gallon jug, so be sure you have your own water bottles to fill for the beach. The air conditioner was small and loud, but it worked. The artwork in the room was just plain creepy. I know the owners defend it as local artwork, but we didn't appreciate how the eyes of the freaky looking lady followed us throughout the room. Luna Blue does have pretty \"oasis\" grounds. Though when I sat in the garden with my laptop, since the free wi-fi signal didn't reach our room, I quickly left due to the abundance of mosquitoes. The shady, wet \"oasis\" area is an obvious breeding ground. The swing bar in the lobby is cute, but drinks are over-priced and seating is limited. We enjoyed the novelty of it, but there are many better bar options nearby. Maid service was good, so no complaints there. Front desk service was not helpful nor interested, but they did offer basic information when we asked. The Mamitas beach club was crowded, even though our visit was during the off season. Beach chairs were limited, and we found the people there to be largely unhelpful -- even though we had the Luna Blue partner coupons. Overall, the Luna Blue is an average hotel in every way, and I'm amazed it gets such high marks on Trip Advisor. There are MANY other options nearby that are just as good, if not better, and much cheaper. Based on our experience, I do not recommend the Luna Blue to folks visiting Playa Del Carmen.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falls Church, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cQuiet oasis in the heart of Playa\u201d", "Author": "zoecatva", "ReviewID": "UR55684515", "Content": "We are so glad we chose the Luna Blue for our first visit to Playa del Carmen. The hotel has a great location. It is at the end of 5th Avenue, but that just gave us an excuse to get exercise and have to walk a few blocks to get anywhere. It was not a problem at all. Plus, it is at the quieter end of the action which is nice. Also, very easy walk to the beach. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, especially when hauling my suitcase up to one of the treetop rooms. Our room was basic and just fine for our stay. It was great having a fridge and water. I loved the open shower too. We also enjoyed the balcony and the view of all of the trees and birds. Very relaxing to sit and play cards. The room was very clean and neat. Yes, the beds were hard, but I actually liked that and after a long day, i hardly noticed. Also, the AC and the fan kept the room very cool. The only thing I wished is that there was more room to store clothes. Maybe we just packed too much! The grounds of the Luna Blue are quite lovely and very well kept. If you like cats, there are a couple of very cute ones hanging around and they don't bother you at all. The bar was always a happening place and had live music two of the nights we stayed there which was a great addition. There are tons of restaurants around the the hotel, with about every type of food you could imagine. Also, convenience stores are nearby and it is not a far walk up to the Walmart or bigger grocery store if you need supplies. There are always taxis available right near the hotel if you need transportation. A couple of recommendations, we loved 100% natural for breakfast and I picked up a business card of Yaxche at the hotel and it was wonderful, one of the best meals we had and we got free margaritas.

This hotel is ideal because it is tucked away on the quieter end of 5th Avenue, so you don't have the madness, the noise, the swarms of tourists, and the inability to find good cheap food outside your door. At the same time, it is right on 5th Avenue (the quieter / better end), so you have plenty of places to eat, drink, shop, and relax right nearby, and within a 5-10 minute walk you are in the heart of the bustling, touristy part of 5th Avenue. After exploring much of downtown Playa, including the cheap eats off the beaten path, all parts of 5th Avenue, most of the highest rated restaurants on TripAdvisor, a snorkeling trip, the Playa beaches, and a day trip to Tulum, my boyfriend and I were in total agreement that we had lucked out and chosen THE best place to stay in Playa. As for the hotel itself, it is small and quaint. You must arrive expecting a little bungalow environment - a small but totally adequate room with a small but totally adequate bathroom, a lovely and relaxing balcony overlooking a green lush garden, and a purified water bottle in your room so you always have free drinking water (and face-washing water, and tooth brushing water, and hand-washing water, if you're paranoid about the local water like we were!). There is no TV, but why would you want to spoil a tropical vacation in paradise with a TV? Luna Blue does offer free wi-fi if you bring your laptop. We did, and we got a lot of use out of it, though the reception in our room was pretty poor so we did most of our internet surfing on the balcony. While we did this we enjoyed the beautiful garden, the sound of running water in the little pond, we watched bats fly through the trees at dusk, and we heard birds nesting and chirping in the thatch roof above our heads. As for the birds, they're loud. I don't think this is unique to Luna Blue, but since there is a garden with tons of trees, you also get tons of birds. BRING EARPLUGS if you want to sleep in quietly in the morning! You may also consider a sleep mask if you like it dark in the morning. Still, the sound of birds is a lot better than the sound of techno music and drunken tourists, which is what you'll get if you stay anywhere near the main part of the strip. Oh, and Luna Blue also has a few of its own local cats cutely sleeping at reception. The owners are cat lovers and are helping to support local strays. We loved it. The hotel staff were great. The maids came every day, but never before 11:00 a.m., cleaned the place well, and left fun and lovely sculptures made of clean towels on our bed. Edgar at the front desk was extremely helpful and sent us in the right direction for good cheap food, good cheap international calling, and just about everything else we asked him about. The other front desk man was not quite as helpful - he didn't speak English as well and he didn't know any of the places we asked him about - but Edgar was at the front desk most of the time. With your stay at Luna Blue you get two-for-one margaritas at the Luna Blue bar and free access (including chairs and umbrellas) to two nearby beaches. One beach - Mamitas, I believe, is right near the hotel, and is lovely. However, on the weekends you must get there before 10:00 a.m. if you want an umbrella. We did not, so we sat at the restaurant instead. We are too white for total sun exposure! We cannot recommend Luna Blue Hotel enough. The value, the location, the staff, the atmosphere - we couldn't have had a better experience. If you do take advantage of this great spot, let us recommend our favorite nearby eateries: Nativo (good, cheap, authentic, lots of vegetarian options), El Fogon (good, cheap, authentic, but you have to speak Spanish or have a good dictionary to order food here), La Cueva Del Chango (great atmosphere, decent prices, good-to-great food, vegetarian options), 100% Natural (decent prices, great food, tons of options, lots of vegetarian options), and Las Cazuelas De Espana (right across from Luna Blue, with one of the best Spanish Tortilla / omelets I've ever had). May we also recommend an amazing dive shop: Mexico Blue Dream, located a few short blocks from Luna Blue. Ask for Elliot, he's a great guide. OK, we hope you take our advice, avoid tourist pitfalls, and enjoy Luna Blue Hotel and Garden as much as we did!!!", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cJust as billed...a tropical garden paradise steps off 5th Ave...fantastic\u201d", "Author": "Cyclepei", "ReviewID": "UR55428320", "Content": "My sister and I stayed in a Garden View Deluxe room from Jan. 13-27, 2010. We did not want an all-inclusive resort and Luna Blue fit the bill perfectly. Our room had a kitchenette and we discovered the Mega store on 30th Ave. and stocked the fridge and freezer. The Mega has a fabulous bakery dept. and with the coffee maker in the room (we brought our own coffee) we had wonderful breakfasts each morning on our deck. The garden is beautiful and it is so peaceful it is hard to believe that the Luna Blue is just steps off 5th Ave. There were so many restaurants we wanted to try, but we ran out of time. Our favourite lunch was at La Route des Vines, just a block away. The best brushetta we had was at the little lasagna place around the corner on 10th Ave, and the best authentic Mexican we had was across the street from the Mega, next door to HC Monterrey Steak House (where we also had a fabulous steak dinner). Our room was very comfortable and exceptionally clean. There was plenty of hot water and water pressure in the shower. There is no phone, no TV, and no swimming pool. This suited us perfectly as we were on vacation and wanted none of the above. Apparently there is Internet access (but not in the rooms), but we did not need it as we left the laptop at home. Each day we were given vouchers for a beach chair each and a palapa umbrella for Mamita's Beach Club. We also took advantage of the beach towels available from the hotel for a $10 deposit. The beach was wonderful for swimming although we had a few windy days when it got a little rough. The highlight of our trip was taking the taxi and going to the Blu Cacao Beach Club. Mamita's was busy and quite crowded, but we virtually had the Blu Cacao to ourselves. Lying on a big beach bed staring out at the Caribbean Sea with a beach in front of us with no one on it - we had to pinch ourselves to make sure we were not dreaming. If you like peace and quiet this is the place to go. Food and drink a little more expensive than Mamita's, and of course there is the cost of the taxi, but well worth it in our opinion. There is live music at the bar about 4 nights a week. Sometimes we chose to enjoy the entertainment, but on nights we chose not to, we found that the sound of the air conditioner muffled it, and as it only lasted til 11 p.m. this was not an issue for us.

They had promised us for months that no amount of pics and talking could really make us understand the charm of Luna Blue, and they were right. We spent a week, and we felt like we were home within the first minutes of stepping through the gate. The wonderful staff at the desk (and I feel awful for forgetting his name!), greeted our taxis when we pulled up, and helped us with a quick check in and getting our luggage upstairs (that we brought way too much of! Thanks guys!). We stayed in room 9, the Treetop room and were immediately smiling when we saw the place. Bright colours, spotless, full water jug and a stunning view of the gardens (with real coconuts in the tree right off the balcony!). We had a full bath, complete with a huge tub where you could look out at the Caribbean sky while showering, yet had total privacy. The room was kept very clean and fresh the entire time, by the friendly cleaning staff that went about their jobs quietly (a problem we've had at lots of other places is housekeeping staff making a lot of noise in the wee hours). I saw maybe 2 ants the entire week and not a single flying critter...pretty good for a tiny jungle! Our bed was very comfy, and for what was supposed to be a smaller room, it was plenty big for the two of us. The front desk staff was great, and helped us with transportation and taught us what taxis should cost us, supplied us with fresh beach towels and helped us with our Spanish...always with a great attitude and a smile. Cheri told us about a great snorkeling spot that, in spite of all our research, had never heard of...and we were blown away! Her and Tony are great hosts! We were greeted and treated like family. And then there's the famous (infamous?) Jorge and the Luna Blue Bar. What can I say...sitting on a swing in that place, sipping a Sarita B Careful, listening to Jimmy Buffett quietly in the background while visiting with new and not so new friends was paradise in and of itself. We were fortunate enough to be there on a night where Mike Grabrow was performing, and had the time of our lives! A party that I'm sure won't be forgotten by anyone in attendance for a long time! But lest anyone be worried about the revelry going on too late...true to their words, we shut it down around 11ish and transformed back to a quiet little jungle. Jorge makes sure that everyone is happy and loving life as much as he does. We felt safe and totally taken care of during our stay. Gates are locked at night, with only guests having a key to the little \"mouse door\" to come in late and leave early. We would get up early, take a quick walk to Starbucks (yeah, I know. There's better coffee to be had. What can I say? I'm an addict.) and sit in the garden in the morning, planning our day and updating our Facebook pages to drive all our cold friends back home insane. The gorgeous beach is only a short walk away, and the Mamitas passes were well used during our trip (and it's a very cool beach club, btw....we loved it and we tried a lot of different ones during our stay!). 5th Ave is a block away fro shopping and great food and bars. There are only two things I would alert other folks about. There is some construction going on next door, but they seem to start pretty late (like after 9 or so). We only heard them once, when we had slept in (probably the day after the Mike Grabow concert), so you may wish to bring earplugs if you sleep late. We never did hear the construction while we were in the garden. It's just a part of PDC life right now. Also, as awesome as our room was, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with mobility issues. See, it's the Treetop Room...meaning it's up high, above the trees. That last flight of stairs was a beast some nights, seeing as we are actually older than we think we are. But there are plenty of ground level rooms that we can't wait to try next time! All in all...I would say we liked it. :-) Tony and Cheri have a great, simple little place that allows you to rediscover yourself. You may not have a 5 star buffet at your beck and call...but your soul will be fed. And in my opinion, that's the most important meal.

As we approached the front desk, Hieme slowly got up front the back room and made his way to us. After a moment of looking at us, he asked \"Yes??\" As if two people coming in off the street with suitcases wasn't a tip-off. A simple Hello, or Hola, or maybe even a Welcome would have gone a long way. I told him we were here to check in and he proceeded to find our keys and show us our room in a very uninterested manner. I thought maybe he was having a bad night and gave him the benefit of doubt. The next day and basically the whole week was more of the same. In general the staff seemed kind of burnt out and it felt like you were bugging them to ask a question or get your beach passes. The one rare time when the owner Tony was around, Hiemi perked up a little and made some dinner recommendations. The maid service was very nice and kept the rooms very clean. We also thought Mike was fun and his live music was good. Also, Rick and his dog Lenny were great. In general we liked the place and would even like to come back if the vibe from the staff improved.

It was a wonderful experience and we were so glad we found the Luna Blue on this site. Location - It's on a quiet street just off 5th avenue so we were close to all the action (restaurants, bars, shopping, beach) but away from all the noise. Totally safe area. We always felt comfortable. Perfect spot to be for a home base for the week. It really did feel like our tropical home. Management and Staff - The owners are from the U.S and introduced themselves to us. We liked the personal touch and had never had that happen in our past traveling experiences. They were very helpful about directing us to places we wanted to see. The staff that work for them at the hotel are a dedicated group and friendly. Room - We had a Tropical Hideaway room on the first floor. Our balcony was spacious and we spent many romantic evenings by candle light sitting and enjoying a drink while viewing the wonderful garden. We could hear the waterfall in the distance and we felt like we had found paradise in Playa Del Carmen. Often we chatted with our neighbors who have been to the hotel multiple times. We can see why they keep returning! The room was bigger than I imagined and had lots of natural light. It was always clean and we enjoyed the natural decor of wooden towel racks and a rope type toilet paper holder. They even had luxury toilet paper we have not seen even in a 5 star hotel. Nice touch. Great big shower and irregular shape with cool tiles and it had good water pressure with nice hot water when ever we used it. Towels were plush and big and the bedding was comfortable. We used the water cooler and fridge and kept snacks and drinks in our room that we purchased from the store across the road or the big Mega grocery store a few blocks away. We had no trouble making ice for our drinks too. It was a good size and held large tall bottles on wine etc. Just remember to bring your own plastic cups or what ever you need to eat off or drink in. The maid did a great job keeping the room clean. Air conditioning ran perfectly and there was a ceiling fan too. You can open the windows too if you want when the air is off. We hardly used the air conditioner. It had a remote that worked quite well. We were so glad there was no T.V or phone. There was a digital clock on the bedside table. We did use our laptop computer and made use of the free WiFi. No problems with connection as long as we stayed near the deck but our room was near the lobby. We had no bugs in our room. We did have the odd mosquito that flew in when we left our door open but keep in mind it is a garden setting and we only saw 2 the whole week and they are very small. If you want to see big mosquitoes then come to cottage country in the Muskoka area of Ontario, Canada and I'll show you mossies that could consume a large cat. I have no idea why someone would complain about mossies at Luna Blue. Take it from someone who has traveled a lot...there is no problem at this hotel with insects that would bother you here. Hotel Layout and Grounds - This place looks so much nicer in real life than in the photos. It is a whole experience of sound, colour, texture and beauty. All the rooms seem to view towards the garden setting. The bar and lobby are all facing this area too. Everything is so convenient and handy. We loved hearing the birds in the morning singing outside in the garden. We also enjoyed listening to the live music that played a couple of nights. The music ended sharply at eleven. The bar has a regular crowd but they are all gone by 11 too. You will get a good nights sleep here so no worries. Value - we are always looking for spots that have the best value for our hard earned dollars. We searched Playa for another place that might have better value for what is important to us and had no luck. I am torn about telling people that this is the best deal in Playa because I want there to be a room available for us next time we go and it is not sold out because I am telling others about it. One of the reasons they can offer the price as low as they do is because they don't go through large booking sites. You deal directly with them so it cuts out the middle man. I like that. They also give you free beach passes for Blucacao (absolutely gorgeous quiet but chic experience) and Mamitias (hip place but was busy the holiday week we were there). We heard that Wicky's beach club was being added too. The beaches in Playa just got re-done and the photos we have seen this past week look amazing so hit the beach for sure! All in all we were thrilled to have Luna Blue as our first non-all inclusive hotel. We loved the flexibility to do what we wanted, when and where to go. We took collectivos (local buses) to our day trip spots - Akumal, Tulum and Xpu-Ha. We had bought maps from mapchick.com and had no trouble getting around. The hotel has maps too. We loved eating out at local restaurants within walking distance of Luna Blue such as Babes Noodle House (big portions and tasty) , Vagabunda and La Cueva Del Chango (breakfast places), Fusion (great romantic beach front low tables and chairs in the sand dinner and chilling music) , Sur (elegant and to die for chocolate bomb desert) , Wicky's (brand new place on the beach and very nice) , El Bistro (lovely romantic setting but good prices) , Au Cacao (chocolate treats and coffee). We also treated ourselves by cab ride to Al Ceilo restaurant at Xpu-Ha beach and had the tastiest food with the best sunset view. Pricey but good. We figured we spent about $100 a day on everything for the two of us (drinks, groceries, restaurant meals, taxes and tips) We ate well and felt this was very good value. We loved not having to do the big buffets and waiting in long line-ups for al a cart reservations at the big all inclusives. Eating out on our own in Playa was a real treat. We used the forum to ask questions about our trip and everyone on that forum was so helpful. Thanks especially to Oldtraveler, Candylady and Coloradowanderer who gave us endless amounts of advice. I encourage everyone to take the time and ask questions before your trip to prepare and know what you are getting into first.

It is close to everything you want to do in Playa. The best part of the trips were the Owners and the staff. They arranged for rental cars, their restaurant recommendations were spot-on, their advice of what to do and where to go were very helpful. The people were simply great.

On occassion, we like to get away from the daily grind, put the kids with my mother-in-law and spend a night or two in a local hotel. Recently, we decided to really unwind and spend some time at the Luna Blue. We are very familiar with the Blue, having spent a lot of time at the bar, during one of Tony and Cheri's many charity events, but never stayed the night. We had always wanted to and the price was within our budget. In the past, we have spent weekends in Barcelo Maya, Iberostar Linda, and other AIs, but wanted to do the a la carte version of tourist, this time. Our room was awesome, as the view was pure color. The flowers and garden/jungle atmosphere provided the perfect setting to just sit and be comfortable. No disturbances, other than the sounds of birds and the little waterfall. After a bit, we went down to the bar and had a couple of sodas, and chatted with Jorge. Then, it was off to dinner at the Italian place, around the corner, on 5th (Atica?), which was awesome. When we returned, Tony and Cheri were there, so we chatted a bit and then headed up to enjoy some more alone time. Comfortable bed, I might add. ;) Woke up early, strolled over to Oxxo for some coffee and then sat around just taking it all in. Wife woke up and we went to La Vagabundo for breakfast. Later, we hit the beach (we had passes included with the room) and enjoyed the beautiful sea. Living here is not like vacationing here. However, we make a point of being \"tourists\" every once in a while and the Luna Blue is now at the top of the list of places to stay.

When discussing this hotel with people, I usually say that if you are the type that likes to stay at your hotel and just lounge in your room or by the pool all day, this hotel is not for you, as there is no pool and the rooms are basic. But, if you are that type of person, you should probably be looking at Cancun or one of Playa's big resorts.

We were assigned to a room right by the street and by the door which is used for guests who returned to the hotel after 11pm. Tried to move to another room, and was rejected. So we had to stick to that room. The room was left in a state of bare minimal. There's no TV, no dresser, no place to put your stuff other than on the tiled floor which gives you a sense as if you're sleeping in a bathroom. In addition, there's no decor to speak of, which only makes a comparison with hostels appropriate. But honestly, we've stayed at hostels in Yucatan during previous days which are much better than Luna Blue. The most terrible thing about the place is that the room was filled with mosquitoes, and even after we killed quite a few, we still got bit over the night. We were trying to turn down the room temperature and make it drier so that mosquitoes won't bite as fiercely, but the Mexican guy at the front desk was very reluctant to give us the remote. Yes, there's no remote in the room and you can get one only if you ask. The problem, as it turned out, was that one of the windows was loose and there was a huge gap for the mosquitoes to come in. Terrible management, is the only reason we can think of. So, if you're looking for some place that will give you a feeling that you're camping indoors, this is the place.

We stayed in one of the rooftop rooms (so probably furthest away from the bar) and still had to use ear plugs to sleep. It's great that there's live music but it's a little too noisy if you've chosen to have a quiet/early night. I would have found it helpful to have seen this advertised in the reception area to help us plan our evenings better (we didn't know until it was too late, and we didn't want to spoil the enjoyment of others who were sat at the bar by asking for the music to be turned down - then it took us by surprise and happened again the following night - by chance, we found out there was live music again later in the week). It's just worth mentioning that we are in our early 30s (just in case anyone thinks we are grumpy pensioners) and did enjoy spending our last evening at the bar, listening to the music (though song choice could have been a little more international i.e British/European) and sitting amongst the locals and other guests. However, I think the music level either needs to be turned down a notch, or guests should be advised to bring ear plugs if they plan to be in their room before 11pm.

The hotel sign in front that quotes a review from a seasoned travel writer which stated, \"The Luna Blue has that 'Lost In Time Quality' not found in many Modern Resort Destinations\" really rang true for us. We had been long time All-Inclusive travelers to the area but we each had never felt so relaxed and at ease so quickly as we had upon our first day at the Luna Blue. We always feel as if we're mere steps from The Happening Crowd of 5th Avenue, yet when we step into the Garden Courtyard area and hear the sound of the waterfall, and the rustling of the palm fronds and leaves of the canopy overhead, we feel welcomed and enveloped by the inner atrium of the heart of the hotel. For amenities, we've enjoyed the Kitchennette rooms, the Treetop Terrace Rooms, and others. The Free water for refills to water bottles, coffee, etc AND the Free beach passes and towels are always a plus. the rooms are airy and nice and we always find plenty of storage space. The Hotel is kept up with new paint, and cleaned inside and out every day. The staff has changed some, but the quality of our care continues. For location, a walk of but a few minutes and we're at the water's edge. Plus, we're in the North end of Playa which we prefer. This end continues to develop and has an equal amount of great restaurants, coffee shops, specialty stores, convenience stores,bars and shopping. Also, there's a nice clinic right behind the Hotel and the personal MD of the owners for Hotel guests is always just a call away. The staff and owners have always been there to give advice on daytrips, places to eat and to arrange transportation. The addition of the bar, live music on occasion and special event nights is a noted addition to our Mexico experience. We like the idea of familiarity. We travel to the area to relax and knowing what to expect helps us achieve that end much more quickly. The Value of the Hotel in our estimation is hard to beat. Besides, we just have come to appreciate the Chill Vibe and Atmosphere the Hotel gives. This brings me to this last statement. In almost every season since out first few stays we have met those fortunate travelers who come to the Playa del Carmen area several times per year. They could stay anywhere but choose the Luna Blue again and again. Often times using the hotel as their PdC base for their daytrips to Tulum, Belize, Majuahal, or the ruins or what-have-you...and sometimes they may actually stay somewhere overnight and still leave their room at the Luna Blue for when they return to PdC from an overnight jaunt elsewhere up and down the coast. We've met these folks who come from other North American homes, to European couples, from the UK, etc - several times, These are couples who value their time and money and choose to stay at the Luna Blue each time (given availability and occupancy). In fact one of these Canadian couples on our trip told us they come down every few months and always book their next stay before they return to Canada. This fact, and meeting these folks often depending on the time of year, on the front or back end of our stays has also become something we look forward to. Wondering if we'll see someone at the Hotel we've seen at other times before. That fact, that people have chosen to stay over and over again at The Luna Blue...people with a few hundred choices on places to stay, each within a few dollars of each other, each with similar amenities, etc - keep booking return stays here spoke volumes to us as we considered similar options. Choosing Playa del Carmen and the Luna Blue as our hotel is one of the smarter travel decisions we've ever made in 30 years traveling together. we would suggest you do the same.

If we weren't going to Playa for the wedding we weren't really that interested in going to Playa, but we had a credit at the Luna Blue and an airline credit so we figured we should go. The only other time we could go was August, which is a big part of why we didn't love Playa. We aren't really intense heat people, and boy was it hot (and humid) while we were there. We also didn't care for the very touristy Fifth Avenue scene with the aggressive sales people, and we also found the beach to be very crowded, even in the off-season. The best part of the trip was definitely staying at the Luna Blue (oh, and also snorkeling with sea turtles in Akumal which was amazing). Luna Blue is very cute and has a lot of character. Our room was very clean and very comfortable. The furnishings and decorations are unique and attractive. We loved having the air conditioning, so despite the heat we slept great. It was also very nice to have the bottled water provided. We had a really interesting shower in our bathroom and enjoyed the balcony off the room. The garden in Luna Blue is beautiful and relaxing and I loved seeing the cats find interesting little spots to relax. The staff was very nice and helpful. One person recommended a restaurant called La Cueva del Chango, which was amazing. We ate there for dinner and breakfast. Definitely the best food we had in Playa. The location of Luna Blue was also really great. It was as short walk to the beach club, a short walk to Fifth Avenue, but also in a quiet area. (I actually found Playa on a whole very easy to get around. We were able to walk every where we wanted to go, had no problems finding the places we were looking for, and when we did opt to take a cab it was very affordable.) And mostly we loved the bar and the bartender, Jorge. We went to a few other bars in Playa, but everywhere we went seemed overpriced and/or too touristy. The bar at Luna was perfect.... laid back atmosphere, great swing seats, great drinks, and great conversation with other guests and also with locals. Loved the Jimmy Buffet music, although after four nights at that bar it was getting old. But spending our evenings at that bar was great. So for anyone traveling to Playa who doesn't want the big resort experience, I highly recommend Luna Blue. I also have a couple other trip recommendations. We took the ADO bus from the airport to the Playa bus station and found that to be very easy to do and a lot less expensive than a shuttle. From the bus station it was an easy walk to Luna Blue, although on our way home we took a cab to the bus station to avoid some of the heat, and it was also a really cheap cab ride. We enjoyed Akumal and I definitely suggest taking a collectivo van down to Akumal and just going to a dive shop to rent gear. There was no need to pay for a tour because it was really easy to do ourselves.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "red bank, nj", "Title": "\u201c\"Always Good to Look for the Positive\"\u201d", "Author": "whaleboat", "ReviewID": "UR46623832", "Content": "The Positive, well I really liked the complimentry drink upon registering, perhaps if the bar was opened I might have even enjoyed it.

I felt the location was ideal, as many other reviews here state. The room was clean, the courtyard and bar were nice (and beer was 20 pesos, vs 34-40 anywhere on 5th Ave). Tony, Cheri and the rest of the staff were friendly and helpful. We met a lot of great folks at the Luna Blue bar as well. I'm not really sure what else to add; we were looking a nice place to stay that was easy on the budget. We stayed eight nights and got each fourth night free, as currently advertised on their website. Lack of a television was a plus in my opinion (even more so next time should we take our daughter, although she might not agree). In contrast to others reviews, when we left a deposit for towels, we got our money back when we returned them. Yes, we had to ask for passes to Mamita's; not sure why that would surprise anyone. For Bluecacao, you just needed to present Luna Blue's business card and tell them you were staying there. Much less crowded than Mamita's, 100 pesos via taxi, and we walked back each time (about an hour). Mamita's staff didn't make us feel unwelcome at all, but perhaps that's because we had breakfast there before hitting the beach. We were sorry we waited until the end of our stay was near before following Tony's advice on dining (La Pesca, if I remember correctly, when we asked for a good seafood place). That turned out to be the best meal we had during our entire stay at much better prices than you could find on 5th Ave. They also directed us to Mexican Blue Dream when we inquired about dive shops, whom you can also read about on tripadvisor. On the (minimal) downside, getting a hot shower was generally a crapshoot, but showering in the afternoon or evening after being outside most of the day instead of each morning after sleeping in the AC made it bearable. Interestingly enough, we were only awakened in the morning by construction on Saturday. There was quite a bit of construction going on in the general vicinity of 5th Ave., so I doubt Luna Blue is the only hotel affected by noise. Other than that, we were undisturbed by noise from 5th Ave., or even the Luna Blue bar. It would have been nice if I could have accessed the internet from inside our room, but stepping out into the courtyard was really no big deal.

We chose to stay at Luna Blue because we wanted something more private and unique than a big, fancy hotel could offer. We stayed for a week at Luna Blue before going to some other areas and hotel, and, unfortunately, it ended up being a week of our vacation that we wish we could go back and change. We loved Playa and really enjoyed all the experiences in the Mayan Riviera, however our experience at Luna Blue was difficult and not quite relaxing. We don't like complaining, but we feel that if someone else is headed to this hotel believing they will get a relaxing vacation it is our responsibility to share our experience. We really liked the \"ambiance\" and cute rooms of Luna Blue and the staff were truly very helpful in planning adventures or where to eat. However, twice during our stay the electricity went out (including the AC), which I understand was not something that the hotel had control over, but we were forced to go find a restaurant or bar where we could at least get cold drinks. Perhaps we would have felt better if those at the hotel had offered us some ice water or cold drinks, but instead we had to trek around looking for a place with either AC or something cold to drink each time. While the expense was not a lot, it was very inconvienient and uncomfortable. Another thing that was really too bad was the banging construction that started at 8:00 AM everyday directly outside the front door to our room (I'm talking ten feet!). This made our \"private\" patio not so private and our mornings not so peaceful. When we mentioned the noise to a worker one day he apologized. Then, later we were told by another worker that there was no one else staying in our entire building. It's unfortunate that the simple solution of switching us to a (cheaper) room that was quieter was not offered. Also, one day only boiling hot water was coming out of the shower and sink-- which was impossible to bathe in. Apparently there was a malfunction with the hot water heater. One of the workers came up and told us he would get it fixed the next day. So, again, we found ourselves too hot, but this time we couldn't clean the sweat and sand off our bodies. At the end of our week the owner asked us if we enjoyed our stay. We answered honestly. He only offered an apology and a free nights stay the next time we come visit, which will be never. We felt that some sort of financial compensation would have been appropriate, since refunds were not offered at any point during our stay. We are not picky people and we are not the type of people who only stay at five-star resorts. We do not even need a phone or daily maid service. However, for the amount that we payed Luna Blue (which was only slightly less than many similar hotels with the same amenities) we felt that it was definitely not worth it. For only a bit more, we were able to stay another hotel in the Mayan Riviera with a beautiful private beach, consistently functional electrical and AC, a welcoming and accommodating staff, and a truly relaxing environment.

Prior to our making reservations at Luna Blue, I did extensive research on the hotel and the surrounding area, including reading every TripAdvisor review. In summary, we had a great time and the hotel was exactly what we expected. Before beginning this review, I again read every TripAdvisor review of the hotel with a Terrible (one star) or poor (two star) rating. With actual experience behind us, I wanted to attempt to understand why some reviewers would give the hotel such poor ratings. But, since our experience was unlike any of their stated experiences, my arriving at any definitive conclusions has proved to be difficult. My opinion (and it's only an opinion) is that they made assumptions because of a lack of research, and those assumptions proved to be incorrect. We were searching for a small, clean, reasonably quiet, reasonably priced hotel on or near 5th Avenue. Luna Blue met every one of these requirements and then some. We requested and received a Tropical Hideaway room and my wife's sister and her husband were in a Treetop Terrace room. Both rooms were exceptionally clean, with ceiling fans and air conditioners that cranked out COLD air, chests of drawers for our clothing, large bottles of purified water, and showers with ample hot water. We didn't have any odors or bugs in our rooms and each room had a balcony/terrace that overlooked the beautiful courtyard. When we arrived on a Tuesday, check-in was fast and efficient and the young man behind the desk was kind enough to carry our luggage up to our room, which was on the 2nd floor. I have some mobility issues and it would have been very difficult for me to get the luggage up there. We felt as if we had been there before because the photos on their web site are an exact match for the courtyard, bar, and rooms. After dropping our luggage in the rooms, we left the hotel to take a turn around the lively end of 5th Avenue. This took up most of the afternoon and, when we returned to the hotel, Jorge was already behind the bar. Of course, we had to stop and meet him and sample some of his too-strong (they really are) drinks. When we asked for a restaurant recommendation, he said that the little (and I do mean little) Spanish place across the street not only had very good food, they'd also deliver it to the bar. Jorge walked across the street and perused the menu, then came back and informed us of the specials, but he also said they'd cook anything we wanted. The meals averaged 75 pesos ($6 USD) and they were filling and delicious. In fact, the place made such a hit with us, we had our dinners at the Luna Blue bar 4 nights out of the 7 nights we were there. Jorge just added the cost of the meals to our bar tab and we'd pay him at the end of the night. Now, I know that some folks are probably wondering why we'd spend the majority of our evenings in Playa del Carmen at the hotel bar. We did our sightseeing and traveling during the day. A quiet evening at the bar, having a good meal and a few drinks, and conversing with Jorge, other hotel guests, and regulars who'd drop in for a drink, was an ideal way to spend our evenings. After eating our meal and after having a few more drinks, Jorge told us that Tuesdays and Fridays are music nights. So, we hung around the bar until Brad, Danny, and he-whose-name-I-can't-remember (two guitars and a sax) arrived and started playing. What a pleasant surprise! They were talented and they could play almost any type of music. Tony and Cheri showed up, so we had an opportunity to meet them. One of the things that impressed me about Tony was his concern for the noise level of the music. He went out in the street a number of times, to listen to the music out there and to insure that it wasn\u2019t loud enough to disturb the neighbors. The restaurants and clubs down the block didn't seem to share his concern. We were tired from traveling all day, so we didn't make it to the end of the show. We headed up to our room about 9:30 or so and, after showering, we laid in bed and talked about how nice it was to be able to lie there and listen to the music as we drifted off to sleep. This was sort of a working vacation for me, and it was imperative that I be able to send and receive emails on my laptop. I had some difficulty in getting my laptop configured properly, so Cheri made a special trip from their home one evening, to assist me. With her help, I was able to get the job done and I was a happy camper. She also took care of renting a car for us on the day that we went to Akumal bay and arranged for the rental company to deliver the car to the hotel and to pick it up when we returned. She and Tony seemed to be available whenever we needed them and they were always cordial and willing to help. I don\u2019t know what more could be expected of hotel owners. We spent one day at the Mamita Beach Club and one day at the Blue Cacao Beach Club. Neither was very crowded, but Blue Cacao was definitely our favorite. It's about 20 minutes away by taxi and well worth the 100 peso taxi ride. When we were there, all 10 guests (including the four of us) were staying at Luna Blue. It was peaceful and secluded, with an incredible beach. We thought it was a wonderful perk for such a small hotel. The hotel staff, including housekeeping, was friendly and efficient and was never intrusive. They were there when we needed them. Otherwise, they more or less stayed out of the way. So, let me see if I can sum it up\u2026\u2026A lovely hotel with a great bar, located in a wonderful, quiet area just off 5th Avenue, with clean rooms that were an excellent value, a friendly staff, and friendly, helpful owners.

Luna Blue is certainly that. It is beautiful, but not in the antiseptic, overly-manicured, Stepford manner of the big resorts. It has much more character, much more soul. The love with which it was constructed by it's owners' is palpable. The owners, Tony and Cheri, are very much a presence.

Luna Blue is a lovely hotel but I must agree with previous reviewers that for us, it was nothing overly special, especially when it came to the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. It was just, well, average. We also had a similar experience with the towels and beach club passes, and when we asked for a breakfast recommendation we were directed to one of the worst, cheeziest places for breakfasts we had on our entire trip (La Vagabunda?) Maybe we just ordered the wrong things! I also have to agree with the other reviewer about Mamita's, which was PACKED solid with no hope of an umbrella if you got there any time after 9 am, not to mention the grumpy wrist band dudes that sullenly took our passes as if we weren't really welcome there... We're glad we came to Playa del Carmen (although I doubt we would return) and I definitely recommend Luna Blue in terms of a clean, cute, funky little hotel. The beach club was an experience but in no way shape or form he kind of beach holiday that we were looking for!

We have really no criticisms of the Hotel except our room, though clean and cool, had no chairs to sit on, only the bed. As in many other reviews for all hotels, it seems that firms beds are the norm in Playa, as is the low pressure of the shower head.

The location is pretty good, close to 5th Ave. and short walk to Mamita's beach (the nicest in Playa) and Mega (for groceries). The hotel has a nice, lush courtyard, but no swimming pool. Room we stayed in (Garden view Deluxe) is pretty big, but sparsely furnished and the balcony is adjacent to the stairwell, so not very private. We paid 112USD/pn which in our opinion was a bit much for the mentioned room. Our room was kept very clean all the time. The hotel would be pretty quiet, but the whole time we stayed there, there was construction going on from 8am to 6pm 6 days a week, right next to our room. The hotel bar has a pretty loud music starting around 7 pm until 11pm few times a week, so on many days there was no peace and quiet from 8am till 11pm. The hotel staff and the owners are nice and helpful, but I would expect that from anyone working in hospitality industry. We took the ADO bus from Cancun airport, very cheap and great way to get to PDC. When we got outside the arrivals, there are many taxi and shuttle drivers offering a ride for over 80USD. There were many buses parked there, but non of them ADO and there wasn't really anyone to ask, unless you wanted to get hassled. We waited about 20 minutes and ADO bus pulled in the first stall to our relief. The bus dropped us off at PDC bus station right downtown, from there we took taxi to the hotel. The same way we got to the airport on our way back. We went for few trips. Xcaret (basic admission). We had a big breakfast and bought a meal at the \"beach\" cafe with a pop for about 30usd for both of us. The snorkeling is not that great in Xcaret and none in the underground river, so we didn't bother renting snorkeling equipment. We seen many people with it in the underground river, which we thought was funny as there is nothing to see under water there. We paid extra for the Sea Trek, it was a bit scary, but exiting at the same time, we enjoyed it. The night show was great, really liked it. Coba, cenote, mayan village. Coba is very interesting, got to climb the pyramid (very exiting) but VERY hot! Loved the swim in the cenote afterward. Mayan village was a visit to one family dwelling (very humbling experience). Cozumel. The ferry ride was VERY rough, many people felt uneasy afterward. The dock is right downtown with lots of same souvenir stores as in Playa and there are no nice beaches within walking distance. You either rent a scooter for a day (25usd) or take a taxi to a beach. Tulum and Akumal. My favorite. Took colectivo from PDC to Tulum and a tram from the highway to the ruins. The ruins are more complete then Coba and in a beautiful spot right next to the Caribbean Sea. Then we took colectivo to Akumal. The walk from highway to the beach is about 5 min. The beach is beautiful and snorkeling is great. All in all we had a great time in PDC. We have been to PVR, Mazatlan and Acapulco and PDC is our favorite so far.

Instead of posting all the great things about Playa and Luna Blue again-which are many! (see my review in 4/08) I am mentioning only new things we saw or did. *Went to Blue Cacao beach club at Tony's recommendation. Roughly a 180 peso(with tip) trip each way. We got a cab from Genaro who was willing to come pick us up at a specified time as the beach club is not by a main road. The beach club was sparsely filled almost all day (we went on a Tuesday) but the food/drinks were excellent. A relaxing day but as twenty somethings we prefer the bustle of Mamitas. *Don't bring food to Mamitas-if you do be discreet as they have guards that will have you throw it away. Normally we would not bring food but several days we had trouble getting attentive service from the staff. *Again, Il Paraiso is the most beautiful beach we have ever gone to and every visitor should make the trip to Tulum to see it. Take the collectivos from 2nd and get off at the ruins. You can then find a cab on the road parallel to the beach to take you to Il paraiso (3 bucks). The collectivos are easy and super affordable (4 dollars each way or so) so don't be shy. *The Luna Blue Bar concerts with Mike were great, he is a great singer and it was nice to not have to venture far to receive some entertainment. *Check out Fusion (6th street and the beach). You can have the most amazing fish right on the beach and listen to a Bob Marley cover band while watching the sun set. We were there our last three nights. *Don't go to Hemingways-we went both years and have found it to be extremely overpriced. Also, they attach the tip to the bill and are very pushy about it. I have no problem tipping well but it was a huge turn off for it to be demanded (esp when the service/food was mediocre). *La Vagabunda is always a good choice for breakfast *Take the ADO bus from the airport-its under 10 dollars. Don't worry about all the people asking if you need help, just keep walking saying no thanks and don't let anyone take your bag (a needless tip) *Our room was #33 (I believe). Last year we stayed in a standard room and thought an upgrade would be a nice treat. The room was spacious and we had a nice tucked away deck. The only thing about the room I would change would be the bathroom door oddly enough. The slat design blocked absolutely no noise-since we are a very easy going and open couple this actually generated many laughs but a more reserved couple might find it a little less private then they'd like.

The Luna Blue is a nice hotel - pretty basic you get what you paid for type of deal. We stayed in one of the treetop terrace's with a garden view. The room was pretty basic but nice. The bathroom - well the plumbing just sucks. For the toilet to flush at all you had to push down on the handle through the entire flushing process, there was no water pressure, and the water temp was very particular. We never complained about any of this, just took it with a grain of salt. At home we had crappy water pressure and bought this oxygenics shower head and oh my gosh it made a world of difference - so if Luna Blue is in the market for a little water pressure in the shower I'd recommend the oxygencis. Everyone at the hotel was helpful, we rarely ran into the owners, and the bar was a lot of fun. My only other comment about the hotel it self was that they have a lot of cats 3 big cats 5 kittens and I thought parts of the garden smelled like cat urine so we did not hang out in the garden area except coming and going. I'm not a cat urine expert but I grew up with cats and just think the cats are fine but the dirt should be changed in the garden area every so often with that many cats. We mostly hung out at Mamitas and went down one day to Blue Cocoa. They said at the desk it was a 5 mile walk along the beach, it's not. It took us an hour and we don't want on the beach at a 12 mph. Most the time we run at 10mph. But Blue Cocos is worth the walk. It's a little more expensive, but the service was 10x better than mamitas and there were fewer people.

Seconds, it's the staff -- of course the owners (Tony and Cheri) see to your every need. But it is the people that are there every day -- Jaime and Genaro at the desk and Jarge manning the bar -- that make it very special. Third, it's the rooms -- the Tree Top Terrace rooms are super (couldn't get one this year) and the other rooms are very nice. Although I haven't been inside one, according to someone staying in a Garden Nook room, they are quite small (as stated on the website). What to do: * Spend time at the bar with Jorge and Jimmy Buffett on Radio Margaritaville * Spend time at the beach (Mamita's is good, but Blue Cacao is SO worth the $10 taxi fare) * Shop * Eat. HC Monterrey has the best steaks in town -- Arracharra Nationale; El Fagon has the biggest meal for 2 people I have ever seen (or tried to eat); Playasia has great asian fusion food and seating in what feels like treehouses in an inside garden; Los Amigos has super tortas, and Xache has authentic Mayan dishes. But best of all is right across the street from the Luna Blue -- I can't remember the name, but It has a awning with a picture of a stack of pots (which is the name of the restaurant). The owner, Miguel, is from Spain and serves the greatest dishes (including tapas) which you can have delivered to the Luna Blue bar so you won't miss any of the exciting goings on.

We had a private bath with tub and shower, a private balcony with chairs and hammock (oh how I wish I could've taken this home), fridge, complimentary bottled water, and the comfiest bed I've had while on vacation! The rooms also have beautiful ornate tile floors and great a/c...and the maids keep them spotless everyday...what more can you ask for?! Also on the fourth floor is the rooftop deck which is available to all guests though I never saw one person up there other than us. The rest of the hotel and common areas are amazing as well. We loved the lush jungle garden in the center of the hotel and it proved a great place to just sit and relax and listen to the birds...you would never know you were in the city! The bar was one of our favourite places and we rarely went out elsewhere...why would we when Jorge and the staff kept the drinks flowing (and not sparing on the booze) and having fun on the 'swing' stools. We caught the live music twice while we were there and Mike Grabow was awesome! His laid back style was exactly our taste and made for the best entertainment we saw in Playa. We also caught Jimmy Buffett night and the 2 for 1 margaritas...be careful of these, as I said before Jorge doesn't spare on the tequila and these can creep up on you ;) I cannot say enough about the staff and the owners. Every single one of them (Tony & Cheri, the owners; Genero and Jaimie (sp?) on the front desk, Jorge at the bar, and all the maids and groundskeepers/security, etc.) went out of their way to make this the best stay possible. Genero got us great deals on taxis to Blue Cacao Beach Club (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), Xpu Ha Beach (again, highly recommended) and to Coba for the day (since we didn't have time to catch a normal 'tour')...he saved us so much money and time and did it all with a smile. Tony & Cheri always said hello and asked how we were doing, giving us tips and ideas of things to do and see...priceless information. We cannot understand how anyone who stays here has anything negative to say...either they didn't actually stay here or they're used to staying at the Ritz!

The larger room had a kitchem area, table, & free bottled water, which was a nice touch. Our only problem with this room was the noise. It overlooked the street, so if you like a quiet room, don't choose this one. Although the air con was noisy when on, we were woken in the middle of the night by people in the room below us moving furniture (on a tiled floor). As it contined, I went downstairs to complain, but the noise had now stopped, & all the lights were switched off. I mentioned it to the young guy on Reception the next day.

It is beyond tranquil here and you can even have a massage in the gardens under the trees! Our check in was effortless. Gennaro was so respectful and patient. He answered every question we had, and we had many! He walked us to our room and carried all of our luggage himself. Our room was SPOTLESS! It was the perfect size for my husband and and I loved the hand painted quote on the wall as well the painting above our bed. Linens were clean, soft and pretty. Our maid gave us towel art everyday and I was excited each day when we returned from the beach to see what she had done! We had the treetop terrace room (#36) and it had a very large balcony with a cocktail table, 4 chairs and a hammock. It was a perfect setting high above the trees with birds chirping and trees and flowers surrounding the balcony. We enjoyed this space every day after the beach for a snack and a few cocktails and every night after our return from an awesome night of dining and fun, for a night cap. The location of Luna Blue couldn't be in a more perfect spot. The upper 20's of Fifth Avenue is a little more quiet and less congested than the southern section and it was refreshing not to have to navigate through all the people in the streets. I do enough of that in NYC! It is also considered Little Italy and had a couple of wonderful restauants right around the corner from the hotel. We even ventured further north towards 40th and the peacefulness of the streets. There is a convenience store on the corner of 10th and 26th where you could buy everything your need for your stay including ice, alcohol, snacks, lotions or anything you may have forgot while packing. As for the owners, Tony & Cheri, they were professional, accommodating, sweet, friendly and compassionite. Our original date to visit the Luna Blue had to be changed because of a health issue with my husband which required surgery and recovery right at the time we were suppose to go to Playa. They did everything they could to accommodate our changes and we are most grateful for that alone. They are hands on with everything and do their best to socialize with their guests as if they are family and not guests at all. I love this about them.

Your 1st night you should pull up to the swing bar for a great drink. You will get some great ideas from other travelers. By the end your your vacation you will be telling others what they need to check out in Playa. Playa has changed a lot over the years. It`s getting bigger every month.

We based our decision to stay at the Luna Blue on previous reviews and we were not at all disappointed. We found the grounds of the hotel beautiful and well kept -- a tropical jungle with a bar. Our room was clean and more minimalist in its decoration -- white and blue with Spanish arches. We had an endless supply of water, as promised. We opted for a room with a small refrigerator; we filled it up a couple of times by walking fifteen minutes away from the touristy part of Playa through more authentically Mexican neighborhoods to -- ironically -- the Wallmart. The hotel staff was friendly and courteous in every possible way; they changed our bathroom towels each day (even twisting them up to look like swans, if you're into that kind of thing) and gave us beach towels whenever we needed them; they kept our room immaculate. We had one bump in our trip -- I got sick -- and the hotel staff immediately directed me to a doctor a few blocks away. (He saw me almost immediately and I was better by the evening). They followed up to see how I was doing as well. The hotel is in a quieter stretch of Playa, a bit removed from most of the bars, so we never had too much noise and had no problems sleeping at any point. This is important if you go during high season and want to find a stretch of beach that is not overcrowded -- Luna Blue gives you free passes to Mamita's Beach Resort -- a beautiful beach with turquoise water -- but you have to get there early for a spot (with the palapa covering to protect you from the sun, which can get brutal). This means, at least for us, getting to bed not too late, to be up and at the beach by 8. Maybe this isn't the case at other times of the year -- not sure. One small detail -- the VIP discount card the hotel gave us was not honored at all Playa restaurants, contrary to what the card itself says.

The staff was extremely friendly... and I must personally thank Genero (front desk mgr.) and Jorge (bartender) for making our stay extra special. Genero would help us with all the little daily things... and Jorge took care of making all of our fantastic drinks - including those great shots of tequila he'd pour up. Here's some of the things we really enjoyed about this hotel: 1) swing bar... perfect little getaway to meet people from all over the world in a relaxed setting - and with the best bartender around; 2) use of beach chairs and a palapa at Mamita's Beach Club - which was located only a couple of blocks away; 3) each room had a small fridge to store whatever food and beverages you'd have on hand, along with a water cooler so you'd always have water whenever you needed it.

The bar itself is outside, and so much fun, BUT, if you're trying to turn in early, it doesn't close until 11 pm and can be very noisy. Also, they have live music in the bar every Tuesday night which was so enjoyable....but just keep it in mind", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland", "Title": "\u201c8 nights in paradise!\u201d", "Author": "leftlanne", "ReviewID": "UR25216838", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay at Luna Blue and intend to return again next year.

They also retain excellent, long term staff which is a plus in the hospitality industry. They were also very responsive in having the AC repaired in my unit in a timely manner when the compressor went out. The courtyard \"forest/garden\" area is in my opinion one of their biggest assets. It is an area of sanctuary and serenity outside of the usual street commotion. It can be a little warm due to the ocean breeze being cut off by a neighboring hotel, but it is very peaceful sitting in the dry cenote area watching the waterfall. You may also see at night, a family of oppossums which live in the garden. The small bar with swinging seats is a new addition the past year and is a nice place to wind down an evening and chat with fellow hotel room neighbors or others who live nearby and are having a drink.

This was our third straight November trip back to Playa after we honeymooned there. The previous two years we had stayed in the same condo on Calle 24 and 1st. We decided to switch to Luna Blue after not being as happy with the condo the 2nd time around. We chose it for the look of the hotel and lobby area, its location in Playa Norte, and the dead-on advice of the owners on their own blog, TA, and playa.info . In the interest of full disclosure, we had also met Tony and Cheri on our trip last year at a PeepMeet and thought they were great people whom we would want to give both our business and our company. Reviews of the Luna Blue tend to be overwhelmingly positive, with some \"I dont get the hype, \" and of course as with any place \"The worst experience we've ever had.\" I think it is key that travelers have realistic expectations and realize that what makes this place special is not for everybody. This is not an AI. The rooms are basic and there are no TV's. As a TV addict, I was surprised to find that this was a great thing for us. It was invigorating to break some entrenched habits! For you sports junkies, there are numerous restaurants and bars literally footsteps away for your NFL, soccer, college, hockey, basketball, etc. Plus, this is what DVR is for. If you need a hair dryer, bring it. My wife adjusted rapidly and my long flowing locks (haha) did not suffer. We had one of the rooftop terrace rooms with our own little patio/seating area as well as hammock. It was immaculate and cleaned on a daily basis with a different piece of towel art every day. There were no bugs in excess of what could be expected outside in Mexico. Our shower could have had a smidge more pressure, but not a big deal in the scheme of things especially since we were used to our Monstrostream shower head at home that takes a few layers of skin off each day. We had a minifridge and huge filtered water dispenser that is absolutely crucial to any Mexico trip. There was not a microwave in our room, but I believe they have some in their kitchen suite rooms. We didnt miss it. We tend to be out of the room for the most part on our vacations, so it perfectly fit our needs. It was nice to wake up each morning and sit on our patio. Wireless internet on the hotel's secured network is available, but remember you need to get the code so you can use it. We found it helpful to bring our laptop and would suggest it. If you are still awake (ZZZZZ boring), on to the fun stuff. In our opinion the lobby, seating areas, and Tiki bar really made our stay wonderful. Pretty much every night from 5pm onward you get an assortment of hotel guests and other travelers bellying up to grab a good swing. And I mean a REAL swing so get your mind out of the gutter. We met great folks from all over the US, Canada, Norway, Finland, and as far away as Israel. My wife still communicates with them frequently through Facebook, but I have yet to make the plunge as MySpace is offering a free bubba keg. It provided a comforting and fun place to start every night. You never knew who you would meet, but you could always have a good time. It was almost like being at the bar at a European Hostel mixed with Cheers. If you are an \"early to bed\" person, please be aware the bar closes promptly at 11pm. If you go to sleep earlier, there will be some noise from the bar, but the staff goes to lengths to keep the volume acceptable. If you need absolute silence at 9pm, this might not be the place for you. After 11pm, there are metal gates slid in to close off the Tiki and lobby area. To leave and return you are given a key for a door to the left. You are not \"locked in\" and it is a good security measure. I can not understate what a great location it is. It is a short half block to 5th and a 5 minute walk if that to some of the major beach clubs like Mamitas. You do get a coupon for Mamitas so use it. It is also a short walk to numerous excellent restaurants with more of a local flavor on Constituyeuntes and 30th not to mention the Walmart and Mega. It is in the trendier and less touristy Playa Norte where new places are always springing up. The \"Cruise Crowd\" does not make it up this far and if they did, they would not want to get back on the boat! Last but not at all least, the owners and staff were absolutely fantastic. The owners go out of their way to take care of their staff in numerous ways we witnessed first hand. This translates into the staff being incredibly responsive and invested in making a good experience for travelers. Jorge was the bartender and did an awesome job with giving advice, entertaining us, and helping our Spanglish. As an added bonus, if you like some volunteer/charity thrown in to your vacation, Luna Blue will from time to time host benefits for local causes. When we were there they had an art exhbition and sale to benefit the Peanut Pet Shelter, a no-kill shelter in Playa started by two great people from the UK. I would be happy to answer any and all questions you would have about Luna Blue. The strongest compliment I can give is that Lord willing we will be going back to stay there this coming November.

I usually stay at the same hotel which is located on the beach and near the center of town. This time, I really didn't want to deal with holiday crowds and decided to spend my time in the northern part of Playa. I selected the Luna Blue because its location and because some of my friends who stay here recommended it very highly. I have no complaints but only high praises for this hotel. I booked a standard room that was located on the first floor next to the side gate. This is the entrance that is used when the main gate is closed. When I saw this, I was a bit worried because I thought there would be a lot of traffic late at night. It was not bad at all. Another plus about this room is that you can get a strong signal for your wireless connection. I could stay in my room while I used my laptop. I just loved this! I think I got an excellent deal for the price I paid which was $70.00 USD for four nights. The room was cleaned on a daily basis, and the bed was comfortable. I also liked that there was a large dispenser of purified water in my room. I have to add that the room is very nicely decorated with Mexican rustic pine furniture, beautiful art, and fixtures. Another nice detail of the Luna Blue is that there is a small bar on the property. The prices of drinks are very reasonable, and Jorge makes some very tasty mixed drinks. It's nice to have a chance to have a drink before going out, or a nightcap after returning from dinner. The staff at the Luna Blue is excellent and they went out of their way to make my stay a very pleasant one. It is noteworthy to add that Jorge and Genaro are very patient because I always asking them a bunch of questions. On the second to the last day of my stay, I asked Genaro about a shop that sells silver. Instead of just giving me the name of a business, he walked me to the shop and introduced me to the owner. I thought this was very nice of him. The location is something else that I think makes the Luna Blue a great place. Nearby are several restaurants, coffee shops, and small bars. Across the street is a laundromat and a small store. If you need a larger selection of snacks, beer, and other things, around the corner is an OXXO convenience store.

We booked the hotel after reading reviews on Tripadvisor and I must say that we were not disappointed with our stay. The hotel is located in the quieter part of town, but still very close to good restaurants, shopping, and the beach. We walked everywhere we needed to go in town without any problems. The hotel is about two blocks from the beach, but it's not a bad walk at all and you avoid being situated near some loud clubs. The atmosphere in the hotel is very pleasant. Being built around a lush garden area, we enjoyed sitting in the lounge area and reading and relaxing when we didn't feel like heading out. The bar is also very nice and the atmosphere there is very pleasant. The bartender was friendly and locals and visitors to the town both enjoy the swing chairs and the Jimmy Buffet tunes. Very cool atmosphere. My husband and I are both 24 and while most of the guests at the Luna were older than us, I would recommend the hotel to anyone, the atmosphere is very chill for anyone looking to relax and enjoy town. We stayed in room 22, one of the \"tropical hideaway\" rooms. The room was very comfortable for two people with only a couple of exceptions. The bed could have been a little softer, it was pretty firm, but didn't kill us. Our only other complaint with the hotel at all is that the door to the bathroom is very thin and offers very little privacy. Otherwise, the multiple windows offered a beautiful view, the air conditioning worked great, we loved the layout of the bathroom and main room and the hotel staff was very quick to replace the fresh water they provide when we ran out. We also really enjoyed the beautiful towel displays the maids left every day! The Luna Blue \"isn't the ritz\" as one other guest so eloquently put it, there is no pool, no room service, but if you want a quiet place to stay that is clean, safe, comfortable, and friendly look no further! Let me also say a little bit about the concierge service. Genaro, who works during the day at the front desk, was absolutely invaluable to us during our stay. He helped us book tours, find restaurants, navigate in and out of town, and got us off the beaten path, something we really enjoyed! He was absolutely the best thing about the great experience we had at Luna.

We have never experienced something like this before. I was spooked out a little and was glad to leave the hotel at the end of the stay. We stayed at PDC for 5 nights in total, but only in Luna Blue for 3 nights as there weren't vacancies for other nights (it was the peak tourist season in PDC and most hotels only had the off day or two available). We wanted the standard room but unfortunately there weren't any available so we got room number 9 (I believe it is the treetop terrace a.k.a. the love nest). The room is all the way up on the top floor (4 flights of stairs) and is quite a big room with a terrace. As the room was above the trees on the hotel grounds, we could get enough sunlight in the room. To be fair to the owners, I'll start off with the good points - the location is good - it's on the quiet end of 5th Avenue, with walking distance to the nicer part of the beach. When we checked in, Cheri was there and she was happy to offer any advice on travelling to cenotes and other activities. The room itself, room number 9, was quite good sized with a big bathroom. There was a stair going down, but obviously this is not in use. I also liked the fact that water is provided in the room. All deco is blue (curtains, bedding) but hey, that is the name of the hotel. What I didn't fancy much was that the hotel grounds is generally quite dark as it has loads of trees and foliage. I couldn't see most of the hotel building, but i think that was the idea of the owners. If you want some sunlight then the rooms on higher floors is probably better. The rooms were just OK and I wouldn't regard them as being one of the nicer ones I've stayed in. Everything went ok for us until strange things happened at night. On the first night we were there, we slept very soundly as we travelled from Palenque by an overnight bus. On the second night, the alarm clock in the room went off at 12 midnight. Now this may sound minor and silly to complain about, and that there's nothing wrong with this, but the point is that we both made sure that the alarm clock was switched off from the night we arrived. It didn't ring the first night, and we thought maybe the cleaner might have accidentally switched it on. However, the bedside table (which the alarm clock was on) was not touched by the cleaner as we noticed our things strewn on it remained unmoved. Anyway, we could deal with an alarm clock going off - it's no big deal and we didn't think much of it later. On the third and final night, I was totally spooked out. We were both very tired and called it a night at around 1am. We were sleeping soundly when a light in the room switched on by itself. This was the light closest to the air-con, ie, the far left of the room, and the switch was on the same wall. My husband claimed that as he stirred from his sleep, he actually saw the lights came on and heard the switch click. He was pretty groggy at that point and didn't realise I was next to him, so he thought I had gone up to turn on the lights and asked me if I did so. I was next to him, of course, still fast asleep and when he asked me, I opened my eyes to see the lights on. Of course I didn't switch on the lights, and neither do we both sleepwalk! We kept asking each other if we actually switched off the lights before we went to bed, but of course we did - it was a bright wall light and we both cannot sleep with lights on, and have never left lights on at night. I have to admit I was pretty spooked out - I couldn't go back to sleep for the next hour and we tried to think of a logical explanation for this - we thought it might be an electrical fault, but I've never heard of an electrical fault causing lights to switch ON - it is more possible for an electrical fault to cause lights to go off (i'm happy for anyone to correct me on this, I'm no electrical guru!) I then recounted our first night and thought to myself that I was never comfortable from the time we went to sleep in the room. There were a number of noises in the room at night that just made me feel uncomfortable generally - fair enough there were the usual noises such as the expansion/contraction of furniture due to heat, the aircon and the fridge radiator. But then again I am just finding a logical explanation for everything. It's not just the noises that made me uncomfortable, it's just the general feeling and ambiant of the room (I have to say that the huge picture on the wall of a fierce-looking long-haired woman wasn't very calming). On check out, i informed the front desk staff about this - he seemed surprised and I asked him to check the room for any electrical fault, which he said he would. What I would like is an explanation - is there an electrical fault in the room? If not, how do you explain the lights switching on, on its own, in the middle of the night? My husband is a real cynic when it comes to certain matters, but even he could not think of a logical explanation. I read some of the reviews on tripadvisor, but could not, so far, find a comment on this. So what I'd say about the hotel is - yes, it is located in a good place, but having stayed at two other hotels in PDC, I preferred the Hotel Villa Del Mar, which was cheaper and had much nicer rooms (and bright and airy grounds).", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "truro,nova scotia", "Title": "\u201cenjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "grandmarnia", "ReviewID": "UR23388710", "Content": "enjoyed our stay and the friendly staff were more than willing to help in any way possible. the rooms were clean and cheerful. desk personal arranged trransportation for any outside trips as well as to the airport when leaving....always with a smile. the bar is a drawing card for everyone and all are made to feel part of a larger family while enjoying a friendly sip. a great beach is close by and the water inviting. the temps even in november are beach worthy. would recommend this hotel and Playa del Carmen without reservation. walks down 5th avenue each evening to find a great place to eat and then to help walk off the extra pounds are a great way to end each day. as one couple had a room with a kitchen unit, we ate breakfast and lunch on site but went out each evening for dinner.....best of both worlds!", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oregon", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Luna Blue\u201d", "Author": "cavermotif", "ReviewID": "UR23379027", "Content": "I stayed at the Luna Blue just before Christmas.

We were looking for a smaller hotel with great service and that's what we found at the Luna Blue Hotel. Our trip started with renting a car in Cancun and driving to Playa Del Carmen. This was an adventure all on it's own. Before we even got to the hotel we got lost and then stuck in a trench on the side of the road. Ok, so we got an early education in driving the streets of Playa del Carmen. Thank goodness for us the police and people are so friendly in Playa. We were ultimately pushed out of the trench by a police officer and two people off the street. After that ordeal we finally arrived at the Luna Blue....exhausted and hungry. As soon as we arrived Maurice saw the look on our face and said it looked like we needed an upgrade. This was unexpected and very nice after a very long travel day. From that moment forward we continued to experience the same great, friendly service during our entire stay. The hotel doesn't look like much from the street.....it is fairly decieving. Inside the gates though is a tropical oasis....pictures do not do it justice at all. The swing bar that's at the entrance is one of the best bars in Playa. Jorge is a riot and definitely made our stay memorable. We had a blast meeting other hotel guests and all the locals that frequent the bar. Overall, the Luna Blue is a great hotel for the money. The service and staff are outstanding....I must admit the staff there are far better than many 5 star hotels I have ever stayed at. If you are looking for a great budget hotel....this one can't be beat. Although we had a great time at the Luna, I must be fair and point out the negatives. There were very few. The Luna Blue is at the far end of 5th Ave. It is close to the beach, however, if you like to go dancing or to many of the hot spots...it's a bit of a walk. We found ourselves walking back and forth quite a bit between hanging out at the swing bar and going to some late night bars since Luna Blue closes it's gates at 11pm. This was not a huge deal, but it might be to some so I thought I would mention it. The rooms at this hotel were nice, but the beds were very firm and made sleeping difficult and uncomfortable. Another thing about the rooms....there was no hair dryer or extra pillows kept in the room. I'm not sure if it was just our room, but I found it strange. If you ask at the front desk they are more than happy to supply these items for you. I just found it strange that they wouldn't already be in the rooms. Other than the very minor room issues I mentioned....the hotel is wonderful and it is the fun, friendly atmosphere at this hotel that made our stay so great.", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wayzata, MN", "Title": "\u201cDone searching for the perfect hotel in Mexico!\u201d", "Author": "PlayaOrBust0", "ReviewID": "UR22354616", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just returned from our best vacation yet in Playa del Carmen. It was our second time there and I spent A TON of time online trying to find the perfect hotel for us on a budget. Lucky for us, I stumbled across the Luna Blue! I almost didn't want to write a review about it because it's one of those things that's so amazing, you just want to keep to yourself! 2 blocks from the best beach in Playa and right of Quinta (5th Avenue - the hotspot for locals and tourists alike), this hotel was in a word - PERFECT! We booked a \"standard\" room off of their website. It included a full bed and a twin, along with a bathroom, air conditioner, AND a water cooler - which saved us a ton of money on purified water! The hotel is clean, friendly, charming, beautiful, wonderful... it was an all around perfect stay! Notice that there aren't any TV's in ANY of the rooms but my theory is, if you want to watch TV on your vacation, just stay home! The hotel also has the best bar in Playa, in our opinion, with a fantastic bartender named Jorge who provided laughs, songs, and the best margarita's you'll ever find. We spend almost every night here because the bar itself attracts the \"right\" people: locals, foreign locals, and everyone else at the hotel. Of all the people we met, one absolutely LOVED \"all-inclusive\" hotels and had stated after staying here, she would never go back! The owners: well I can't say enough about them! Toni is probably the nicest guy you'll ever meet! Both him and Cheri give you the insider's tips on where to go, what to see, how to get there and anything else you want to know about Playa, Mexico, you name it! A few tips on travelling to Playa on a budget: 1.) From the airport, don't take a taxi or a tourist bus. The ADO (city bus) takes travelers and locals alike to and from the airport. It only costs $8, it's just as nice as the $20 buses to Playa and makes less stops! We even bought our return ticket ahead of time when we arrived in Playa at the station. 2.) Don't eat on Quinta! It's pretty much \"American\" prices everywhere on 5th. Check out 30th which is a few blocks North of 5th and runs parallel to it. Our favorite was \"Los Amigos\" which was never busy and super cheap! Try the \"Tacos al Pastor\" - it's a local tradition, so cheap (Less than $2 American for 5 tacos), and is sooooo good! They also have beers for $1.80; it's hard to beat these prices! Plus, the owners of Los Amigos were always there so even if you don't speak Spanish, this is a great place to go! 3.) Take the collectivos to Akumal Bay. Collectivos are basically vans on 2nd and 20th that leave when they're full to a destination. It costs less than $3 dollars to go to Akumal where you can bring your own snorkel gear or rent it and see real, live sea turtles! This was the highlight of our trip and cost practically nothing! We swam out by ourselves and got to experience these awesome turtles. If you can't find them, there will be groups in the bay populating around the turtles. 4.) To save money on the beach, we'd bring our own chips and salsa in a bag and just order beers. We also went to a supermarket to get pre-toasted toast for breakfast and other snacks so we only ate one real meal a day which saved us a ton of money and we never went hungry! Overall, the Luna Blue made our entire trip because we could afford everything else while staying in what felt like a 5-star hotel with built in neighbors and friends. The day we left, we felt like we were leaving home! So give the Luna Blue a try your next time around... you will love it! Thanks Toni and Cheri and Jorge!

We have been home only one day and I'm already wondering when we can get back. From the very moment of our arrival until our last good-byes, we were treated like royalty and -- without a doubt -- thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Playa del Carmen's most charming boutique hotel. Unlike last year when we stayed in the Treetop Terrace, we opted for a Superior room and spent seven lovely nights in room #35. There is no phone and no television, but there is plenty of cool air, hot water and one heck of a view. The number one goal of our vacation was not only to celebrate my birthday, but it was also to relax, to reconnect and to simply spend a romantic week together. Room #35 is on the second floor of the hotel with a lovely garden view. Upon entering the room you immediately feel as if you are at home. There is a ceiling fan, an A/C, a mini-fridge and bottled water. The room's shower offered plenty of hot water and there never was an issue with water pressure. The maids came daily to clean -- always leaving behind towel art creations. There is no pool, but the beautiful beach is just a couple blocks away and hotel guests receive free passes for Mamitas Beach Club. We spent a lot of time on our patio...we had two chairs and a small table and our patio was actually connected to the room next door (it was separated by a small, wooden wall). From our patio we could hear the water splashing around in the hotel's water feature and we could also see the hotel's new swing bar. While we could still hear some light construction noise during the day, the sounds of the birds and the chirps of the geckos immediately transported you away from the hustle and bustle. At night, the hotel grounds were quiet and peaceful. Like I stated earlier, the hotel has a new swing bar and we enjoyed many nights at the bar. It was quite nice being able to enjoy cold beers & Micheladas, Sarita B Careful's, Beso Cubano's, Cheri's Favorite Margarita's and different tequilas just steps away from our hotel room. The company at the bar was always good and Jorge took great care of us from the very moment we sat down at the bar until our very last drink at the bar before our trip home. Immediately at 11pm, Mario, the night watchman made sure the hotel was safe & secure. Genaro and Jaime made sure that we had anything we needed and helped us with getting a rental car and also arranging for transportation to the airport on our last day. The Luna Blue is truly a gem hidden in Playa del Carmen. My husband and I cannot picture ourselves staying anywhere else simply because we adore the hotel and we adore Tony & Cheri, Genaro, Jaime, Mario, Jorge and all of the hotel staff. The hotel is clean, safe, quiet and offers it's guests such a relaxing and stress-free vacation. And, on a side note, if you're staying at the Luna Blue it is a MUST that you pay a visit to Miguel and his lovely wife at Las Cazuelas which is right across the street from the hotel. My husband and I enjoyed many breakfasts there as well as some fabulous tapas and also the most wonderful birthday dinner I have ever had. You will not be disappointed. So, if you're looking for a romatic getaway or if you just need to unwind and de-stress, be sure to give Tony & Cheri a call or send them an email and book your stay at the Luna Blue.

My first night I had to stay around the corner at the Aventura Mexicana. Day 2 I moved to the Luna Blue for 3 nights in one of the 2 kitchen units. The room was very spacious and clean, a little rustic. You could easily sleep 3 people in that room. Benefits included the passes to Mamitas beach club, which offer you free chairs and umbrellas. Otherwise the hotel had no amenities to speak of. Staff were friendly and accomodating, maids lovely and location good proximity to everything including the beach. I wasn't overly impressed with the kitchen contents. No kettle and the utensils looked like they had been pieced together from a garage sale for lack of a better word. It felt a bit poorly outfitted. Only one frying pan,2 pots, nothing to use for the oven. One cloth, one sponge. At close to $100 per night, I expected a little bit more. My challenge was with the cockroaches. Woke up in the middle of the night to see one crawling across the kitchen counter. The next day the staff sprayed my room. That day I found 3 dead cockroaches in various places around the room. Someone who was in my room that day actually left the door unlocked. When I mentioned this out to the front desk they said it was probably the maid. Don't think that was true. This is something that I think the staff should be very careful with \u2013no questions asked. I couldn\u2019t stomach a 4th day thinking about the roaches, so I asked for my money to be returned for the last night that I had to pre-pay when I arrived. The manager called the owners who did refund it in a very timely fashion. I noticed a lot of spraying after I reported the roaches. They were spraying the 2 kitchens and also the foliage around the property. I was a little disappointed that although the manager insisted he wanted me to be happy, I felt that he found the situation a little humorous. The reason I say this is; I was clearly not happy, wanted to leave and when I came to see if the owners had agreed to give me my money back if I checked out 1 day early he wanted me to \u201cguess what they said\u201d. Not in good taste considering the situation. I want to be clear that this is my 11th trip to a southern destination, and I am very well traveled -from Australia to Morocco- staying everywhere from hostels to pensions 2 star to 5 star. I know what I am signing up for and what I am getting for my money. I believe that small changes can make this property worth the money you spend for it but no one will truly know that unless they have seen what else there is in the area at the same price range. I will return to Playa because I loved the town and therefore I popped into half a dozen similar small hotels all roughly around the same price ( including the fact that I stayed at the Aventura Mexicana for 2 nights). Only then did I realize that although the Luna is comfortable enough and in a good location with friendly staff, there are many many hotels, which are exactly the same and offer many more amenities for exactly the same price. Almost all of them served a continental breakfast, had refrigerators, tv\u2019s, internet, beach towels, and free or discount passes to beach clubs.

It would have been fine to take the public bus, and a lot cheaper, but the bus station is probably 13 blocks away. It was nice to get dropped off and picked up right at the hotel, and to have everything arranged before hand. The room itself was just what I wanted. It was one of the two treetop terrace rooms (#9). It is on the fourth floor, which might be a bummer for some, but I thought that I needed the stairs after all of the extra calories that a vacation tends to bring :) A previous reviewer said that the rooms were too warm- I did not find this to be true. I was very impressed at how well the seemingly small air conditioner worked, and how fast. The room was always comfortable, even though we left the unti off when we were out to save electricity. It took less than five minutes to cool the room. The drinking water was convenient, and the mini fridge had an ice cube tray! So we could make ice with the purified water to make drinks to enjoy on our fun balcony, which was complete with a hammock, two chairs, and a small table. There is also a large patio outside of the room (this room is the only one on the top floor). That patio has four lounge chairs and a hammock that two can fit in comfortably. I think this is for the whole hotel, but we were the only ones that used it the whole time we were there. I couldn't believe how nice everything was for the price that we paid. Luna Blue was awesome, and I will definitely stay there again if I go back. It was also conveniently located, and the housekeeping did an amazing job. One thing I might change would be having do not disturb / cleaning signs on the doors, but maybe this is not something that is done in Mexico?

Luna Blue and Tony & Cheri (owners), and their entire staff exceeded our wildest expectations! Not only did we receive a very warm welcome, but the grounds are absolutely gorgeous and our room was nice, clean and cool (thanks to air conditioning). We got there early our first day (check in wasn't until about 2 or 3) so we took advantage of relaxing in their courtyard garden and hammock (snored rather loudly after a few margaritas) and it was so peaceful. They have a fun bar with swings that was a huge highlight every day after being out in the sun. You have to try the \"Sarita Be Careful\" margarita - outstanding!! Tony and Cheri made us feel right at home and introduced us to a lot of friends that travel to Playa annually (or more) and we made so many new friends from all over the world thanks to them. They also gave us excellent recommendations on restaurants, night life, excursions, etc. and we were always very pleased!! This hotel is perfect for people who are adventurous, a little more budget oriented, but still expect excellent service and a nice, comfortable, clean room with beautiful grounds in the heart of Playa. It truly is a gem of a property. We have stayed at all-inclusive mega resorts before but prefer to experience the true personality of Mexico and being able to try out all the different restaurants that all-inclusives fall extremely short on.

In general, Playa has really great food, especially when you get away from the many overpriced tourist traps on La Quinta.

After spending a day at the beach or on an excursion of one sort or another, we were always happy to walk through the gates of the Luna Blue late afternoons, and we were always welcomed with a friendly \"Hola\" by either Juanaro or Himmie (sp.?) It was our \"home away from home.\" The small bar that's recently opened on the property is a great addition. It was nice to reconnect with other guests at the end of a long day and find out what adventures they'd been on, where they'd eaten, etc., and we always looked forward to going there for our first drink. Player has changed in the year since I went, there are more college students around as well as families with small children and more Americans. Fortunately, for those of us who don't have small children, you will not find under 14 year olds there. The person that stays there during the nightime is \"on the ball\"--one night we were returning to the hotel after several drinks and we were being a little louder than we normally would have been, and he came out immediately and just asked us nicely to keep it down; I appreciate that. And when we left at 4 a.m. on the day of our departure, he came out as he'd heard voices again just to make sure that things were okay at the Luna. As far as the beach club, well, Mamamita's is getting more and more crowded but as several guests have commented, if you get up and walk, you'll be able to find a quiet secluded beach. There's a lot of confusion when you first arrive at the beach club because you just don't know how they operate and there's no signage. And there are more and more people that are showing up earlier and earlier to stake their umbrellas and chairs, so good luck! One day, after my sister and I had walked the beach for hours on end, we were able to each find a lounge chair, but when the beach guy came around asking for our slips from the Luna, I was only able to find one slip, and so he told one of us that we had to give up our chair. It was 3:30 in the afternoon at that point, my sister and I had just received our drinks, and if I could have spoken Spanish I would have had a few things to say to him. You should try to venture out on Route 307 and check out all of the cenotes, they're all different, and cost around $5 or so to get into. There you'll find beautiful crystal clear waters to go snorkelling in and lots of shaded areas. And make sure to go to Hidden Worlds, it's quite an experience you'll love if you have any sense of adventure. Just make sure that you watch your money when you and if you stop for gas; my sister and I were distracted by all of the young lads winking at us, washing each and every windown, and it was only once we'd driven off, we realized that they'd ripped us off. We'd given them two 200 peso bills, and the attendant quickly told us that we'd given him only one 200 peso, that the other was a 20 dollar peso....just beware. Take Toni and Cherri's advice as far as restaurants, they're right on target....

As previously mentioned, the rooms don\u2019t have TV\u2019s (Yea!!! please don\u2019t ever add them!!!) This helps get people out of their rooms and socializing with other people and we went out to dinner one night with another couple we meet. We didn\u2019t realize that there were no telephones in the rooms. One day my wife and I went to do different things and she was having such a good time that she was going to be a couple of hours late. She called and left a message for me at the front desk but I never got the message. Later on I happened to think that if we had an emergency in the room that it would have been difficult to get help without a phone. Eventually it would be good to add phones. They don\u2019t have an ice machine, which makes sense since the tap water is not purified enough to drink. Large bags of ices are available inexpensively at the store across the street. We had had read so much about the owners we were a bit disappointed that we only saw Tony twice while we were there. The umbrellas at the beach club are in short supply and at this time of the year they were all taken by about 9:30 am. There were other beach clubs nearby with umbrellas available, but I didn\u2019t check to see how much they would have cost to rent. The beach is a great walking beach and you can walk for miles in either direction. There is a lot of construction in the area and the lot next to the hotel has a basement excavated, but there was absolutely no construction the week we were there. During the day you could hear a bit of hammering down the block but it wasn\u2019t bad. The reservation system was odd in that it wanted to get your credit card number before you know if there is actually a room available.

This trip was the best so far. I believe the Luna Blue was a large part of the positive experience. First of all, the Luna Blue is a very, very nice hotel. It is very clean, well run, comfortable, close to 5th Avenue yet far enough away to feel like you are not inundated with \"touristy\" encounters. I loved it. We were in room 8. I highly recommend it. We booked a kitchen suite and it was perfect. To be honest, we never used the stove, but having the dishes, glasses, fridge, coffee maker was perfect. We purchased coffee, pastries, fruit from Mega and enjoyed simple yet delicious breakfasts on our more than ample balcony most mornings. Our room was kept very clean and it was so delightful to return to that haven after a day at the beach. The shower was fine - lots of hot water. I have no complaints at all. The hotel is especially beautiful at night. There are lots of lovely lights hanging amongst the coconut trees and other foliage. It is truly magical. So magical that one night we put Frank Sinatra on the ipod and danced ourselves into a stupor on the balcony. Gee, hope we didn't disturb anyone - but we sure had fun. The only complaint that I had (and it is no fault of the Luna Blue Hotel) is that while on vacation I do not want to be on any schedule and if you want to get an umbrella at Mamita's you'd better get there by 9:00 or 9:30 or you are out of luck. Twice we ended up at \"Kool\". We had a better time there - it has a nicer vibe, but cost extra - not a big deal though. The towel game is really annoying and sometimes it is allowed, sometimes not. I do like Mamitas though - nice waiters, good food, beautiful beach. I just wish they didn't let people put their towels down and then leave. Well, they do sometimes and sometimes they don't. Genaro was very helpful and kind. He always greeted us with a friendly 'good morning\" or \"buenos dias\". He is a very nice man. This was the best vacation ever and we will return to the Luna Blue.

For the past 16 years we have stayed at mostly large resorts. We weren't sure what to expect with a small hotel. After reading the reviews on TA we thought LB has to be a great place or somehow uses TA to make it look good. But there is no question, what the reviews say is what you get. Luna Blue is doing all the right things to keep people coming back. The room (#33, superior room) suited us perfectly. The room is nestled right in the middle of the garden setting with the waterfall. It was very peaceful and relaxing. Exactly what we had requested. We spent every morning and evening (and a rainy afternoon) enjoying the balcony overlooking the garden. The attention to details they have put into the hotel shows.All of the reviews describe it quite accurately. Some of the details we appreciated were: brighter than usual lighting, a full length mirror, accessible outlets, nicely tiled floors, clean paint, very adequate water pressure and hot water, nice thick large bath towels fresh each day, a quiet ceiling fan, nice sized balcony, a full water jug, a clean frig that kept beer cold and worked well enough to actually make ice, an extra soft mattress pad cushion that made the bed more comfortable than most Mexican hotels, pillows I could sleep on without getting a stiff neck, wonderful staff and the owner's availability when we needed assistance. Best of luck to them and all they continue to do to make LB what people are looking for. As for Playa Del Carmen it is a very busy tourist town that has lost most of the laid back Mexican charm. The service in restaurants was fast. So fast they were bringing the food before we finished a drink and ready to clear the table before we were done eating. The ambience of the small restaurants was often spoiled by loud booming music from a bar next door virtually sharing the same space except for a little divider between. It was not relaxing. If you are there to party hardy I'm sure this will be a great location. The first time we were in Playa was for an afternoon 8 years ago. The beach just south of the ferry peer was so gorgeous, we knew we had to come back to spend time in this area. Today there is no beach in front of the hotels south of the peer. But if you walk north and keep walking past all of the hotels, restaurants and beach clubs you will finally come to the kind of beach we were hoping for. There are long wide stretches of soft white sand. You can walk for hours and we did. We walked to Punta Bete which must be 5 miles one way. You will pass a few AI resorts and finally come to a pink place with a palapa roof called Los Pinos. That is where we had the best, coldest beer, a big plate full of nachos and frios served with wonderful Pico de Gallo and more cold beer. It was the Mexico we were looking for. The nice lady running the place that day waited on us and made our food. There was no rush. The only sound was the surf. We shared the place with two locals and a couple getting massages. Relaxing! Well worth the walk.

We keep coming back because this hotel just keeps getting better and better. This is my first time to post a review on Tripadvisor, and I wish I had done so earlier. The staff has been with this hotel for some time, and are among the best we've ever encountered anywhere. We've always been treated with nothing but the utmost respect and our questions are always answered thoroughly and whatever our needs, they are met with promptness and a good natured response. Each time we return we see improvements in the rooms with new A/C units, a fresh coat of paint, new furniture, fixtures, and this time with new \"in room quotes\" which, in our room at least, really captured our hearts. This was our 4th stay at the Luna Blue. We stayed in a Kitchen suite and enjoyed the fridge, the coffee maker, blender and stove daily. I think this category room is perhaps the best value in Playa Del Carmen. Check-in was easy and Genaro and Jaime were incredibly courteous and helpful, as always. One of my favorite things on this trip, with our Kitchen room, was to make our morning pot(s) of coffee, decaf for me, and regular Chiapas for my husband, fix a bowl of yogurt/fruit/granola, pour a glass of fresh orange juice and complete a crossword puzzle or read a chapter or two. Either sitting at the lovely kitchen table in our room, or on the balcony listening to the sounds of the water fall and swaying palm fronds. Our balcony was always quiet, and the WiFi always welcome and working. At the end of our day, a nicely made margarita (or two) was a perfect cap to a great day (Which is ANY day at the Luna Blue in Playa!) I must say I love the insulated feeling I get with the lushness of the garden and many trees. The hotel keeps them cut back and thick and never over-grown. The grounds are just perfect, colorful and I loved hearing the rustling of the tree limbs and leaves. My goodness, I miss it so much already. Our bathroom had plenty of shelving, a large shower and good lighting, we had a nice sized dresser, 2 nightstands, and our in-room safe was digital so we could use our own code and not worry about losing a key! I won't repeat all the lovely things others say about The Luna Blue except to say the location of the hotel in the north end is perfect for us, being north end people away from the hustle and bustle of the hotel properties nearer the action of the southern end of 5th Avenue. The beach passes work smoothly, the towels are always fresh and soft, our rooms are always superbly cleaned and ready for us on arrival/check-in, and after a day at the beach or out and about. A couple of parting things of note. We appreciate the hotel's close relationship with Dr. Eduardo Rovirosa, who is the family physician of the owners as well. His office and clinic is actually located on 10th Avenue, directly behind the hotel. He is always available to the Luna Blue and it's guests and is a true gentleman and physician of note, and was of great service to us on one occasion. It's nice to know that if we should ever have need of him, he is always available to the hotel's guests. The second thing is the availability of water which is provided to guests in most room categories above a standard room, I believe. We buy a few of the larger water bottles and save them, filling them with water and placing them each evening in the refrigerator. The next day we have all the cold water we'll need for the day. Can't tell you how nice it is to just grab your water and go, or have water available for a pitcher of lemonade, or for the coffee maker!

The next day (after cleaning), the smell was better, but not gone. This was not a good start to our trip, and clearly, the bathroom had not been cleaned prior to our arrival. Disgusting. The hosts that everyone speaks so highly of in other reviews were nowhere to be found while we were in Playa, and we couldn't find anyone in charge who could give us recommendations or help us find activities in the area. And, we were there during a very busy time and needed to get to the beach early in order to secure a spot. Although someone was supposed to be staffing the front desk starting at 8:00 a.m., there was nobody to be found anywhere in the hotel at the designated time who could give us our beach towels and passes. The wireless internet the hotel promises only worked for the first two days of our trip. When we inquired about this, we were told that we should just restart our computer, which we had of course already tried. Again, no effort was made to fix the problem. Finally, when we e-mailed our not-so-gracious hosts after our stay to ask about these problems before writing this review, we received no response at all, an oversight which by this point seemed typical of the overall service level and quality of this property. One more thing - the beds are very hard and uncomfortable. I've been to Playa before and stayed at the Hotel Quinto del Sol. It's a similar property and is MUCH better in both quality and service.

Very spacious for the price and we did enjoy cooking breakfast in the room while having our coffee, and blending drinks after sunning at Mamita\u2019s all day. I also found the layout interesting in that there was no other room \u201cbutted\u201d up against ours. We had windows on three sides of the room and the outside staircase against the fourth wall.

Playa is a fun town full of bars, restaurants, caf\u00e9\u2019s and shops and this hotel location is ideal. Try Quinta Passion a few doors down from Luna Blue for fish taco\u2019s and marguerita\u2019s. We also liked Fusion on the south end of the beach for eating and partying after sunning all day and one night we caught some good live music there.

For a Gringo like me with a fifty word Spanish vocabulary, this place is a little tough to figure out at first. We arrived there a little late in the morning, and getting situated with a beach chair was somehow more difficult than it should be. It seemed all of the palapa\u2019s were taken. The workers you\u2019ll see first and ask for help are waiters only, and they\u2019ll just point you in the direction of a stack of unused chaise lounge chairs. Finally \u2026after looking confused for a while like the newbie that I was\u2026 I grabbed a chair and picked a spot, but of course then the guy who became known as the \u201cpalapa police\u201d showed up immediately to tell me I was in the wrong spot. \u201cDonde?\u201d I asked sheepishly, so he pulled the chair over 10 feet and that was O.K.

His English is good enough, and anything you need, he\u2019ll make sure you have it. Service with a smile.

What a great vacation! We booked a week for our 5th anniversary at Luna Blue after reading the positive reviews here on tripadvisor. We were a little worried because it was hurricane season. We lucked out hurricane-wise, with a couple of storms leaving the the town without noticeable damage before we arrived, and it was clear the week we were here. This hotel is really a hidden jewel. It's only got a few rooms, so it's quiet, and it's only a half a block off Quinta, the main pedestrian street through Playa, so it's very accessible to most of the places tourists would want to go. It's also only a couple of blocks to the beach, and \"blocks\" here are much smaller than big-city blocks. The location really can't be beat. The northern half of Playa, where Luna Blue is, is more European and less-crowded than the southern half. We rarely overheard English. The northern (and newer) section is also mercifully devoid of local shopowners assailing pedestrians with sales pitches, which is the norm in the southern part of town. And there are plenty of nice restaurants, bars, and shops nearby, even a laundry service across the street. We were able to walk to breakfast at Il Baretto a couple doors down, listen to the Italian customers, and enjoy excellent food. (Try the ravioli!) Oops, I'm not really reviewing the hotel... The hotel served as a great launchpad from which to explore the Yucatan. The staff was there when we needed them and not intrusive when we didn't. They brought our delayed luggage to our room while we were at the beach, arranged for a snorkeling trip, got us a rental car so we could drive down to Coba, and recommended restaurants. Always polite and helpful but never hovering. It was still pretty hot and humid in Sept so the air-conditioned room was a godsend. Not many restaurants or clubs are air-conditioned, so it was great to get back to the room after a day of tromping around in the heat. The bed was firm, but comfy, the room was clean, there were no insects and only one lizard (that we would like to have seen more of). The Mamasita's beach club, for which the hotel issues free passes, is very nice but closed early, around 5:00, which is too bad because we would have spent much more time there if it was open late. Luna Blue is not all-inclusive, which in my opinion is the only way to go in a town filled with excellent restaurants. It's not actually on the beach, which may be a put-off for some, but it's so close we were never wishing we had stayed at a hotel on the beach. If you're looking to stay in your hotel for most of your time, this probably isn't the best choice. But if you're looking for a comfortable, affordable base of operations, look no further. Our only regret was that we didn't take a few more days off work so we could stay in Playa longer. We'll be back. Highly recommended!

Maybe I expected too much. I knew there was no pool & was OK with that as well as no TV. My experience with this hotel was that it's just OK. It should never be rated in the top 10 on this site as it misleads in my opinion. The tiny room we stayed in didn't have the bottled water that everyone mentioned (had to pay $10/day extra for it) & I found it to be somewhat dirty as well as the bathroom door had a broken vent slat. When you used the shower water went all over the floor therefore you had standing water to add to the humidity. The only highlight was the man at the front desk. He was a delight but we never saw the owners. I also want to mention that I booked a 4 night stay in Jan. & decided we could only stay 3 & when I emailed to cancel approx. 3 months in advance I was charged $25 to do so even though it states on their cancellation policy that you \"may\" be charged a fee. I can see if I cancelled closer to the time we were to arrive but I gave plenty of notice. I was also told when we arrived & saw how tiny the room was that it was the only room with 2 beds except for the penthouse or whatever he called it that was occupied. I find that hard to believe since I would assume there are times when a family or friends would need more than one bed. Anyway, my review of this hotel would be neutral or rating of \"2\".

We chose Mexico because she is West Coast and I am East Coast so it was an easy flight for both of us. I had manically inhaled reviews of different hotels to find one we would both like. In January my family stayed at one of the big AI's and didn't like the property at all (to say the least), so I wanted to get a small hotel in town. Luna Blue fit the bill. We were in room 7 with a kitchen as I thought we may cook some meals in. Well, we didn't, but the fridge and water came in handy. We loved the property. It was beautiful and Cheri and Tony were great hosts. I agree with all positives listed in previous posts (location, ect). The only negative things that I can come up with is unfortunately why we probably wouldn't stay again. And it is no fault of the hotel. While we were there it POURED rain (buckets and buckets) day and night the first 2 to 3 days. Cheri and Tony were in the states then, and once they came back it stopped raining (they must have taken the sun with them:) ). Any way, I didn't realize how much a tv would have come in handy. I booked knowing they didn't have TV in the rooms. We both brought books to read instead. But being kinda stuck inside (the rain was crazy), we wished we had a tv. For the most part I would be able to do without it for a couple days, but it is a nice diversion to have. Also - I would never get my husband to agree to no tv for a week. The only other 2 things that were the AC is quite loud and was right above my bed. I thought earplugs would drown out the noise - but it was still kinda loud. We tried to sleep with just the fan blowing out of ac machine and we both woke in the middle of the night to an incredible hot,humid room. I think the AC machine would have been better in Kitchen. Also, it would have been nice to have another mirror in the room. The only mirror was a very small mirror over the bath sink, that we had to take turns using as it was too small to look into together. A full legnth would have been nice. So it took longer to get ready. We were 2 girls hitting the town - mirrors are a must. The positives are a long list here: comfortable beds, large rooms,bottled water,nice owners and a great price too.

My wife and I debated whether we should experience the \"All Inclusive\" Mexico or the down in the streets with the people Mexico. Now I must say that we are rather high maintenance people and have grown to expect a certain comfort level in our lives. I'm sure that we would have enjoyed staying at an AI resort and I'm sure that some day we will (when were older and less adventurous). Now having said that, the most memorable experiences we've ever had have come from exiting the rat race of commercialism and the luxuries we take for granted and immersing ourselves in the real world culture. By not allowing ourselves to get caught up in the resort mentality and the tour bus craziness, we were able to experience the Mexican people and their culture in far more fulfilling ways than you can behind the walls of a resort or the windows of a tour bus. The Luna Blue Hotel is a gem in the heart of Playa Del Carmen. There are no distractions like satellite TV, telephones, and yes - there is no coffee pot either (we knew this before we stayed there). There are excellent restaurants all over the place and the staff were extremely helpful in directing us to local (and cheap) establishments that did not fail to satisfy. Everything you need is within steps of the hotel. They provided us with tips on where to shop for the best bargains, how much to pay the cab drivers (they'll burn you if you don't know), and so on - they were very helpful to us \"Mexico rookies\". I could not write a review without mentioning Mamita's Beach Club - simply put - the best damn beach in town. Get there before 9:00 am to secure a palapa. Part of our adventure was to rent a Harley Davidson from a local company - now thats the way to tour the ruins in Tulum and Coba (and everywhere else for that matter!). For you who are going to rent transportation and tour around just a word of caution - there are speed bumps on the highways in the craziest places and they are not marked very well - good thing the bike had excellent brakes! The drivers are insane but it doesn't take long to get with the flow - there is order to the chaos! By going on our own we were able to enjoy things at our own pace and go where we wanted, when we wanted. Definitely check out the snorkeling at Yal-Ku - awesome! Tulum has some excellent restaurants and beaches. Snorkeling in the underground Cenotes is also a must do. The bottom line is that the Luna Blue was our \"base camp\" and sanctuary while there.

There were only a few minor issues such as some of the lightbulbs being burned out, and the fact that our room had a connecting door to the one below it, and one night we were woken at 3am when the people below us came back from partying and continued to do so in their room...we could have sworn they were right on our room! However to the credit of the hotel staff, the night guard was knocking on their door within 10 minutes, and came back again 5 minutes later when they still hadn't quieted down...you would never see prompt attention to a noise issue like that in any hotel!!!

If you are not into the big overcrowded, overexpensive resorts, and are more into making new friends & having a good time then this is the place for you. The service you get is personal & outstanding. The rooms are charming and you can't beat the price.

Luna Blue is a small hotel just off the main walking street in Playa. It is quiet and convenient and only a 4 block walk to the beach. If you are looking for reasonable rates, a comfy place to sleep, and a nice calm beach (as opposed to Cancun's waves and riptides) this is the place for you. Plus, you can do it for less than $100 a night. As we booked only a week before our trip the hotel had a standard room available the first night and a room with a kitchen for the second night so I can comment on both types of rooms. The standard room we stayed in was perfectly fine and cost 60$ -cheap for Playa. The room had a double bed and a single bed. The bath was large an water pressure was great. The water doesn;t smell like salt water. There was no view but lots of windows. The hotel does not have the musty smell many places in the tropics have. If you need a comfy mattress - stay here. These mattresses are more comfortable than my bed at home! The room with a kitchenette was fine for us but we didn't use the appliances. The room is a bit bigger with a dining table for 4 without the single bed. Again, lots of windows with garden views. There is a fridge, stove, plates, pots, etc (see photos). The bath is large and there are 2 chairs just outside. The staff is helpful and polite and we felt perfectly safe staying at the hotel. The only downfalls to the hotel are there are no elevators (though I'm sure the staff would help you with your luggage - we just had one bag) and the walkways are stone - i.e. not condusive to rolling luggage, again that didn't affect us. Also, there is no pool at the hotel, but the beach is nice and the waves are not overbearing. As we walked around Playa (it was our first time) we were so glad we booked here. It was between this place and one called Posada Mariposa and when we walked by Mariposa we both said, I'm glad Luna Blue had space. It was much quieter at Luna Blue! Well, I booked at this hotel because it was the highest rated hotel at Playa for less than $100 a night and I hope to stay there again very soon! Hope you try it! The first 4 photos are of the kitchenette room (sorry I don't have any of the standard) the beach photos are taken from Mamitas Beach Club (free to Luna Blue hotel guests). It is a busy part of the beach although the photos don't show that but it is a very nice place and swimming is great.

It was just wonderful! We felt very secure in this hotel, actually more so then at an AI last year. We stayed in superior room #33 with a wonderful patio space overlooking the waterfall area. The room was very sparsely furnished. However, we found there was plenty of space to unpack our belongings. We loved the safe with the keypad access rather then key\u2026.and we didn\u2019t have to pay an $80 deposit as a previous reviewer mentioned. The shower was great, we loved the remote control to operate the air conditioning, the bed was really perfect, the housecleaning staff had the room in immaculate condition when we returned from the beach each day, the water bottle was awesome and we appreciated the use of the mini fridge. We also appreciated the wireless internet connection that we had on our patio. We were not able to access it inside our room, but that was okay with us. We loved the free passes to Mamitas. Great location on the beach and such a nice short walk there. We were disappointed to not have been able to meet Toni and Cheri as they were traveling to the U.S. We are very curious if it would have been a very different experience. We were quite surprised by the number of mosquitoes on the property. We think the waterfall may contribute to the increased # of mosquitoes. Nowhere else did we encounter mosquitoes. We were glad we packed the mosquito repellant. One thing that concerned us a little was that there appeared to be no smoke detector in the room\u2026.still not sure if we just missed that. We would add that as a suggestion to the management for the safety of their guests. The plumbing was certainly different then in Canada\u2026.however we could tell it was an issue at most establishments we visited on our trip\u2026so no complaints in that regard. Just a heads up. We were glad to have a laptop along with us along with a few DVDs and we really would have missed those unwinding moments with the lack of TV in the rooms.

We had a Superior room, which ran us about $80/night. Overall, the property is lovely, the gardens are lush and full. However, the grounds always seemed to be damp, with puddles to avoid and slippery stairs to watch out for. One day we had gone down to view the waterfall area and I slipped on the wooden platform. It is extremely slick when wet. Granted, I tend to be a bit of a clutz, but perhaps some kind of rubber mat or something would prevent accidents like that in the future. Also, the stairs leading up towards our room were borderline rickety. The banister wobbled and a few stairs were actually loose. I took them very slowly and was fine, there was a 'caution' sign at the base of the stairs to warn people, so I assume management was aware of the issue. The room had everything we needed, but not much else. The biggest saving grace was the bottled water, which was very convenient. Honestly, my husband was not thrilled about the room. He's not picky, but he hated the bed and did not look forward to going to sleep. I had to agree with him. It was incredibly hard, not just firm, but rock, solid hard. The owners and management were very good, though. They did everything possible to make us comfortable. One thing to be aware of is that the in room safe is available with an $80 cash deposit. This was something we didn't realize until we got there. I'm glad we had the cash! It's one of those little details I didn't read anywhere ... just an FYI. Also, there are a plethora of switches all over the room, it took us a while to figure out what switch worked what. We assumed that we must have had some burned-out bulbs, because certain switches did nothing. Perhaps a quick tour of all the gadgets when we arrived would've solved this problem. We did spent a few evenings on our little patio area, which was very quaint and quiet. It's a good place to catch up on conversation and have a few laughs. But beware the biting insects! I got bit up on both legs causing huge, red, itchy welts. Part of the fun of being in the tropics! The A/C in the room worked well, but again, we weren't really sure how to use the remote. It was difficult to maintain the temperature in the room, it was either freezing cold or blazing hot. There is a timer feature on the A/C, but we couldn't figure it out. Not a big deal, but again, perhaps a brief explanation when we arrived would have been helpful. Personally, I enjoyed the quiet and simplicity of the Luna Blue. I like not having any distractions. I brought my ipod and portable speakers, so we had music, and for me, that's all I need. I would have preferred a bit more comfort. For example, in the room there is no other place to sit except the bed. Also, I noticed the maid didn't change the sheets every day. So, not only was the bed hard, but the sheets were sandy. Not a good combo. We did make a point to tip the maid generously, but to no avail. We had considered other small hotels in the area for about the same price. We've decided that we missed certain luxuries that we'd like to have when we return to PDC. A pool and TV are two things that we could've had at a hotel a few blocks away. The Luna Blue is an evolving property that is well run by fantastic people. I'm glad we stayed there and were able to experience it for ourselves. The hotel is safe, clean and in a good location.

While many, if not most, of the garden hotels in Playa have been replaced by new retail, hotel, or condominium projects, owners Tony and Cheri Head have preserved the old Zanzabar Hotel and restored the garden into a tropical oasis. Tony and Cheri are wonderful hosts, the staff is friendly and professional, and the service is excellent. Our room was spacious with a nice kitchen (stove with oven, refrigerator, dishes, toaster, and coffee maker included), comfortable beds with soft pillows, big fluffy towels and plenty of hot water in the shower. The hotel is well maintained, very clean and daily maid service was provided. One of our favorite evenings on our trip was having a drink on the balcony of our second floor room, enjoying the evening breeze blowing through the lush gardens below while listening to the trickle of the waterfall. The garden is beautifully accented with lights after sundown. The Luna Blue is just three blocks from one of the most fantastic beaches in the world. The north beach is wide, the turquoise water is gorgeous, and the Luna Blue provides free Mamitas Beach Club beach chairs with every room. Towels are available at the Luna Blue with only a modest deposit. We really enjoy the food in Mexico, and the selection of restaurants within easy walking distance from the Luna is considerable. A short walk further down Fifth Avenue brings you into the heart of the Playa Del Carmen entertainment district with choices of more restaurants, lounges, bars, nightclubs and European style discos. Getting up and down Fifth Avenue on foot is easy, and we only used a taxi when we were moving to and from the hotel with our luggage. We had the pleasure to be invited to a private party hosted by the owners. It is our understanding that this gathering of locals and tourists is a seasonal event that occurs only a few times a year. The party was a delight with burgers catered by locals, and self serve blender drinks mixed by the guests. A local band played a nice selection of soft rock and latin music - great dance music. We had the opportunity to meet several expats living in the Playa area and to spend a few minutes talking to the owners, Tony and Cheri Head. The party broke around 9:30 or 10:00. It was a very enjoyable evening and our total cost was a contribution of $10.00 towards the catering. It was a classy event and great fun!

It had our own veranda with a hammock, which we often fell asleep on during the afternoons. From our room we could see the courtyard, which is very tropical. We even saw someone getting a massage out in the courtyard. There are tons of restaurants nearby. However, since we had a fridge, we also would go to Walmart or Mega grocery store to buy fruits and other local foods to eat. If you wanted to go on the beach, you can get a pass to the beach, 3 minutes away. If you wanted to go on excursions, you can walk into town and book them there at a good rate.

The location was perfect, the rooms were very nice and the staff was excellent. There were a couple of problems getting water and there was a sewer smell coming from our bathroom, but for $70.00 a night we could put up with those minor issues. However our main concern we had was with the party that Sherri and Tony threw in the courtyard on our last night. We were aware that there was going to be a party several days in advance and we were assured that it was only going to be from 5-8pm. We also assumed that it was going to be more of a cocktail party, rather then the big drunk fest it turned out to be! The courtyard was so packed, we could barely get to our room and when we did get to it, our patio was full of people and we could hardly get inside, let alone hear ourselves inside the room. At that point we were not overly concerned, as it was only 7pm and we were going out for supper with some friends. When we returned at 10pm, there was no sign that the party was going to end anytime soon, even though we were assured it would be done at 8pm. We still were unable to hear ourselves talk in our room, not to mention the fact that it was our last night and we needed to catch a flight in the morning. All we wanted to do was enjoy our last night on our patio with a final drink, but that was impossible. Meantime, as we were trying to pack and get ready for bed, there was so much hollering and screaming outside that I finally went out to tell them to please be quite. I was quite shocked to see that it was Sherri and three of her friends outside my door. I was completely surprised at how intoxicated she was. I told them it was 10pm, and that they needed to move. However they only moved away a couple of feet and the party continued. I would also like to mention that Tony seemed to be much more intoxicated at that party then Sherri, as he was slurring his words halfway through the party. I never spoke to Tony directly, but the microphone he was speaking into made that quite evident. We decided that there was no way we were going to be able to sleep, so we went for a walk. When we got back around 11pm, most of the party was done and the noise was finally bearable. Another guest mentioned in a previous post that they had concerns about a bar being built in the courtyard, well those concerns are certainly valid. Tony mentioned that they plan on keeping the par open until around 10pm. The courtyard is not very big, so the bar will totally ruin any peaceful relaxation anyone might want during the evenings. The best part of this experience, was when were checking out. We looked at the bar and there were several bras hanging from the rafters. At that point I decided I would never go back to this hotel again. I think that Sherri and Tony owe and apology to all the guests who were staying at their hotel during this party. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a good party like anyone else, but these types of parties should be held at your private residence, not your place of business. By paying to stay at Luna Blue, we were making it our home for a week. However Tony and Sheri ruined that by throwing a private party in our back yard.

Like everyone else's reviews: owners, staff, location, value, peace n' quiet, etc. - all wonderful. If you want to escape reality, this is the place: no TV, phone, or papers. Just beautiful gardens and R&R. Kudos to the owners: They went above and beyond one morning as the water was out (pre-shower and post morning coffee), and Tony went around telling guests about the issue and that it would be back in 10 min - it was! Getting there: Wife and I added some extra adventure to our trip and took the ADO/ Riviera bus from the airport and back. Would recommend it: cheap ($8 pp each way) plus the $3 for the taxi from bus station to LB - still better cost (and comfort) than a small taxi. Leaves every hour. Beach club: Great! But if you want shade/umbrella, get there early. We got there around 9am after learning the laws of supply and demand. Were told Sundays are \"Family Day\" for locals, so they add to the beach demand - ergo, get there really early then. Rooms: We stayed in a superior level room, and would suggest at least that since the fridge and water bottle are a nice touch. Electric is same as US, so my wife brought her hair dryer. LB will be opening their bar in the next week or so (If there's one negative, it's our bad timing). It has swings as seats and a nice palapa overhead. It will be nice to relax with a cerveza after a long day at the beach, but hopefully allows guests to share more feedback and PdC secrets. Food: As other rookies will learn, this end of 5th Av is less crowded and less expensive than the other end, but those willing to venture beyond the tourist zone/traps will be pleasantly surprised. With LB's help we enjoyed the wonders of Mexican cuisine at better values: ask them about La Pesca and El Fogon. Several restaurants nearby too: Vagabunda and Mystic Cafe for breakfast, Fe and Quinta Pasion for cheap Mexican eats, and Babe's for your eclectic meal fix. Ah Cacao satisfies your choco cravings.

Twenty-four days before our arrival at the Luna Blue I emailed Sheri to cancel the last two days of our reservation. She said that was not possible because I missed the 30 cancellation deadline. I asked if she could make an exception. She said that was not possible \u201cWe simply have to abide by the policies we have established in order to make our business run efficiently.\u201d I asked if she could rent the room for the two nights: \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s doubtful. We will try, of course, but our hotel is not a \u201cwalk in\u201d type of hotel.\u201d I asked if I could try and find some guests on tripadvisor and she said: \u201cwe would ask that you don\u2019t place your own ad on tripadvisor .We have a very specific arrangement for specific bookings of the hotel with another company through the internet, and that might cause us some problems.\u201d That same day, to my relief, I got a new reservation for 7 days. I emailed back saying: \u201cHi, I am very thankful and relieved that you have chosen not to penalize me for my mistake. I was hoping that you would be able to rent the room but I see that your have gone one step further and have updated my reservation. I was feeling terrible about my mistake which was obviously affecting our excitement about our trip. Now that has changed. Thank you for your flexibility.\u201d That relief and gratitude dissolved when we got to Luna Blue and were still charged for 9 nights. When I mentioned to Sheri there must be a misunderstanding, she said no, there was no misunderstanding. When I referred her to my email in which I thanked her for not charging us, she said she was \u201ctoo busy\u201d that day to answer me to clarify the situation and was \u201csorry\u201d. I was dumfounded, I was speechless, at this flagrant lack of straightforwardness. Since our arrival back in Canada, I have emailed to ask if she has been able to rent the room. That email too has gone unanswered. I guess she has been \u201ctoo busy\u201d to answer. I prefaced my comments by saying this problem was my mistake. Yes it was. My husband and I have travelled extensively and do not have lofty expectations. We are respectful and we expect to be treated with respect and forthrightness.

We stayed there from Feb. 12-14. We are more the AI type but since it was such a short, last minute trip we decided to try the Luna Blue because of the high ratings on TripAdvisor. We were lucky enough to get the last room when we booked five weeks ago. Our room was the standard room, very small but still great. When we entered there was a slight musty smell that went away as soon as we ran the air, it is near the beach afterall. The room looked like it was recently renovated with a new, quiet air conditioner, new rustic furniture, paint, bathroom countertops, and alarm clock. Our room didn't have a kitchenette like the higher priced rooms but we didn't need one either. Posters are right about the soap not lathering well, but honestly the only reason I tried it is because of the posts I've read. I always bring my own stuff from home and never like hotel soap, even the best stuff at the Four Seasons and the Wynn! The room was very clean and had a nice charm to it. I have to disagree with one of the earlier posts on the statement that the hotel was like a motel 6 or something to that affect. The room was great and the grounds were beautiful. The bar and spa were still under construction but I'm sure they are going to be awesome when finished. Just like everyone has said, the owners were very friendly and helpful. They reccommended a seafood restaurant called La Pesca? that was awesome, same for a breakfast place that is called something Chuenga? Ask for the breakfast place that has Monkey in the name. They had the best fresh squeezed watermelon juice! same for the yogurt with fruit and granola! Needless to say we had a great time in Playa and slept great at the little Luna Blue hotel. If you want a nice, clean place to sleep that's close to the beach then this is the place for you. If you want to be waited on hand and foot it's probably not the place to go.

Everything is so close and within easy walking distance, most folks couldnt ask for more.

We really enjoyed the short walk each day to Mamitas beach club and the complimentary chairs and umbrella there (provided by Luna Blue) We also took advantage of the little laundry and mini mart across from the Luna Blue which was very cheap and handy. My wife had the need to see a doctor during our visit, and wouldnt you know it ........there was an american speaking doctor right around the corner from the hotel.

After staying for a week, I would like to relay my experience as objectively as possible, and let you, the reader decide whether it will be a positive experience for you. I rated this as \"Okay, but some problems\" for the reasons discussed below. Of course, if you do not see the answer to your question here, please email me at work and I will most likely be able to respond immediately if not by the next day (gdame@deflaw.com). 1) Cost of the Room: This hotel seems reasonably priced compared to other similar hotels if you are staying in a deluxe suite. I stayed in a standard room for $72 per night including taxes/fees/refrigerator, and note that it had the same amenities as another hotel we stayed at for $40 total (posada d\u2019Margo). The hot water did not work unless we turned on the sink and then it only worked sporadically, it had A/C, a clock radio, safe, and a ceiling fan. The only thing that stands out is the fact that it had scented toilet paper. The room was, however, located in a safe, secure location with a tropical setting. You could barely hear the traffic or the other residents. The bottom line is this: if you are willing to pay a bit more to feel safe and secure, you should consider this hotel. If you have been to Playa before and are more willing to experiment for a better deal, try the Posada D\u2019Margo or some place else (I have a few more suggestions if you are interested in apartment/condos with full kitchenettes). 2) Location: The hotel is 5 blocks from the beach and about a mile from where you can catch the collectivos and buses for traveling around. If you plan on taking day trips, and do not rent a car, this hotel may not be for you as it is quite a hassle traveling to the other end of town. I have more on this depending on your situation. The bottom line: It is not an ideal location for either beach or traveling, as it is far enough away from both to be a bit of a pain. 3) Service: The owners of this hotel are American and were able to direct us to a beautiful beach in Tulum, as well as some great, and cheap, Mexican restaurants. Their suggestion for car rental, however, left me paying too much, with back strain from having to lift the car to replace a tire, and unsatisfied. In fact, I strongly suggested that they re-evaluate their referral to CP Rentals, but doubt that they will despite the fact that they owner said he would \"seriously look into it.\" I say that I doubt they will because I was also told that a plumber would be out to my room, which never happened, and I was told $45/day for a car was a fabulous deal until I complained, and then was given a look front desk receptionist like I had paid too much (which was the truth). Regardless, just in case they are still referring CP Rentals, please save yourself time and money and go to ---.com (there is an internet caf\u00e9 1 block away that will let you get on for $.60 for 15 minutes), get a brand new car for $11/day, and save yourself from having to drive a 1970s Beetle with no AC, power steering, radio, and side view mirror. Better yet, get a car from the airport. If you plan on traveling, a car is necessary and is just as expensive as picking up the collectivo when it is all said and done. Parking is not an issue. My review would have been neutral had my hot water worked, or had a plumber actually come out, and had the hotel either not referred CP rentals, or agreed not to refer them again in the future. They also did not offer to pay for all or a portion of the rental (which would have been going above and beyond, but for $45 would have said a lot about their service - however, they did not make that effort).", "Date": "January 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "maine", "Title": "\u201cincredibly relaxing\u201d", "Author": "JackiMaine", "ReviewID": "UR6687551", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Luna Blue for 11 nights and we loved it.

My wife and I stayed at the Luna Blue for the first time last May and what a difference a hotel can make when it is run by such wonderful and friendly people like Tony and Cheri. That trip was about our 20th visit to Playa so we feel we can speak from experience. In fact, we enjoyed our stay at the Luna Blue so much we took a chance and booked the entire hotel in October. We went home and told our friends about this little gem in paradise and in no time we had 34 travelers to fill all the rooms.. This group was a mixed bunch of people, some had been to Playa before but stayed at All Inclusives, some had stayed at big resorts as well as small hotels and for some it was their first time to Mexico. It came as no surprise to us that everyone of our group was smitten with the Luna Blue, Tony and Cheri and the entire staff. They bent over backwards to accomodate our group's every need. They even tried to build a palapa bar and get a provisional liquor license so our group would have a place sit and visit and enjoy a cocktail or two. They worked very hard on this but due to local red tape they were not allowed the provisional license. What other hotel would actually try to build a bar for a group of guests? This is what is so amazing about this friendly place. Without a doubt all of our friends who stayed that week with us will be return guests. We will be returning for our 3rd visit along with two other couples in a few weeks (Jan28th) who will be staying here for their first time but I am sure not their last. Haveing traveled extensively in Mexico I do not rate a hotel a 5 Star because the water pressure in the shower is amazing or that your shoes are polished for you each day or someone fetches you a drink with a flower in it. I consider a hotel to be a 5 Star when you are greeted and treated as long time friends, when your room is clean, when the atmosphere provided by your hosts takes you away from the real world and enables you to truely live the Mexican and Caribbean way of life for a few short days. For the same price as a dingy budget hotel in the States you will be enjoying what a true 5 Star experience should be. So put on your flip flops and flowered shirt and let Tony and Cheri and the good folks at the Luna Blue show you the real Playa del Carmen. The best part is that with all the money you save not going to an All Inclusive you can stay an extra week at the Luna Blue, eat and drink at all the cool places Tony recommends and still have money left over to put on your next trip to the Luna Blue.

I'm happy to say that the lushness of the Riviera Maya area is back, and the Luna Blue is no exception. The Garden Courtyard area looks fabulous. The new waterfall area adds a nice touch to the look and sound of the hotel. The finishing touches and improvements to this 18-room hotel continue. We stayed in an upper balcony room, #34 and the new remotely controlled AC unit was nearly noiseless, you could set the degree temperature you would like plus it has a timer. Nice touch. And, once again our rooms were kept spotless the entire stay. The staff of the Luna Blue is incredibly friendly, helpful and capable.

Both in our room and on the balcony the signal was more than capable to keep a steady connection - good for checking your Fantasy Football scores, e-mails, catching up on the news of the world or back home etc. There is a new addition to the hotel's amenities coming soon, an on-site palapa bar complete with the most beautiful hardwood bar and soon-to-be installed (if not already) swing seats. The owner, Tony, said his desire is for this to be a nice romantic retreat on-site for an evening's nitecap, or whatever. It SURE would have come in handy on some of those rainy days and nights so that we wouldn't have had to make our way out in the driving rain for a quick adult beverage. And with the lighting of the Courtyard and the sounds and lighting of the waterfall - we can imagine how perfect this place will be on our next visit. Again - passes to the nearby beach club were available and the hotel was gated and guarded and locked tight each night at 10 if that sort of thing is an important thing to note (A key is provided for entry and egress by the wooden gate at night). Playa Del Carmen is a growing, vibrant community that has both an exciting and relaxing vibe to it co-existing simultaneously - and the north end of Playa is our favorite. Thanks once again to the Luna Blue! We will definitely be back!", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "midhurst ont", "Title": "\u201cLuna Blue Yahoo!\u201d", "Author": "lakd", "ReviewID": "UR6438559", "Content": "We (2 couples) stayed at Luna Blue for three nights starting Dec 1 2006.

Other reviewers says how wonderful this hotel is, I couldn't agree more. So I'll just show you the details of the room we stayed. Our room(superior) which is on the 2nd floor and is in front of the garden, is very clean and has enough space to put our baggage. Inside this room, there was a double bed, a small refrigerator, a water tank and a safety-deposit box. In addtion, there's a confortable balcony which is facing their garden! I really enjoyed reading a book at this balcony, when I wake up too early. Because of the jet lag, I wake up at 5 or 6 a.m. And maybe because of this garden, we were never bothered from the noise from the street. There's a small store and laundry in front of the hotel, large super market (10 minutes walk) and many restaurants on 5th ave. The hotel is not located on the beach front, but don't worry. There's a beach club where you can get 5 minutes walk and you can use their palapa and beach chairs free! We spend a great vacation at this hotel, we really thank Toni, Cheri, and especially the man who stays at daytime at the front desk. He gave me some useful information and explained in plain language (we're not fluent in English). One regrettable thing is that a half of the garden is under the construction. (but we were never bothered from the construction noise) I think this construction is to make a garden patio or something like the place where the guests can share their experiences of travel and useful information. If I stayed after this was finished, I could enjoy a chat with other guests/staffs in a relaxing atmosphere... If you're looking for an inexpensive hotel where you can really relax, Luna Blue is the best place to choose.", "Date": "November 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York and Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cWe loved Luna Blue!\u201d", "Author": "bunnnitos", "ReviewID": "UR6002358", "Content": "We loved Luna Blue and we loved Playa! We had an excellent experience with our stay at the hotel, received wonderful suggestions from the concierge for places to eat (the authentic stuff!), and the facilities at Mamitas Beach Club were perfect. Not to be confused with a 5 star hotel, Luna Blue is a great \"Mom and Pop\" type place that is just the ticket. If you want to be pampered and are persnickity and high maintenance, you may want to consider one of those soul-less, all inclusive resorts, which also carry a pricetag twice the one at Luna Blue. This is the kind of place that has a kitten that hangs out near the front desk, is all smiles, with fresh towels laid out in interesting shapes every day. We reserved room #7, one of the recently renovated deluxe rooms equipped with a full kitchen, pots and pans, a coffee machine (even though we brought our own stove-top one just in case), dining area, a double bed and a twin bed (with a trundle second twin beneath). We used the extra twin as a couch and bought supplies across the street at the little market, milk for our coffee and cereal, etc. There was also a big jug of filtered water in the room, and I was happy not to have a television, vacations are intended to be just that! We used our FM transmitter on our Ipods to use the little clock radio as a stereo, perfect! The decor was simple, relaxed, and comfortable. I sleep on a 4\" memory foam mattress topper at home so of course the beds were a bit firm for me, but I was not uncomfortable one bit. Slept like a baby. We didn't have any problems with the noise our AC made at all, either. We were glad to have it. We also loved the porches each unit has, an area with two chairs and a table in the veranda outside their front door, as well as a hammock. And it made me feel safe having gated entry at night, definitely a thoughtful bonus, though I don't consider Playa dangerous. We did not have a hair dryer in the room (which some reviewers have griped about), and as a daily user of one at home, with that heat, seriously, who wants to use a hair dryer? We didn't have any insect problems to speak of, either. People on this site complain about lizards and ants and stuff like that, and it's like, have you never gone to a tropical climate before? These things come with the territory of travel. They're expected. We did not have any of these things in our room, but we were so happy to see them in the wild. A nice change from the cement and roaches of NYC. :) The food in Playa is very affordable. We loved the places the people at the desk suggested. We did not love the touristy places listed in Fodors, they were twice as expensive and often not as good. There's this teeny tiny bar on 5th ave right around the corner to the left with four tables outside that is amazing. We hung there with the locals at night, the type of place that encourages strangers to sit together and talk. And breakfast there, I got two ham and cheese croissants, fresh squeezed honeydew juice, and an americano coffee for about $3.50 total. And it was delicious. Definitely our favorite place, young and hip. Also, ask concierge about the restaurant north on 5th ave (you turn right at this rotary, it's a bit desolate up there), this place was magical, dogs and cats meandering through, a central pond and a waterfall in the bathroom. The peanut chicken was to die for. Mamitas Beach Club was perfect. We loved having their restaurant right on the beach so we could have lunch without much effort. It was definitely affordable, though slightly more expensive, think $1.50 for a coke, maybe $6 or $7 for burger and fries. The setup Luna Blue has with them is great. You get an \"umbrella\" which is a cool thatched permanent umbrella, and enough beach chairs for your party, every day. We would make our way to the beach about 10AM daily and we always found a good spot. We would stay on the beach after lunch until about 4 when we would head back to the hotel for siesta, then after dusk head out for dinner when it was starting to cool. After that, drinks and shopping. Most of the shops on 5th Ave (which btw was way longer and cooler than I expected) stay open really late. It's much nicer shopping in the night air than midday. Sadly Tony and Cheri were out of town while we were staying there, but they were so great and helpful in the process of us choosing a room and making reservations and even followed up on email after we got home to the states and they were back in Mexico. My amazingly handsome and all around awesome boyfriend and I had the most wonderful trip to Playa, thanks in part to Luna Blue.

They gave us several restaurant recommendations, which we asked for. We stayed in the treetop room, which was very basic in appearance inside. Only suggested improvement would be the mattress pads (which a previous response says they are acquiring), and perhaps some nicer bed linens, but that is just personal (and somewhat nit-picky) preference. The room had a mini fridge, which is great for beer, wine, etc. The outside patio with palapa roof and chairs was AWESOME. Every night, my husband and I would have a nightcap out there, and it was our favorite part of our room. The rest of the hotel grounds/garden were very nice. They had just finished the waterfall feature on the lower level where a Jacuzzi is going to go. The 'hole' referred to in the previous review is not actually a hole. It is the way the grounds are shaped - kind of cut deeply into the rock, which slopes below street level. There is a wooden platform down there for the upcoming Jacuzzi (lack of appropriate workmen/installers have apparently delayed this project, but it is just THAT way in Mexico), and near the check-in area, they were finishing what looked like a plumbing installation for a bar they are installing. But that is the only area that is 'under construction' and that term barely even applies. We never had any bug problems while we were there, and it rained several times. All in all, this is a GREAT value. It is not an ideal choice for someone who is expecting fancy room service or chocolates on their pillows, but personally, we don't go PDC to hang out in our room - we go for the beach, restaurants and beautiful outdoor environment.

This hotel has a bad problem with biting insects. We are guessing this is because they have dug a big hole in their grounds in preparation for a swimming pool. Unfortunately we think this big hole is collecting standing water and acting as a breeding ground for insects. Depending on weather conditions these insects are affecting some of the rooms quite badly. 2. The hotel owners are very defensive about their problem with biting insects and if you complain you are treated unprofessionally. Here is a detailed timeline of our short and unhappy stay at the Luna Blue. We booked online for 4 nights at the Luna Blue to celebrate our fourth year anniversary after reading the glowing reviews on tripadvisor. Afternoon 7/6: We arrived and had a pleasant and speedy check-in. The room we had, number 21, was dark, but otherwise OK. It was a Kitchenette suite. The main improvements I would suggest would be some draws to store clothes. We were hungry and headed out to find some lunch. We asked Cheri for some suggestions which she kindly gave us and for which we thanked her. Early Evening 7/6: I was using my laptop out in the lobby (the wireless didn't work in our room) and was struck by just how many insects there were. As a result my husband and I took great care to shut the door quickly when coming in and out our room because we were scared of the insects getting in. I was perturbed that I was catching mosquitos in the bathroom but I congratulated myself after killing the visible ones. We headed out for dinner and drinks. Nightime 7/6: After dinner we returned to the hotel and found the nighttime hotel attendant dealing with irate guests who were complaining about a mosquito explosion in their room. We went to sleep or at least tried to but it was very hard as we kept on being bitten. We didn't sleep much sadly. Morning 7/7: We awoke to find insect sized blood marks on the sheet. I told my husband that I didn't think I could stay in our room any longer. We made a plan whereby he would find out if we could swop to a higher-up room away from the standing water or get a refund for our prepaid nights, while I scoped out the area to find out if there were alternative hotels where the insect problem was less severe. The owners arrived after my husband had waited for an hour in the lobby, being told that they were \"just coming\" and were \"two blocks away\". They were scornful and dismissive, and attributed our problems to our not understanding the nature of a rainy season. Tony initially offered to move us to a higher-up room, and told us that no other guests had had problems. My husband mentioned the other guests we had heard complaining, and Tony told him that, as the other guests had not checked out, there was no evidence of there being a problem. My husband suggested that this might not be conclusive evidence that there was not a problem. Tony then withdrew the offer of an alternate room in pique, and said that we could either remain where we were or leave without being refunded for our remaining nights' stay that we had prepaid. (My husband also mentioned that I was out looking at other hotels to evaluate whether they had such bad insect problems. The owners of the Luna Blue disliked this as evidence of customer disloyalty. My husband also mentioned that he thought the hotels near the beach might have less of a problem with insects because of the ocean breezes. At no point did he say that we wanted a room on the beach as the management (may) claim below, only that we wanted a room free of a biting insect problem. We had afterall happily booked into a hotel which we knew was not on the beach and paid for four nights - hardly the actions of people who did not know their own minds about the location they wanted in Playa.) We left the hotel feeling very upset. Both that we had inadvertently booked into a place which treated their guests with such scorn and also a little upset that we lost \\$270 in this manner for our prepaid but unused nights. I personally find it an unacceptable management action to make an offer of an alternate room and then capriciously withdraw it because they took a dislike to the guests. We checked into the Alhambra which was a lovely hotel.

I really can't say i've had a better vacation than this one. The town, the location, all so beautiful. The hotel just blended in so well with the feel of the town, that you really feel you are on vacation. I've been back for 5 days now, and i'm still on that vacation high. :) Highly Recommend!

We had a room on the first floor which was perfect, beautfully decorated and clean with all the amenities, such as AC and a perfect outdoor balcony for sipping cervazes and enjoying the garden courtyard. Of course the highlight for us was the people. Tony has to have been one of the most helpful hotel owner come concierge i have ever come across. His knowledge of the local restaurants and recommendations for things to do in the area, where the best....and really added to making this one awesome vacation. As a side note my girlfriend stayed at one of the 4-star inclusive hotels in Cancun the week before, and thought her stay at the Luna Hotel and Playa del Carmen was so much better! The only downside was no pool, but with free passes to the beach club which is very close by, that totally made up for it. Hope your stay is as awesome as ours was. Can't wait to go back!!!

The passes that they give you for the chairs and umbrella give you a discount and the service was ok but slow on getting you what you ordered.

The owners are nice but I suggest that they put a little more money in additional sheets and comforters and some bug spray, and some more remote controls for the air conditioners or relocating them so you do not have to climb on something to adjust them. The maid service was very poor. Only thing I think was done was putting clean towls out and changing the trash. The sheets were not changed because my nephew left me a note on top of his bed and I did not find it till the bedspread was pulled back.

Coming from Manhattan, I found it too trendy, too crowded, and too expensive----it was all things I was trying to take a vacation from!! Additionally, it was not typical of Mexico and Mexican culture, which is what we had wanted. Additiionally, I cannot help but notice the very exxagerated and obvious socioeconomic (and ethnic) divide in this town; something that left me very disconcerted. That being said, it was still a beautiful place. The beach was beautiful. Hated Mamita's beach club, but the beaches are beautiful and the waters are so blue and so warm! And Luna Blue was a quiet little piece of heaven. Had we stayed elsewhere, I may have written this trip off all together. Coming back to Luna Blue every nite was great. It's very rustic and you have to deal with things like ants in the room and tons of bug bites so this may not be for everyone. But for us, it was fine and just a very very beautiful place for a very affordable price. I had also arranged for a little engagement celebration suprise for my fiancee of chocolate and champagn, which Tony and Cheri happily set up for about $70. The room was waiting for us on our arrival and my fiancee was sooo suprised! It was great. By our 4th day in Luna Blue, we had walked the town a hundred times, eaten ourselves and drinken ourselves full and I was sick of PDC! Luckily, the next day we discovered collectivo trips to other places (went back to Akumal twice!!!) and this helped this to be a great trip. Had we been isolated to only PDC, I would have lost my mind, but seeing the ruins, meeting and talking with locals on teh collectivos and visiting Akumal (beautiful, quiet, serene), and yes even PDC in moderation, made this a pretty good trip. Not the best I've had, but still a fun time.

We stayed in the Kitchenette suite, room # 5 and it was great. The room was bigger than I expected, with plenty of living space. We ended up spending most of our time on our little front porch/patio...a great place to enjoy a Cuban cigar and a beverage. The location is great, just far enough down 5th ave to be away from the loud partying yet close enough to everything as well. Mamita's beach was a nice beach to go to for the day. If you walk a little further north though, it is much less crowded and the water is perfectly clear. Decent snorkeling was possible from the shore...nothing spectacular, but worth the effort. What I liked about Luna Blue was the fact that it was immaculately clean. The entire staff was ultra-friendly and not the \"holding the hand out\" friendly you encounter at many places, if you know what I mean. Both Tony and Cheri offered us fantastic restaurant recommendations. They are wonderful hosts as many have mentioned. Tony suggested a local place away from the main tourist zone and he was on the money. I believe it was called \"El Fogon\". Tony told us to bring the card of the hotel. I was a little hesitant to flash the card but let me just say this...when we initially arrived the place was completely full (with all locals, no tourists). They originally told us they did not have any tables...which they didn't. Then I showed him the Luna Blue card and the waiter/host's eyes lit up and said, \"Oh, Tony sent you? He is my friend.\" A table appeared out of nowhere and he took some unused seats from other tables. We sat down immediately. The meal was fantastic as Tony said it would be, but mostly I was just impressed at how well-received we were after mentioning Tony. Luna Blue is a great hotel and totally reasonable. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. I am looking forward to the completion of the bar and cenote. I think those additions will make it even more of a perfect little paradise.

However, there are many other components to a great hotel, which Luna Blue lacks. I am just trying to offer HONEST criticism of the hotel so that visitors are not disappointed like we were. First, some of the standard rooms, including the one we stayed in, have obnoxious sliding patio doors for entrances, making it feel like you are sneaking into someone's back door to stay the night. Second, the room decor is non-existent, just bare walls. A simple painting or wall hanging would do wonders. My wife is a professional design consultant for bathrooms and kitchens and couldn't understand the unfinished nature of the bathroom area. Our friend staying in another room is in the construction business and was equally amazed at the same \"design\" in their bathroom, strange nook's that only serve to collect dust and wood boxes on the walls near the ceiling in the shower are just a couple of examples. What this hotel lacks above everything else is attention to the little things (this is design and aesthetic related not service related). For instance, the soap holder in the shower was on a slant (same for our friends' room) which obviously means that the soap falls off when wet. Also, the soap itself has a ZERO amount of lather-ability. And there was only one mirror in the whole hotel room, nice if you are by yourself, annoying if you are with someone else. All these things could just be written off as minor things noted by picky people but when you are on a vacation these are the things that add up to be uncomfortable nuisances and make a hotel superb versus sub-par. There was, however, always an adequate amount of hot water and the garden area was quite nice. My point is this: For the price, Luna Blue is a reasonable choice, but there are definitely other hotels in Playa that offer similar prices with better aesthetics and detail. Just search the list on TripAdvisor and compare, we've stayed at about a dozen hotels in Playa over the years and most of them are in the \"under $100/night\" range and all of them had nicer rooms. Do not be misled about what this hotel is, it is a budget hotel with merely average accomodations in a good location with really nice American owners that are hands on and can assist you in English (which most hotel employers can do anyway). Service/Owners: 9/10 Rooms: 4/10 I think potential customers should know what they are getting into and that they should know that the high TripAdvisor ranking reflects the owners and not the rooms.

Playa is so cute, with everything in walking distance (like a mini-mexican-manhattan) - Luna provides free beach towels and passes to Mamitas Beach, which is a short walk from the hotel - After a sweaty day at the beach (I know, it's August, what do I expect!), the cranking air-conditioning in the room was exactly what I needed!

The lavanderia across the street was cheap and your close are done in about 2 hours. For a tip they even bring it to the hotel and lunas staff put it in your room. I recommend having them wash your clothes before you go home. There folded and sealed in a plastic bag making it easy to pack and no work when u get home. Plus the clothes smell amazing! I can not wait to go back to Luna and even though they are open to children , I loved the lack of children there at the time we were there!

They have locked gates at night, and someone is always there. Also, they have safes in the room for your belongings. Tony and Cheri are the best hotel owners I have ever met. They consistenly were happy and helpful, and would do anything to make their guests stay a pleasant one. They are familiar with the area and can tell you lots of great advice, just ask! On several occasions we saw Tony and Cheri out around town and they always stopped to ask how our day was going, and hear about what we did that day. I was sad to see a customer write a bad review of them. [-------------------] They truly care about their customers! It was hard to say goodbye, I felt like I was leaving a friends house! I did not want a big all inclusive type of place...so Luna Blue had everything I was looking for...safety, charm, cleanliness, friendly staff, beach access, and lots of peace and quiet!

It was the perfect combination of peace & tranquility and the hustle bustle of an up & coming resort city. By this I mean, the hotel is just 2 short blocks to the beautiful Caribbean Sea (beach club membership is included with hotel!!), a 1/2 a block to 5th Ave which is packed with restaurants & artsy boutiques (not just the same touristy stores you see everywhere) and when you return to the Luna Blue, the gardens envelope you in a sense of peace & beauty! We loved it! Also, and importantly because we took our children with us, 5th Ave is a safe place for the kids to walk around at night. There are police on the streets and all the owners seem to keep an eye out for any problems. The hotel & it's gardens are locked up after 10:00pm so when the kids return, they simply unlock the gate & can hang around in the beautiful gardens or their private veranda. Lastly, but most importantly, the hotel is very charming, the rooms are clean, air conditioned & decorated with a sense of the country we were visiting. The owners, Cheri & Tony were there all the time to help with reservations and suggestions for places to visit that aren't just the same place everyone goes to! We loved the ruins that are still in the jungle & you need a guide to get to them, the lagoon for snorkeling that is a national park, & the ATVing in the jungle that was so much fun, etc. etc. So, the combination of where the Luna Blue Hotel is situated, the beauty & peacefulness of it's gardens & rooms along with the Best Owners a boutique hotel can have, will have us returning very very soon. Make your reservations at the Luna Blue & have a Great Vacation!

The Luna Blue has a set of rooms that connect by an interior staircase (rooms 8 and 9), one has a kitchenette. While I was a little wary of traveling with a 15 year old to a hotel that has no TV, my son never missed it. The rooms were clean, quiet and very comfortable. The area that the hotel is in is known as Little Italy. We were there on the day that Italy won the World Cup and if you went in the room, you could hardly hear any noise from the celebrations (and they were celebrating!). There was a hammock on the patio along with a table and chairs. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The passes for the beach club are a nice touch. We spent a whole day at the club and enjoyed it very much. As for bugs, yes there are mosquitoes and biting flies but it is the tropics and the start of the rainy season. Every time I have gone to PDC, I have been bitten (if I don't protect myself) and seen a bug or two in my room. When I mentioned that I had a couple of bugs, they re-sprayed the room right away. Tony and Cheri made me and my family feel very welcome in their \"home\" and took care of any issues that came up quickly and courteously. I will definitely stay at this hotel again!

Here's the bottom line: it was great for us, but not for everyone. What makes it great? Location, the american owners, and the value. The location was GREAT. It is located a half block from 5th Avenidas, which is THE main tourist, pedestian area. It is also just north of the more developed and more tourist stores and shops. In this area of Playa, many new and arguably better restaurants and condos are locating here. Overall, it was very quiet, despite sounds from nearby construction. Across the street is a mexican laundry and a small store. This store turned out to be very handy, and has a great mexican beer selection. The hotel is also conveniently located to Mamita's Beach Club, which is the best non-resort beach area in the entire PDC area. Lot's of beautiful young people (many from europe) hit the beach at Mamitas. Daily access to Mamita's is provided free by the hotel, using coupons for umbrella and beach chairs. For a small deposit, the hotel will provide daily beach towels, too. This is a european-style hotel, so it is not your typical american hotel or resort. The bed is very firm, but we didn't have any problem sleeping. Other than bedside tables and lamps, there was no other furniture. We stayed in room 36, which had an outdoor patio and chairs. Our room also had a refrigerator and water cooler, with water bottle (this is particulalry nice, since you need to avoid ingesting tap water). The bathroom is small and functional. It has very simple furnishings (e.g., the toilet paper roll was a piece of bamboo on string). The shower works at one fine, medium strengh, medium temp stream, but it does work. No bathtub. Our toilet sometimes required holding the handle to ensure that it worked, though a minor inconvenience. Be warned though...if you want a nice bathroom with privacy, this ain't it. The bathroom \"door\" was a partial door that was open 15 inches or so at bottom and again at top. While one could not see into the bathroom, you could HEAR what was going on in the bathroom. Thank God no one got traveler's diarrea on this journey with that door! We were looking to escape and re-connect as a couple for a few days, so the lack of phone and TV helped in that regard. However, our pre-teen children would NOT have survived, easily. I'd go for a bigger resort if we went with smaller children. High school or college-age children will do fine here. Presently, there is no pool or other amenities at the hotel. However, the owners are building a 10-person hot tub on the ground level, as well as a bar. The owners are from San Francisco, and were very welcoming and helpful. This was our first time to Playa, so we welcomed their learned advice on several occassions. They really made our trip better and cheaper. Considering the hefty price for the all-inclusives, Luna Blue is a good value, particularly when you include the free beach rentals. We'll probably stay there on our next journey to PDC. If you stay at Luna Blue, I highly recommend a restaurant located on the same street (26 Calle), just before 5th Avenida: La Quinta Pasion. (It's about 40 feet from Luna Blue.) This is a quaint street patio restaurant that is run by a recently arrived family from Mexico City. They are very nice, speak decent english, and serve excellent mexican food and cocktails. Best part: it is inexpensive, even for PDC. This was the only place we ate twice during our stay. It is THAT good, and I particularly recommend the tacos de pescado (fish tacos, though the shrimp are also very good). Being from San Antonio, we eat mexican food four times a week, but this is exceptional food. In the afternoons, Quinta Pasion often has drink specials on margaritas and beers that are also hard to beat. They also serve breakfast.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento", "Title": "\u201cWe stayed at three different hotels, and Luna Blue isn't \"all that\"...\u201d", "Author": "wlittleman", "ReviewID": "UR5431178", "Content": "My wife and I traveled to Playa Del Carmen for the second time in 2 years. We love this beach community. Prior to staying at Luna Blue, we stayed at one of the Tucan Group Hotels, and found it pretty good for $55/night (low season). A couple days later, we decided to stay a bit north of the Ave. 5 strip, and get away from the hustle and bustle of cheesy souvenir shops and aggressive restaurant hosts. We found Luna Blue at the northern end of the strip. We got one of their standard rooms for $50/night, and it was a slightly nicer than the other hotel. It only lacked cable TV (we weren\u2019t concerned about that since we didn\u2019t have any children with us). We booked the room for two days starting on the morning of June 29th, and by the end of the day, we decided that we wanted to stay in the area two additional days. I promptly notified the staff that we would like to extend our stay to include July 1 and 2 as well. They told me I could pay the next morning if I wanted to. So the next morning, I paid for the additional nights. We enjoy the day, went to bed, and on the morning of July 1st, there\u2019s a note requesting my attention at the front desk. Apparently, the owners, Tony and Cheri have set a \u201chigh season\u201d date starting on July 1, and that they undercharged us for the room that we had already paid for. They requested that we pay the difference if we intend to stay over the weekend. Well, I just didn\u2019t feel that it was right to change the rate on us during a 4 night stay. In fact, I found it petty, so we decided to look elsewhere, and ended up finding another wonderful hotel just around the corner. It was called Fiesta Banana (yeah, I know...dumb name). The room was smaller than Luna Blue\u2019s but there was better lighting and a large shared patio for socializing. In addition, our room included a private balcony and continental breakfast for $50/night. 90% of hotels in the area during the month of June and July have vacancies, so I don\u2019t see why July 1st would be considered \u201chigh season\u201d for Luna Blue. I\u2019ve never stayed at a hotel that raised their rates in the middle of my stay. Luna Blue\u2019s policies posed unacceptable inconvenience to us, and we will not stay there again. It\u2019s not a bad hotel, but it's not awesome either (there was a cockroach in our room (#4)! Other reviewers seem to rave about this hotel, but I find their reviews suspiciously similar?!?!? We stayed at two other hotels and they were equally decent. I just found their policies to be more appropriate for large hoteliers than a mom-n-pop operation. We wished that we left Luna Blue with more fond memories.

We have travelled to several areas in the Yucatan Peninsula (Isla Mujeres, Majahual, Tulum, Cancun) and found Luna Blue to be both an incredible oasis and an excellent value! As mentioned, what makes this hotel so wonderful are owners, Tony and Cheri. Within minutes you feel like you've known these two great people your entire life and are drawn in by their great stories, helpful tips, and caring nature. They (and their staff) are truly interested in making sure you have everything you need to make your time at their hotel special. We reserved a Superior Bedroom during low season ($55/night). The room was on the third floor (with a balcony) and had a Queen bed, AC and fan, small fridge, 5 liter water cooler, and in-room safe. Free passes to Mamitas Beach Club and fresh towels were provided any time we wanted. By booking through a popular Playa message board website, we also received a PDC card which provided substantial discounts to several area bars, restaurants, shops, and sporting activities. The gardens are peaceful and beautiful. We did notice some bugs while we spent time on our relaxing terrace. As we realize from living in Florida, the bugs you CAN see are just part of the problem (they don't call 'em \"no-see-ums\" for nothing), so definitely bring bug spray. This is also true if you venture to the ruins, the cenotes, or even out for the evening in town. Stepping outside the gates, you'll find several great restaurants, shops, and conveniences (laundry, food stores, etc.). The area is VERY safe and the hotel is locked up tight each night to provide guests with an additional feeling of security. Don't worry if you're staying out late...you'll receive a key for all-hour access! On-street parking can usually be found within a few yards of the entrance and cabs can be hailed around the corner (though walking down 5th Avenue and the local neighborhoods is a wonderful experience). We HIGHLY recommend Luna Blue to anyone who's considering staying at a boutique hotel and is looking for safe, friendly, clean accomodations (and at a GREAT value). Plans are in place for a small bar and the jacuzzi should be ready in the next couple of months. Though hard to believe, enhancements continue to make the place better and better.
