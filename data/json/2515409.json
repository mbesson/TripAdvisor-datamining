Finding any hotel\u2019s that provide 2 bed/2 bath suites was excruciatingly time consuming. Luckily, after a lot of research and comparisons on travel sites I chose Staybridge. They offered exactly what I was looking for \u2013 a true suite (small apartment) with 2 bed\\2 bath and a sleeper sofa in the living area \u2013 at a reasonable price! It was extremely clean, comfortable and well maintained & someone else cleaned up, brought in fresh towels & made the beds! Short of a waterfront view, I would not have asked for more. It is off the beaten path and a little ways from the attractions, restaurants and night life - but it is extremely quite, so the short drive was worth the quality of rest time in the hotel. Staybridge does have a hotel closer to the attractions, but for my family the nightly rate increase was a consideration over the 5 days we stayed. I have seriously recommended this hotel with great enthusiasm to many of my friends & I do plan to stay there again. I will look for a Staybridge in every city I travel to \u2013 THE STAY WAS THAT GOOD!! A last note: Parking was FREE..

We usually stay at a Marriott or Hilton Vacation club locations because of the needed size and space. However in San Diego these options are few if any. And our favorite locations in SD are either in the Gaslamp or Marina area. For this trip, we were in town for our daughter's softball tournament which was going to be held at Kit Carson Park Escondido and again Quality hotels in this area are very limited. Because of the great reviews of Staybridge we decided to try it out since it was a quick freeway drive about 10 minutes away from the park. We were very pleased with our choice. We had a 2 bedroom suite which consisted of a master bedroom with a king size bed and bath and an additional bedroom with a queen bed and bath, TV's in each room in addition to living and dining area and small kitchen. I really had nothing bad to say about the space. In fact I really loved the layout which was very different to the usual 2 bedroom suite layouts which IMHO made better use of a smaller space without leaving out or missing anything. Beds were extremely comfortable, wifi, dvd player in rooms, Kitchen utensils etc.. I feel 199.00 per night for our stay that weekend was a great value for this type of suite in SD. The surrounding area is business and residential. Its tucked away from a couple of medical buildings on a culdasac. But don't let that deter you its a quiet and pretty area with lots of trees and a nice pool and BBQ area. seriously you wouldn't even know your there amoungst businesses. Across the main road there's a Costco if your stay is long and need supplies. Also, there's a Claim Jumper restaurant that we enjoyed which is in the same shopping center across the street. We also took a quick drive to beautiful Torrey Pines State bech which was a quick trip on Ted Williams freeway a straight to the beach. The Hotel looks to be pretty new and the decor warm and inviting we didn't get a chance to try out the snacks they offer during the week but we did try the complimentary breakfast which was actually very good. Nothing fancy but better than I expected. they also had washer and dryer facilities and business and excercise facilities. The only thing they lacked in this area was an Ice macine which I think they should have. I guess because most rooms have a refrigerator with an ice maker but that takes a while to get going. They were kind enough to get ice from their pantries to fill many families Ice chests and ours as well and I thought that was great customer service. Along those lines there were many times thru-out our stay that some person in the staff genuiely offered help. Weather it be for directions, help carrying bags, assisting to make sure everything was ok.

We did request 2 beds on the top (3rd) floor and didn't receive either request, so that was a slight disappointment, but it turned out just fine.

Our room had free WiFi and there was a laundry room that was free (bring your soap).There was a free, full breakfast every morning with eggs, waffles, breakfast meats, pastries, oatmeal, cereal, juice, etc. Tues-Thurs night there was a free \"dinner\" that we were surprised to see. The first night they had grilled hamburgers and hot dogs. There was tap beer and saki, too! If you'd like to grill your own food, they have a really nice patio area with 2 propane grills and they provide the utensils.

About 90 minutes after I complained, they still hadn't put up an \"out of order\" sign, so another unsuspecting guest had the same problem I did.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat facility.. but clientele is not so great\u201d", "Author": "BusinessTraveler90", "ReviewID": "UR7655586", "Content": "This is another lovely Staybridge site.

Surrounding area has a ton of restaurants and decent shopping/grocery stores. Cons ------ Unfortunately, due to its value, many families stay here. if you're a business person, this hotel is going to drive you crazy.. there are incompetent parents and their throngs of unruly toddlers in the gym, running and screaming down the hallways, running and screaming in the rooms, at the breakfast table, at the basketball court. It's like being in a daycare.

Chose the location because we were planning to visit the San Diego Wild Animal Park in Escondido. The park was just a short 10 minute drive from the hotel. The studio suite was slightly smaller than I expected. It included a kitchenette, sofa, desk, armoire w/TV and queen size bed. Should have reserved a one-BR suite for the three of us (our teenage son joined us). There was a nice pool (no one was in the pool, the weather was cool), a workout room, basketball court. There was a complimentary breakfast each morning. Son loved being able to make a waffle. The eating area was very pleasant. The bonus was on M,T,W & Th they have a \"Sundowner\" between 5:30 & 7:30. Didn't know what to expect. Thought it would be drinks and nibbles. But it was much more. One night there was beef stew, the second night, deli sandwiches. Drinks were complimentary wine, sodas, sake and beer. My teen thought this was the best! The business center was nice also. Two complimentary computers and printer. They simply ask that you limit your time so all guest have their turn. This was also the \"library\" with books, DVD's and games. There was a small self-serve store near the front desk, for items you may have forgotten and snacks. The hotel caters to business travelers but we found it to be great for our family.

Perhaps the hotel puts the older, more experienced staff on during the week, as this is primarily a business hotel with guests staying for a week's duration. Very nice rooms with full fridge, stovetop, microwave, dishwasher, etc. Two televisions, one for the living room and the other for the bedroom.

I have only positive comments with this hotel. My kids are teenagers and need their \"own\" space when we travel. Had a 2 bedroom/2 bath unit on the 3rd floor. Small kitchen area with a full size fridge and microwave were great. Pull out sofa in the living area was big enough for my 16yo son. Daughter had a queen bed in her bedroom with a tv and plenty of space. The only inconvience was the 2nd bath was IN her bedroom. so, if she was sleeping our son had to actually go into her room to use the bathroom. we had a huge master bedroom with king size bed, lots of storage area and a full bath as well. Free internet access from your room. The rooms were clean and maintained well. The breakfast buffet was good and always had a changing item along with all the regular items. One day it had eggs, sausage, another day was pamcakes etc. always had fresh fruit, canned fruit, pastries, breads/bagels, make your own waffels, cereal, oatmeal, rice, breakfast bars and such. My daughter is a Veagn and could always find something to eat. Great way to start the da yand a huge convience. Therer is a room off the lobby/ dining area with 2 computers and printer that is assesible all day. We didn't bring a laptop, so this was a great way to stay in touch, print boarding passes and kids to chat with friends when we were back to the hotel for the evening. There is an evening reception with food, drinks, wine and beer 3 evenings a week. We were never back to the hotel to take advantage of these, so can't comment on them. The front desk people were always friendly, gave good advice and easy checkin/out. There is an adequate fitness area and FREE laundry room with several washers and dryers. they have laundry soap at the small store area in the lobby. the pool was small for the number of rooms but never saw more then a handful of people there. This was our 2nd trip to California in the past year, and I've come to the conclusion it never is real hot there so numerous people wanting to be in the pool area really isn't an issue. Being from Maine we expected southern California to be warmer then Maine..NOT!! For the price this was an excellent place to stay. Only consideration would be the travel distance to any of the \"tourist\" areas. We did have a decent ride in crazy traffic everyday.(avoid rush hours) Our Hertz rental car with Never Lost GPS was probably the smartest thing we did. We would have been lost literally 100's of times without it. We just typed in our destination and let the Never Lost get us there.. All in all we were very pleased with this hotel and would stay there again.", "Date": "May 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, lovely location - good for families\u201d", "Author": "Loll", "ReviewID": "UR4987880", "Content": "We stayed here for three nights in April (me, husband and 14 year old).

My wife and arrived w/ a late checkin (had called ahead a week before); The hotel staff person arrived at the door after we waited outside in the cold for 10 minutes...he had been smoking Marijuana; and couldn't figure out how to charge my credit card, give us a room card, or program the room card to open a room. Eventually, after 20 more minutes of waiting, we suggested that he just go and open a room for us, and we would get one in the morning; This he did...and tried to take our bags into the room and wanted a tip (as if)...

The other peoblem was the 30 minute drive to downtown. If you are not doing stuff downtown, dont sweat the distance. There are some decent restraunts nearby (olive garden, tgifriday, marie calender, the gold rush place, etc...) THere also is a theatre near by.
