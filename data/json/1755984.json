I arrived at 3pm and there was building work going on both sides of the hotel I was not pre warned about this ! I would never normally moan as I know improvements need to be made but the noise was that loud even with my ipad earphones on the noise was totally unexceptable ! At around 6pm the noise stopped but all I heard was guests arriving at the hotel, staff talking on reception and the reception phone ringing and this was when I was trying to rest. I went to my awards evening and on my return I expected things would have calmed down but yet I still had to use ear plugs to sleep and I could hear the 2 reception staff talking. Then at 7am other guests started arriving and all I could hear was suitcase after suitcase being dragged along the wall and loud voices and then toTop it off at 830am the bagging and sawing noises started again and the car traffic noise was crazy ! Possibly the worst night sleep ever ! Please do not except the room next to reception as you will regret it ....Its such a shame as the rooms and located were great !", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lisa C", "ReviewID": "UR120590934", "Content": "Loved this hotel.

Given a room in the basement I took the view that at least it would be quiet, no traffic noise etc. Unfortunately I didn't anticipate the constant noise from a service lift and the very early preparation by the cleaner in the basement corridor. The quality of the rooms is really good however but the room I stayed in was very small; needed to move the chair around to watch TV or get changed.

Located along a quiet smaller residential road a few steps off the crazy busy Oxford street, we could sleep very well without the traffic noise (we had a room facing the backyard). Its about 500m down the road to the Marble Arch station, but we rarely took the metro due to the convenience and frequency of the buses going down Oxford street towards Chinatown and Piccadilly Circus, and down Park Lane towards Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and the Parliament. Loads of fast food restaurants, shops, supermarkets near the hotel. Hotel does not have B&B packages, but it didn't bother us as we had plenty of cafes and restaurants along Oxford Road to choose from (Pret a Manger and the Italian Cafe down the road had cheap and good breakfast menus available) Reception and hotel in general I would describe the property as a small, boutique hotel without all the frills. Not a hotel you would book into if you are looking for a fancy reception, gym, bars, restaurants etc (try their sister hotel, The Arch, up the road for all that). There is just a simple reception desk downstairs and no bars or restaurants here. There was a minor glicht when we checked-in, we were told to walk back to their sister hotel, The Arch, with all our luggage and stuff because they recently took over management and we had to check-in at the other hotel instead. There is no lift in the hotel neither, but it didn't bother us much as we stayed on the second floor and it wasn't much of a hassle. The reception staff were friendly and helpful in general. We saw a flyer at the reception that offered van shuttle services from the hotel to Heathrow at 14 pounds per person (a great bargain and much more convenient compared to the express trains) and the reception staff happily booked it for us. Rooms We stayed in Room no. 8 (think it was Club Double), the first room on the left when you come up from the reception. For the price we paid, we were really really happy with the room. The room was large (by London standards), we had plenty of space for our luggage and shopping items. No problems with noise or traffic as the room faced the backyard. The bed was the best I've slept on, although its slightly higher than the average hotel bed (if you tend to fall off from the bed when you sleep, it would be more advisable to take the sofa instead!). There is a small cabinet equipped with a minibar, microwave, cutlery and coffee/tea making facilities in the room. The bathroom was very well-kept and clean, and it was very nice to walk unto the warm floor in the mornings (and at nights!) as it had floor heating. We had nice warm fluffy towels and the water pressure was very good. Our room had everything we needed for our stay including a hairdryer, internet access, TV, air-conditioning, iron and ironing board. Everything seemed newly renovated and nicely kept. We would definitely return to this hotel the next time we are in London, you just can't beat the price for the location and the quality of the rooms. Just know what to expect before booking into this property to avoid disappointment and be careful with the room choices.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cLets be realistic - good hotel, good location some niggles....\u201d", "Author": "Chippyqueen", "ReviewID": "UR115834640", "Content": "I have stayed here a couple of times this year - and I have read the other reviews. The hotel is a converted town house building so some rooms are smaller than others - there is a room in the basement which is small but rooms 9,10 & 12 in my experience are substantial for London. The sooner people stop complaining about the size of hotel rooms in London the better - they are small and expensive, so lets move on. The hotel is in an amazing position - Marble Arch, Oxford Street, Park Lane, Bond Street, Baker Street (Madame Tussauds) all within walking distance. Round the back is Seymour Place with some amazing little bars and restaurants. The hotel has no lift, but a concierge and you will need to check in at the reception of their sister property a few doors up. Room 12 should be avoided, I had to move rooms at 3am this week when the ceiling started to leak but the rooms are usually modern with seductive lighting, trendy bathrooms and fairly helpful staff if a little bit teflon when you want to complain or query something. Its on a road that is naturally busy between 7am-6pm but I can honestly say hand on heart, the traffic noise has never kept me awake and I have stayed in rooms at the front and back of the property.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cAppalling.

At 4am the breakfast staff started working in the kitchen and I could hear everything. My day was ruined. I don't understand how a hotel could do anything so inappropriate as to rent a room where such noise is clearly audible. The staff in the morning was not very apologetic; it was insulting.

Me and my boyfriend stayed in a double deluxe room, and my mother in a single deluxe room. Getting to the hotel is wery easy, 4 minutes walk from Marble Arch subway. When we enterted we were told that we would not be doing the checking in there, but at another hotel down the street... When we booked the room, we were informed that there would not be made a reservation on our creditcard, but we still had to reserve 100GBP upon check in. Not a big issue, but not as they advertise either. We returned to our hotel. Our room was wery spacious for a London hotel, located on the second floor. There is not an elevator, so getting the bags up there was a little heavy, but we managed. The room my mother got was a different story..... Her \"deluxe\" single room, on the first floor by the reseption, was about the size of the bathroom in our doubleroom. Just about room for a bed, a desk and a closet, and a much smaller bathroom than we had. Considering she payed just 70 GBP less than us for the entire stay, we thougt this was unreasonable and talked to the man in the reseption. He could not do anything, and refered us to the hotel down the street where we checked in. We went back there and discussed this with them, but they could not help us as they were fully booked. They could possibly do something the next day, but an upgrade to a double room would cost 50GBP per night. Considering we only payed 15 GBP more than her per night to start with, this was out of the question. When we returned to our hotel, not exactly in a good mood, the problems continued. The air-condition in her room did not work properly. it was wery hot in there, and the air-con just blew out hot air. The window could not be opened much, so we discussed this with the receptionist. He said that since it had been set for heating, it would be a while before it would switch to cooling. So for the first hours her room was wery hot. Next, her television did not work.... We had to get the receptionist back in there again, but that did not help much. He fiddled around with it for a few minutes, but did not figure it out. The maintenance crew had left for the day, but they could check it out the next day. This was not a big problem, but all of these little issues started to bug us.... When we finally got to our room and unpacked we tried to connect to the advertised Wifi service, but it did not work. When we told this to the receptionist, he sayed that they did not have Wifi... Even though it was advertised when we booked. At this point we started considering leaving the hotel and finding another one (Raddison down the street is a much better choice by the way) The next day, we just decided to not let the first days events wreck our vacation. So the single room was just used for sleeping in, everything else we did in our double room. All in all, not our best hotel memory. But maybe that is what you get for staying in London on a \"budget\" (not that London is cheap anyway). Did not expect a \"deluxe\" room to be the size of a closet, and expected more service (things that were advertised) Good location, just a few minutes from Oxford Street and the subway, but that is the mort positive comment i can give.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable professional but friendly helpful service.\u201d", "Author": "patomalley55", "ReviewID": "UR90656789", "Content": "I was really surprized staying in a small boutique style hotel of 15 rooms.

I stayed in this hotel on 21st October 2010 for one night. Once I arrived to the hotel I couldn't believe there was no restaurant, sitting area or anything else other than a tiny reception. I was shown to my room that was next to the reception, which meant I could hear everyone coming in and out of the hotel. The room was the smallest room I have ever stayed in my whole life. A tiny single bed pushed to the wall with just enough room to open the room door and the bathroom door. Trying to close the curtains in the room meant that I had to pull the bed out and jump on the bed to reach for the courtains... There was no chair at the \"desk\" and when I was given one I couldn't open the bathroom door...which it was the same case if I tried to open the wardrobe door! There was no iron or ironing board in the room as falsely advertised and I again I can understand why as per the chair situation, simply no space for one. Eventually I was given one, but it wouldn't fit in the room so I complained and I asked them to move me to a bigger room, but they wanted me to pay to be upgraded, unbelievable!!! In the end I was offered to iron my clothes in another room which was of a normal size and then carry them across the corridor and through the reception to my room. Returning to my room later in the evening I found it hard to have a good night sleep, because the noise was so bad both from the reception and from outside the window. There was some sord of a \"boiler\" noise that didn't stop all night long and at times it was so loud that I ended up waking up! What dissapointed me the most is that no effort was made to move me to another room and take care of my needs, especially considering it was a group booking of 5 people, which means we had 5 out of the 15 rooms that they have all together.

A taxi was provided at management's expense and we were delivered to the Shaftesbury Suites. We entered a tiny reception area where we were greeted by a silent and terrified bellboy, who simply stared at us with wide, rightened eyes. Shortly thereafter a cooly elegant young woman emerged. She greeted us with a raised eyebrow and a very cold \"Yes?\". We explained who we were and why we were there. In total silence she checked her computer records. At last she confirmed that we could indeed remain. There was then a protracted argument over whether we needed to pay or not (we had pre-paid for the original hotel but there was much uncertainty in this young woman's mind as to whether that was good enough for her establishment). Finally we were told our room was on the 4th floor. \"Fine. Can you direct us to the lift?\" The eyebrow shot up once more. \"There is no lift,\" we were told, with great disdain, as if only peasants expected lifts. She glanced at our overnight bag and said, with a shrug, \"If your bag is heavy you can leave it here.\" Not, mind you, \"it will be brought up\" but merely \"you can leave your personal belongings behind and do without.\" Declining this offer we started the climb. We are in our 50s, in reasonably good shape, but it was one of the hottest days of the summer and we were not happy bunnies by the time, panting and sweating, we reached our room which was, to be fair, beautifully decorated and very stylish. The airconditioning, however, was very weak and even when turned to the maximum was inadequate to cool the room to a comfortable standard (outside temperatures that day/night were in the high 20s). We had reservations for a restaurant in Knightbridge for dinner. We went out, had a lovely time and got back at about 11.00pm. Upon turning the lights out to go to bed we discovered that there were three permanently \"ON\" security lights on the ceiling over the bed. The only way to make them turn off was to remove the keycard from the electricity dock, which turned off all the power to the entire room, killing the airconditioning in the process. I gave my sleep masque to my husband and spent an uncomfortable night trying to avoid the glaring overhead lights. By the way, the rooms seem to be designated as \"suites\" merely by the presence of a small microwave and a tiny extra sink/bar arrangement.
