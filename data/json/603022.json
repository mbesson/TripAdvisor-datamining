{"Reviews": [{"Content": "There's nothing glamourous about Twin Peaks - that's the point! Myself and a friend stayed at the Twin Peaks hotel for two of our five nights in San Francisco. We were keen to stay in the Castro but didn't book in advance - this would be advised if you were looking to stay somewhere more charming or expensive as the area gets very busy at weekends - we tried four or five places that where all unavailable before finding Twin Peaks. The guy at reception (we presume the owner) was friendly and helpful after some proprietors in other hotels weren't, so we were made happy. We were offered two rooms for what we would have paid for one at other locations, but we decided to stick with just one anyway ($59 per night plus tax).The room was basic and out of date, but for that price we weren't expecting much else. It was very clean (and was cleaned during the day to a high standard). Communal showers aren't ideal, but they're in individual rooms which we found fine. This hotel aint the Ritz and is never going to be - but it is clean and its location is a winner (30 seconds from Church station and right in the heart of the Castro). It's perfect for travellers on a budget who don't spend enough time in a hotel to justify paying big bucks.", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR676026414", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "CalifBoy08"}, {"Content": "Pas super beau mais propre et pas cher et bien situ\u8305   showReview(4628319, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR806258866", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "GREGBrussels"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d603022-r21058424-Twin_Peaks_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html", "HotelID": "603022", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
