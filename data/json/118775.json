Based on our research, we even took the advice of others and requested a room on the back side away from the noise of Interstate 17 and on the north side of the building away from smokers at the back exit doors. See we did read the TA reviews. When we opened the room door, we were greeted by a sickeningly sweet aroma, like a cheap public restroom. It looked clean enough, yet quite spartan as the others had stated. Additionally, the beds seemed quite low to the floor as if they were lacking the mattress portion of a box and mattress. And they were more than hard! Unbearably hard. So much so that in the middle of the night, I found myself awake and almost angry at the extreme discomfort. My wife was up at 4A ready to leave and she is NOT an early riser! We got up and left the room in the predawn hours, not even taking the time to shower or clean up for the road. It was that bad.

(read if you are a coffee drinker)\u201d", "Author": "chacharu", "ReviewID": "UR68122980", "Content": "Overall, the Red Roof Inn was a decent experience but a couple of things made the hotel come up short for us. We chose the place because our needs were simple and the price was excellent for the long memorial day weekend. We would have preferred a place with the free continental breakfast for the convenience as much as cost. For a small amount extra we got a microwave and fridge (happy with that, btw) and the hotel info claimed to have coffee available in the lobby so we figured we could forgo the free breakfast. That brings me to my first huge complaint. It wasn't exactly coffee that they had--it was one of those little multi-beverage machines that produced a hot brownish coffee-flavored beverage. I think it's actually supposed to be \"brewed\" but I think they just run some hot water over some instant flake things. Think sanka. Instant coffee would have been preferable. Let me just add that I understand Red Roof Inn is not a fancy hotel and I wasn't expecting Starbucks, just a cup of real coffee. It's not that difficult or expensive to run a coffee maker. And if they don't want to do that, they shouldn't claim to provide it. Okay, I'm obsessing, but I'll bet I'm not the only one who wants a dang cup of coffee in the mornings. Our plan was to purchase a roll or something simple we could heat up for a light breakfast and grab a cup of coffee from the lobby. Well, on to plan B and that meant buying breakfast out. We dealt with it but.... Okay, enough whining over that. My second complaint was that everything seemed to be done on the absolute cheapest-of-the-cheap. We got a tiny little bar of soap for the shower and they have gone to the little single-use shampoo packets instead of the traditional small bottles. Okay, lots of inexpensive places have done that. But it would have been nice to have 2 packets--one for each of us. Cheap. There was only one small trash can for the entire room--none in the bathroom area at all which was inconvenient. And when we had to get an address and directions over the phone and there was no pen or paper in the room. We had a pen but had to scrounge for something to write on. Most inexpensive places still give you a few little sheets of paper. We didn't need fancy stationery and weren't paying for that, but c'mon. There's no frills but this was just plain cheap. Okay, that's the complaints. Nothing we couldn't live with. Otherwise the place was actually very good. The woman who checked up in was very friendly and made us feel welcome. And the clerk when we left was very helpful getting me info to get to the car rental at the airport. The room was cleaner than most and beds were firm and comfortable. Even the air conditioning was good; quiet, easy to adjust and didn't get overly cold or warm which was a pleasant surprise. So except for the few annoyances it's a good place to stay. Just be prepared to provide everything for yourself (including a trash bag) and it's just fine. I might stay there again, depending on the circumstances, but there are other inexpensive choices nearby and I'd probably try one of those instead.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and excellent, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "JenEricTravelers", "ReviewID": "UR67485281", "Content": "We chose this hotel for its proximity to my family in Phoenix as well as its super close location to a major Interstate (I-17 Black Canyon Freeway) As we were traveling northbound to the Grand Canyon this location was superb to get right on the highway and go.

The hotel itself was clean and well maintained, the room equally so; the front desk staff was cheerful, friendly and helpful (both coming and going, something of a rarity when you check in late); the room and bathroom surprisingly spacious; the rooms well-insulated from highway noise. If these are the factors that are important to you, it's likely to be well worth your money to stay there. Unfortunately, for us these efforts were overshadowed by a couple of significant negatives. The first and biggest one - the beds were rock-hard! I realize some people prefer firmer mattresses, and I usually have a pretty wide range of tolerance, but these were seriously only half a step up from sleeping on the floor. I kept trying (and failing) to get comfortable - once I even woke up with half my ribcage numb from lack of circulation! I'm very glad we were only staying there the one night, because if it had been longer I would've broken the reservation and found another hotel. I can forgive a lot of things, but the whole point of staying at a hotel is to be more comfortable than you would be, say, sleeping in your car - which I thought about doing that night. The other major negative for us was the wireless Internet access. My husband and I are true Internet geeks, so free wi-fi availability is important to us in choosing a hotel. To their credit, there was wi-fi and it was complimentary - but it was through T-Mobile's service and you needed a PIN from the front desk to log in, and they would only give you one per room. I realize that not every family sits around at their separate laptops for hours like my husband and I do, and it wasn't a great inconvenience for one night (fortunately I'd brought a book as well), but only being able to put one computer online when the hotel had advertised unrestricted free wi-fi was quite frustrating for us. A lot of the frustration really stemmed from the price point - if this had been, say, a $40 a night hotel, I would've accepted the downsides and been more pleased with what they did right. But we paid $70 for a double-full-bed room for two people - more like $85 with taxes and fees tossed in. So the aforementioned issues, coupled with a few smaller problems like a single shampoo packet (no bottles, and no conditioner available - I asked) and a complete lack of even an attempt at a breakfast, really stood out. I didn't feel like I'd gotten my money's worth at all. I really do hate saying this because this hotel had some of the friendliest service and nicer rooms I've seen, but unless you regularly sleep on the floor of your house because your bed is too soft, I honestly can't recommend it.", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBest Nites Stay\u201d", "Author": "hnybea", "ReviewID": "UR55609605", "Content": "Very friendly staff, always helpful no matter the hour.

There are a few sports bar/restaurant type places within walking distance (e.g. Applebee's), which was convenient, but the location is basically within a strip mall.
