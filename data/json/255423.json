Even more challenging when you are party of 3 and way past the age of dorm rooms. We are very glad (and thank you trusty fellow Tripadvisor) to found Cambridge Hotel on here. We booked the Deluxe Room with balcony facing the city vew for quite a good price. It had a double bed and the spacious sitting area got converted into another double bed, plus another single bed - all in all we had 2 double beds and a single bed, 5 luggages, 3 hand carry bags, 2 computers bags and still have huge room to move around and did a mini concert before a night out with MTV blasting off the telly. Basically it was a very, very comformtable space for 3 hyper active people. The bathroom was huge (it comes with a bathtub), fluffy fresh towels and toilettries (not quite L'Occitane nor Molton Brown but great house brand anyway). The room was made and cleaned everyday; and great applause for the housekeeping team for keeping our rooms really clean despite all our personal effects strewn all over (and not one thing got missing!). We stay at total or 4 nights and everything was just perfect. Considering they really didnt a room for 3 - they were accommodating enough to transfrom ours into a really comfortable space. Oh they have an amazing shower! Now the location: 2 words: gay village. And you know what comes with in the gay village, you ask? all the chicest resturants, bars and stores and really fabulous colonial houses in the chic vintage balcony. walking around Surry hills, having coffee and coctails should be a thing to do in Sydney, apart from the visit to the Opera house. This place is just lovely minus the tourist riff-raffs. So Cambridge Hotel really lucked out on the location.

I have to say that my trip from start to finish was exceptional! When it comes to staying away from home I am a bit of prude and very frugal with my money. I want the best value for it but also at the same time except that you cant expect to have 5* accommodation on a 1* budget! (I'd be an idiot if I thought I could actually get it for this!) This is where I think the Cambridge has hit the spot, affordable yet appealing accommodation at its best! The service was fantastic, on arrival I was able to park my car in the multi storey car park below the hotel. Although this is not part of the hotel its ideally situated if you drive. I took the elevator up to reception where I was greeted with a warm smile and friendly hello by a lady named Donna. She checked me in nice and quickly, the usual protocol credit card, fill in your details etc and I was whizzed off to my room 1208! Something to note is that only guests with a room key card can gain access to your floor before the lift will operate, leaving me feeling safe and secure that not every Tom, Dick or Harry can access the hotel. On entry to my room the view was fantastic, it was clean, fresh and had all the mod cons needed; phone, wifi - prepaid, iPhone doc, desk, lounge area, large tv with Foxtel (it even had the sports channel!), mini bar which was very well priced a beer was only $4.00 and air con. Where the hotel was located was another great benefit, it is in the heart of Surry Hills and a 1 minute walk onto Oxford street where all the bars, clubs and restaurants are and if you want to head into the CBD then that will take you 15-20mins scenic walk through Hyde Park or a taxi ride 5-10mins costing $10-$15.00 (there is plenty of public transport also). In the mornings I had breakfast in the 212 cafe, I was served by Adam, very professional & polite, he was quick and efficient with my order leaving me little time to time to read my complimentary news paper lol. On one of the evenings I had to organise a restaurant for me and my friends to go to, so I asked the reception desk if they could recommend anywhere. I was greeted by a lady called Sarah, again like all the other staff I had spoken to during my stay, she was knowledgable & friendly and knew loads about the local area. She recommended a pizza place around the corner from the hotel called Mad Pizza. She also recommended a pub across the road from the hotel called the Porter House, a lively Irish pub, with special $10.00 meal offers and a pub quiz on a Wednesday. However I opted for the pizza place, if you get the chance I certainly encourage dining here, the pizza's are devine and again the service is second to none, polite friendly and efficient! Whilst on my stay I also found out that they are splitting the hotel in to three separate hotels. They are currently building a new section which is due to finish in August 2012. It is going to be a 5* serviced apartment type hotel leaving the Cambridge to remain at 4* and another part of the hotel to be 3* giving lots more variety to those with different budget types! Fantastic concept! Lastly, although it may be seen as a negative, they dont have a gym within the hotel, however they have arranged for guests staying to have free access to a gym around the corner called Boxing Works (www.boxingworks.com.au). It is actually quite nice to leave the hotel especially when it is in bid to get some exercise! Being a regular gym user, I do like a clean and friendly place to work out, this place is great! Although it is mainly martial arts users, the gym was clean, I could find the weights where I needed to, cardio machines were sweat free, no intimidating Personal Trainer looking over my shoulder and the staff are polite & friendly. I recommend doing a Boxercise class I did the 6.15pm class on Monday, it was busy but the atmosphere was amazing! The three nights I spent there were brilliant, and I had a really good nights sleep on all occasions, the bed was comfortable & clean, and the pillows are to die for! The level of service I received was great, the staff were friendly & polite right from the smiley House Keepers to the Managers on reception, always willing to please, they honestly couldn't do more for you. I would certainly recommend this hotel to friends and family members to come and stay!

Both me and my partner were happy with this - but I still think its important to be honest about our time at this hotel. The location is great - only a 25 minute walk through the CBD to the iconic Sydney harbour front - with the bridge and Opera House. The hotel is in an area called Surry Hills - a very trendy area with lots of lovely bars and places to eat just round the corner. Crown Street in particular will leave you spoilt for choice. The hotel rooms are basic but have a good showers and ours was very spacious too. However - we felt let down by our time here. First of all - there was a power cut on one of the nights - with not notice to tell us so when we returned hot and sweaty from our harbour bridge climb. We had to fumble around in pitch black corridors before returning to reception to ask what was going on. We had no air con, no flushing toilet (properly anyway), no hot shower and of great concern there was no fire exit signs lit up anywhere as I am sure they are supposed to be in case of a power cut. It was finally resolved at 11pm at night - it went off at 11.30am. The sheets in our room were not changed for the whole five nights we were there - wet used towels were left on the floor, glasses that we'd used to drink from were not replaced, the sides were left dusty and the fridge was never cleaned - despite the fact it all melted during the power cut. We complained about all the above - but to no effect. The internet is a total rip off - we paid $12 for 2 hours - failing to complete even one task in that time. When we complained - we were told to ring the provider ourselves to get a refund. Not acceptable. The staff tried to help but check out was slow and communication between staff was poor. In all - if you are doing Oz on a budget - I would look at other hotels first before this one.

However, on our first morning there, we were woken at 7.15am to the sound of jack hammering vibrating through the walls and floor. When we called reception to find out what it was ,we were told it was from the construction site next door and they had just begun the jack hammering this week. Management is apparently in negotiation with the builder and council over start times for this part of the build, but it was a real pain to wake up to.

The staff were polite, friendly, helpful and did all they could to make the stay comfortable, but there are several elements beyond their control that make this hotel less than very good. Location wise, the hotel is in a superb location, and walking distance from the George Street shopping area and gorgeous harbour. The rooms are small and minimalistic which I expected given my experience here in the US with the American parent company Comfort Inn, but hoped for better given the price range. The elevators (or \"lifts\" in local lingo) are extremely slow and if the hotel is busy, which it was during my stay, then you're in for a bit of a wait. My rate included breakfast which is decent. The most annoying aspect is that the hotel charges plenty for Internet use, and the optimal deal for my 3 night stay was a week-long internet package that cost 40 AUD. This is the first hotel I've stayed at in this price range that didn't offer complimentary internet service. My problems started when I couldn't get a signal on any device from inside the room, and on the rare occasions that I could the signal was too weak and slow to get anything done. The only place I could get a decent signal was in the lobby, and although the helpful staff did their utmost to rectify the situation it was of no avail. So if you need to work or be online during your stay you should be aware of this issue. To their credit the hotel refunded my 40 AUD since I had to sign up for a separate hotspot service elsewhere. Another issue I had was that despite the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door, the personnel entered the room and woke my up from my jet lag-enduced slumber. I didn't notice who it was, but it wasn't the friendly female house maid I encountered later on that day. It was a male staffer who didn't even bother to apologize. Typically \"do not disturb\" means exactly that, and one would expect the staff to respect one's wish for privacy. The final problem I had was that when entering the hotel late at night the access key doesn't activate the door, nor does the alarm bell work. I had to pound the glass door before the night crew noticed me. But overall, the bad experiences are somewhat compensated by the wonderful and friendly staff.

The shower screens didn't slide on their track, the sink was actually broken, and the soap dish in the shower wasn't attached properly and dumped everything in it onto the floor when you touched it. But the worst was the hot water. At any time of day, regardless of water pressure, the shower was impossible to adjust; first hot, then freezing cold. At one point I even found a setting where it would alternate between hot and cold every five or six seconds, without me touching the taps at all. At one point the water pressure was so low the hot water wouldn't work at all and all I had was a trickle of ice-cold water. But worst of all, my reservation was stuffed up and the staff were convinced I was leaving a day earlier than I was supposed to, despite taking a photocopy of my online reservation information. I had five different people in three hours try to enter my room to evict me, and four phone calls from reception. I shudder to think what would have happened if I wasn't in the room at the time. I spoke to reception a number of times, asking them to let the staff know, which didn't make a difference at all. Then after it had all been sorted out, my swipe card access to my room was revoked. The hotel's feedback page on their website also mysteriously crashes when you send feedback, and my email to them went unanswered.

The Cambridge made a great first impression when I arrived around 8:30 in the morning after an overnight flight to find that I could check into my room right away! My fellow travelers and I had been planning to drop off our bags and explore the city, but it was great to be able to shower and change first. Obviously they can't always do this, but it's nice to know they will let you in first thing in the morning if rooms are available. (Some more friends arriving an hour later weren't so lucky though; we'd taken the last available rooms until later in the day.) The two rooms I had were, clean, large, and modern, and they had a great skyline view. I don't know if these were upgraded from the standard room; I just took what my company booked for me. The room on my first stay had wifi available for a fee. The only drawback to this room was that I heard a lot of street noise and some yelling from a nearby pub around 2 am. On my second stay, the room didn't have wifi coverage and it overlooked the same pub. When I asked at the desk to move, they said they couldn't guarantee any particular room would have wifi, and in any case the rooms they had left were likely to be noisier. However, I didn't hear any loud noises that night. The staff also pointed out that wifi was always available (for the same fee) in the lobby. The location is two blocks off Oxford Street, which is a very lively clubbing district. As I said, there was some street noise, and you see a lot of young people out having fun in the evening (and sometimes the next morning), but I didn't feel that the neighborhood was threatening. There's a large police station right across the street. The train station is about 1 km away, down a hill. This was a easy walk for me with one suitcase. The main shopping areas and Hyde Park, along with any number of restaurants, are also in walking distance. The Circular Quay and the Opera House are farther, but my friends and I still made it on foot. You could also get there by tram or bus or taxi.

A 4 star property would have significantly more options (more meats, cheeses, cereals, different breads, fruit and fruit salad, different yogurt options, a selection of pastries including croissants, danishes etc), but this one didn't! The Cambridge had a very simple cereal, toast and cooked breakfast (English style) that lacked imagination and creativity. I also opened the sliding door to my balcony and the handle fell off. The other issue was the very expensive internet - $20 per day is extortion and needs to be mentioned.

I am not sure why this is the case - they are running FOXTEL through what appears to be an anologue link or something (OK, my tech facts are wrong but bottom line you get my point - poor TV reception!). They don't have free Internet - helloooo? It's 2011! Don't use some poor excuse along the lines of \"...well Sir, you won't find many other hotels in Sydney who do offer free Internet...\" Rubbish! Get ahead of the game, fork out, be a business leader and offer it free for your guests like just about anywhere else in the modern world, don't be so darn stingy! You want international business - give free WiFi rather than a poor option of a third party supplier who charges like a wounded bull!! Don't insult us please. The lobby is a bit of a mish-mash. Depending on what time you arrive you can be waiting for a long time or a really long time. There's a cast of internationals running the desk who generally are pretty good, but the system they are using (whatever it is) is slow. Average check-in is 5-10 minutes (from my three stays, arriving at different times of the day). Most of my standard business hotels can get me a room key and away in under 3 minutes. That's the benchmark for good service that I use and there should be no reason a good receptionist can't deliver it. There is some bizarre ritual of chargin a $1 holding fee or something?? Come on guys, sort that rubbish out. You're the only hotel who has ever done that to me. Take a credit card swipe for goodness sake. But overall I do like staying here because the staff are also friendly and accommodating and the rooms are good and well organised for business overnight stays (the last stay my room window had a view directly to a solid brick wall 2 metres away! Would have been depressing if I was spending any time in my room during the day!). Parking is expensive, but I will concede this one - it is close to CBD Sydney, so it WILL be expensive. For now, you will get my business again Cambridge, but I would like to see some additional service offered if you are going to get better than 3 our of five stars from me.

During my stays I have stayed in many room types at the Cambridge hotel if you are after a economical room.(Sydney can be very expensive especially on the weekends) go for the pool atrium rooms. As on their website these rooms are really \"no fuss\" clean, comfortable and spacious with all the amenities that you need in a hotel room by Sydney standards. I have also stayed in their Premium rooms and Deluxe rooms. These rooms also offer great value for money. A tip if you are going to book ask for the rooms at the back of the hotel as the front facing rooms having great views of the Sydney city can suffer from street noise. The staff I have found to be excellent and obliging and always very helpful with all my requests and queries no matter how difficult they have been. I do not want to name any particular staff as I have found all staff front desk, housekeeping to be all excellent. I have now downloaded the Tripadvisor widget on my phone and intend not to be a bystander and share my experiences in the future with the Tripadvisor community. I highly recommend Cambridge hotel as a hotel that offers great value for money with excellent service.

With this Hotel, you must keep it in perspective in terms of value for money. The room was only $115 a night, which is really at the \"budget\" end of the accommodation scale. We thought that for what we got was pretty good value. The service was good (I found the staff helpful and very professional) the room was clean and had all the facilities we needed (We have 2 young children). It exceeded my expectations a little because I have stayed in more expensive hotels with less impressive facilities. We really liked the beds, they are on the firmer side (which I prefer so I found them particularly comfortable). The location is very good, you're a block away from a large shopping strip in Surry Hills and you can walk to central station in about 15 minutes. I didn't find the area particularly noisy, it's what you'd expect for an inner-city suburb a stone's throw away from a main road. Overall we would happily stay again if we need to be in the area. With all that said, there was a couple of things that I didn't like. It won't put me off staying again but if you are a little pedantic these things may annoy you. Firstly the TV reception was average. I couldn't figure out why that was, the TV itself and connection to the plug was fine, it may have been the wind messing with the aerial. The next thing was that one of the shower screen roller wheels was broken. I could still use the shower, but you'd think maintenance or housekeeping would pick something like that up pretty quick and have it fixed. It would have been a 5 minute job to do so. The next thing was that getting to the car park was annoying, you could use elevators to get down there, but you can't directly use the suites elevators from the car park! You have to go up to the ground floor in another elevator, then switch back to the suites elevator. After a couple of trips for nappies and things it was a bit annoying. The last thing was parking. Hotels that do this irk me because if you're staying in the hotel you should get free parking. Raising all the rooms by $5-$10 probably won't put people off staying if you offer free parking, but if you have a car, a room at this place is now worth $137 per night. That's not so price competitive if you don't need to be in Surry Hills, maybe the hotel needs to think about that one.... You can always find fault if you look for it but we think that ultimately this place is worth a look as it is relatively good value and in close proximity to the main CBD.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu", "Title": "\u201cvery nice rooms, friendly staff and great location!\u201d", "Author": "Juli808", "ReviewID": "UR112822543", "Content": "we were unsatisfied with this other hotel we were in and so we looked online and were very happy to stumble upon this hotel.

The location is excellent. From the Airport you can get on the shuttle bus, or even taxi (for the same price as the shuttle at $25). Check in was pleasant, and the reception staff are always willing to offer assistance. The room was very adequate, clean and reasonably modern for Sydney. Some Foxtel channels are offered. The location two streets back from the lower end (City side) of Oxford st means you are close to walk to the City, Opera house, Kings Cross, Darling Harbour, and Darlinghurst (for shopping). Their is a Convenience store 5 mins walk from the hotel, many restaurants around the surrounding streets of the Cambridge and a fantastic internet cafe. Although I understand their was internet available in the hotel lobby, but I did not check its prices, as I was very happy with the Cafe close by. The Hotel does have a restaurant, which I tried for dinner, and it was good. Never tried the breakfast. Overall, a pleasant hotel, with friendly staff, and a great location to boot.

Both times I was there to visit a relative who was in Darlinghurst and then Redfern, so The Cambridge was well-located, in East Sydney between Darlinghurst and Surry Hills. It's just off the city end of Oxford Street so ideal for convenience shopping or if you are there for nightlife. For dining, Crown Street is only a couple of blocks away. The location is a decent walk from the nearest railway station (St James), especially with heavy luggage, but I imagine there are buses on Oxford, and taxis aren't hard to find. It's a pleasant stroll though Hyde Park into the city, or along Macquarie Street to the Opera House, and the hotel is a good base for exploring Sydney's eastern, inner-southern and inner-western suburbs. For those not familiar with Sydney, it's in a 'racy' but upmarket area and reasonably safe on the street. It's not 'cheap' (compared to hostels) but not overly expensive either, and it is I think worth the money if you want somewhere comfortable and central and are prepared to spend a bit. It would I think suit business travellers. My room at Easter was a Premium Queen Balcony, on an upper floor with very good views (see photos), but it was a bit pokier than the Deluxe Balcony I'd stayed in at Christmas which had similar views. The Premium Queen Balcony had a rather small bathroom and nowhere to put the electric jug (except on the floor next to the power point). By comparison, the Deluxe Balcony also had a small lounge area and an 'office' zone with a desk, which I didn't really need but gave the room a more spacious feel, and more importantly (for me) enough shelf space for said electric jug. Beds are comfortable and the rooms are well-appointed generally with tasteful decor. The balconies have low railings so care is required (not all rooms have balconies by the way)! The service was efficient and friendly but non-intrusive and low-key - the desk staff were responsive when I told them that I couldn't get the TV set in my room to work, and it was fixed when I got back that night. Beyond the reception area, the hotel as a whole was very quiet and I rarely encountered other guests except in the lifts which are phone box-sized (you'd be struggling to fit more than three people in with no luggage). All-up, good value with no serious drawbacks.

Our room (10th floor) was large, clean and comfortable but still pretty loud at night despite the fact that the hotel is off the main streets. Building work right outside when we stayed which started early in the morning, also right next to the police station so sirens are heard even from 10th floor! Nice street off the main roads, felt safe, near to coffee shops, also quite near to the sex shops part of town if that bothers you! A good 30 min walk to Opera house / Bridge / Ferry wharfs - but if the weather is nice you can walk through the botanic gardens. About 20 mins walk from Darling Harbour which was a nice area for good restaurants / bars / nice shopping centre etc. 5 mins from the train station. I would certainly stay here again. One thing I would say is that we booked direct and had no issues, however, every time we passed reception there was guests there who had problems with their room bookings i.e. hotel saying they didn't have the bookings, guests expecting to stay for more nights but rooms not booked etc so don't know if these booked direct or via 3rd party agents so maybe just check before you arrive!

At 12.00pm, after waiting four hours in reception, we asked if the room was now ready, we were told not but if we upgraded to another room, one was ready. This we agreed to out of sheer tiredness. We asked if this room had been ready all along and was told not, which left me to ask, if this room could be got ready, why could our original one not have? no explanation was given. On entering the room we were not disapointed as it was spacious and everything worked, but at an additional charge. The breakfast is very good, but the dining room sparse with plastic furniture. The evening meals are more then adequate, but plain, which actually suited us. The meals are the same price as dining out. One day we wanted to cash some travellers cheques, which they did, but charged us, this is the only hotel of all the four we have used in Australia that did this! Overall the hotel is ok, but I wouldn't like to leave my luggage in the luggage storage room as it is unattended and in the basement car park, which means any other guest with a card could take your bags and no one would be the wiser.

There are lots of good restaurants in the surrounding areas of Darlinghurst and Surrey Hills. We stayed three nights - the first in a very small but adequate room.

I had been staying in a hotel in the suburbs, but we wanted a more central hotel for the weekend. I had read many of the reviews on this site and found myself wondering if I was staying in the same hotel once I arrived. Location: This hotel is in the southern end of the city. I would forget about walking to the main attractions around Circular Quay or Darling Harbour, as it will take you at least 30 minutes. You will find yourself wanting to take a bus or CityRail, but more on that later. Oxford Street is right around the corner and has numerous clubs, pubs, coffee shops and reasonably priced restaurants (Sitar is fantastic). There is a supermarket in Oxford Square on the corner of Oxford and Riley Streets. Be aware that even though Hyde Park is right around the corner, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how any of the rooms in the hotel can have a view with all of the buildings in the way. The proximity to Oxford Street does come with some noise, but our location on the 12th floor helped muffle the sound. Transportation: CityRail is very convenient, but is not as close to the hotel as you might think. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a ten minute walk, entirely up hill, from Museum Station to the hotel. Be aware that there is no lift in Museum Station, so if you are hauling bags from the airport to the hotel, you will have to carry them up several flights of stairs. Trains to and from the airports stop at Museum, just check the monitors for a little airplane symbol. There is an additional gate charge at the airport stations that amounts to $10 one way, or $18 for a 7 day return ticket. It seems like a money grab that people just put up with because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still cheaper than taxis. The CityRail MyMulti ticket is a good deal if you are staying for a couple of days, as the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location will have you riding busses or trains to get to most of the sights. The MyMulti ticket allows you to ride all of the trains, busses and ferries for one price. Just check the zones and make sure you get the correct ticket for where you want to travel, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay for trains to zones 2 and 3 if you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be going that far. The busses are also very convenient, and sometimes easier than the trains. There are bus stops on Oxford Street and you can catch a bus in to Circular Quay and out to Bondai Beach from Oxford Street. The train to Bondai actually goes as far as Bondai Junction and then you will have to get on the same bus that goes right up Oxford Street, so just use the bus to begin with. Rooms: We were given an upgrade from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room that I had booked to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room with a balcony. I have no idea what room they took the pictures of for the web site, but it was far from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It had an uncomfortably firm queen bed with institutional grade bedding. The remainder of the furnishings were below college dormitory grade. The love seat and chair shown in the picture were nowhere to be found. The carpet was a depressing industrial grey. The bathroom was nice but tiny, with a shower and not the tub that is shown on the web site. The balcony was utilitarian, with a view of an alley and the neighboring building, and there was no screen on the large sliding glass door to keep out bugs. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153large flat screen LCD television\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was awkwardly mounted low in the corner, and had a very limited channel lineup, that included what seemed to be the all soccer channel and the all cricket channel. With only ten rooms to a floor, it is hard to get a room that is not close to the elevator, and therefore subject to noise from drunk guests waiting for the elevator late at night. Public Areas: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the hotel restaurant. There is a Gloria Jean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Coffee on Oxford Street where you can get breakfast for two for less than one can eat in the hotel. The lobby is clean and functional. When we arrived, our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready and my wife wanted to shower off 27 hours of travel. They gave us soap, shampoo, a towel and a key to the pool. The shower room by the pool did not have a lock on the door, and there is no mirror for hair, makeup, shaving, etc. The pool is tiny and the area around the pool had all the charm of a prison cell block. Internet Access: The WiFi signal was strong on the 12th floor and it seemed that they had the hotel well covered, but $20 a day seemed excessive. Similar grade hotels in the States and Europe include it for free. In summary, if you go in to this hotel with the right expectations, it will serve its purposes, and it is priced accordingly considering the cost of other hotels in Sydney. I would not go out of my way to stay here, but would consider it again.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australian and UK party", "Title": "\u201cGreat Quality\u201d", "Author": "adventurers_9", "ReviewID": "UR87226755", "Content": "This was just such a great & friendly hotel!

The two nights at the Cambridge were kind of at the last minute because of a change in our plans. I have written a review of the Radisson as well. We stayed at the Cambridge mainly we were on a budget and were out and about during our stay in Sydney. The front desk staff was very helpful and professional. The Premium Queen room with a balcony was very clean and comfortable. The hotel is about a 20 - 30 minute walk to Darling Harbor. The reasons we gave the hotel a 3 star rating was because of the noise and bathroom. Our hotel room faced Riley Street, from which we could hear music. I don't know if there was a club or bar nearby, but the music was noticeably loud. Also, our room was near the elevator, so we could hear the other guests, 20-year-olds, coming in late from a night on the town and leaving the next morning. We could even hear room service knocking on the door late at night and the guests speaking with him. We slept better the next night since it was basically my wife and I staying on the floor. However, the next morning around 7am, we were woken by construction noise. It seems that work begins around 7am in Australia. Some reviewers have commented on not experiencing noise problems; others have. I guess it depends on the location of the room, the type of guests on your floor, and which nights you stay. The other issue is the bathroom and shower were small. The shower door is on a track and sometimes it was dragging when trying to close it.

The room I was given, on the second floor, was certainly nothing like a 4* hotel (although I'm usually a 5* traveler, so might be a bit unrealistic). The bedroom was spacious and well furnished with an excellent bed. It was clean and the air conditioning worked well. On the downside, the old CRT TV (haven't seen one for years!) wasn't tuned properly nor did the remote control work well. The room was adjacent to the pool area which resulted in considerable noise in the evenings. The first time it was kids in the pool (which was meant to shut at 2000) after 2200. The second night some people decided to have a late night chat by the pool. Neither of these should be a problem if it wasn't for the hotel's paper-thin walls. On the third night it was people in a nearby room singing at 0100! Reception did, however, deal with all incidents well. The bathroom was far from satisfactory. The fittings were old and tired with many poorly repaired chips in the sanitary-ware. The shower was weak and didn't get a good temperature - being either too hot or too cold. The tiles were peeling. The view from the window was an apartment block/ service yard. This meant early morning disturbances from service vehicles. I had two breakfasts at the restaurant. They were OK, but the choice and quality was poor. I wouldn't bother. The location of the hotel should also be noted. It is located in Sydney's gay area. Although I'm not gay this wasn't a problem. In fact, the atmosphere was a lot less threatening than in other parts of a city. However, there are a large number of sex shops and various fetish retail outlets on Oxford Street close to the hotel which may be a concern for children. I don't think I'd want to stay here with a family, but it would be great for a couple! Furthermore, the section of Riley Street between the hotel and Oxford Street is poorly lit and felt threatening. A major plus of the hotel is that the staff were very helpful. On balance it was OK for a cheap hotel but don't expect anything more than a Motel. In future I'd probably spend a bit more and stay at something like a Marriott so I know what I'm getting.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "York England UK", "Title": "\u201cHuge room with balcony\u201d", "Author": "ebors", "ReviewID": "UR60883979", "Content": "We arrived early and our room was ready but they wanted $20 for early check-in which was disappointing - other hotels in the area did not charge this as our other cruisers informed us.

Staff - they were brilliant, always polite and helpful. They asked about any problems, I said about noise and they were going to put me in a different room if it continued. It kind of did but I didn't mention it again. The room was very nice, balcony was a great size, all nice and tidy and clean. Bathroom was decent, air con was very quiet which was great. The location is OK, we walked out most evenings and late in to the night and although we never had a problem, I didn't think it was as safe as staying at Citigate Central (CC) where I stayed last year. I can only compare against this hotel, but please note Citigate is more expensive. If Cambridge can sort out a few problems then I'd say they'd almost be equal. the bar is nice and i like all the trendy lighting going on the in the lounge/reception/bar/lifts etc. Negatives: - noise - single glazing windows means very noisy due to the location. it rained our first two nights and this made the problem worse. we were on the 8th floor and could hear people talking (although probably loudly) on the streets late at night. Some girls kept us up 2 nights (till about 2-3am) by being on the balcony next door talking, we didn't complain, but they weren't talking loudly. After about 4 days we probably got used to the noise more and slept better. police station is opposite but that doesn't produce to much noise. - breakfast - i wanted to like it, but it was a buffet for about $13.95. The food quality was low. once was enough, i expected better. i would have preferred to pay more for a better quality product. If you get over the noise issue, and perhaps either have snack bars in your room, or get breakfast elsewhere, then this hotel is very good value for money. As I said, the staff really were great and very helpful. I was able to check in at about 10am which was fantastic. I really wanted to like this place, but the noise by single glazing lets it down. There is a swimming pool but I didn't use this. Do I recommend it? Well it depends on your budget. For the cost you might not get better as it's great value. Next time I go to Sydney, I will certainly try for Citigate Central and compare the prices, try to get a deal there.

Bed was comfortable and the room was neat and tidy which is good. 9.30am Sunday the fire alarm was set off after 10 mins we were told it was due to testing. Since we were awake we went down to have a full buffet breakfast which consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon and toast.... not very full by my standards. I advised reception on check out that I was not impressed the staff there didn't apologize we paid cash for this stay although they charged my card to so ended up paying double for one night and had to phone them to get them to refund the money to my card.

Little things were done that we haven't seen in hotels for a long time.

The duty manager assured us he would take care of things.We found our room to be marginally bigger however the rollaway bed was back!
