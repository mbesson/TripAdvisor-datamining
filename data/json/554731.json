We stayed during the May day long weekend which also happened to be popes beautification weekend. We paid 100Euros/night and have stayed at better hotels for the same price in Europe (Stayed for 100Euros/night in Switzerland and it was fantastic considering the cost of living of Switzerland) First impressions of the hotel - scary. There is a name board before a huge wooden door which does not appear like a hotel. But there is a buzzer outside the door with the name - hotel oriente. We entered a bit shocked only to find a shoddy looking lift which required a key to operate. Finally we carried our heavy bags to the first floor and were greeted at the reception. The person at the reception took our passports and booking print out and offered to let us use the lift but told us it's only a welcome treat \u2013 lucky us ;) The reception and the hotel area inside the building looked quite pleasant when compared to the building itself. The room was of good size but the look of the building still left us a bit shocked. The second night when we came back to our room the towels weren\u2019t changed; bed not made nor was our shower gel refilled. On asking reception, we were told that the towels would be changed only once and shower gel was complimentary just for day 1. The room had an ac but costs an extra 10 euro per night. Our booking said the price was inclusive of taxes but when we checked out we were asked to pay extra and was told it was tourist tax. We paid it, a receipt was not offered automatically so we asked for one which seemed to annoy the guy a bit. We left our luggage in the reception on the last day and came back after a few hours; the guy at the desk was nice enough to let us use the rickety lift to carry our suitcase downstairs. Breakfast: Breakfast was included in our price but never have I had just a croissant and a piece of bread as breakfast in a hotel. The breakfast was pre-kept in our plate\u2019s everyday - one croissant, 3 pieces of bread for two of us, a packet of rusk and coffee or tea. Highlight \u2013 coffee! Conclusion: Location \u2013 Great. Nearest station is Vittorio Emmanuel about 3 min from the hotel Room \u2013 Ok. Good size Service & Breakfast - Terrible Hotel in general \u2013 Poor \u2013 Shabby entry, scary lift. At 100 Euros / night it\u2019s a 1.5/5 value for money!", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading UK", "Title": "\u201cQuirky hotel in a great central location\u201d", "Author": "cdowney", "ReviewID": "UR124777287", "Content": "The Oriente, in Rome's China town, is fine if you know what to expect. A few floors of a very old apartment block have been made into a hotel : you can't use the lift so be prepared for a bit of a hike to reception, then more to your rooms. We were a school group, they sensibly put the boys one side of reception and everyone else on a different floor. Breakfast was basic, rolls, croissants, butter and jam. Rooms were like a student hostel. All three guys in reception were very helpful. It was fine for our purpose: would have been a bit gutted if I'd come for a romantic weekend.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dartford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAverage Rome Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mikemanfreeman", "ReviewID": "UR120612703", "Content": "We stayed in the Oriente in September for 3 nights to see the sights of ancient Rome! The place is fantastic, well worth a visit. Our hotel experience was fine - nothing exceptional to report, other than the extremely friendly, multi lingual front of house. He was ever so friendly and gave us lots of good advice. Look out for the man with glasses 8-) One thing I should point out - there is an old man who people keep mentioning on here. We saw him quite alot during our visit. He doesn't speak much English, smokes alot and seems quite grumpy. To be frank, we found alot of Italians to be like that! But the others are fantastic - friendly, welcoming, happy and kind. Depends what sort of day you catch them on :) but he did make us feel a little on edge. Anyway, the room was clean and very cosy. But we didn't come for the hotel so it didn't matter to us. I would suggest that visitors don't go for the breakfast as it is just coffee, a roll and a croissant which I find a bit of a rip off for a tenner! You pay extra for the air conditioning, it is not included in the price of the room. Also, beware that the elevator is not for guest use. So if you are on a high floor, enjoy the walk! All in all, an ok stay at the Hotel Oriente. Just make sure you get your room for a good price otherwise I would say look elsewhere.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "A\u00e7ores", "Title": "\u201cVery good for the price\u201d", "Author": "A M", "ReviewID": "UR119380539", "Content": "The building where the hotel is located is quite old, but the floors that belong to the hotel are recent.

The rooms have TV, air conditioning and private bathroom (with hair dryer). For breakfast there was a Croissant, toasts with jam, orange juice, milk, coffee or tea.

We showed up only to find out that there was no air conditioning in our room and it was 35 degrees outside. I went to the desk and when they explained that we had to request it (I checked the website and it was not clearly an option to do so) I asked if they had one available and offered to pay if there was a price difference. They said there was not. So I went to book another hotel. When I went to check out, they said they did have a room available with air conditioning, and I got very upset that the same person said there was not one only 30 minutes before. The room had a squeaky bed, no safe and looked run down. The area also made me uncomfortable. I have stayed in two other extremely nice hotels in Rome on this trip that were a similar price but offered so much more. In their defence they did not charge us for cancelling, but that was only after I got so upset and said I was going to write them up. They blocked me from writing a review on venere where I booked.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cclean and good location\u201d", "Author": "50tourers", "ReviewID": "UR13684001", "Content": "We booked the hotel for a special occasion and was suprised by the size of the room, small but in Rome you dont spend all day in there. The furniture was well used but the beds were comfortable (and I am a big guy) and everything was spotless. The bathroom was small but new and again clean. The stairs could be a problem for some but not if you are able to walk around Rome all day. Rome is a large city and the hotel is not in the best area but we felt safe and shops and resturants are good in the local area. It is a great location for just walking around Rome but also the Metro is close also the Terminni is just a short walk. On reflection the hotel is great for a long week end break and the breakfast is ample to get you going in the morning. Thanks to the whole family who put up with our poor attempts at Italian and late arrival on the Friday. Just remember you get what you pay for and you will like this hotel.

Hotel Reception is 2 storeys up, our room on the 5th floor. Lift can only be used when accompanied by the manager. When he wasn't avaliable, my mother had to either struggle up or wait for him. Asked for twin room, got double. The walls are paper thin. Many rowdy teenagers on our floor making noise until very late - Luckily a 24 hour chemist is directly opposite to get earplugs from. Location is ideal, minutes from Colosseum, Train/metro Station and many other places of interest. Local area is rundown but we, as two single females, walked around the streets late and felt perfectly safe. Staff were pleasant and breakfast was adequate. Served until 10 am.
