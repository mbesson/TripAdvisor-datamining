Food is okay and we only ordered once, Spaghetti from the Kid's Room Service Menu. The main disadvantage of this hotel is bad check-in. It took us whole 2 hours to Check in. First the check-in time is 2 PM and they do not allow early check-ins at all. After 2 PM they were not able to meet our requirement of Non-Smoking Nearby rooms with our friends. They gave us rooms on different floors. Reception staff is rude some times and starts to raise their voices on petty issues. I was just explaining about our requirement as 2 families and she wouldn't listen. Anyways, the main ease of this hotel is vicinity to Little India and Mustafa Shopping Centre which is a bliss to us Indians.

Did I mention that I had to wait in line without any acknowledgment and the only Front Desk agent on duty assisted someone else who jumped the queue? The same Front Desk agent then assisted a group with elevator access and watched the elevator door close right in front of me. Sigh! Where is the hospitality? Room is small, TV is really old, but most importantly, cleanliness must be improved. Upon entering the room for the first time, the side of the basin was smeared with blue toothpaste and the shelf below had coffee stains. There were hair in the drawer and the trash was not emptied. Anti-slip mat was filthy and bed linen was stained. I cleaned up whatever I could as I did not want to bother the Housekeepers. There was no turndown service and bathrobes. I did not even have a room service menu until I asked for it. When I finally got hold of one, I ordered Chicken Caeser Salad which came without the chicken. Hilarious? This was all true.

This was supposed to be a stop over to refresh in preparation for an ongoing flight, but we didn't receive the rest we were hoping to get. There is a pool which is nice with a bar. The restaurant is fair but over priced as well. The location is a bit too far away from the attractions of Singapore.

Look for discount rate.\u201d", "Author": "DanoCanada", "ReviewID": "UR124042077", "Content": "We\u2019ve been to Singapore over 10 times in the last 8 years. This year, we have stayed at the Wangz, the Albert Court Village and the Park Royal on Beach. Its sister hotel on Kitchener is priced slightly lower, serves quite a different clientele and is located in Little India, which is also quite different. But it\u2019s still a good hotel for its price. Granted we got it at a fantastic price, over 50 per cent off on Agoda ($98), so my comments have to be taken in that light. But the Park Royal on Kitchener is a comfortable, clean hotel if you can get it for a good price and you don\u2019t mind a bit of a metro ride to get to the heart of Singapore. It does not warrant the rack rate of $200++, but is very good value at the $90 to $110 range. Pluses: 1. Room size: The rooms are a good size, but not as big as at the Park Royal on Beach and a slightly more tired looking. They have a mini fridge and very comfortable bed. 2. Service: We had good service. Everyone was courteous, helpful, and responsive. But the front desk service was quite slow (see below). Staff were quite good, however, about ordering taxis and suggested that we save $8 for the booking charge by simply getting one off the street. They have a nifty system of turning on a lighted sign by the roadside, which alerts passing taxis. We were able to get a taxi in 5 minutes at 3:30 a.m. without any difficulty this way. 3. Restaurants: We didn\u2019t eat there, mainly because there are so many more affordable restaurants in the mall across the street and in Little India. But they do have a Happy Hour. 4. Location \u2013 This is not as well located as the Park Royal on Beach unless you want to be in Little India, but there is the Farrer Park MRT (metro) across the street and two shopping malls and lots of restaurants. By metro it is not far to anywhere in Singapore. 5. Free wifi was included in our room. 6. Pool \u2013 It\u2019s not a big or as nice as at the Beach location, but it is adequate. 7. Business centre: Services are chargeable. One plus, however, is the post office on the lower level under the hotel. 9. Free daily newspaper 10. Noise: Our room was exceptionally quiet even though we faced the mall and a busy street. Negatives: 1. Front Desk: Checking in and out can be a problem because of the bus tours and large groups that seem to book here. The lobby area was always crowded in marked contrast to the Park Royal on Beach where it was always quiet and never busy. It serves quite a different clientele than the Beach road hotel \u2013 more tour groups and less business people. 2. Breakfast was not included at the rate we got, but that is understandable. However, we had to request the free bottles of water standard in every hotel we have stayed at in Southeast Asia and they made an exception for us. But we had to argue for them every day. 3. The elevators are small and extremely slow. 4. TV was an older model (not LCD) with very limited English channel selection. 5. Location: It\u2019s not as conveniently located as the other hotels we stayed at downtown even with the MRT at the door. Taxi rides from the centre will be more expensive. 6. Noise: There is a power plant or large AC unit on the third floor in the northwest corner of the building that is very noisy. Our room wasn\u2019t located near it, so it was not a problem for us, but it might be for rooms in that area.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Varese, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGood location, clean, and friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "easybus", "ReviewID": "UR123775648", "Content": "Used as a getting to know Singapore location.

I was very impressed with the breakfast, especially as a vegetarian I found a special selection with great Chinese and Indian dishes. There is also western food like omelets, bakery items, etc. Staff here were also very good-- I asked for coffee and later realised it was self-service, but the staff member smilingly served me coffee to my table.

Let me start by saying that I spent 4 nights in this hotel and christmas. The good thing about this hotel is the location. Apart from Mustafa being on the rear side (2 mins walk), the place is centrally located and also well connected by bus, tube and taxis. Most of the hot spots would be 5-10 mins by Taxi and so you shell out less. I arrived at the hotel at 8 am while the hotel had its standard checkin time at 2 pm. Despite being a GHA member and requesting an early checkin 3 months prior to arrival, I had to go through the usual dance and fish of the reception staff to get 1 room. By the way I took my family so had 2 rooms booked. It was certainly not a welcome gesture that I had. The reception staff kept fooling me by asking more and more time in units of an hour every hour till 2 pm when they finally gave the 2nd room. I had booked a tour to Sentosa from the same hotel and that departed at 2 pm and hence requested that I need to freshen up before going out. No rationale or logic seemed to dawn on the reception staff. Besides there are a few guys on the front desk who are pretty rude and actually not suited for hospitality business but also there were a few ladies who could atleast empathize with you if not help you out of the situation. The rooms were nothing great. Old furnitures, old carpet, old 1980 type television set, no phone in the bathroom and avoid looking at the curtains carefully - for you might see blood stains and other dirty stuff. Walls were more or less clean for my room. Bathroom was redone and hence wasn't that bad. Lighting was appropriate but quality of toileteries was sub-standard. Breakfast was good. They have a decent menu to choose from and the quality of food was also satisfactory. I didnt eat anything else in the hotel. Wifi was free for me in the rooms. You have to crib a little for the complimentary water bottles (for GHA members - water bottles was complimentary). The travel desk in the hotel (RMZ tours) is good. They pick you up from the hotel and take you on guided tours. I did quite a few tours with them and was happy with their behavior and quality of the tours. The guys charge you reasonably for the tours and if you plan to make your arrangements you won't save much. Besides, the hotel itself, there is a mall (City Square Mall) opposite to the hotel apart from Mustafa. Take a round trip around the hotel, you would find a lot of eating places. There are a few telephone booths on the road side offering you the easiest and cheapest mode of calling - insert coins and talk. Ah.. dont forget to prefix 019 before dialling the country code. It's not mentioned there in English. Overall Singapore is a good place to visit especially your kids would love them. If you can spend a little more than Park Royal, you can choose from Pan Pacific or some other hotels on the Orchard road may be preferrable but season time things could be very different :)", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gurgaon, India", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "Manika_Gupta", "ReviewID": "UR122745159", "Content": "We stayed for 5 days in Park royal, Kitchner road from 26th Dec - 30th Dec and our experience was wonderful.

This hotel is located in the Little India area of Singapore. It's right next door to the Mustafa Centre, which is a 24 hour shopping centre. The area itself can get a big crowded, especially on Sundays as this is when the migrant workers get their day off. Being 6ft tall and blonde, I certainly got a few stares whilst walking around Little India, after a while it didnt bother me as I did stick out like a sore thumb!! There is an MRT station across from the hotel and this allows easy access to the major tourist areas of Singapore, ie Orchard Road, Clarke Quay, Marina Bay. It's a very cheap and quick way of travelling round Singapore and you get a 1 dollar refund when you hand back your ticket, which only costs around 2 dollars!!! During our stay we visited Marina Bay and the huge hotel with the skypark running across the top which looks like a big boat. I would recommend that you visit the skypark, it costs 20 dollars and is well worth it, the views are extraordinary, you get a 360 degree view of Singapore, beware though, if you have a drink in the bar here, they charged us 36 dollars for 2 small bottles of tiger beer, this is about \u00a318. It was worth it for the view alone!! Talking of alcohol, Singapore can be very expensive if you want to go out for a drink, especially the more upmarket areas such as Clarke Quay and Orchard Road. Right next door to the hotel is a food court area, which has seating outside and this is where the locals drink. You can get a large bottle of Tiger beer for under 6 dollars, which is around \u00a33, we drank here all the time and on talking terms with the staff. Across from the hotel is a shopping mall which has a fantastic food court. I had the most amazing bento box with terriyaki chicken, miso soup, jasmine rice, salad and tempura prawns for 5 dollars!!!

We found the staff in the Club lounge to be warm, friendly and extremely helpful to my whole family. In fact, I would say that they were the ones who made our stay extra pleasant. In addition, I dropped a bunch of keys in the lobby when I checked out yesterday. I only discovered my loss after arriving home in Sarawak last night. I emailed the hotel this afternoon and, a couple of hours later, I received a call from Ms Cindy Wong, the Guest Relations Manager to inform me that they had found it. She promised to courier the keys back to me the next day. Now, that's great service for you. The location of the hotel is good because the MRT is so near. It was a direct MRT ride to Vivocity in Harbourfront and, from there, a short hop to Sentosa. Very convenient. Likewise, Mustaffa Centre is directly behind the hotel - lots of bargains. City Square is just across the road. I agree that the hotel breakfast is nothing to shout about. It was bacon and eggs for me every morning. After 3 days, we decided to forgo the complimentary breakfast to try the local food around the hotel. There are eating places all round the hotel and I advise you to try them out. If I have one gripe with the hotel, it is the shower. Even on the Club floor, the shower is in a narrow high bathtub.

As other reviewers have mentioned the location is good, opposite a new small shopping mall and a MRT station. Head the other way and you can experience Little India and lots of great smells and little shops and restaurants. However the hotel is way off the mark in terms of it's brand. We stayed in Parkroyal Malaysia prior to this stay and we were extremely let down. We opted for Orchid Club level, and this was a waste of time. We were put in a room that looked like the decor hadn't been upgraded since the 80's. Shower over a high bathtub anyone? Bathroom that was tinier than those you see in European cities. The mattress on the bed was like wood - I love hard mattresses but this was ridiculous. The Orchid Club lounge was like a small function room, again with peeling carpet and dated furniture. The food selection was average and the staff really couldn't be bothered with us. Clearly management hasn't empowered the staff to go the extra mile or use their initiative. In the four days we were there we never saw any staff member at the gym and a number of pieces of equipment weren't working, but we had no one to tell. We were supposed to get a paper, and we got one on one out of the four days we were there. No big things on their own, but they all added up to a lack of interest in guest wellbeing. For a 5 star brand this is unacceptable, they are certainly more of 3 star level. As part of the Parkroyal brand, the level of furnishings and staff helpfulness is at odds with other hotels we have stayed in from the same chain. You chose a chain based on the expectation that the management have built a similar culture in each property which will pass through to the staff and in turn they way they treat the guest. Not sure if I will chose Parkroyal again based on this experience. To their credit the manager contacted me immediately after I completed their survey, however that is the only follow up I've received i.e. the usual standard we are sorry for your experience speil. When will we start to see real results i.e. if you pay for a product and the product doesn't do what it's supposed to (like a computer or similar) then you get a refund. Hotels get to keep the revenue you provide them, even if they don't provide you with the type of service they market themselves to deliver. Anyway Singapore is a great place to spend a few days, lots to do - the Flyer is fun, and the Zoo is amazing.

Directly opposite the City Square Mall . Never hurts to have a mall right opposite the hotel, especially for digestion pills after the fantastic chilli crab at Mattar Road! Also 7-Eleven is right around the corner. 3. Little India - If you have a hankering for Indian cuisine, then you are at the right spot! Also Mustafa Center is nearby which has almost everything. Worth to pay a visit! Cons: 1. What Wi-fi? 2. Breakfast menu is very average like straight out of Asian Hotel 101 - got your dim sum, fried eggs, bacon, cornflakes. Nothing exciting catches the eye and the taste-buds 3. Superior room feels like a budget hotel - Hard mattress, no hair dryer, tiny CRT TV, noisy aircon, no weighing scale, no complimentary mineral water bottles provided.

Now come the areas where they can definitely improve on: - Breakfast was less than inspiring. Definitely not worth the extra S$20. While the spread is not too bad, the food just lacked flavour and oomph. Was quite disappointed. - On some nights, there are express/tour busses waiting for passengers in the area which meant plenty of people walking around the sides of the hotel. Was extremely crowded during that time. - I had a room right at the edge (Deluxe?) on the 18th floor and the WiFi signal was kinda weak. - Checkout staff was robotic. A smile and friendly remark would go a long way in the hospitality industry. - One evening, i walk down to the gym area in search of the steam bath. I went down wearing the hotel-provided in-room slippers (those white cotton ones). Just at the door of the gym, I asked a staff member where the steam bath was.

The superior room we booked was very spacious with king size bed and a large drawing area to move around. Room was extremely clean and the toilets 100% hygenic. The staff were very courteous and guiding. Hotel serves buffet breakfast in which a lot of indian vegetarian dishes were available. The negative point was that everyday the items were same. But the dishes were tasty and hygenic. One of the most important plus points of this hotel is its proximity to Little India. Since we are south Indian vegetarians, the location proved good for us due to its closeness to some of the most famous south indian veg restaurants in Singapore such as Komala Vilas, Ananda Bhawan etc. Just behind the hotel is Singapore's famous super market Mustafa Centre where you will get each and everything.

(As the guide books recommend, you need to use taxis to get around if you are on a short stay, so this need not matter much). Little India is a strongly mono-ethnic zone (with mainly men visible) and is not very tourist-friendly for visitors with different background. The hotel is showing its age a bit, but is comfortable enough. Like many such hotels it is hard to get double rooms, as opposed to twins with a fixed console between the beds. The beds were soft enough and the airconditioning unobtrusive. Wifi was free and available without password or registration, which is a big plus, given the number of hotels that see this as an opportunity to charge extra. There was a lot of fussing over bags which may be fine if you have a lot and need help, but if you are an independent minded traveller travelling you would rather take them to your rooms themselves, and not have to wait for your post-12-hour-flight shower.

I wanted a single queen size bed and it was not available on the first day. They took my request to transfer me the next day to the room with queen size bed, which they did. Room was of decent size, not too small and not too large. Somehow I did not like the bathrooms and interiors. It was not upto the 4 star rating.

If you are interested in message and reflexology, the services are available at a cost. They also organised to keep the luggage and send it directly to Airport since we were checking out and going Star Cruise for 2 nights before flying back to India. Therefore, we did not have the headache of carrying the bulky suitcases on the cruise. Off course this service comes at a cost. Finally, my recommendation is that if you like to stay closer to little India and do shopping leisurely at Mustafa this is the place.

Coffee mugs should be cleaned on a daily basis but afraid that was not the case in our one bedroom suite... The Breakfast Buffet had a healthy spread but for people with special requirements or diets the F&B department need to seperate the meets from the vegan dishes. For instance the Pork sausage was in the same area as hash browns and other foods that could have been consumed by vegans or indviduals with speacial diets....however due to the fact that the meats were placed in an open offering area it is very likely that the tongs used to pick up the meat dishes were being contaiminated with the veg dishes....as such for strict purity reasons this was not feasible for some.

Pool area was pretty much empty so we had the place to oursleves everytime we went. There are rooms to change into which was very convinient. What makes this hotel so worth the money is the location. It can't be beat. I ate breakfast the first day and it was very adequate. The usual egg stations where you can get eggs any way you liked, good choice of breads, cereal, juices, several hot dishes. However, i noiced after several outings that the immediate neigbnorhoold was dotted with little eateries and cafe shops. As a result, I started skipping breakfast and instead frequented these local eating spots. You always know its a good thing when the locals are filling up the place. One place comes to mind is the small kopitiam on the right side of the hotel on the main street which eventually leads to Mustafa, the 24 hour department store. I ate breakfast and lunch there for like 5/7 SIN dollars and it was great. Great Keema and naan fresh off the tandoor. There is a new chic mall right across the street. Those of you who want to stick to the traditional Western fare, are going to love the choice of all the fast food joints.

The entrance porch and lobby, were imaculate, so many wonderfull floral displays of Orchids.... have since bought these on arrival home too!......... we arrived late evening and the staff were so so helpful, polite and courteous....... nothing was a problem..... our family party consisted of 5, so we had 2 rooms, both very spacious, spotlessly clean, really lovely. As our next flight was late the next evening, and checkout being mid morning, the hotel are very good at allowing you to vacate your room, but hang about until you are ready to leave for your flights, they do this by having secure storage for your baggage to be held, enabling the use of all hotel facilities, pool, lounge, bar, dining room etc..... and room for changing/showering in. The hotel is an easy very short walk from the main big City Center Shopping Mall, I dont think I have ever been anywhere as big, this is a totally eco friendly shopping centre, solar power.... etc etc.... set in beautiful gardens....really lovely, and so much to see inside....so many places to see and visit, sadly we werent there long enough to do very much..... but what we did pack in we loved.............. again as this was the 12/13th January.... all city centre shops were preparing the most wonderful decoratations to welcome the New Year, so its a lovely time of year to see Singapore............... we spent our full day that we did have, shopping,sightseeing, spending time at the lovely pools..... then enjoying a lovely meal in the restaruant before late departure, even then , they have a shuttle service to the airport which is great, and they even come into the waiting lounge and call your name!!! All in all, we would highly recommend this hotel, beautiful surroundings, so clean, luxurious, the staff are a credit to the hotel, with outstanding hospitality, what a welcome..... well worth the visit.... we have the most wonderful memories and photos that will be with us forever of our, all beit short stopover in Singapore, and the ParkRoyal enhanced those memories..... thankyou...", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath", "Title": "\u201cImpersonal service , lack of organisation\u201d", "Author": "PookyBath", "ReviewID": "UR116974650", "Content": "This hotel had a record of our booking through Travelmood, but did not have a room available for us.

We chose this hotel based on the recommendation of a friend. W staed therer for 5 nights and overall we were satisfied with the hotel and it met our expectations and requirements Location - The Hotel is located bang in Little India and perhaps the only decent one there(depends on our definition i suppose). It is surrounded by a host of India restaurants which open early and close late. So food was no problem for our kiddo who is rather finicky. Recommended especially for people with specific veg requirements (though we are not). Komala`s restaurant is just a few metres away. The metro station is just opposite the hotel. Mustafa is just behind if one wants to shop buy anything. Most cabs stop in front of the lobby and that is convenient too. Check in process was quick and smooth, given that we had pre booked and paid in advance. Room - We paid a very slight premium and got a room on the 18th floor. The advantage we found out later, is that there are2 separate lifts which service 18th and above floors which is a distinct advantage. The room was comfortable, compact and clean. The view was good and not facing another building(it was overlooking serangoon road and an open ground behind it. Service - was prompt and polite. When we speid a nail that had come loose on the floor, it was immediately attended to. No other reason to ask for housekeeping. Food - we never had to eat in the hotel, given the location. But the impression(high level) of was leaning towards chinese cuisine (not the type served in India) and a bit expensive. We also booked a sentosa tour through the hotel, but it was just a generic tour which we were part of. Never got a chance to check out any other faciities.

One warning though, the edge to the baths are very high and as a person on the short side I found them very hard to get in and out of. Something to think about if you happen to be disabled in anyway. Close to MRT and fantastic shopping mall across the road. Had a great stay - until we went to check out...... We were told that our accomodation bill was outstanding despite being fully paid to the travel agent back in Feb. The admin staff at the time promised to get it sorted out and get back to us via email as soon as possible and that nothing would be charged to our credit card as the number had been 'dumped' from the system. That was a lie ! After two days waiting for some type of communication regarding the investigation of where our money went I checked my credit card statement. Low and behold they had charged us over $4000 ! It is several days later and still no response from the hotel even after sending them an email requesting some correspondence regarding the mix up. They had no authorisation to make this deduction and have so far still not answered my email seeking to resolve this problem. Luckily the travel agent we dealt with is helping and the bank is lodging a dispute against them. Why didn't they alert us to the problem as we checked in?

You get reimbursed the GST for anything you buy there and their currency exchange rates are good. There's also another mall across the road as well as a metro station. The hotel is in Little India, so for Indians, that's good as there are many Indian restaurants around if you feel a bit home sick or are a vegetarian.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "India", "Title": "\u201cMy June 1st week in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "kousalya", "ReviewID": "UR68376221", "Content": "Stayed in Hotel Park Royal in Kitchener Road.

However I did notice many people returning without booking or had some issues with bookings as the hotel is mostly booked. Hence you might want to book it in advance before checking in. Did not have any hassles in particular at the hotel and the staff was quite friendly however checking in took 30 mins, could be my bad luck as most of the guests were checking in then. You may also want to note their check in time mentioned on their site which is around 12:00 if I am not mistaken. Connectivity: You may take a MRT (Mass Rapid Transport) i.e. metro rail, from the Changi airport till Ferrer Park station. The hotel is at 2 mins walking distance from the metro station which implies excellent connectivity for any place around Singapore through MRT. Since it is close to the city/commercial area location is quite suited for the ones looking for something close to offices. Specially for Indians the nearby locality rightly called 'Little India' suits well for food and other requirements.

It took 45 minutes for me to check-in.. alright atleast I checked-in. I booked the hotel on Apr 20 and have specifically requested for King Bed, got the written confirmation of same, but when i checked-in, they said that they do not have king bed available and i had to accommodate in a twin bed room. Imagine, with a small child (sharing bed), how will we accommodate with twin beds. They were not ready to upgrade and were more keen on me taking an extra bed for the child at a price... cross selling. I spoke to the reservations manager on duty and she was very rude (unlike people in the hospitality industry) and was not willing to accommodate me in a king bed room. After 2 hours of argument, she was willing to change my room next day into King Bed room. Atleast I got something for rest of my stay... She also mentioned that they will join the beds and attached is the picture of the room after they joined the beds. Apparently, when they changed the location of beds, the entire floor was dirty. their cleanliness staff does not clean the under bed area... We somehow spent a night and were looking forward to a new room next day. Next day, we got our rooms in the evening when we returned from sightseeing and apparently this time we got King Bed, but the furniture was broken, TV not working, Shower panel not working properly... we complained again and the staff replied that you always complaint and never compromise... what an attitude of a hotel staff. We are paying to listen to all this crap... Neverthless, we decided that we will never return to this hotel and will write a strong letter to the hotel management. I wrote to the hotel management and still waiting for their answer. I do not recommend this hotel to any of the traveler.

Indian restaurants (Saravana Bhavan, Komalas, Ananda Bhavan) located nearby. Also just behind this place is the 24 hour Mustafa shopping centre. Since its open throughout the night, one can always hop in at the wee hours and shop rather than putting in daytime. Another advantage of Mustafa is that they offer the best currency exchange rates in Singapore and accept most of the known currencies (Indian Rupee included) The service is quick, friendly and with a smile The buffet breakfast spread is good even for vegetarians. The rooms are clean and the housekeeping staff really efficient. Overall, great service with just one word of caution on the tour desk. The travel / tour desk is manned by staff (very specifically, Mala from RMG Tours) which seem friendly but do not really mean to deliver. My experience was bad when I booked for our Universal Studios tour thru them. Mala did not bother to tell us that every visitor at Universal Studios is entitled for meal and souvenir vouchers worth SGD10. It was only after we returned from the place did some fellow hotel guest mentioned this to me. When Mala was asked about this she was curt and said that they are not supposed to tell this to the visitors and it is the responsibility of Universal Studios to inform the visitors.

Upon arrival in Singapore and upon returning from KL. Helpfulness of the staff seemed to be mainly dependent on the rush of customers they were exposed to, though there weren\u00b4t extreme negatives. I had an individual I did not know leave messages for the room number daily, and even though I told the staff I did not care for them, they were still forwarded. Some of the rooms are basic and well used, but all the rooms we lived in had bath tubs. After a long day in Singapore heat I found them nice with AC and the beds comfy. Be wary of the rooms with the connecting doors (unless it\u00b4s your own two parties), they are merely blocking views, not noise. Internet is pay per hour. During the first stay and per request we got switched to a much nicer room close to the pool. That didn\u00b4t work after our return. The hotel was almost overbooked - if you plan to go around holiday time, DO reserve in advance, and reconfirm, if you leave for a while - so there was no choice but the dreaded door room. It was louder, but we survived. Try the pool. We had robes, slippers, and fresh towels. It\u00b4s not exotic, but you\u00b4ll like it, and I found the seating areas inviting. There is also a fitness room adjacent, but I did not use that. Breakfast is o.k., if a bit of a stretch, as it tries to accomodate European, American, African and Asian tastes at the same time. For a supply of fresh fruit other than daily melons, make the short trip around the corner to to Mustafa's shopping center. If you find the restaurant pricey, by all means don\u00b4t stay in the hotel to eat. Asian folk just LOVE to eat, and you find cheap and cheapest foodstalls and restaurants all over Little India. At a little African place at a nearby corner we had more fresh food cooked under our eyes than we could clean up, and for next to nothing. If you prefer vegetarian, Indian places offer variety. And if you absolutely need a burger, by all means, this can be accomplished too. I don\u00b4t recommend sticking with an average hotel kitchen, if the sounds and smells of Asia are waiting right outside your doorstep. And there is always the underground close by, if you think you need to go farther, or fancy a somewhat more upscale surrounding. It is probably wise to expect some construction in progress somewhere close to the hotel. Singapore seems to be hustling, bustling and moving constantly. Nothing will stay the same for long as far as buildings go. But don\u00b4t let it keep you from enjoying what\u00b4s to see in Singapore.

The staff very kindly got in touch with the driver and it was duly returned to the hotel. I could not thank them enough as this is not a good start to any holiday. We arrived early in the morning and the room was not ready until11.00am but this could be the fault of the holiday company and not the hotel. After a 12 hour flight it would have been great to be able to get into a room. When we finally got a room it had a strong smell of smoke and we had specifically asked for non smoking rooms. I suppose you will always get guests who still smoke despite being asked not to. We asked to be moved and at first they said could the room be sprayed but we said no and were finally given another room. The downside was that it was not available until 3.00pm!!!! When we got the room it was worth the wait because it was much better decorated than the first room (which did not look too good at all with paint peeling off the ceiling). Even my husband, who thought that at first,I was being fussy, agreed that we had made the right decision in asking to be moved.

I selected Parkroyal on Kitchener Road which is located in \"Little India\" but still easy access by public transport to all areas. There is a new Shopping Centre opposite the property and Mustafa Centre with its 24-hour shopping around the corner - plus some really interesting restaurants catering to all tastes. I had secured an Internet Price of S$220.10 (including Tax/Service) which was a significant saving on the Published Rate for an Orchid Club Room. Even at this reduced rate, the Orchid Club was still only very average value-for-money. Check-in was in the 19th Floor Orchid Club Lounge which was handled efficiently by friendly staff. My Room 1918 close to lounge was well-appointed and recently refurbished; there was flat-screen TV with good channel selection, great single lounge chair with foot-stool for relaxing - also comfortable office-style chair and internet connection (free unlimited broadband) providing an excellent work-station for the business traveller. In-room electronic safe is large enough to hold a laptop and there was an abundance of coat hangers (often missed) plus iron/board. Bathroom is well-appointed but quite small. Towels were of good quality but no face towels provided (was told by Duty Manager that \"guests used to steal them so we don't put them in rooms any more\"). The toiletry selection was incomplete and soap (only one piece in a room reserved for two) was inappropriate size for a \"premium room\". After my complaints to Duty Managers on two occasions about \"in-room\" inadequacies, there was a full complement of toiletries (this time for two guests) following the morning room make-up - they had also managed to \"find\" two face towels. In the \"Orchid Club\" the \"signature orchid stem\" was missing from the room - although a selection of fresh fruits was provided. Orchids - so prevalent in Singapore - were also nowhere to be seen in the Orchid Club Lounge, which is really quite small - causing tables to be placed very close together (more like a coffee shop than a club lounge) and with very limited lounge-style seating adjacent to the television/reading area. There was just one laptop computer for (complimentary) use by Club guests. If you are planning to stay here and expect Club Lounge facilities commensurate with those found in almost any hotel offering this service - but more importantly if you are coming from Parkroyal Kuala Lumpur - you will be shocked to say the least with the gross inadequacies you will find at this property. The \"all-day refreshments\" offered were just Coffee/Tea and Cookies. The evening \"hors d'oeuvres and cocktail\" between 18.00 and 19.30 were in one word \"horrible\"! Forget any aspirations you may have about there being a choice here - two \"dim-sum\" varieties in double-layer chafing dish (warm at first but cold when burner went-out and wasn't replaced) with lower layer stuck to banana leaf and impossible to remove without falling apart), a \"fried ??\" served cold on small aluminium foil dishes (no china here!), Corn Crisps and commercial Salsa made-up the \"selection\", NO International Cheese platter here either - just individually-wrapped \"Bonbel\" and \"Babybel\" (ok...they DO come from France) with Water Crackers and one variety of Dried Fruit. Staff in Club Lounge are all extremely friendly and do their best under what could be described as \"extenuating circumstances\". Breakfast the following morning was equally un-inspiring (no kitchen so no choice of fresh-cooked eggs) so I had breakfast in Spices Brasserie Cafe which had a reasonable selection and unusually-good coffee. I returned to the Club Lounge for Coffee and Pastries. Standard Operational Procedures are virtually non-existent at Parkroyal on Kitchener Road. I had arranged an appointment with the General Manager to discuss the problems I had encountered. He is extremely personable and has been at this property for around six months - is also very aware of what is needed to \"bring his property up-to-speed\". He explained that the Parkroyal Group is going-through a \"re-positioning\" exercise and is under a recently-appointed CEO. On my return later in the day to my room, I found a bottle of excellent Red Wine and a hand-written note from the General Manager thanking me for my feed-back - a positive sign that the property is in good hands! It may be that demand is insufficient for this property to operate a \"fully-fledged\" Club Lounge. Its owners must decide to either elevate the standard of facilities and services to an acceptable level - or disband the Club concept and return the rooms into regular inventory simply as \"premium rooms\" without \"club extras\". As it is right now, I expect that there is a very low incidence of \"repeat\" business and even less \"referral\" business for the Orchid Club. The warmth and sincerity of the Club Staff and its very helpful Club Manager - plus the genuine enthusiasm demonstrated during my meeting with the General Manager - would be sufficient for me to return to this property on my next visit to Singapore. I should like to believe that my next report on Parkroyal will be much more positive.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham", "Title": "\u201cdisappointed\u201d", "Author": "NottinghamCyclops", "ReviewID": "UR56463191", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel twice - once for three nights and again a week later for two nights.

The lifts in this hotel are terribly slow and there is no indicator to show you which floor the elevator is stuck at currently, so you just have to wait for an undefined amount of time. The room was very spacious probably because it was a corner room, but my husband notice cobwebs on the ceiling (of a room in a 5 star hotel, and that too on the executive floor?) The Bathroom was large and spacious. The waiter who brought our room service order was trying to solicitate us to write good feedback about him on departure, even repeated his name a couple of times so we wouldn't forget, which we found very unprofessional. On the day of arrival, we stopped at the main restaurant to have a cup of tea while waiting to be assigned a room. We were seated at a dirty table and after waiting awhile, thinking that they would come back to clean it, we had to ask for it to be done. We were served tea in a mug, and as I couldn't find a place to keep the tea bag, I asked for a quarter plate, and would you believe it, they picked up a used plate from another empty table which had fruit peels on it, emptied it onto another plate on that table and brought the plate to me to put my tea bag on. Totally unprofessional for a 5 star hotel.

Unsurprisingly, given its location, the hotel is popular with Indian tour groups and travelers, which adds a certain \u2018hustle and bustle\u2019 to the place; at any time of day, the hotel lobby was busy with large families checking in / out or waiting for tour buses.

The promotional rate was around S$140 per night nett for a superior room and included S$25 credit per day, which could be used for any hotel service except breakfast. Unfortunately, my stay couldn't be credited for frequent flyer points with partner airlines, being a promotional rate. The hotel check-in experience was a good one as the porters and check-in staff were quite friendly and efficient. The lobby was good, there was a separate lounge area which was separated from the main lobby to provide a bit more privacy and comfort. I was upgraded to a deluxe room on a higher floor, which was good of them. The only problem with the check-in process was the amount of time it took for my luggage to be delivered, I waited about 20 mins. However, the luggage porter was friendly. The first thing I noted about the room was its modern design and outlay, the bathroom in particular was quite modern. The room was clean and had a good feel to it. The hotel is located close to the Farrer Park MRT station in Singapore, only about a five minute walk away. So, many locations in Singapore would be accessible through this route. There are many food outlets in the area, not just serving Indian food but also other varieties. Unfortunately, I went to the hawker centre to the right of the hotel upon exit and got a 1.5L bottle of water for S$2.50, when it should probably cost less than S$1. So, I'd be a little careful about the place. Taxis are usually all over the place as well. Mustafa Centre is located very closeby, this shopping centre is well-known in Singapore for their competitive prices and large range of goods. They also have foreign exchange services at very competitive rates. Also, they are open 24/7. I used my daily credits for a dinner room service meal and also laundry. The room service was very quick, the meal tasty and well-presented. The laundry was nicely done and on time.

So needless to say, we knew nothing of this hotel, let alone Singapore! Upon arrival, the concierge helped us with our luggage and the reception staff booked us into a twin room. (not an issue as this was the only room available in a hotel that seemed to be taking in all waifs and strays from those attempting to get home from Thailand). The room was located on the 12th floor, adjacent to the lifts and unfortunately for us it was also a smoking floor and the room really really smelled of stale smoke. However, the room was lovely with twin beds, which were a little hard but apparently this is the case with most east Asian countries. We had spectacular views of the city and it was clear the room had recently undergone a series of renovations, particulary the carpet and bathroom, with a shower that was most welcoming. We also received two complimentary bottles of water which again was great as it was some 35c outside! Breakfast was superb. I honestly don't think I've had one quite like it as it met everyone's taste. Excellent! As our check-out time was midday, we were able to use the pool and gym facilities and of course the showers that came along with it as we did not need to leave for the airport until 7.30pm. The staff were very helpful and as we had lockers we were able to dump out stuff and go and see some of this amazing city (which we intend to visit again, this time, properly!). Although we didn't get very far, the smells eminating from the Little India area was sublime and we wished we could have been around long enough to experience the food. The hotel as a whole is between a 3 and 4 star accommodation in my opinion as it seemed when they were busy, they had real trouble ensuring customer services were met and some would say they could have come across as being a little rude (though very much working under pressure). We wanted an extra pillow for the room as my husband suffered from a bad back, however laundry had run out of them, and even if therer were some, they couldn't deliver them as they were closed (it was 10.30pm and we arrived at 10.00pm).

The food in the Chinese restaurant was dry and unappetising and vastly overpriced. The bar on the same floor as Reception was also incredibly expensive and the singer in there had the volume turned up to a level more suited to a stadium gig! When we asked for it to be turned down a little so that we could hear each other talk we were told that the level was fine.

I had booked a 'superior' room and was given a room which smelled of damp, was dirty, including sweet papers under the bed, had broken furniture and paint in serious need of redoing. [I can add photos of the room if people would like to see them]. It also had an adjoining door to the very noisey family in the room next door.....and believe me I was not a happy bunny. I met with a Manager to discuss my concerns and she told me that 'superior' was the lowest standard room they had at the hotel. Perhaps people booking rooms should be aware of this - it might help them to select a better room (incidentally my (inferior) Superior room cost me 100 euros per night). The receptionist who checked me in reminded me several times that breakfast was not included in a room 'at the rate' I had booked. Given the standard of the room I was rather pleased that I had the option to go out for a nice breakfast. After much discussion the manager upgraded me to a nicer room, which had all of the comforts you would expect a nice hotel to have. I have to say to its credit the second room was so much nicer than the first and had a nice flat screen TV, more modern(!) furniture and a bigger bathroom. The rest of my stay went smoothly with the 'nicer' room being well cleaned daily. [again I have some photos of this room and can add them to the review if required]. The area the hotel is in is called Little India and is full of interesting shops, restaurants, food stalls, markets and Indian temples. At weekends a large number of Indian guys congregate outside the hotel and are very chatty and love talking with tourists.

We did'nt eat at the hotel so cannot comment on that but watch the prices for food and drink as one couple at the pool were billed S$ 30 for 2 beers!!!", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood for a stopover\u201d", "Author": "RoomGeek", "ReviewID": "UR15673671", "Content": "First up, we booked our stay through a travel agent who used some sort of QANTAS holidays booking process to get us rooms at a rate considerably cheaper than some other reviewers describe.

Little India was an interesting cultural surprise and as vegetarians we delighted in the many cheap and interesting Indian vegetarian food options around. It is a quick walk to the MRT station so getting around was not problematic. However, if you are coming to Singapore for the shopping rather than the food, or if you are easily offended by unusual food smells or poorly maintained footpaths, you may be better off finding a more central hotel. Our biggest gripe about this hotel was having booked a double room and then being given a twin instead. Annoying - and I see at least one other reviewer on this site had a similar experience. Having said that, otherwise the hotel was fine.

Overall, first impressions? Very nice, classy contemporary decor, nice staff, nice room. The location is slightly away from the middle of things, but the MRT and buses are right next door, so getting around is no problem. I stayed here, as I had no need to be closer into town, so was seeking better value. Negatives on my trip? Housekeeping calling me on the phone,'because your do not disturb sign is on', to ask if I wanted laundry delivered. Coming back one night to find Housekeeping had left the security bar flipped over on my door, and the room open. Housekeeping calling on a Sunday morning to ask if I had laundry to drop off. Checking in to realise that the room had no desk chair, and the room safe had been locked open by the previous guest. Rather a meagre breakfast for the price of hotel. In two weeks, they only went beyond melon cubes for fresh fruit on two occasions (once pineapple, the other time dragon-fruit), this in a country where tropical fruit is so abundant and cheap. Enquiring if they had any cheese, I was told that it would be charged as an extra. You did get something of a feeling that they provided nothing that you could walk out with. Compare what was on offer with say the Prince Hotel in KL. I was told that if I checked out early, I would pay one nights room-rate as a penalty. On re-checking this, I was told that this was not so, and offered the managers card in case I had further issues. I had a good stay, but not sure I'd choose to spend two weeks in this location again. As others have said, I'll add that the cost of hotels in SG is now totally horrendous. After add-ons I was paying over US$200 a night, which even a year ago would have got you something really special. Good luck to anyone trying to find a hotel during the Singapore grand prix. p.s.

On booking in, there was confusion about whether breakfast had been paid for, for our children (which it had) and this took a while to sort out. We again had this query when we went for breakfast the following morning, but this time it was if any of us had breakfast included! The family room was two adjoining rooms and was dated and tired looking, with wood work chipped and dirty. The curtains were filthy and the sheets had a hole in. The whole presentation was dark, dingy and depressing. One of the robes provided had a stain on the back. The only ok thing about the hotel was the breakfast which the children enjoyed as they could have pancakes freshly cooked. However the ceiling of the restaurant looked like it belonged in a factory with all the pipework exposed.

Being located in Little India added a new dimension to my experiences of this wonderful island nation. Arrived after my afternoon flight from Australia. Transfer to hotel went well. Staff were polite at check-in but there was a problem. My booking for a king couldn't be filled due to the hotel being at full capacity during the expo. I was offered a twin. That suited me as I was travelling alone. The only reason I mention this is that they did explicitely state that it was a king room on the booking confirmaiton. Room is very clean and comfortable. They have been renovated since some of the ealier review. Every function was in order. With the weather at the moment, the aircond is producing quite a lot of condensation which is dripping onto the carpet near the cupboard. Reported it to maintenance this morning but no action yet. Yesterday morning I ordered an iron for the room. It took more than 60 minutes to arrive. Fortunately I had made the decision to go to breakfast in the meantime. Breakfast was quite hearty with a range of Asian, European and Indian dishes. I've been having the fresh cooked omelette each morning. The bacon is certainly unusal. Not sure what they do to that. It is very fatty. Brekky has been keeping me going for the day. Location of the hotel is a little out of the centre. Taxi fares to most parts of the city have been in the range of S$5 - S$6. Outside the hotel do try the \"My F&B Cafe\" (pictured) area 20 metres from the hotel on Kitchener Road. A full chinese meal will be about S$3. Fantastic Indian fare can be enjoyed for around the same price. I tried the pool on Level 6. Even though we are close to the equater, the pool water is still cool and refreshing.

We paid US $126 for a double room inclusive of all taxes and breakfast for two. We were given a quiet room at the end of the hall on the 14th floor, which was completely non-smoking (yea!). Our room was fresh, clean and inviting. It had a comfortable king sized bed, a desk with comfy lounge chair, a safe, mini bar/fridge, powerful air conditioning, two bathrobes and plenty of space. I loved the lighting - bright lights over the sink and mirror in the bathroom, plenty of lamps and soft lighting in the bedroom. There was a floor lamp, desk lamp, lights under the bed side tables and individually controlled reading lights attached to the bed. The bathroom was modern and spacious with a shower over the tub and ample shelf space. This hotel is located right next door to chaotic Mustafa Center, a 24 hour shopping complex that seems to be busy round the clock. It's also right across the street from an MRT station, so it couldn't be more conveniently located. All one need do is walk out the door to find Indian food, but we chose the restaurant in the basement of the hotel - Jewel of India - excellent choice - inexpensive and really good ($12 nett each for dinner buffet).

Having the Mustafa centre just a 1 minute walk away was great for whenever we needed anything...and i mean anything!!! This place is the biggest shop i have ever seen and i managed to get lost in there many times! There is also many Hawker centres within a 2 minute walk, so we ate at them a lot and never payed more than $10SING for our 2 meals.
