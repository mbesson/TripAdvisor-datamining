The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The place is an old building with four or five floors. The first one has the reception and breakfast lounge; the rest of the floors have 3 rooms each, one shower and one toilet (absolutely tiny). We booked the 6-bed room, which was the smallest. The other rooms of the floor were bigger, I assume there could easily be 10-12 beds, that is, kind of 30 people for each shower (it was better not to think about it) Rooms were filthy, there were stains on the mattresses, no wardrobes, bad smell... Only the location was positive. And the staff, who was quite friendly too. All in all, I would not recommend it in any case.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cBad smell\u201d", "Author": "manteLondon", "ReviewID": "UR20200986", "Content": "This place is absolutely awful! Definatly would not reccomend to anyone I know! The stairwell stinks. We had to hold our breath from the bottom to the top floor! Bad times! When we got there they had mucked up our booking- we booked a room for 6 and were given a room for 4 with no discount for their cock up! The room had insects and no privacy from the sleeping area into the bathroom ( by bathroom I mean very smelly shower and a sink) The room that we moved into after 2 nights was not much better because we were situated next to the water tank or something and the water dripping noise kept us up all night! however the bathroom had a door so at least we could all wash in private! On the plus side because we couldn't bare to be in the room any longer than we had to we had an amazing trip!
