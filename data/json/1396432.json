In this hotel stay a lot of airline crews but also people who have an own car. We chose the place as we are members of the Holiday Inn Club and we could use all our collected points. Further we wanted it calm. So we really liked it and made friends with most of the stuff there. When there was no shuttle service available we could also use the public bus station which stopped about 150 meters far from the hotel. A seven eleven is not too far, another 100 meters. The pool we couldn't use as the time we chose for our stay was December and it was damned cold we also had snow! Nevertheless the staff is very helpful especially when tipped off.

Stalls are very narrow, with lots of pillars, drive slowly. Lone window has no sheer drapes to filter light through while allowing privacy from outside. Only option is to close pull down blind, blocking all natural light. Two elevators for seven floors are very slow, so make sure you are patient. Avoid rooms overlooking the pool area due to excessive noise from guests, music speakers, and the busy fire department right across the street. They had eight emergency calls on our first night, with sirens going off hourly until 410am!! We listened to poolside guest normal conversations until after 10pm, outdoor music until midnight when I finally had to call the front desk to turn off the pool speakers. We moved to the otherside of hotel with no view for quiet. No, breakfast is NOT automatically included. It depends on your room rate package, if it includes breakfast, so make sure you choose the rate plan that offers breakfast and one beverage choice. Limited menu from 0630-11am. No buffet, set menu only. Wait staff seemed rushed, overwhelmed, dirty coffee cups and utensils from previous diners stayed on our table the entire time. The check was placed on the table with our meals, and the server never returned. I recommend getting a Terrible's Casino FREE BUFFET coupon from the lobby tourist rack. Terrible's Casino is right across the street, with a good buffet restaurant. On coupon is another coupon for a FREE Cap or T-Shirt and $5 slot free play when you open a free players club card. You will need the card to redeem the buffet coupon. We collected our free t-shirts, used the $5 slot free play after you add at least a dollar to the machine with your card. Cheap fun at Terrible's! Breakfast buffet is $3.99, lunch $5.99, dinner and sunday brunch only $8.99. Use the coupon for 2-4-1 buffets! One guest at the pool bragged that she got the Holiday Inn Las Vegas using Priceline for only $50/night for her entire week stay. Another guest used Hotwire website for a low rate. I used the regular Holiday Inn website for my higher rate (sigh). Also, you get nothing extra as a Gold or Platinum level Priority Club member. I am a Platinum level member and was \"pre-assigned\" to a small room 321, next to the ice machine and elevators, with a view of a wall, the loud pool music speaker and directly down at the busy hot tub, listening to guest conversations all day.

We arrived after 10pm so no free shuttle from airport. Taxi was about $15 with tip. Check-in with Jeff was easy. He changed our room from a king to two queens. There is no advantage being a Priority club member as there are no upgrades because there are only two types of rooms. The website mentioned executive floor but nothing such exists according to one of the front desk guys. We had breakfast included-not a $10 voucher as advertised but a coupon for an entr\u00e9e and one drink (juice or coffee but not both). Room was ok with view towards vacant lot so quiet. A/C worked well, nice tv with limited channels. Comfortable chair with lamp in corner. Light bulb replaced in lamp between beds as requested. Bathroom nice with low tub-easy to step out of. Toilet didn\u2019t always flush on first try. Shampoo, cream, soap provided and ok. Plenty of towels. Shuttle was ok and usually available but only to preset locations. We would take to strip and then wander back on foot. Usually stopped at Tuscany on the way back. Terribles nearby but very smoky because of poor ventilation. I won\u2019t return there again unless staying within area. No complaints with front desk staff. For breakfast, try to get lady. One older man seemed bothered to serve and took 3 requests to get ice water. One younger guy was ok but lady was the best. We didn\u2019t use the pool or exercise room but did print out boarding passes for our return flight. They stored our luggage since our flight wasn\u2019t until 5 pm. Great shuttle ride to airport. Biggest scare was waking up at 3 am with no electricity. It was dark since there was no emergency lighting in room. Phone didn\u2019t work so I used cell phone to call front desk (fortunately, I had called when we were to arrive late so number was still in recent call list) Nice lady said whole block was out but not sure why. I was a little concerned because who would notify us if we had to escape. No lights so there would be lots of people in underwear or less evacuating! After about 45 minutes, electricity came back on so just a false alarm. One strong recommendation: The Envy Steakhouse at the Renaissance for Sunday brunch. $29.95 includes bloody Mary station, wines, and French champagne plus omelettes and other breakfast selections, prime rib, shrimp, oysters on half shell, split crab legs, cheeses, desserts, and more. A Liberace type piano player with several older women made even more special. Have the shuttle take you to the convention center and walk back. We took the shuttle to the Venetian and walked and walked but found it and had the best Sunday brunch ever. A definite must do on the next trip. I would probably not stay here again unless I got a great rate or couldn\u2019t get one elsewhere. Most staff were nice, hotel was clean, but location was not the best. Stay here if you just need to relax or want to get away from crowds.

The bell boy who was helping us move was very friendly and kind. He seemed to know that the service in the hotel was pretty bad as compared to the other Holiday Inn hotels. The breakfast was NOT a buffet as we thought. It was wholesome but Id prefer more variety in a buffet. I really cant understand why they do something unconventional like this. Overall, as a platinum member I will make sure that I never stay at this location ever again. The reason is not just the ugly and cold approach road and the building but also the yellow swimming pool and lack of knowledge of enhancing customer experience by providing good service.

While traveling on business February 21st, air traffic was disrupted by a large snowstorm that blanketed the upper Midwest, causing flight delays and cancellations and rerouting hundreds if not thousands of travelers. I was one of those unfortunate people who were caught in the middle, dealing with long lines, cranky people and unusual circumstances as I tried to get from Minneapolis to Salt Lake City. After seventeen hours and several changes in my itinerary, the closest I could get to my destination was by making my first-ever trip to Las Vegas, arriving after midnight and leaving early the next day to get to Salt Lake City - late for my business meeting. I caught a cab at the Las Vegas airport, and the driver attempted to find his way to the Holiday Inn on Palos Verdes - he didn't have much luck, and actually called the dispatcher and the hotel for directions before finally finding it just after 1:00 am on the 22nd. I was exhausted by my seemingly endless day of travel, had no luggage, and just wanted to get a nap before starting over again in a few hours. I paid the cab driver too much money and entered the hotel lobby. The desk clerk, Donald, alerted of my arrival by the can driver's call, was ready for me. He was warm and friendly as he greeted me, happily provided toiletries to get me through until my luggage could find me, offered information about the return trip to the airport, and took my wake-up call request, all very efficiently and in a manner that I was grateful for after a trying day. I was in my room by 1:15. A few hours later, my 5:00 am wake up call was prompt, and Donald was still cheerful and helpful. At my request, he called a cab company that took credit cards, offered me a cup of coffee, and chatted with me while I waited for my cab to arrive. As I got in the cab, he thanked me for my business, and wished me luck on my travels. While the trip was ultimately a successful one, it had started by going form bad to worse - until your desk clerk changed my attitude by presenting his own positive attitude and cheerful outlook. I would like to take this opportunity to let you know I appreciated the hospitality, and would like you to pass this \"thank you\" on to Donald for helping me make a bad day better. I have not maximized my stays at Holiday Inns in the past, instead I have stayed in higher-end properties with stuffy, unfriendly employees much too often. If your front line employees are anything like Donald in Las Vegas, you will get more - and keep more - of my business and the business of my partners and associates.

Love the parking under the hotel - very safe, gate closes after 10 pm and opens with room key. Check in was fast and convenient, employees friendly. Our room had a \"view\" of the strip, but also overlooked an empty lot full of trash. We didn't mind. We didn't pay for a view. Thought I should note this anyway because some people might not care for this type of view. Our room was a standard size. Huge TV, but downside was there were no pay per view movies available. The room was nice and quiet until the last night there, we had neighbors (a bunch of loud partying kids) and you could then tell how thin the walls were. But the noise was before 9 pm, so we didn't make a big deal about it because they left by 9:30 pm. You can hear people walking in rooms above you too. We are heavy sleepers, but light sleepers might want the top floor. Beds/bedding was sooo comfortable. Bathrooms were modern and clean. Everything worked great. The building seems new - everything smelled new. Overall we really like the convenience of the place. Less traffic being away from the strip. You definitely need a car to get to the strip unless you are in good physical condition -a walk! I do have one complaint about the room. The bed is placed on a dark wood base which sticks out 2\" further than the bed on all three sides. Oh my gosh. My husband and I are bruised on our shins from running into the wood corners of the bed. We stubbed our toes on it. When the comforter hangs over the bed, you cannot see the dark wood frame sticking out. I ran into it during the night and getting ready in the morning numerous times. Very very painful. After the 2nd day, we put both trash cans on the side of our bed to remind us to steer clear of the corners of the bed. The 1st night my husbands phone was ringing. He got up to run to get his phone, ran into the wood corner of the bed which tripped him. He fell and suffered a rug burn on his knee and a bruised shin. That's when the trash can \"guards\" went up. Housekeeping would move the trash cans when they cleaned and bam! we would run into the corners again. Ouch! It's the bright white comforter over the dark wood frame. You really cannot see the base until it's too late. Overall, everything else was really great. We would probably stay here again next time. We stay in hotels 5-10 days a month.

I found the beds comfortable and any noise from the airport is no big deal, it did not slow me down from sleeping. The staff were very friendly and accomodating...with a very easy check-in.

This is not an exageration- if 2 people are talking in the room with the TV on- the planes will interrupt like a person snoring in the room. But if you are outside on the street, or in your car, you do not notice the jet noise as much. This may be IChotels worst hotel for that fact. On another note: The jet noise is only during the day, you do not notice it at night. Other than the jets, noise is not a factor & is a peaceful place. Aside from that, the staff is very nice. Cleaning crew good. All other factors- No Problem- Holiday Inn professionalism through out. Rooms look like they were designed by Bob Guccione. If noise isn't an issue, please consider this hotel. It is a great location for business if you are working a convention at LVCC. Personally I put up with the noise because I got a Hotwire deal on this.

Unfortunately the first day fell on Christmas Day and major hotels on the Strip were bit too pricey, so I gambled and booked this Holiday Inn which was about a mile away from the Strip. I've been to Vegas many times but never stayed at a hotel which is off the Strip and didn't know what to expect. Luckily once you pass the Las Vegas Boulevard, it only takes about 2-3 minutes to the hotel. There are many popular restaurants around there, including my new favorite, Firefly. The garage had the gate which made me wonder if the area was not safe or I should be looking around when we unload our luggage but that was the only part that made me feel a tiny bit uneasy and everything else was great. Unlike those Vegas hotels, there was no waiting line to check-in and the young guy at the front desk was very pleasant. The room felt like it was still new and we thought it was a decent size. Oh, but I kept hitting my feet to the bed frame. Overall, everything was clean and new except the bed sheet. When I opened my comforter, it had wrinkles like someone was sleeping on there already. I checked the pillows and they looked clean and didn't smell anything and I was too tired to call the front desk and wait for someone to come and change it so I've decided to ignore it. I went to sleep right away and heard nothing but my sister said many people came back to their rooms after midnight and got pretty loud. She said she thought someone was in our room talking. Next day, I was able to enjoy my favorite TV channel on a big flat TV while my sister was able to check her emails for free. We knew we'd sleep in late until we had to check-out so didn't bother to ask if we get the free breakfast as some of those Vegas websites stated but I think I've read we could get complimentary coffee in the morning at their cafe. We were going to shop whole day so we moved to a hotel on the Strip next day, but when I come to Vegas by myself, I often go to places off the Strip and don't need to stay at those pricey major hotels. Especially, many hotels nowadays have been cutting down many amenities anyways (do you remember we used to get stuff like cotton swabs, shoe polish clothe or mending kit?) but adding ridiculous Resort Fees for nothing (this past year, I've stayed at Mirage, Treasure Island, Venetian and Planet Hollywood which recently stopped charging the Resort Fee). I didn't feel like I downgraded and stayed at a cheap motel. It was nice that there was no awful smell of smoke to go through when you come back to the hotel or stupid Resort fee to pay but got a free internet access with many good dining places to choose from.

Facilities: Whilst it was too hot during the morning, and early afternoon we did use the pool later in the afternoon and early evening. The pool itself altough not too big was a nice to have in the hotel. Restuarant: We ate breakfast here on three occasions and were pleasantly suprised by the Quality and service. We didn't eat at night, but did partake in the happy hour which was good value. Location: We personally had the use of car and the location off the strip suited us.

Its about a 20min walk to the strip but the hotel does supply a free shuttle to the strip but not return trip. I used the shuttle a couple of times and the driver was more than accomodating even taking us exactly where we wanted rather than the pre organised drop off points.

The style is clean, modern and simplistic --- nothing extra. The location of the Holiday Inn on Palos Verdes Street is 1 of 3 total near the Vegas strip, and the one most taxis do not know where it is, so be prepared to say your address and give them directions. While the hotel offers a shuttle all day long (5-15 minute waits), it does not do pick-ups, so that extra money you saved by getting a hotel further away from the strip goes to paying for the taxi rides every night. Advice --- better to pay the extra $10-$20/night and get a more convenient hotel closer to the strip. The hotel shuttle drop offs at three major locations: MGM, Venetian and Flamingo, which are all decent places to start walking to your next destination. To walk at night to your hotel is not recommended, even though taxis rates are high compared to New York and Atlanta. The taxis are overall friendly and can recommend several places to go and things to do. I would suggest to the hotel that they offer shuttle pick-ups for certain times 9pm-11pm, it would certainly help as visitors who stay there will be happier with the easier convenience and the hotel could make a bigger name for itself since it is not located on the strip. Or offer cheap $5/flat rate fees for pick-ups, it's really inconvenient compared to other hotels. The hotel is located almost in the middle of nowhere, as of May/June 2010, there is alot of empty concrete ground around the hotel. Close by/walking distance depends on the hot desert air, you can go eat at local restaurants such as Buca Di Beppa and Roy's, none of which I tried. The Holiday Inn has a nice breakfast available at their level floor known as the Forte Grill. They offer a good selection of breakfast meals for a decent price, from omelets to croissants to toast, with self-serve coffee. The service can be slow at time, seems there is only 1 person working and runs around doing all the hotel room services as well. The front desk is next to a open seating area and bar, and behind is a big area for public conferencing or business/computer area. Only 1 computer with USB hub and laser printer is offered, there is a touchscreen that doesn't do anything. I would suggest adding another computer station setup. The hotel is very clean, immaculate is the word, which could either make you love it or hate it. It can seem cold at times, but Holiday Inn is going for the new and hip look, which attracts the under 50 or single visitors in Vegas. Walking around in the morning and evening, you don't see many people, which is nice in a crowded Vegas. It's very quiet, although you are 10 minutes away from the airport. I never heard any bothersome planes from overhead. However, the hotel walls are slightly thin, you can hear the TV from next door at night. The hotel room is very simple looking, ours was a 2 Queen size beds with large cable TV and one small coffee table (with pot & mix), one dresser connected to a long table with a lamp with 2 extra sockets. There's one 1-seat sofa chair and a bedside table with a phone and a lamp inbetween the 2 beds. Overall, I think the beds take up too much space due to the layout, and there could better bright lighting instead of 3 small lamps which you must turn on one by one, and one more sit-in chair/stool would be good. There is a normal-sized closet with an iron and ironing board inside with extra hangers, useful. The bathroom is nicely setup with the basic dryer, towels and accessories, also includes big showerhead nozzle and working vents. The hotel beds are big and soft, which can be good or bad depending on your back. There are 4 large pillows included, 2 firm, 2 soft and a nice bedsheets, although I was allergic to the linen or fabric. Advice --- bring long pajamas. Room service was friendly and quick to answer the phone, however we did ask them to give them to give us a cell phone call when our lost luggage arrived, but they never called. We had to find out later by going to the front desk, however they did leave a message on the phone. OVERALL RATED \" B\" GOOD --- clean, free internet, no smoking, no casinos inside, not crowded, friendly service, free shuttle drop-off, nice breakfast (not free) BAD --- far from strip (costly taxis), no shuttle pick-up, bare minimum, slightly slow service/not enough attendees", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porterville, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay and Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "adjasj", "ReviewID": "UR65503476", "Content": "This hotel is brand new and it is fantastic.
