After walking around the room I was doing my makeup standing on the towel when I stepped off the towel was black and I had just taken a shower. I told my daughter put on socks or wear your shoes while we are in the room. I took the towels and laid them on the carpet so we would not have to walk on it. Later when I asked for towels they only had one and said they were doing the laundry. In the morning the maid said they were still doing laundry and had no towels. The furniture in the room was also Ikea, the mattress was smashed in and small. Maybe a full size, I tried to see if the bed was from Ikea but did not see a tag. I felt very uncomfortable in this place and wasn't sure if we were safe of not. I would never recommend this place to anyone. We were on a budget and could not get a different Hotel. The internet did work in the room which was nice and the Front desk girls were nice. Those are the only things I liked about it.

I arrived at the Leamington Port of Miami October 12, 2011 to stay the night before the KISS Kruise. The first thing I noticed was right when I approached my room door. I could see through the crack of the door into the room. The door looked so old and cheap that even a child could kick it and it would swing open. As I walked into the room I was hit with a stench that reaked of mold and God knows what else. I tried to spray cologne and it didn't help. The floors looked that they had not been vaccumed in weeks and as I go to put by suitcase down I noticed that there was gum stuck to the carpet that looked black and hard or at least I hope it was gum, but the worst is yet to come... I decided to check the bathroom and the first thing I notice is that there is DRIED UP URINE ON THE TOILET SEAT and the shower curtains were very dirty. At first I tried to tell myself its just one night and I could wait to shower on the cruise boat. As I go to look at the bed sheets and guess what??? MORE URINE! That was it. I grabbed my suitcase and checked out within the first 30 minutes. They wouldn't refund me the money for the reservation. I have emailed the hotel owner and im awaiting a response to hopefully get a refund. This hotel is NOT worth any price no matter how cheap you think it is. Anyone who gave it a good review must have no sense of sight or smell because it was so unsanitary. Do yourself a favor put the extra money into staying at the Holiday Port of Miami down the street. The staff was very friendly and accomodating to me since they knew I was extremely upset about what just happend. The nasty pictures on this sight that other people posted while staying there are completley accurate and although I didnt witness or encounter bed bugs because I left I wouldnt doubt anyone that claims to have been bit is telling the truth.

They said, they only changed the sheets and towels if u left them on the floor but they rever changed the two nights we were there. The grand finally of it all is that they advertise free continental breakfast for guest only but only thing they served was toast and coffee (what about the people who dont drink coffee).

There are a few bums that like to hang out front,but we actually found they were homeless and not all that bad.Of course we were cautious. It is center Miami so very convenient to Walgreen's,C VS, Bay front Park,Night life,and the FREE transport Metro-rail Mover. There is a 24 Hour Latino Cafe on the corner adjacent to the Hotel and it was a lifesaver.The weather was very cold in the mid to upper 30's so a cup of Hot chocolate sure hit the right spot.The Cuban sandwich was also excellent. Santos was on the spot when ever we needed him,very sweet and concerned about our welfare and being comfortable during our stay.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Caledonia", "Title": "\u201cStay Away.

I was told that this was a very nice hotel, one of their best in a good location. Be very careful with these referrals because they only go on what the hotels tells them. I knew we were in trouble when a dirty bum greeted us as we exited the taxie and begin washing the tires with a dirty spray bottle of something as he asked for a \"dollar\" . As we proceeded to the lobby the bum insisted on grabbing our luggage again asking for a \"dollar\". The lobby was smelly with a host of misfits standing around glaring at us. The elevelator was ancient like the one on Petty Coat Junction (about 50 years old) and bumped and grinded the entire time we were scared to get in. As we entered the hotel room I simply wanted to cry but was too angry. The comforter and sheets on the beds were dirty, dingy and stained with old blood mixed with other STUFF. The carpets was stained with what looked like old gum and feces. Dust and dirt everywhere plus a little extra in the corners. Holes in the walls, blinds dirty and did not work. the air conditioner blew musty air, bathroom simply filthy. I do not believe the bathtub has ever been cleaned shower curtins torn and dirty. I contacted Hotels.com and informed them of the conditions and asked to be moved to a different location, however there was none.. I complained to the Manager and he acted surprised that I didnt like his hotel. And they have the nerve to offer continential breakfast. Eat at your own ristk Better yet, stay away. I took pictures to send to Hotels.com. I'd be very interested in knowing if they still refer this hotel as one of their best.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGet a Great Rate!\u201d", "Author": "Jenla68", "ReviewID": "UR88055242", "Content": "As the saying goes...you get what you pay!

The area looks like it could be a little rough but we were back in our room by 9:00 PM . Everything was dated but clean; Yes; it needed some remodeling but we dont mind. The next day you are going to be on a cruise ship. The bathroom smelled like bleach but to us it was proof they did a good job cleaning.

This must be the absolute worse hotel that I have ever been in. I was referred to this dump due to another hotel being sold out and they used the Leamington as a satellite hotel. Needless to say, I complained everyday until I was reimbursed by the host hotel. Lets start with the staff they were rude, uncaring and simply misersable. The lobby is used as a transport station for packages being sent to Haiti. They have people packing and tapeing boxes all day and night and it smells horrible inside. I understand vintage, but this is a building that should have been blown away with one of the big hurricanes that Florida had. Please dont be fooled by the three circle rating. After all they are circles not stars. This is a pet hotel and only if your really mad at your pet. A great practical joke if your into those things.
