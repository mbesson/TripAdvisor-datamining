I can say that we enjoyed it and I will never forget the experience. The villas have definitely been updated/renovated since some of the reviewers posted their comments. We were pleasantly surprised by how up-to-date the appliances and furniture were in our room. This is a place to go for an authentic Puerto Rican experience, not a 5-star one. We were the only non-Puerto Ricans there when we stayed, and we found that a plus overall. However, since we were traveling with a 2-year-old, the booming music late at night from nearby villas was not a highlight! Fortunately, our daughter was able to sleep without really hearing it and the partyers next door decided to take their celebration elsewhere. . . Also, the food at the restaurant is nothing special, so we only ate there once. Pluses -- great staff who were extremely helpful, wireless internet access, BEAUTIFUL mountain scenery, nice pools for big and little people, farm animals to see, etc. We did have a horrible problem with ants in our villa, which really sort of ruined the experience for us, in the end. We couldn't leave ANY kind of food whatsoever on the kitchen counter or dining table without an armyt of ants coming for it within several minutes. So I'd characterize the rooms as glorified cabins more than anything else, and if you have that mentality, you'll be fine. The Adjuntas area is breathtakingly beautiful, but be warned that it takes a LONG time to get almost anywhere (except for Ponce and central Adjuntas) from the parador due to winding roads along cliffs where you have to drive about 20 miles per hour (while the locals whiz past you at frightening speeds). The Camuy Caves, for instance, are probably close to 1.5 hours away because of this--even though you might look at a map (or talk to a local) and think it's just 45 minutes away. Having said all of that, I'm SO glad that we got away from San Juan for a few days to experience this side of Puerto Rico.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.C.", "Title": "\u201cThis review is about the horse Ride. Please read this before you get on a horse ride\u201d", "Author": "tlaws1", "ReviewID": "UR38064995", "Content": "The website for this Place is http://www.paradorvillassotomayor.com/ This is a letter I wrote to the manager after coming back from the horse ride. Please read: VERY IMPORTANT: Dear Manager, The reason for this email is to express a concern and let you know about a complaint I have after using your facility. We did not stay in the apartments but I did go to ride the horses. My concern is that after riding the horse in the trail we went in (30minutes) I am glad I made the decision not to allow my 6 year old child ,who has never had experience on a horse, ride on one of yours in that trail. The terrain was fit for only grown ups or children that have had some experience with horses before. The horses were tired and disobedient at times. We ask the leader when was the last time they got fed and he said 9am in the morning and it was already past 5pm. The horses were stopping every chance they got to eat. The trail was rough. This is fun for someone that knows what they are doing with a horse, it would have been tragic for my 6 year old child. Especially when the horses go up the hill and need to gather up speed. I had to hold on really tight or else I would have fell. My proposal to this is to warn people before they make a decision to ride the horses and give the people some kind of training as far as what to say and how to turn the horse since after you pay, no matter if you change your mind, you do not get a refund. Which brings me to my complaint. I paid for my 12 year old daughter to ride a horse thinking it would be fine since she is my height and a lot more coordinated than my 6 year old. Well instead of tying all the horses up and allowing every one to climb on, they unleashed every horse as people were getting on. This caused the first person to try to control the horse until everyone got on. My daughter got on last and the horse was turned around the wrong way. Not only that it was walking the opposite way our and the leader's horse was turning frightening my daughter. I was trying to tell her how to turn and in the meantime my father tried to help her and my horse stepped on him in the process. I told the leader over and over to just let her down she was afraid, but instead the leader proceeded to say \"I will hold the leash of her horse so she will feel better\". I decided she was too scared so again I told them again to please get her off the horse. Finally they got her off and I was happy she did because as beautiful as it was for me (the trail) it would have been terrifying for her and anyone who never had experience on a horse. I never got my money back even though she never rode. This policy is wrong and people should be pre-warn before being charged for the ride. In the near future I could see a lot of lawsuits being filled against Villa Sotomayor if the policies and procedures do not change. I would not like for this to happen and will not like anyone ridding a horse being hurt so I would pray that you would consider my suggestions. Thanks for your time.

More expensive than a room in a super cool boutique hotel, the VIP villa at Sotomayor is worst than a shack in a favella/shanty town. Nothing chic about this shack. I doubt it's even legal to hire out such a space. We tried to cancel three hours after making the reservation, after finding a bad review online, but there were no refunds on cancelations before five days of the check in date. First nights deposit was needed to book...in my case $210. Upon checking in we had to wear these pink wrist bands, (as if we were going to come circuit party or some all inclusive 18-30 cruise...I still don't know why)and given a TV remote controll with the room number painted on with nail polish ($20 fee if lost, like we came to watch tv.)No one showed us to our villa and we spent the next 15 minutes driving around in circles trying to look for it, until we went back to reception to ask again. Located by the side of a busy road with trucks passing by every five minutes with loud speakers advertising everything from men's fashions to political announcements, this was a great way to start our relaxing weekend, after a 4 hour drive from San Juan. Inside none of the covers were on the electrical outlets or light switches. The room was small, the TVs didn't work, cieling fans rattled as if they were going to fall off, there was a lizard living in the drain of the bath tub amongst half ripped anti slip flower stickers. When unfolding the sofa bed, we found a cap and a pair of dirty red panties, the sheets were still on and the cushions were stained with blood. It was like being in some horror film. We couldn't stop laughing. The hotel claims to be an eco friendly resort, but from my experience it couldn't be further from the truth. After taking pictures and going to reception to tell them what was going on, they moved us to another villa/room that was cleaner and offered us a free breakfast. After all the stress in the first room, it was pretty difficult to enjoy much else. They sold no bottled water or had any kind of internet access. I will never stay there again.
