Elevator not always available. To reach the room, I had to move an ironing board, that was in the middle of the corridor. Tired after a long flight, I jumped on the bed and crashed in the wall: the bed was on wheels! No view, just some light from a horrible window. Orrible bath, you wouldn't touch anything. Taps dripping, mouldy shower courtain, basic furniture, that was new when my grandma got married. My girlfriend and me tried to console ourselves: after a sleep, we said, things will be better. But that night, it was karaoke time at the thai restaurant! (I've been told is not an uncommon event, there). And so, thay and chinese traditional songs had sung till late night.

The furniture and decorations in this hotel look good. But, very unfortunately, we lived in a room which was located directly above the function room on level 3. There were music bands in the function room and making noise to the entire building. I can tell you that they played until mid-night. Unless you will come back to the hotel after 12am, otherwise you won't be able to sleep because of the noise by the music bands. Even though some other suites are not above the function room, i am sure that the noise was still extremely terrible. In the next morning, fault fire alarm woke me up when i was lack of rest due to the noise in the night before. The alarm kept ringing for another 30 minutes. WTF!
