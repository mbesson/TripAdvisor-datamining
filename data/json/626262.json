An important point in our choice of hotel was a lift. Many converted houses have steep stairs with no lift. I had stayed close by at the other side of VondelPark on an earlier visit and had realised a lift for older people is essential. It certainly made a difference to our stay. It was though an excellent choice. Staff were warm and friendly and really helpful. There was good tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. The computer in reception is slow but perfectly usable for a short stay. Breakfast was adequate with both hot and cold choices.

The hotel is clean and the room we had was big with a nice bathroom although we didn't have a double bed it was 2 singles pushed together! The staff were friendly and helpful and I would recommend the breakfast its 7.5 euros for an eat all you can eat buffet and there is a choice of hot as well as cold food along with the usual breads, croissants, fuits and cereals. We ate out for breakfast the first morning and found that it was cheaper to just eat in the hotel for breakfast. Whilst in Amsterdam we visited the Anne frank museum which was really interesting, the sex museum which was actually quite good as well as a laugh and at 4 euros it is worth a visit! we also took a canal boat trip which was only 10 euros and was a nice way to see all of the city! The red light district is also a must at night time when it is busier and you still feel safe even though it is night time. Food and drink are quiet expensive but we found that it was the same in most places although we did find some italians where all main meals were only 5 euros we tried one out and it was nice!

The hotel Staff are always willing to help if you ask them questions about where to buy stamps,how to get to and from the centre they will give you very straight forward directions and a free map.The rijks museum is right around the corner about 5 minutes walk and well worth the trip we visited the Torture museum which was kind of mediocre and not really worth it.The sex Museum is decent and worth the money also I realise the ladies in the window are kind of off putting for some people however there is really decent bars,Restaurants in this area.The Prostitutes and Pot heads are only one part of Amsterdam the Red Light district is something that needs to be experienced its a bit of a shock however kind of makes you laugh too, me and my girlfriend found it rather hilarious.The hotel is about 40 minutes walk to this area however Unless you are disabled or fat and lazy then I would suggest walking everywhere if you can as you can explore all the side streets and really see some beautiful buildings. The canal Tour is well worth it and the hotel give you a 10% Discount card which does make a difference.The rooms in the hotel are spacious with free tea/Coffee and it is cleaned every morning by some wonderful cleaning staff.The towels are replaced if you use them be sure to leave them on the bathroom floor if you need new ones.

I stayed in a single room, it was compact to the point of being rather reminiscent of some university accommodation - a bathroom, a bed a couple of desks and sufficient room to move between them. The bed was adequately sized, I'm 6'2\" and it fitted me comfortably, if you're much larger than that you might find it a little cramped mind. That said the room was well designed so as to fit in the essentials in a way that despite the size of the room didn't feel too crowded. The bathroom was the standout feature, again not large but clean, modern and well maintained. The staff were very friendly and helpful as well, if you use the shuttle bus from the airport to get to the hotel (strongly recommended at 23 euro's for a return, compared to 39 euros each way for a taxi) they'll book your return journey for you if you ask.

It had fantastic central heating (it was freezing outside!), a lovely big window that opened overlooking the hotel across the street, a large wardrobe with a safe, comfortable bed and a clean brightly lit bathroom.

Everyone was eating in silence! Very strange for me! There was plenty of choice and everyone else seemed happy. Luckily we stayed room-only. I may have felt I'd been ripped off if I'd paid extra for B&B as there are so many lovely places to eat out for breakfast. There is also a lovely little bar in the hotel which was great to come back to after a night out for a meal etc. It was no more expensive than any other bar which was great. The bar man was very friendly too. The location of the hotel is brilliant. If I were to visit Amsterdam again, I would look this hotel up before booking anywhere else.

On the third day, an item of my clothing went missing from the hotel room. It was a white, hooded sweat top which I had left in the room whilst I went out for the day. On my return in late evening, I discovered the top was no longer in the room. The room was literally turned upside down, everything was turfed out of the cases and the wardrobe but to no avail, the top was not there. I reported it to Reception the following morning. There was a slight air of uninterest and I was simply told they would check laundry later that day to see if it had been taken there by accident. Surprise surprise, on checking with Reception later on, discovered it hadn't been! For the next few days, whoever I spoke to on Reception, had no idea about my missing top, so it involved me having to go through the whole rigmarole again of explaining why I was at the desk only to be told to check the following day for the return of the laundry. One member of staff told me they had never heard of anything going missing before, another said it had happened on several other occasions. The woman who cleaned our room was apparently a temporary member of staff not in each day, yet I was told by another Receptionist that all their staff worked there for 20 years!! Even on the day before we left, again we were told to wait until the laundry was returned the following day to see if it had turned up. At this point, I stated I wished to make a complaint. There was no senior members of staff on the premises and no one knew the complaints procedure. I was simply told to leave my details with Reception the following day during checkout. On doing this, I again had to explain why I needed to do it and was simply handed a ripped out piece of paper on a notepad to write down my details! Hardly professional. So I duly returned to the UK without my top and emailed a letter of complaint to Best Western Head Office based in Phoenix. They responded within hours telling me they would pass my letter on to the hotel which they duly did. As predicted, their letter was full of apologies and claimed they spoke to housekeeping but the woman who cleaned our room couldn't recall seeing any such top so I guess it did grow arms and legs and walk out of the room by itself after all!! They offered me a discount on a future stay as consolation, well I would rather have my top back, the same top I have had for 3 years, which has travelled with me to various destinations, as far afield as Florida and always come back as has the rest of my belongings. From now on, any future trips I take abroad, I no longer will be so trusting as to leave any items lying out inexpensive or otherwise.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDid the job perfectly ..\u201d", "Author": "Deltablade", "ReviewID": "UR109308717", "Content": "Ideally located in a quiet street but easily accessible to Leidse Square from where trams take you wherever you need to go (that said, we chose to walk for the majority of our stay to absorb the culture and by so doing discovered hidden gems not always captured in the guide books).

Very odd I thought, not sure if they have a lot of people running off without paying or something!! Another thing to be aware of it is on the face of it, we thought the hotel was quiet but quickly realised that the soundproofing between floors is not great (leading us to think a family of elephants had rented the room above us!) and the sheer multitude of students and groups means a bit too much running around and laughing in the corridors at 4 in the morning for my liking.

It's not super cheap, but not too expensive and I think it is quite comfy. Any of the times I stayed I chose one of the air conditioned rooms, cause it was winter and didn't need it. But rooms were warm and very well heated. Also included a coffee/tea maker that was handy when fighting the cold brought from outside! Some rooms are smaller than others, but none of the 3 I've got were tiny. All of them had a TV, free safe and an electric fan. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom and toileteries. Plenty of towels too. Everything was clean and cosy. Main thing I missed was a free internet connection at the lobby. It was quite pricey. Breakfast was included and was very a good buffet style one: boiled eggs, ham, cheese, cereal, youghurt, different bread rolls, toasts, coffee, tea... for me it was more than enough! There's also a vending machine with chips, snacks and soft drinks. The bar was small but nice and the barman was entertaining and provided good service. One of the things why I like this hotel is the location. It is very near the Leidseplein, an area with lots of shops, restaurants and cafes. It's not in the middle of the noise tho, but in a nice quiet street at the other side of the canal. The Vondelpark and the Museum Plein are just a short walk away. Many canal cuises have stops nearby. About the public transport, at Leidseplein you can find various buses and tram stops that can take you almost everywhere. There's also a direct bus connection with the airport that takes you to Leidseplein in a bit less than 30 minutes. If I am not wrong, 197 and 370 are the ones. If you stay in this hotel or this area, better the bus service than the train to the central station. If you need to catch a very early flight, there's also a shuttle mini-bus service for various hotels around, including this one, but that's a lot more expensive than the regular ones I mentioned before. The concierges at the hotel were very nice in each stay. In the last one they also saved my luggage at a storage room.

The location of the hotel is OK though, in a quiet neigbourhood and not too far from the hub of the city. Breakfast was skimpy, with only one hot dish ie. the egg which is hardcooked (no need for use of the disposable egg cups). The chambermaid only partially cleaned our room, barely straightening up the beds and did not even empty our almost full bins on the 2nd day. Towels which were hung up however, were changed. So much for being environmentally friendly. Checking-out at 11am was not usual for us and it was strictly non-negotiable even though we explained that we had a 7pm flight out of Amsterdam. Surprisingly, we were asked to pay EUR9,50 being taxes, although our stay was prepaid as part of a SAS package.

We (my partner and I) were so pleased with everything about it, the room was an ideal size for the two of us located on the second floor. EXTREMELY helpful reception staff who spoke a range of different languages fluently and an ideal continental breakfast that set us up for the day ahead and a hotel bar with friendly staff and reasonable prices. The hotel is within easy walking distance to the Van gogh museum (although the museum itself was outrageously boring and massively disappointing), the Rijksmuseum and the Heineken brewery (which is a fabulous experience including complimentary drinks!!) The hotel room has a free map which includes a variety of vouchers for the major attractions and a detailed guide to the surroundings including a list of the tram lines that run directly to the Centraal station. The hotel is ideally located just a 5 minute walk from the Hard Rock Cafe, all the major tram lines and the Canal bus stops, (something we both highly recommend, 20 euros per person valid 24 hours on all three canal routes and you're able to hop on and off as you please, a great way to see the city!, much better than a boring bus you get in most major capital cities!). The room was always cleaned by the time we arrived back to the hotel after a full day out including fresh towels, toiletries and empty bins. You are to hand your room key into reception whenever you leave the hotel and reception is manned behind a locked front door 24 hours a day which made us both feel very safe inside the hotel. Upon arrival we could leave our bags in the locked luggage room and again before we departed for the airport, which again was so easy to get to and recommended by the reception staff to take the bus for 3 euro each rather than the expensive, unreliable shuttle.

We got it at a good price due to the recession but even having said that, there were lots of bargains available that I wish I had chosen instead. We were really disappointed. We arrived at the hotel at 11am, told we could leave our luggage, but the room was not ready. We went out and came back at 8pm. We were really tired and just wanted to get a quick shower, a little snooze, and then go out. Unfortunately we could not because the room was ABSOLUTELY FREEZING. It was on the ground floor facing the front and 2 walls were sheer glass, then a big window had been left open and the heating was not on. Its February and its Amsterdam. We shut the windoow and put the heating on and got into our bed to try to keep warm. Even when I put my outdoor coat back on, and lay under the thin duvet, I was shivering and nearly crying with the cold. The other big problem was the location of our room. As well as the street noises, we had a constant sound of thump thump thump, bang bang bang.... right outside our room was a wooden staircase which seemed to be in constant use. It was so noisy. Really if they want to have a staircase right next to someones room, get a thick carpet on it! After an hour I went to reception to complain, they brought 2 duvets more, but their attitude was really that we should just wait til the heating warms the room up. Yes, we did that, but it was 10pm before the room was warm and so we ended up going out late because we couldn't dare get in the shower before that, too cold!! So we felt that the hotel had really spoiled our plans for the evening, we didn't get our little snooze due to the cold and noise, so were tired and grumpy... They said they didn't have another room for us. I know its not good for the environment to heat empty rooms... but knowing its a big room, with massive windows, that people are going to stay in it, that its february, it would have been sensible to at least close the windows and put the heating on low during the day. The breakfast was ok, not much choice of bread was left, when I asked a staff member, who had a white roll for her own consumption in her hand, if they had any white rolls left, she said no in a kind of rude way.

Most hotels give you 90 million horrible scratchy blankets, but it had a big comfy duvet, was like sleeping in a cloud! better than my bed at home!! The room could get chilly (it was december so yeah it will) so we put the radiator on and it soon warmed up and was cosy and nice!

This is an excellent 3 star hotel which is the best I've stayed in in Amsterdam (having been there 5 times). It simply couldn't be any better without adding features that would make it a four star. Location: You just can't fault it. The hotel is very well located in a beautiful, quiet, leafy street which is 2 minutes from the Vondel Park, the Leidseplein and the museums. The hotel: Most hotels in Amsterdam are very tall and narrow buildings which struggle to function as a hotel because of a lack of space. Anyone who has stayed in Amsterdam before will know this. This hotel however is much larger than normal and is the width of 4 buildings together which means that there is ample room for a breakfast room, a bar and a lift which you can get more than 2 people in. The breakfast: A very well organised and well laid out affair with a selection of meats, breads, cheeses, tea, coffee etc. The room and tables are very spacious and you don't feel you are fighting for food as you do in some hotels. The rooms: My room was a decent size and very clean. The hotel photos don't do it justice. The only minor downside was the bathroom which was just a shower and possibly the smallest \"smallest room\" I've ever seen but then it was clean and did everything I needed it to do. I think other rooms in the hotel are different sizes because the building is over a hundred years old and its upper floors use the attic space. I saw two rooms when I was there and both were fine. The staff: Helpful and courteous at the front desk; invisible and efficient everywhere else: just the way I like it.

One morning, two guys split the equivalent of a full loaf of bread between themselves. The housekeeping staff were fine. The desk clerks varied from helpful and friendly to a couple of curt staff.

We actually took the bus Interliner 370 to this hotel (Leidseplein stop), about 5 mins walk. We think the 370 bus is a better alternative than the train from the Schiphol Airport since it's cheaper (5 strips if you get the strip ticket at the bookstore in the Airport. 15 strips on 1 ticket costs Euro 6.70) and you do not need to transfer (Good when you have luggages). The bus ride was quick (about 25 mins) and painless. - The rooms are good size in Europe. - Staff was very helpful. - Not much noise heard. - Nice neighborhood, near Leidseplein. - Showerhead is good. - Safe available in the room. - Clean. The level of cleanliness is very good. Cons: - The hotel may need a bit of renovation. In fact, I changed my room because the halogen lamp in the first room was broken so it was quite dark. Even in the second room when the halogen lamp was working, i think the lighting was still not enough. - The breakfast (included) was only okay without much selection. I am not asking for a grand breakfast at all, but i have been to other hotels that offer more choices on, e.g. spread for bread, which was nice. Others: - If I remember correctly, this is the only hotel I visited that provides soap AND shampoo for guests.
