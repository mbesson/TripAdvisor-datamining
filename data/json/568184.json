{"Reviews": [{"Content": "pretty bad At christmas/New Years it is hard to find a cheap place around this time of year so we chose this one as it had a kitchen and a washing machine so we could save some money. Let me just say the word apartment is a bit misleading...not what we expected. What it is is basically shared accomodation, some seperate bedrooms, 2 bathrooms one being laundry as well, and a kitchen.When we (my girlfriend and myself) first arrived we were ok with it. We are trying to save money and be cheap. But gradually during our stay things made us quickly change our mind.There is no lounge area so i dont know what some people are talking about in their reviews, and the dishwasher doesnt work either. We are travelling cheap so it was ok to rough it but of all the cheap places we have been to, this ones pretty bad. Everything there is falling apart. The toilets dont flush. You have to turn on the water to the toilets, flush then turn it off as the tank leaks. The washing machine is ok a bit rundown but does the job. The kitchen, now this is where i would have rather stayed in a hostel. At least the kitchen gets cleaned in a hostel by some staff member. There were crumbs all over the place, stains over the stove. One of the burners is broken, the top of the stove's cupboard is peeling off. The oven is pretty seedy with dried food crusted onto the base, and when you turn it on the kitchen smells foul, some saucepans leak and others look quite revolting. I got sick one night after cooking in the kitchen. im not sure if it was the tomatoes or the chopping board. Some people were chopping raw meat on it a day later so maybe thats why i got sick...raw meat on the same board. Another thing, now that im on a roll, the heating gets turned on only from 6pm till midnight. then from 6am till 9 am. I dont know if the owner is trying to save money but when its snowing outside you really freeze inside. Fortunatly we managed to reprogram the thing so we could have all night heating.oh and if your booking a double just bear in mind it is just two single beds pushed together. Another reviewer wrote of it being recently renovated...maybe 10 years ago...the bathroom IS spotless but no rails to put your things on so they have to sit on the floor (no bathmats) and get wet while you have a shower.Also one of the showers doesnt drain properly. So you feel like your standing in a puddle of water constantly and you have to cut it short in case everything overflows. On the positive side... it depends what your after. If you want just a cheap place to crash and near the centre of everything and you dont mind a bit of filth, and you are traveling with a friend then yeah this place is ok, but if you expect anything more i really do not recomend it.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR844396989", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great location Just got back from staying at the Arch - Clelia, Florence. The apartment was great value being just a few minutes walk from all of the major sites. The apartment itself consisted of quite a large lounge, separate dining kitchen ( complete with dishwasher and washing machine), a bed room with 2 single beds (there was also another fold up bed) and a spotless, large, modern bathroom. The apartment has recently been renovated and is simply, but tastefully, decorated. Anyone who is not particularly healthy should be aware that the apartment is on the third floor of an old building which does not have lift - although this did not cause any problem to either my friend or I, both of whom are middle-aged. We also met the owner Clelia who was really nice and friendly. All in all a great value place to stay in Florence.", "Date": "Jun 5, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR306462843", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "footiefan"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d568184-r4313463-Archi_Clelia_Apartments-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "568184", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
