My only complaint about this hotel is that the pillows are SO hard, it's like sleeping on a rock! How to get there: Take the vaporetto to the San Marco square stop. DO NOT TAKE A TAXI BOAT. They wanted 60 euro, whereas the vaporetto was 6.50 euro each. When you get off, walk to the right until you get to the main entrance/exit on the left.

We traveled here a while ago , mysel my wife and our daughter who at the time was only 4 Months old , we stayed in march, with snow on the ground a baby plus luggage we must have been mad !! . WE LOVED IT , what an adventure ,even if it was freezing cold , yes getting from the airport was a bit of a faff , but this is venice, so it's to be expected - and it all adds to the experience. The water taxi dropped us at Piazza San Marco and the directions we were given from our travel agent took straight to the door of the hotel , (a good 5 minute walk ) I could'nt believe how central this little hotel was. We had a small room at the front of the hotel , the addition of our own travel cot made this even cosier , but hey we had bagged three nights in venice for around \u00c2\u00a3400 including air fairs , so you are prepared to be a little forgiving. The staff were always friendly ,and able to offer advice when asked for. The lack of an evening meal option was a bit of a let down , but we managed, and found some great inexpensive resturants around the Piazza , The breakfasts were your typical continental affair, so plenty to eat even if it wasn't Bacon & eggs !!. The rooms are small , but again don't forget this is Venice so land & property are naturally at a premium.. But that said ours was comfortable with an en suite and Mini bar. We loved it here , and the experience gave me a lasting love affair for Venice that I will never forget.. I have rated the room as average - but that said It should be better than average - only slight detraction was it's size - but as I have previously said that is more than forgivable..

First, getting here: When arriving at the airport and after getting through customs, signs will direct you to baggage claim and to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transportation area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. No big deal here, just follow the signs. However, getting to the island itself is a different story\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 First, you do have several options. In hind sight, I would MOST DEFINATLY recommend getting a water \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taxi\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, not the water \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There is a third option of taking an actual motorized vehicle bus, but it only travels to Venice (via a causeway bridge) and has one drop off point. If you take the actual vehicle bus to the one drop off point, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be walking for probably 30min to 1.5 hours to any given point on the main island. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on any of the other islands (i.e. Murano or Lido), then your only option is really a water taxi or water bus anyways \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so keep reading. I strongly recommend the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153water taxi\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fast, and will take you right to your hotel (if your hotel is on a canal) or a major drop off point close enough to it. We took a water bus b/c it was significantly cheaper at 25 euro per person round trip vs 100 euro for the water taxi one way. However, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the kicker \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the water bus operates like an actual vehicular bus, meaning it makes several (if not a dozen or so) stops along the way to San Marco Square (which is where this hotel is located). It took us literally 1 hour and 50 minutes to get from the airport to San Marco Square!!! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say it again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1hr50min boat ride! No joke, not kidding, and not very much fun. So, again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the water taxi is 100 euro for the boat, not per-person. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got 4 people (or more) in your group, spring for the extra price tag and take the water taxi. I think you can have up to 8 people in a water taxi, and still \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only 100 euro (the more people in your group, the more cost effective). There are several kiosks/stands in the transportation area on the 1st floor of the airport, so make your way there to purchase tickets on whatever mode of travel you select. FYI: The water bus ticketing company we bought our passes from charged our credit card transaction as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cash advance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find this out until we got home, and credit card company said there was nothing they could do about it. Anyways, whatever you select to get here, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to disembark the water bus/taxi at San Marco Square to get to the Hotel Comfort Diana. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, because there are two stops for San Marco Square, if you miss the first one or are unsure don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t freak out, just relax and get off at the second and make your way to the main square. Once in the square, make your way to the Bar American, you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss it. Travel north past the Bar American through the tunnel, and then take your first right. Once you take the right, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be traveling due East \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then take your 2nd left. Go about 75 yards North (you should now be on Calle dei Specchieri). Hotel will be on your right side, and do \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look Up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as someone else said below, b/c you can and probably will pass it the first time or two. If you get lost, or can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the street, just ask \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most locals are friendly enough to help if they can. Second, the hotel: So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got mixed feelings about this property. Basically, this is an older hotel which probably hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been updated in years, if not multiple decades. You can sense the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of this place with its obvious age! The beds are hard as a table, and the pillows lack any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fluff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Comforter smelled musty too. In essence, not very good nights sleep. On the flip side the sheets and linens were clean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a plus I guess. Also, d\u00c3\u00a9cor and furnishings (and the room as a whole) were obviously not up-to-date, and I doubt they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be renovated any time soon. Furthermore, the price was astronomical for the quality you get. I think I paid about $458/usd per night. However, I pretty much knew all this going into this place. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read on Tripadvisor prior to making my reservation, so I was well informed on what to expect. With that said, I just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I comprehended how much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old world charm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this place would have, and believe me, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a lot of it. The staff seemed really indifferent to our needs or requests. Upon arriving, the front dest clerk give off an attitude like: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh great, here are some more Americans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, very un-welcoming feeling. Then, once we got settled into the room later that evening, there were no towels. After a call down to the front desk, and 30min later we got 2 (two) towels for 4 people in our room. Again, staff service not that great. It did get better the next couple of days/nights. We got the towel issue straight the next morning, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast was great. They lady who serves you was very nice & warm to us and our daughter, so kudos to her. We stayed in an adjoined two bedroom \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which was well suited for our 4 person troop! The rooms themselves, while from the times of antiquities, were very clean. TV was small, and only in the 1st bedroom, but then again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in Venice to watch TV, so this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us at all. With all that said \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saving grace, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top feature by far \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location, location, location!!!!! This hotel is literally a block from San Marco Square. From there, you are walking distance from anywhere on the main island of Venice. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t begin to say enough about how this hotel is right on top of the action! Multiple restaurants (all very good) on the same street as the hotel, and around San Marco Square. If you want to be in the thick of it all, then this IS the hotel to be at! 3rd, when traveling around Venice: There is also a couple of the water bus/taxi stops in front of or near San Marco Square. I recommend buying a day pass for the water busses (10 euro/day), and you get unlimited use, takes you to pre-designated stops along the Grand Canal and multiple surrounding islands. You CAN walk to pretty much anywhere, but after the first couple of days, the water buses will be your friend! 4th, when eating at restaurants: Be aware, that most places charge a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cover charge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to a night club, AND that gratuity is almost always included (typically around 12.5%). This really irked me, b/c most waiters were just going through the motions, and not really waiting on you. Service at most restaurants was limited to getting your drink order (not coming back for refills), and dropping food off at your table with the check. With that said, the food was fantastic at everyplace we ate at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so at least they got that right! OK, so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my 2 cents and opinion on the Comfort Hotel Diana & the City of Venice. Hope this helps someone make a decision. Pics included of the hotel for visual reference. I think this place fairly deserves 3 out of 5 rating. Room quality really about a \u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the location is a \u00e2\u20ac\u01535\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Again, to sum it up, older out-dated hotel which is clean & maintained well, but in an awesome location! Would recommend, and would stay here again.

The map was confusion and color coded yet there was no legend, Needless to say we got lost alot. There were 9 of us and we were all on different floors. 2 of us were on the very top floor which meant we had to take the elevator and then carry our bags up a narrow, circular staircase. We were forced to carry our luggage because evidently the porter only works when he feels like it. Once we got up to our room we were okay until we entered the bathroom and saw ants, and other weird bugs (centipede look alikes) coming from the sink. We told the front desk and she basically told us were lying. She said no other guest has other complained about this and she lived down the street and has never had an issue with bugs. I'm still trying to figure out what her living down the street has to do with my room in the hotel having bugs but I digress, She then proceeded to give me directions to the market so I could buy bug spray. Of course I was two minutes from cursing her out but I asked her to go look in the rooms and see for herself. She couldn't do it right away and we had reservations so we left. When we returned she said she looked in the rooms and didn't see anything. Big surprise. The shower sprays some sort of debris out when the water is on (dirt, hair, etc) so taking a shower was out of the question.

We had a really nice stay (Mar 12 - Mar 19 2011). We had a little trouble finding the street it was on as some construction on Piazza San Marco was covering up the signs that might have shown us the street name. (And you have to get used to street meaning something in the US we might consider an alley, often easy to miss), but after a few turns, we found the street and got to the hotel. The staff were always pleasant and helpful. Check in was very easy. Our room had a double bed and its own bathroom. The bathroom was large with a tub, bidet and a heated towel rack.. The bedroom was small and the only place to put clothes was a large armoire. Good for hanging things but no real room for small folded items like socks and underwear. There was working safe in the armoire that we used. 2 night stands by the bed, small but each had a deep drawer. The lighting in the bedroom was adequate - a large ceiling fixture that has only part of its lamps working plus 2 wall sconces that were to be used as bed side lights. The sconces did not provide enought light to read by if the main room light was turned off. There was a flat screen TV off to the side on top of a desk. It was somewhat hard to watch from bed as you had to turn you neck a lot & liable to get a stiff neck from the position. 2 English channels BBC news and CNBC news. Breakfast was inlcuded with our room, served 7:30 - 10:00 I believe. The breakfast room was at the back of the lobby. There appeared to be a nice patio but it was closed since the weather was too cool yet. Breakfast was brought out to you, a basket of breads (2 warm fruit filled croissant, 3 plain rolls, packed dry toasts/crackers) a basket of 2 yoghurts with assorted jams, honey and butter. Some type of a juice was served, never sure what kind it was, rather weak and you had your choice of tea, coffees, or chocolate to drink. No meats, eggs or cereals. The staff did check with us during our meal to see if we wanted any more to drink or any more bread, etc which was nice. But what was brought was sufficient. If you did not like the choice of yogurt brought out, they were quite happy to change it for you to some other flavor of your choice. The location right behind St Mark's is excellent. Many restaurants nearby but they looked more touristy than we wanted so we eat in other areas of the city. Our room (302) was at the back of the hotel and looked out over a small back street. The street was quiet. We occasionally heard other people in their rooms or in the halls but not much. They have a laptop that their clients can use, once the breakfast room is empty. You get a login from the desk and you can use the laptop for up to an hour at a time. You cannot print from the laptop. To do that, you need to email the documents to the hotel email address and they will print it for you. For our boarding passes, which downloaded as .pdf files, it was easier for me to go to an internet cafe and get everything directly & print directly. But others may find that they can work out the printing of things. The room had a minifridge stocked with water, sodas and prosecco. The charges were extremely reasonable (1euro for water, 2 euro for soda) so we sometimes used them as it was convenient & not too expensive.

Beds were clean and comfortable and all rooms had free wireless-which we didn't have phones or computers, but brought our hand held wireless devices (an itouch and droid). The location could not have been better! Every morning we were awakened by the bells of San Marco-which we enjoyed that experience! Only gripes, which we could live with.....breakfast is very very minimal, almost not worth spending the time on. Basically consists of a croisant, or raisin bread or something, coffee, juice, or tea. Also, the shower heads are about 4 feet tall-not sure why they're built that way, but they are. Showers have good pressure and plenty of hot water and towels, they're just short (?). Food and shopping are steps from the room, so breakfast wasn't really a problem-we ate the breakfast and just ate lunch whenever we got hungry while we were out sightseeing. Another strange requirement is you need to turn in your room key every time you leave the hotel-not sure what that's all about, but we did and no one at the desk griped about getting our room key for us multiple times during the day. Oh one more gripe-temperature wasn't easy to regulate, but they have these wonderful large windows that open out to the street and we just opened the windows if the room got stuffy.

We had a window which overlooked a courtyard. You will have to leave your roomcard at front desk when you go out. I guess you can't lose it that way! A small bathroom with (very interesting) hair dryer. Your appliances will not work unless you have adaptors. The air was off for the season but room was very comfortable and quiet. A lovely breakfast with choice of caffine =) and breads with spreadable cheese and jams. Included with hotel rate. I paid 12 Euros at hotel in Mestre for same breakfast post cruise. They held our luggage for us while we explored Venice till it was time to leave for the Marritima. You cannot buy the same cheap one way tickets on water bus from San Marco or Rialto. I believe it was 6 Euros for a one hour ticket each. We spent 13 euros for a 12 hour and rode the bus around Venice and out to Murano and the Lido. We considered it a cheap tour. Then we fetched our bags and headed back to Rialto to catch the bus to Piazzole Roma where we caught our shuttle to the ship.

The second room was also spacious but was decorated fairly blandly. The beds were very comfortable but warning the rooms at the front of the hotel get the full on tones from the bells on the square which start from 6 in the morning. Safety was not an issue both in the hotel or in Venice. On the last day of our trip we were able to leave our luggage by the front door of the hotel and it was still safe and sound when we went back to collect it. The hotel is really close to San Marco Square and was very competitvely priced for its location. The continental breakfast was not great but I would say it compared to pretty much all the other hotels I have stayed at in Italy. The front desk staff were really helpful. One tip I would pass on is do not eat anywhere near San Marco Square as the prices are ridiculously high for very average food. The water bus connections were great and I would recommend buying a one or two day waterbus ticket from the airport as they definately saved us money compared to buying one off tickets.

This was our hotel of choice....and not a bad choice at all. It is definitely the reach of everything!!! We booked this hotel at the website choicehotel.com Lets see, we arrived at Venice airport at 8am. The next water bus to St. Marks was not until 8:45.(may I mention the most economical too!) It was 12euro pp one way. Honestly, once you get to the hotel, you can walk everywhere else. The water taxi's were advertised at 90 euros per trip. WOW!! On the bad side it took over one hour and twenty minutes to get to St. Marks on the waterbus because it is the last stop on the route and the water bus goes maybe 5km ...geesh..never the less, open your window or step on the back balcony and fill your camera with pictures. Since our check-in was not supposed to be until noon...what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the rush? right? Once we arrived you get off and like the other reviewer said \"follow the crowds\" You will past plenty of vendors to comeback later and buys things..Speaking of the vendors..look around because alot of times you can get the same thing ALOT cheaper. When you are actually in St.Marks square you will be facing a blue clock and above the clock there is a bell tower with two statues, ( St Marks church should be on you right hand side too. ) make a right there. Then go down your second street on the left. Cross over one street and the hotel is maybe 5doors down. Hotel Diana is located across from the Hotel PANDA. I took the liberty to give such detailed directions because we originally planned to arrive at night. Everything closes about 7pm. There are street lights, but dim lights. If we would have arrived on the 945pm flight we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have made it to St.Marks until 11pm. It seems it would have been a ghost town. The street names are painted high up on the buildings. The hotel does not have a sign pointing out from it, only a sign screwed above the doors. So when you see the hotel Panda sign, you know it is right across from it. If you get to the Best Western sign, you have traveled too far. (check out the pictures I took for better navigation.) We arrived at the hotel at 1010am. Unfortunately check-in is not until noon and our room was not yet available. The receptionist was nice though. He said if we came back in 30minutes it would be ready. He allowed us to leave our baggage. We had a walking tour leaving from the Gardens at 11:00am. We took the tour and when we came back our baggage was unharmed and the room was ready. The hotel has a lift (which was very slow) it took twice the amount of time to make it to the room. (If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have baggage, just take the stairs) The lift can comfortably accommodate 2 adults and two pieces of luggage. We had room 302 which faces the alley...no problems there with me. The room is a bit small but enough space to get around. They had older decor in the room but a new plasma tv and two english speaking news stations. The bathroom was very spacious and well cleaned! The only thing about the bath accommodations was the towels smelled if they had been cleaned in vinegar rather than soap. The room has central heating and air (which the heat would not come on) But more than likely; like most smaller hotels, the front desk had the on/off switch to change from heat/cold mode. The temperature in Venice was quite comfortable so we didnt really need it except for on one incident when we had left a window open. The morning continental breakfast was satisfactory. After you sit down a woman brings your stuff out to you. There were coffee, cappuccino, tea, juice, biscotti, crackers, croissants, rolls, cheese, jellies, jams and yogurts. Mind you that I have notice while in Italy that they recycle rolls...(if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat your bread out your basket then they will put it back in a bin to reserve to the next guest) So we did not partake in anything we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see come out a bag or wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sealed. My husband is a pretty hearty eater. They initially give you two croissants in your basket. So he had asked for another one. No probs...but when he asked for the third croissant...she seemed a little unwilling. Mind you we did not eat the rolls, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want the biscotti or crackers. He had tried a cookie they had in the basket, but it fell apart when you touched it (not sure what kind of cookies they were) and neither one of us wanted the yogurt. OF course she gave it to him, but after yelling something in Italian about croissants to the guy at the front desk...(lol) When it was time to head out , we had an early morning flight. The water bus starts as early as 340am. Since the rooms have no clocks, we had to arrange for a wake up call. I really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say what got us up that morning, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t our wake up call. We woke up and felt we had slept much longer than we should have. We called to the front desk and there was no answer. We rushed to get dressed, feeling they may had forgotten our wake up call, then the phone rings...and the guy is saying its your wake up call...Hmmm... From the sound in his voice I felt we may have had woken him up. Never the less he said it was 300am and we were all rounded up and headed out by 325am. The water bus is maybe 5 minutes from the hotel. Since the ticket booths are closed, pay when you get on board. After he has picked up all the stops he will come around for your ticket or your money. If anything I wish they had for sure is an alarm clock. My husbands watch battery died earlier in the trip so we had to call down to ask for the time. All for all it was a great experience. I would stay here again and recommend to a friend. There are plenty of places to eat close by including what I have found the most affordable is a Mcdonalds. You can get an Extra value meal for 7.90 euros. Everything else is Italian.. Most pizzas will start at 8.90 euros and a 3course dinner is 15 euros. (pp prices) There are Gucci Stores and other high dollar stores. If I can recommend to take a grand canal tour and a walking tour to get the most out of your stay.

My basis for choosing this one was finding the most reasonable price in the St. Mark's Square area. The price we got was about $200 per night. While this is vastly overpriced for the room itself, it is a function of the location. As previously mentioned in other reviews, this hotel is located on a side street just a quick one minute walk from St. Mark's Square. Since St. Mark's is a key tourist site in Venice, and, in many ways, the hub of nighttime activity in Venice, this is a fantastic location. To get to the hotel if you are arriving via train, take the water taxi (vaporetto) from right in front of the train station to the St. Mark's Square stop. (Piazza San Marco). Beware that there is a stop a bit before the right one with a similar name (Piazza San Marcoulo or similar) - this is not the right stop. Once off the vaporetto, follow the crowd to St. Mark's Square. The clock tower is located opposite the water (you can't miss it.) Take the first right under the clock tower and go down to the second? or third? \"alley\" on the left - Calle dei Spechieri. The hotel is a little bit down on the right-hand side. The front of the hotel is marked, but as the front is flush with other buildings and no sign juts out from it, it can be easy to miss if you are not paying attention. All in all, it's about a 5 or 6 minute walk from the vaporetto stop to the hotel. Not bad at all with wheelies or backpacks. The hotel offers no amenities (but what do you need them for when you are in Venice???). The lobby/breakfast area is somewhat small and spartan. Note to claustrophobics: the elevator is extremely small and slow. It fits two people comfortably - more than two is too much and not possible if there is also luggage. We had the room that was left when we booked - I think we got the last one. So not the best room in the hotel, I'm sure. I believe it was 105? At any rate, it had no view and was quite small. For the limited time we were in the room, this was not really an issue. Two twin beds pushed together, a small TV sitting on the desk. The bathroom was tiny - the toilet was so close to the bathroom counter, it almost felt like it was partly under it. While the room was tiny and looked old and very basic, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean - and we had air conditioning. So no complaints really on my part. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Baggage storage on checkout day was an unsecured alcove in lobby (but in full view of the desk attendant.) We left our bags for half the day and had no problems. Breakfast is included in the room rate. We did not partake of this, so I can't comment on it other than that it is offered. My key and only real issue with the hotel was noise. The walls are paper thin. During the night this was not an issue, however once people started getting up in the morning, it sounded as if they were in the room with us. There are plenty of restaurants, etc in the area. Overall - clean, comfortable bed, A/C, breakfast included, FANTASTIC LOCATION.

We were running out of options since we booked fairly late, there were 4 of us traveling and we were having trouble finding 2 double rooms and we had a short time in Venice and didnt want to end up in Mestre. We lucked out and found a room for 4 people at the Comfort Hotel Diana. The location is the best part of this hotel. It is less than a 2 minute walk to San Marco and there are plenty of restaurants and shops within a 5 minute walk. Even the walk to the Rialto is about 5 minutes away. The room we had (306) was actually 2 rooms with a door separating the bedrooms located on the street side of the hotel. The entry room had the closet and the tv. The second room had the bath entrance. The hotel was clean and the bath was modern, the tv was a flat screen and the rest of the room appeared older and a bit worn, but still looked decent and comforting. There was a huge window in each room that opened to provide air. It was a bit noisy late at night and again in the morning when the delivery people started with their carts down the cobble streets, but you cant control if/when there will be people out having a night out. I do not know what the rooms in the back had in the way of noise since our room faced the street. If you have a problem with noise, then any room with an open window will be a problem, but for us it wasnt a big deal. The noise ended around midnight and the deliveries started off and on around 7am. We arrived around 9am and wanted to see if we could check in early if available. The front desk man looked at our confirmation sheet and pointed out 12noon checkin, come back then. He said we could leave our bags in the corner though. We came back at noon and were able to check in with no problems. All 3 of the front desk people we had dealings with were a little short, but not sure if this was a language/cultural issue or they were all just like this at the hotel. We just avoided them if possible. The breakfast was ok. Dont expect anything fancy, but we just wanted something to get us going and that was about all it was. Coffee, tea or chocolate, a croissant and roll, butter, jam, processed cheese and biscotti and juice. The breakfast hostess was quick and polite and we didnt have any issues with the breakfast. There was plenty of hot water in the shower and the beds were comfortable. Again, nothing fancy, but we werent expecting to be staying in a 5 star modern hotel in the middle of Venice for the price we got. Overall, I would say this is a typical small European hotel and the price/location couldnt be beat.
