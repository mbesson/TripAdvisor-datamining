The area is Oak Cliff, however, so there are pockets of run down neighborhoods. It's not like driving through Uptown or Park Cities where you find a nice hotel surrounded by nice homes. Oak Cliff is still transforming. But don't let that scare you. Plenty of people are migrating to OC now and The Belmont has a great little bar to meet friends and hang out. The Bar: the bar is a nice place to get drinks. Prices run from $8-14 per drink. I think most of their drinks come out nicely but I always think Dallas bartenders could use a lesson in making a good strong drink. The Belmont is no different in that area. Regardless, there is a nice, small sitting area inside and a larger patio outdoors with a skyline view. You can also walk to the pool and there is a grass lawn you can sit on with the #1 best view of Dallas. The Hotel: The hotel is overpriced and not worth the money. Their nicest room (The Terrace Suite) is about $500 a night. That competes with a room at the Ritz and for the money & service, you get a FAR better deal at the Ritz. If you're going to compete with the Ritz Carlton, you better step up your game, Belmont. The Terrace Suite (which I have stayed in twice now) is cute but stripped of any frills. It's not charming. It's just there. Furniture, decor, amenities; it's all on par with a normal motel. The bed frame falls off if you accidently hit it while climbing into bed. It has a hot tub, yes, but it's never hot enough. For $500, I expect more than a lukewarm tub of water and a broken bed frame. I think customer service should be judged on everyday service but also, and almost more importantly, on the service you get when you are unsatisfied with something. In that area, the Belmont lacks greatly. If you have a problem, don't expect the Belmont to step up and give you immediate, great customer service. I had a recent stay in the Terrace Suite and had an extremely disappointing experience. Four people in our party complained in person and after hearing nothing back from the Belmont, I finally wrote a formal letter of complaint. I have yet to be contacted personally with feedback about that letter. I believe the assistant manager, after a week and a half of verbal and written complaints by our party, offered half off our next stay. This was after I contacted the hotel manager and she told me \"oh, he (asst manager) must have forgotten, I'll remind him to call.\" I find it ridiculous that it took four different people complaining, a formal letter on my part, and a reminder to the hotel manager before we received feedback from the Belmont staff. On top of that frustration, the Belmont offered a coupon that holds no value for us since we already told the manager we would not be back in the near future because, 1) we all live in Dallas and 2) we were only there for a special event. The real issue is that after what we experienced, we do not want to come back. Not only do I think I will waste my money on another room at the Belmont, but I do not trust that if I have a problem with my next stay that the staff will take the initiative to solve my issue in a prompt and appropriate manner. I have included the letter I sent to the manager of the hotel below. \"Dear Ms. Spagna, I grew up in the Oak Cliff area and I along with my family are regular, returning customers to the Belmont. On Friday the 20th, I attended a bridal party located in the Terrace Suite. During our stay, we had repeated noise complaints against us from the woman in the adjoining room of our suite. She became so aggravated that she banged aggressively on the adjoining room door, shouted profanities and called us names --. This was reported to your staff that evening, Jerald, who took no action against the woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s verbal abuse. We considered the matter closed so you can imagine our surprise and embarrassment when the police arrived while the bride was showering and guests were in their pajamas. The Belmont Hotel was aware in advance that this was a bridal party and that, according to the hotel's own staff, the other guest had a history of noise complaints throughout her stay. The hotel staff member inspected our suite and confirmed there was no music, loud games or alcohol. The fact is, a small group of five women arrived late following a concert Friday night and the noise was not atypical of any hotel guest arriving to their room (doors opening/closing, people talking about sleeping arrangements, toilets flushing, etc.) Half of our bridal party was asleep immediately following the concert and any noise the woman in the adjoining room may have heard consisted strictly of four women speaking at a normal volume. The lack of concern or effort from your hotel staff, Jerald, was extremely upsetting. After presenting my valet ticket to him upon departure, he gave me the wrong set of keys. He then laid out all the keys in which he had possession (20 sets) and told me to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pick one.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can imagine how this act of disorganization and carelessness looks to a guest trusting your hotel with their car. It was a blatant lack of security. When Jerald finally did pull my car around, he opened the door and walked away, leaving the car running with the door open in the middle of the road. Jerald did not return to the lobby to notify me the car had been pulled around so it sat in the road running, door open, without my knowledge. The manner in which the incident was handled by the hotel escalated rather than resolved the matter and, in fact, prevented us from full use and enjoyment of our quite expensive suite. As a result, the entire bridal event was highly diminished by the experience. We are particularly upset in view of the significance of the event not to mention the fear caused from a verbal assault by one of your hotel guests. We would have gladly accepted a comparable accommodation in another suite had it been offered. The entire bridal party was extremely apologetic not only the night of the event but also on the following Saturday and Monday. However, we do not feel that anything we did warranted the verbal assault from the other hotel guest or a visit from three policemen. The bridal party would appreciate the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention to this disturbing matter and compensation for our embarrassment and inconvenience.\" If you do decide to stay at the hotel, just make sure your car keys aren't being strewn out for other hotel guests to pick from.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cThis is not a boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "JMT2213", "ReviewID": "UR124279638", "Content": "This is not a boutique hotel, it is a retro motor inn / motel.

It's one of my all-time favorite hotels in the US. They've taken a classic old motor court hotel and completely renovated it. It is wonderful. Each room in the bungalow section of the motor court is roomy with a bed and bathroom and small flat screen. The interior is a bit minimalist, but it completely works. Regardless, you shouldn't spend your time in your room anyway. Each bungalow has an attached covered patio so you can sit and enjoy the amazing views of the Dallas skyline and the beautiful landscaping around the rooms. Cactus, Hollywood juniper, fire grass, and other plants make the courtyard lush and peaceful. Perhaps the best part of the hotel is the pool. The pool is surrounded by black bamboo and that amazing view of the city. It's heated and has a wall at one end with a waterfall. Swimming at night is the best time to enjoy it. I haven't stayed in the main building which I believe is a more traditional setup with rooms off a hallway. In the main building is a hotel lounge and patio with more views of the city.

We used the complimentary shuttle (an Escalade!) to a nearby concert and the driver went above and beyond for us. He drove us through a lovely neighborhood and explained the history of the hotel. He also refused a tip! There were a few negatives- the wedding parties drank up all the coffee the next morning and there wasn't any to be had. Also, the upper parking lot where we parked above the restaurant turned into a mud pit after a rainstorm, which made getting out of there a messy prospect.

We enjoyed the quiet atmosphere of the Belmont. To call the Belmont sparse or minimal doesn't do it justice whatsoever; we loved the modern simplicity of the room and the adjoining patio (a former carport transformed to a stylish, almost zen-like privacy patio). I loved it so much I did my morning stretches in my jammies there. The queen-sized bed was comfortable and the room tastefully decorated in a retro style that wasn't at all comical. The modern TV was TINY and the closet could've used a light switch, but they were the teensiest flaw in an otherwise fantastic experience! Funny enough, we managed to lock ourselves outside onto the patio one morning and their staff responded quickly to get us in our room!! the staff were very professional, knowledgeable and weren't overly chatty. They were almost transparent... in a way that made our stay uniquely about us and the hotel that much more in the forefront. I was a little concerned about parking so far away from the room, but our car was safe in a lot adjacent to Smoke. The grounds of the Belmont are rich with greenery and the gentle sound of a trickling stream; it always made for the best strolls with my honey. The Belmont's patio off the lobby was alive with singing and music but not bothersome in our little bungalow located to the back of the grounds. The Belmont is a romantic, unique twist on the motor hotels of the 1950s but still gave you that step back in time without any goofy theatrics. Having Smoke nearby rounded out our experience perfectly. We can't say enough about the diverse and delicious meals we had at breakfast and lunch.

First clue this would be a bad experience. The room temperature rose to 80 as the afternoon got hotter, I'm sure the views are lovely but you'd be crazy to raise the blinds. I'm sure the pool is also nice, however apparently they rent the pool space out to private parties so we were unable to cool down there. By 11pm when we finally demanded our money back, the room was still 80 degrees. The staff was apologetic and immediately refunded our money without a fuss. However, I would still say this hotel is way overrated and overpriced. Outside of the temperature issue, the garden room we were in is a far cry from other hotels in the area we have stayed in that are in the same price range.

The view from that room is a great view of Downtown Dallas. We didn't get road noise but we heard our neighbors. The toilets have a power flush so we were awakened a couple times by our neighbors flushing. The window covering is a roll shade that was broken so it didn't keep the room dark. The bathroom was clean and the towels are oversized and nice. There is a SMALL shelf over the toilet and ony one hook. Thank goodness my toiletries bag can be hung. It's a 40's hotel but everything has been replaced so it looked retro. The room where the party was held was perfect for a party. There was a wet bar inside and a large patio with a hot tub. We all partied on the patio with the great view of Downtown to talk about. The valet is the best way to park your car. They are super nice and very helpful. It's not a great area of Dallas so you don't really want to self-park across the street. I think it was $15 to valet overnight but all in and out is free. The hotel lobby was cute and the staff was awesome. They have a very popular bar that is a cozy place to visit with friends. There is modern art on the walls, warm candlelite and a great music playlist. The pool area looked cool but I didn't get to spend any time there. For breakfast we ate at The Cliff restaurant on the property. I was amazed at how good everything was! Great biscuits and Gravy, pancakes, good bacon and their breakfast burrito was wonderful! This place was fun and retro. If you need luxury, go someplace else but we had a great time. Take it at face value. It's a 40's motel turned funky hotel. It's clean.

The hotel was booked to capacity (note to self: book early for next year's game). This was our first stay at the Belmont, and we loved the hotel. Because of events related to the State Fair and the football game (Texas Longhorns now ranked #1!), we didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel, but we did walk the grounds and ate at the Cliff Restaurant next door. In short, we had a wonderful experience. Despite the hotel being fully booked, or perhaps because they had planned for it, the staff was available and responsive, and we felt well \"attended,\" from the valet staff, to the staff members who drove the shuttle that took us to the bus station to catch a bus to the Fair, to the front desk and housekeeping staff. Mandy was especially considerate and helpful. Nice to see someone who keeps their cool on a what was almost certainly a demanding weekend, and seems to actually enjoy her job. Our room was basic, a room outside the main building in the old motor court area. The room was fresh and clean, and quiet (as we had requested). The bathroom was older with updates and sparkling clean, with large fluffy towels. We added the \"romance package\" to our stay, which included a nice French Brut champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries. The menu at the Cliff Restaurant was varied (light eating to full dinners), and our dinners and desserts were delicious, with super-attentive and friendly waitstaff. Room service is available from the Cliff. Valet parking is (or was, on this weekend anyway) $15.00 per night, and not free as we had expected, although the in-and-out was free. We used the valet since the parking was more secure, although there is a self-park lot next door to the Cliff Restaurant. We're already talking about returning to this charming restored hotel.

You will check in and since some of the rooms are located in different areas the Valet will drop you off with their golf cart. The hotel is atop of a hill and spread out.

It has some of the original fixtures, tile, and concrete walls. Props to the owner for leaving it that way but modernizing it with the decor and furniture. I rented the loft suite! I cannot say that i've been anywhere that had a view like this. You could practically touch the Dallas skyline with your fingertips. It's gorgeous! It had 2 floors, downstairs was not large at all only to fit a day bed and wall length desk, flat screen, countertop with sink and a bathroom with a stand up shower. Upstairs was much larger, queen size bed, daybed, wall mounted flat screen and bathroom with standup shower. i read that someone thought it was in a sketchy area, not true. Why would you even walk off the grounds, it has everything you need! The hotel was very accomodating about having guests over. It has the BarBelmont which had flawless service, and a skyline view as well! Like i said i stayed in the loft so i'm not sure if everyone will have a view like ours so ask to be placed in a suite that will.

I was waiting out front of the hotel restaurant (overlooking a Dollar General Store) watching for my friend to walk down the hill from the hotel and there was this group of crazy looking gangster types walking down Ft Worth Ave (very bad area) they were just hanging around, drinking out of paper bags. They were scary and I just froze as they approached. I was not sure whether to run or scream but I just stepped backward towards the door. One of the guys rushed towards me and got about 10 feet from me so fast. He thought it was hilarious. Tattoos on the face and neck and visibly wasted. He walked away and threw down his paper bag/bottle. I managed to duck into the restaurant, which was really pretty.

She made it safely. Dinner was ok but service was painfully slow and they were out of the entr\u00c3\u00a9e I ordered. I only found out they ran out after waiting for my meal. They were a little unorganized in general. Waitstaff was nice. So I went back up the hill with her to see her room. Cute bungalow that was correctly represented on the website. The only problem is that it backs up to some big construction site and they start working early each morning. Later I walked back down to the parking lot and hurried into my car. My heart was pounding. It is just a dangerous area. It did not help that on my way out I commented to an employee and they just chuckled and said that the area IS bad and they see a lot of crazy stuff.

We were to attend a film party near the east end of Commerce Street, which runs through the heart of town and becomes Fort Worth Avenue before the entrance to the Belmont, a couple minutes west of downtown. The view in the evening is stunning, as the Belmont sits high enough to have uncluttered views of the lighted Dallas skyline from the right spots on the property. We returned just before the kitchen closed at 10 and enjoyed the last set of a band on the outdoor terrace, excellent pan seared goat cheese and mozzarella crostini appetizers plus wine. Then double chocolate mousse cake. Our corner room overlooked downtown and just north of town, was spacious, the bed firm and comfortable, the shower strong, Kiehl's shampoo, conditioner and lotion appreciated. Valet always was prompt with our car, never a wait. With so much to like it was puzzling that the room had no drawers, no light in the large closet, one bar of soap and the bathroom needed a better cleaning, an old razor found behind the toilet. With so much to like, maybe this was an aberration, but we hope more attention is paid to cleaning.", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cperfect for romantic getaway\u201d", "Author": "grinkle", "ReviewID": "UR6801586", "Content": "This is such a cool hotel, very \"noirish\", rat pack, 50's, space-age swingin' batchelor pad kind of vibe, with funky and artsy overtones.

This old school 40's motor lodge looks like it has been plucked off of Route 66 or out of the Palm Springs desert and landed near downtown Dallas. The staff is comprised of Dallas hipsters (very nice, helpful, beautiful ones) with style and flair. We felt right at home right away. We were there for a casting call for a network television show and when the staff found out, they treated us like mini celebrities...even though we are just restaurateurs from Texas. Our standard room was very nice with a great view of downtown Dallas. Love the decor, mid century mixed with ultra mod. The bar is like a cozy den of some fabulous, creative interior decorator. The drinks are done to perfection and the bar appetizers and food available fits the surroundings (brie quesadillas, hummus, potstickers, anti pasta plates etc..). We were lucky enough to get a surprise call back and ended up having to stay another night even though we had already checked out. I called the Belmont as Dallas was under a heavy ice storm and asked if we could get another room and this time it even had a more spectacular view!! We recommended the hotel to another couple we had met during the casting and they ended up staying there too. The weather was terrible, it was a Sunday evening but the staff showed us a good time. Michael (?) grabbed the hotel vehicle (nice Escolade) and drove us over to the Mission district for a lovely dinner at a tiny tucked away Mexican restaurant. Vera Cruz has only 6 tables and it feels as if you are inside a tiny, beautiful jewel box. The food was good and the hotel hospitality was awesome. We plan to make this our place to stay on business or pleasure trips to Dallas!

The rooms are very unique. The lounge and bar was awesome. The staff, during my stay, were great. However, I did experience some severe problems w/ the valet. I have a german car. On my key ring, I have a fob w/ attached key that has been deactivated as I thought I had lost it. I found it recently, and I had planned to take the car in to get the key reprogrammed the very next working day. I totally forgot to tell the valet guy about which key he should use to start it. Well, he used the wrong key. Instead of calling me when the car would start and then turn itself off (they screen said \"Immobilization Activated), the valet guy continued to try to start my car w/ the incorrect key. I had my car towed to the dealership to deactivate the immobilization feature. PROBLEM: Because the valet guy tried to start it sooooooooo many times (30+ times), $1,000 in damage was caused. While I do not hold them 100% responsible for the damages (I should have had the foresight to instruct them on which key to use). Anyway... they are refusing to accept responsibility. All I asked is that they accepted 50% of the cost of the valet guys error. He should have called me immediately when there was a problem. I loved the hotel, but I am a bit put off in regard to how they are handling this issue. I had planned to make this hotel my new \"spot\".

The rooms are simple and modern. They have flat screen tvs which are small but much better than the average hotel. The deluxe bungalow had a city view. Get a room with a city view. It's definitely worth the extra money. BarBelmont is cozy and has a great relaxed atmosphere. Many locals from Oak Cliff patronize this place and I can see why. Drinks are a little about average price, $11 for bourbon and $11 for a martini but the atmosphere is worth paying for. The pool is really cool. It was a little too cool to swim but was a great place to hang out. This is a great little boutique hotel. Please consider this place. It's close to downtown and to some really good restaurants. Be sure to rent a car because you will need to drive to sites around the city. Definitely a great place to celebrate an anniversary! It's not a 5 star hotel like the W or The Mansion but very relaxed and a great place. I can go on.

Just be aware it is in a very isolated area, there is nothing in the area as far as restaurants or food, shopping, or anything at all to do - you need a car. The hotel does serve food from 5pm but any other time you'll have to drive somewhere.
