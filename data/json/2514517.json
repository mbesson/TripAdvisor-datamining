A good 15mins walk from Victoria Station. It's actually closer to Pimlico Station. Only several Tube stations away from the attractions. The hotel itself is actually very close to several excellent restaurants - walk up Denbigh St --> Wilton Rd and you'll see several good (but pricey) restaurants. Staff: Professional but they dont really put on friendly faces :S They did, however, offered to store our luggages when we checkout. Room: Clean but very, very, very small! I've never stayed in other London hotels before but the room here is TINY. We dont even have space to lay and open our luggages properly. The toilet is also tiny but clean. Breakfast: Several complaints here. 1. Breakfast time is very limited - 7.30am - 9am only. Therefore the breakfast room is packed and guests rush to finish their breakfast. You always have to queue to get food. 2. The tables are small! 3. The website says \"full English open buffet breakfast\" but in fact the variety is quite limited. Cant really remember now but they serve beacon, eggs, baked beans, mushrooms, toasts, and cereal only. Plus coffee/tea. Guests queue and the staff behind the counter frantically serve you. It would be better if they have other options like yoghurt/fruits etc. Staffs in the breakfast room are friendly and curteous but everyone seems to be extremely busy and rushed. Maybe if they extend the breakfast time people can be more relaxed and actually enjoy their breakfast! Checkout time is also earlier than expected @ 10.30am. Conclusion: London hotels are extremely expensive and this hotel is one of the (only slightly) cheaper ones, provided you book well in advance. However I still dont think it's value for money given the small room and limited breakfast. I've stayed in Bristol for half the price with a much larger room and a much better breakfast. I dont think this hotel is worthy of the AA 4* rating. It is, however, a 'budget hotel' as stated on the website. So you should book this hotel with that mindset.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice Little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "thesarge24", "ReviewID": "UR126612896", "Content": "A very nice little hotel close to all of the tourist attractions - Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster Cathedral.

Overall, I did not get the feeling that guests are at the top of the hotel's list of priorities. It is universal at check-in that hotels take a credit card imprint for incidental charges but at the Sidney they ask for a \u00a325 deposit, thus implying that the guest is preparing to do a runner, and if you ask them to use your credit card, the amount is tied up for 7 days. A strange practice. And although there is a reasonably good buffet at breakfast, there is someone serving it and I did not appreciate the dirty look when I asked for a second rasher of bacon: is it rationed? I wasn't having egg, beans or mushrooms and really didn't think 2 pieces of bacon and a sausage was an excessive amount of food. On the plus side, there were lots of people serving and clearing tables, so service was quick, but a smile never goes amiss and I'm sure a bit more effort to sit groups of 4 or 6 together would be appreciated rather than just telling people they had to sit at whatever table happened to be available first.

However, in my opinion, it should not be classed as 4* guest accommodation; if AA standards are adhered to I would suggest it warrants 3* - at best. Our room was room 307 (and I note with my keen eye for detail that another review was written about this room in Feb 2010 \u2013 I wish I had read that before I booked!) which is at the front of the hotel on the 2nd floor.

Do not be fooled by the photos on the internet; it\u2019s amazing what a wide-angled lens can do! With it being such a hot evening and the room being so small, we had the window open, which was far better alternative than switching on the enormous fan provided; I was worried it would \u2018rattle\u2019 off the wall let alone wake everyone else in the vicinity. It was incredibly noisy throughout the whole night outside and in, as you have to endure the constant banging of doors and sounds of other guests talking and moving around either side and above you and consequently sleeping was nigh on impossible. The en-suite was tiny but adequate, with the toilet being a little too close to the bed for my liking, even if there was a frosted glass door there. I had to sit sideways on the toilet to prevent my knees from touching to door. This room would not be acceptable for a stay of more than one night and would definitely not suit a \u2018larger\u2019 couple. The breakfast was only just satisfactory, with cereal, toast and a cooked breakfast, which was strictly rationed, but the watered down orange juice was just awful. We decided to just have the cereal but what we saw other guests eating (easy to do as the tables were so close together), looked fairly average \u2013 with lots of beans! We had chosen to get up early, a decision we were pleased about when we left and saw the very long queue of guests winding up the stairs, waiting for their breakfast.

A \"double\" room was just under \u00a3100. The hotel is reasonably easy to get to from Victoria station, around a 10 minute walk. It is a converted townhouse similar to all of the other hotels in Belgrave Road. At check-in we were asked for a hard copy of the \"travel agent voucher\", even though check-in had our names on their system. This is so annoying and unnecessary, in the modern age of smart-phones, etc why should we have to print off hotel confirmations, hardly very environmentally friendly. We were given room 307, and told where the lift was. Naturally we assumed room 307 would be on the third floor but confusingly it is on the second floor, as we found once we got to the third floor. There is only a single lift, it is very small (a common theme in this hotel) and you end up waiting a long time for the lift at busy times. We were astonished at how tiny the room was. I have stayed in Easyhotels a few times, the room we were given was on a par with the size that Easyhotel has to offer (at half the price of the Sidney Hotel). There was an entrance way from the door to the bed that could only accommodate one person at a time, and then a bed, with a small open fronted cupboard (there would not be room to have doors on the cupboard). To get to the far side of the bed, you have to almost walk sideways between the bed and the wall. If you had any significant amount of luggage, there is absolutely no-where to store it. The bed itself barely accommodated my partner and I, and was not especially comfortable. In keeping with the apparent \"theme\" of the hotel, the bathroom was also very tiny, featuring toilet, small basin, and a shower cubicle. Towels were not stored in the bathroom but in the cupboard in the main room itself. To the credit of the hotel, the rooms are very clean, and do seem to have been recently re-modeled;the decoration and fittings are tasteful and appear to be high-quality and there are flat-screen TVs. A complimentary english breakfast was supplied, this was acceptable, no better and no worse. For some reason the hotel had employed a photographer to erect a camera and large tripod in the middle of the breakfast room, this rather got in the way walking to or from our table, and explanation of why he was photographing us eating our breakfast was offered. We were really disappointed in our stay. The rooms are just unacceptably tiny for a supposed four-star hotel, and there is no mention on websites such as Expedia that this will be the case. I would only ever stay in a hotel such as this if it was for single night \"crash\" where I checked in late and left early the next morning, there is no enjoyment to be had spending any time in the room.

It seems to be getting some bad reviews on Trip Advisor lately although I can't understand why. Perhaps it depends on what you expect. Positives: Location - outside the centre but for public transport you can't get better - a reasonable walk from Victoria Coach/Train/Tube stations although far enough for those lacking mobility to catch a bus. The bus stop is outside the front door of the hotel and the #24 route is 24hours a day (max 15 minute intervals, 7-8 during the day). This route takes you via Westminster/Parliament Square into Trafalgar Sq, Leicester Sq, or Tottenham Court Road within 15 minutes. We used it every day and it was ideal, especially if mobility is a problem for the tube. Cleanliness - spotless hotel in both public spaces and rooms. Service - all English speaking staff (true, not first language for those serving breakfast or cleaning although no problems at all communicating) who were only to happy to help. We were allowed to check in two hours early. Value for money - excellent value. For the budget, this was an excellent hotel Beds - modestly sized but a good night's sleep. Very comfortable. Of course, a glass of wine aids sleep as well so don't necessarily take my word for it here! Negatives: Size of rooms - yes, they are small even by London standards. However, when I visit London I sleep in the room and not much else. The size was perfectly adequate for our needs although I appreciate that some would find it a touch cramped. I felt they were designed cleverly to deal with the lack of space but would not be ideal for those who spend a lot of time in their rooms. Lift - it's typically small and broke down once during our trip (seems to happen in all London hotels as a matter of course) TV - located fine if you like watching TV in bed, but the shape of our room meant it was the only place you could see it from. We always turned it off and it was always back on again the next time we entered the room. To me, the TV was irrelevant to my stay but mentioned here for others. Neutral information: Breakfast - it's true you will not find a continental breakfast here. A typical English breakfast served in a refectory style by pleasant ladies behind a counter. Not fantastic but perfectly acceptable to me for a budget hotel. There are also cereals. Tea and coffee are served very regularly at your table and the service is warm and friendly. The breakfast room, in the basement is clean and relaxed. Noise - it's hard for any hotel to affect outside noise levels. Considering Belgrave Road is very much 24-hour we found it a very peaceful hotel. The only disturbance we did have was some young Spanish gentleman who had decided to have a football match at 3am in the street one night. Not the hotel's fault and these things happened. Fortunately, they don't let us Brits carry shotguns or I may have caused a diplomatic incident! I understand that not everyone will be satisfied by this hotel. I would class this as an excellent budget hotel, and the trick is in what to expect. The key is the word budget. Value for money, cleanliness, friendliness and location were all excellent. However, if you don't like a very ordinary breakfast or small rooms or are expecting top-end facilities, maybe this isn't the right place for you.

Our room was looking a bit shabby, or maybe it was just the impression created by the bathroom. We didn't encounter any staff who spoke English as a first language. And the lady who checked us in had such a strong accent I couldn't understand a word she said. I was glad that they gave me a card with breakfast times on it, or I would have had no idea.

You get a choice of two or three cereals, plus a hot buffet - scrambed eggs, inedible fried eggs, cheap sausages, bacon (which was cold even though I got the first rasher off a new batch), baked beans and mushrooms. Toast was pre-cooked and cold by the time I got it. I had breakfast one day and then chose to eat out every other morning.

A sign at reception listed a price of 139 GBP (approx 210 Euro) for a double per night, booking over one of the popular internet sites gave us a price of just 129 Euro per night including breakfast - which we considered a bargain. I\u00b4m rating this hotel \"neutral/average\", so that it\u00b4s comparabel to other hotels we\u00b4ve stayed in all over the world - for London this hotel was certainly better than what i had expected given the price we payed. Location: Belgrave Road, located between Victoria Station and the river, is a beautiful street in Westminster with surprisingly little traffic and lots and lots of hotels, all situated in buildings of the same style - some looking a bit run down, others looking very professional or even new. We had no issues at all with noise, and walking back to hotel after midnight felt safe. There\u00b4s a few little restaurants, cafes and pubs in the immediate vicinity, plus a dry cleaner which might come in handy. Distances: to Underground: 5 Minutes walk to Pimlico (Victoria Line), 10 Minutes to Victoria Station Bus 24 stops right in front of the hotel, and brings you to Victoria Station, Westminster Abbey, Parliament House, Whitehall, Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square and on to British Museum and Camden Markets. on Foot: 10min: Tate Britain, 20min: Westminster Abbey, 20min: Buckingham Palace, 30min: London Eye Hotel: Nicely coloured lobby with a small bar featuring a few tables and a TV. More Staff available than we\u00b4d had expected, and everyone was very friendly and helpful. Checking in, Checking out, getting our bags in and out of the luggage room all went extremely quickly. The Breakfast Room is downstairs and has limited capacity, opens at 7:30 (a bit late, we thought) and closes at 9 (a bit early, really) - so if you\u00b4re not there before 8 you\u00b4ll most certainly have to queue on the staircase and wait for a table to become available. They serve a \u201cfull english breakfast\u201d, with bacon (good), sausage (well,...), scrambled or sunny-side-up eggs, mushrooms, beans, toast, the usual jellies and cereals. sadly: no fruits. A waitress brings coffee or tea to the table and that worked fine. All in all - not much to chose from, but the quality is ok. During breakfast we could see that the hotel is used both by tourists and by business people and workers - which we quite liked. Room: We had asked for a quiet, renovated room and received one downstairs - nevertheless it featured two fullsized windows where we could see a few patches of garden, a wall and a little bit of sky above. So, although rather dark, we liked the room - it was indeed renovated (according to staff, today \u201cmost\u201d or \u201ctwo thirds\u201d of the rooms are renovated), fresh colours, clean walls, everything clean, new furniture, Hairdryer, TV and Web-Access if you needed it. The room was small, but compared with what we\u00b4ve seen in London over the years it was bigger than many others. Heating worked flawlessly, don\u00b4t know about air condition (there\u00b4s a fan at the ceiling, so maybe...). The bathroom was very small, but with a decent shower. There were a few little holes behind the the toilet and under the shower which didn\u00b4t look nice and should be mended, but all in all the bathroom was ok. In our room we had no noise at all from traffic, but the walls seem to be not too thick, so we could here running around in the rooms above - but as these rooms are all fairly small, running usually stops very quickly ;-). The bed seems to be fairly new, we slept very well, had enough and clean sheets, and woke in the morning without any backpain - what more can you expect?

We were given two double rooms, which was great, but the rooms were still small and both quite dark, with views of the back of the hotel - one room on the ground floor and the other on the third! My room had nowhere to hang clothes - just some drawers! My tea and coffee tray had fallen off the wall and was waiting for me on my bed! The single room I was offered as an alternative was better furnished, but smaller. so I declined the offer, opting for my double bed and modern bathroom over the single bed and wardrobe option! Our bathrooms were nice - one recently renovated and very modern - but one was small and the other tiny. The large flat screen TVs were a definite plus, but the choice of the advertised satellite channels was very disappoining - just ITV2 and a couple of news channels. Would have had more choice with Freeview! Rooms could be brightened up by a lighter choice of wall paint, rather than dull green. Breakfast was included in the price and was very satisfactory, served in a very pleasant breakfast room. All was quiet on my third room floor, but there was quite a lot of noise from the corridor outside the ground floor room. The location of bus stops directly outside the hotel and just around the corner was a godsend for my tired feet and the ten minute walk to Victoria Coach Station was most convenient. Plenty of shops within walking distance, where you could stock up on snacks, drinks etc. or find a place to eat out. The surrounding area was pleasant and felt safe to walk around in. All in all, very fair value for money, when you consider the central London location.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridgeshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "scotsmummy", "ReviewID": "UR8261190", "Content": "I took my teenage daughter for a saturday night's stay, having been to a matinee theatre performance.

I had read all the reviews posted here but decided to make up my own mind... Most of the comments are correct. The breakfast room is way to small for the amount of guests staying at the hotel. There is little room to queue for the breakfast without upsetting those sat nearby tring to eat and both mornings we had to wait in a small corridor for a table to become free! The food was okay but 3 cereals, 2 juices and cooked breakfast was all that was on offer. Our room was recently decorated and I beleive these rooms are all on the lower ground floor if you want one. Our bathroom was ok in our room apart from the shower! The shower head did not fit the wall attachment so you had to stand with it in your hand, not very convenient! Our room was 606 and was on the main steet infront of a bus stop and under the reception. It was noisy because of both of those aspects. Had 3 nights bad sleep making me a grumpy girl! Staff are all foreign nationals so customer service not upto UK standard but it is London afterall I'm 6 months pregnant and not once was offered a seat on the tubes/buses during a 4 day stay..... Great location is the best thing about this one really! Well moan over, you'll have to make your own decision.

The bedrooms looked newly refurbished and modern. The bar looked good along with the general reception area of the hotel. When we returned later to the hotel later that day and where allocated our room what a shock we were in for. The room was anything but four star - walls had mould on them, carpets stained, furniture wore and chipped and the beds lumpy however the biggest shock was the bathroom. You could not swing a cat in it. I think it may have been converted from a built-in wardrobe. It was so small I actually could not get dried in it and I could barely sit down on the toilet. It was worse than a caravan. The ceiling fan in the room sounded like a helicopter taking off. The bar in the hotel was so quiet you could hear a pin drop and I had to pleasantly remind the bar maid that it was happy hour. Despite all this there was a LCD TV in the room which was nice and the breakfast the next day was tasty. Overall I would not advise staying in this hotel. Pay a little extra somewhere else.
