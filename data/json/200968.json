{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very standard business hotel I stay at the Mercure around 20 nights per year for meetings at my office right down the street. It is a very standard business hotel with very few frills. Rates vary tremendously through the year. It is a bit off the beaten track if you want to walk around Frankfurt. 30 minutes walk will get you to the main train station and another 10-15 to the river.The hotel restaurant is surprisingly nice and the breakfast buffet is excellent. If you are a morning eater, book your room to include breakfast. Guest rooms opening to the side street in the main building can be a bit noisy because of the hotel bar. Service is usually pretty good, but checkout can take some time due to the crowds every morning. The front desk folks are always very pleasant and helpful.It is an easy ride to the airport (taxi around 25 Euro) and their are typically taxis in front of the hotel.People looking for a bit more ambience can try the new Radisson. On off season weeks it will be priced around the same and will have much better amenities (pool, gym), albeit not in-room.", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR755106649", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "trinzeon"}, {"Content": "Regular business hotel       Mercure - the tray that was never removed", "Date": "Jun 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR890880203", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Gernereiserin"}, {"Content": "Ok hotel but felt ripped off This hotel is located just by the West Bahnhof so an easy journey on the S bahn to the City.Hotel itself is like most other Mercures in Europe.70's/80's building but refurbished public areas.I booked a superior room on Expedia. The choices were standard/deluxe and superior.However once at the hotel, the room did not seem to be superior.I complained to reception and they said the room was indeed superior. This was not so. The rate board showed two types of room. standard and their new refurbised rooms. See Mercure website for photos. They were not interested in the fact that I had paid more for my room and did nothing.Other incident involved checkout. They did not produce an itemised bill for me to check. They read out items to me. I paid and they printed the bill and folded it in half. I walked down the street and on checking the bill found they had charged 100 Euros for an ironing board. No mention was made of this when they read out the charges.I returned and obtained the refund. but it struck me that lots of people would have left without knowing. It's the sign of a con.So on this strength, I would not stay here again.", "Date": "Mar 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR654007106", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Slackbladder"}, {"Content": "Nice Suprise Stayed here for two nights and was pleasantly suprised with the hotel. The breakfast had a reasonable selection and the service in the bar was excellent. The room was furnished in a contemporary style with good facilities - mini bar, flat screen tv, balcony, etc Only downside was the pillows are pretty uncomfortable but hey what do you want for 60 euro's a night? I had a great time here.", "Date": "Apr 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR464974065", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Rudders71"}, {"Content": "Pretty disappointing I stayed at the Mercure for a night and was not too happy with the hotel. The room was pretty well sized, but poorly equipped. The meeting room we got was in the basement, the a/c was buzzing all the time, it was dark and not too nice for a 4hrs conference.The dinner we had that night at the restaurant was average, drinks afterwards? No way. The bar area was crowded, not too nice, selection drinks rather poor.Breakfast was rather weak, too. The bread was old and the selection of food was limited. Overall, I would not recommend it to people who plan a business meeting there.", "Date": "Dec 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR235100889", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "mariusbaa"}, {"Content": "Not that bad Stayed here in June. I usually wish not to stay at this chain, but as could not find other accomodation, ended up here. I have to say this was likely best Mercure I ever have stayed in!Pros: rooms are ok (not worn out), size is not large. Suitable for short stay. Reception was ok. Service at their simple restaurant was fine until small hours. Ok, got bit crowded later on, assume this due to the fact that there are no much other activities in this area, in which hotel is located. Taxi cost bit higher when commuting to downtown.Cons: I would pick breakfast. Ok, but let's face it, this is officially 2 star facility, so guess should not be asking too much? Problems with email access at room. Just could not make it work (1st time in Frankfurt hotel ever).Would I go again? No. To whom I would recommend this hotel? Nobody assuming you wanna spend here more time. But for 1 night stay its fine, if you get lowish rate.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR472360780", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Abramis"}, {"Content": "Allright, but looks a bit cheap The staff was friendly, the refurbished rooms are quite nice, but the older ones look cheap and out of date, as does the reception desk.The buffet in the restaurant is ok and it is nice that you can sit outside in the yard when the weather is nice. The hotel is quite good for a 3 star hotel, but it really has 5...
