I and several work colleagues stayed here for 2 nights. Let me start with the positives. The staff were helpful but there was some confusion about bookings when we checked in. It was eventually sorted out and not a problem. Our rooms were very small for 2 people, but one of my Turkish speaking colleagues got upgraded to a suit when he complained. He was very fortunate. A very good breakfast is served upstairs in their dining room. The Hotel enjoys a fantastic view from the rooftop restaurant. Now for my complaint. The first night our room temperature was 28 C. Unbelievably hot!. The air-conditioning made no difference. Open your window I hear you say. Well unfortunately the window opened to a small internal space between the walls, and that was covered with a clear roof. It was the same temperature. The corridor was cooler and we left our room door open until we went to bed in an attempt to cool the room. That worked for a bit, but when we closed the door to sleep, the temperature crept back to 28. Next morning we saw reception to try and improve our second night's stay. We were told to pack our bags and leave them in the room, and we would be relocated to an outside facing room whilst we explored Istanbul. Not surprisingly I bumped into another colleague who had also just successfully arranged a room swap. (But they later wanted to charge him extra) The staff explanation for the high temperature was that their heating system was still on, and they had not changed over to their cooling system yet. We returned late in the day to be surprised by the news that we were still in the same room. They did not have any alternate rooms available. \"But you have fun now\" the reception person told me. I was confused for a second. We did not have fun last night. Ahhhh, we have a 'fan' now, hopefully we can get a better night's sleep. Unfortunately it was noisy and we could not sleep any better with it on. Another hot restless night ensued. Again 28 degrees, which was measured from my accurate travel alarm.

Was forced to stay here during a business trip when all the other hotels in the area got booked out. Happy to find that it is a lovely hotel and the view from the roof restaurant is the best in Istanbul by far. The quality of the restaurant food is superb. Best I've had in the city, and the prices are reasonable. Only issue is that there are not nearly enough waiting staff and I often had to go over to the kitchen during my visits to the restaurant to make my needs known. Hotels rooms are not big, but big enough to suffice. Bathrooms are a little too small to be comfortable, which is the only down-side to this hotel. Housekeeping staff are efficient and reliable. Although they only ever let you have one roll of toilet paper for some reason - unlike every other hotel here i experienced which leaves you several. No in-room kettle or tea/coffee making facilities whatsoever. A real shame and surprising considering all the other hotels here seem to offer this simple pleasure in the rooms. Also, they do not have irons and ironing boards - you have to use their professional laundry service instead. It's not expensive but kind of annoying that you can't just quickly iron a shirt when you have to rush off to a business meeting. Aircon seems a but temperamental and some days it worked fine, others it would remain off regardless of how much you tried to get it going. Minibar prices are not too bad. Location is great. Very close to Blue Mosque and i do mean VERY close. Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace are close by too. And it is practically next door to the Islamic Art Museum (aka Ibrahim Pasha Building). For those who have limited mobility though this place is definitely NOT for you. The lifts are small and cramped and they do not go to the top floor - you have to walk up a flight of stairs to the roof, which is a problem if you are disabled. The stairs also seem to be a little narrow. And worst of all you have to climb up and down a steep hill to get between the hotel and the nearby attractions. There is a spa, sauna, gym and Hammam in the basement.

From the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooftop terrace is a perfect panorama over the incredible rooftops and minarets of the old city, reaching the shore of the sea of Maramara, which winds its way eventually to the Mediterranean. I can see the skyscrapers of modern Istanbul over on the other side of the Bosphorus River where cruise ships, ferries and cargo ships ply the waters from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. My hotel (Lady Diana Hotel, Binbirdek, Sultanahmet) is a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of the myriad streets (not to mention the hoardes of tourists). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet here, and while not a four or five star hotel, it is exactly what I needed. Particularly the roof terrace, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my sanctuary above the city where each time I return I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gathered my thoughts and plans for the next outing. That pretty much sums it up. This is the cheapest hotel I stayed on a 9 country round the world trip, and it by far left the best memories because of its priceless rooftop deck. It is cheap, a great value, the restaurant is lack lustre, the hotel rooms are sparse, but it is good enough from which to enjoy the best of the sultanahmet quarter. try to get a room on the front side of the hotel, no real views except from the roof, but that's accessible 24/7 so you don't have to worry about it. The previous review warned about smells, but the whole area smells a bit, face it, the plumbing is hundreds of years old!!

My parents had booked to stay in an 'suite' with my sister -as at the time of booking - the hotel had said they were unable to provide my sister and i with a room, and my parents with another. On arrival, this suite was actually just a 'normal' room, with three incredibly low, small, camp beds lined up. It was impossible to move. The bathroom was also no larger than a toilet on a plane, and it was so small that you were unable to sit on the loo, unless you sat to the side. My room was no better, what was a small double room, had merely had a bed removed and had no external windows. It was dark, with no ventilation and the air con (one of the named 'perks' of the hotel) was broken. Most importanly however, was the hideous stench of raw sewage. It was so pungent i actually couldnt stand in the room while they moved my luggage in. The hotel's response was first to shrug, and then only when my father (they seemed to only listen to men, not 'ladies' as they called us) went down, did the send someone up with an airfresher. We were told i could only move rooms the next day, and the manner in which they treated my complaint was appalling. I cannot express how unhygienic and unpleasant the smell was. The following day i was moved to another room, which still smelt the same. This time, the room had an external window, so the response again was to liberally spray the airfreshener (an intensely chemical smell) and leave the windows open (without any thought of the security threat this posed). i should also mention that none of the safety desposit boxes worked. The breakfasts were very, very disappoitning. Served in an incredbly bright terrace - the 'cooked' options of eggs and sausages were unrecognisable and the 'pastries' were stale and doughy. Not a 4 star breakfast in anyway. We booked the hotel based on reviews - but i would urge anyone booking to look elsewhere. this is not anywhere near a 4* hotel - and the talks of 'views of the blue mosque' is incredibly far fetched..unless you can se through buildings.

It is located in the heart of the Old City and close to all major historical sites. The breakfast was an absolute treat and overlooked The Blue Mosque and the Aya Sofya. I noticed that other reviewers complained about the room size. I am not sure what else one would expect in Europe. We loved our room and bathroom. We didn't have a great view but that wasn't important to us. The AC worked really well. The beds were comfortable and the shower was the largest that we had seen on our 2 week trip.

You spend little time in your room as there is so much to see in the area. Rooms are smallish but not to bad, Ask for a quite room, we got a corner room and got no noise, Aircon was ok, not to noisey. You have to keep windows closed at night as the mosques make quite a lot of noise every 4 hours or so. Take ear plugs, really helps. Don't rely on the reasturant, meals as they are pretty basic and after one main it's time to look elsewhere. I dont think the chef has a clue quite frankly. All the staff stand around gauking at you while eatiing, quite off putting. Use the resturant and outside decks for your coffees, nice setting and views.

The views from the restaurant and patio are fantastic, the continental breakfast more than adequate. The best thing about the hotel was the location. You can walk to everything from here, and we did: Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar, and the ferry. The Blue Mosque is only a few blocks away, but heads up, walking 5-10 miles per day is my norm so not everyone will think a walk to the ferry as close. The turkish bath is a must do.

One drawback: The hotel charges for airport transfers are steep. Unless you stay several nights, you will pay 25 Euros each way. It's worth it on the inbound trip if it's your first time in Istanbul. Unless you have a really early departing flight, it's much cheaper to make an arrangement with a local taxi driver.

First night we were upgraded to the so called suite room. This room has funny decor with ugly yellow canaopy and bed, dirty carpet, nude pictures, and cheap toiletries. This equivalent to a motel 6 room in USA. The ugly nude pictures will only suit a young honey moon couple. For the next four nights we were give a double room with two single beds, filthy carpet, tiny bathroom, a desk, a stool, and nothing else. On our request they put the two single beds together but it was still uncomfortable with two separate quilts and gap in the middle. The so called bath tub was so tiny that you could barely stand in it. No way you can have a bath. The wash basin was so tiny you could only put a couple of tooth brushes only. The room did not have a palce to sit. You can sit on the bed. Perhaps they encourage you to be out sighseeing all the time and come back to sleep. As a minimum, they can spend $100.00 per room to replace carpets in the tiny rooms. They can afford it with room charges more than $130.00 minimum. The hotel offers free buffet breakfast at the roof top resturant which has great view of Blue mosque, Sofia Museum and Istanbul Straits. Variety of food available. The hotel staff speaks good English and helpful. However, they try to sell you expensive tour packages which are not necessary. You can have a 6 hour cruise of Istabul straits for about $12.00. The guided tour costs about $80.00. Bottom line is the hotel is similar to all other hotels in Sultanahmet area and about same prices.
