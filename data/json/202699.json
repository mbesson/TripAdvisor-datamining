The condition of the rooms in the hotel is deplorable. There was mold in the bathroom and the bed room walls. Large chunks of paint were falling off the celling, molding was broken off the walls and left on the floor, bathroom door would not close, about 3 minutes of hot water for a shower, and I could go on and on.

If you book this hotel using Orbtiz, the Hotel may, on your arrival, move you to a different, dumpy hotel in a bad location. If I could have given zero stars to this hotel I would have. I have to say, this was one of the worst experiences I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had with a hotel. We arrived at the Ambassador Tre Rose Hotel in Venice on a Friday afternoon and were really pleased with its location and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to drop our bags in our room and get out and explore Venice. We went to check in and at first they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find our reservation. After a couple of minutes, a worker at the hotel who was behind the reception counter (working behind a curtain) came out and told us that our room had water problems and that we had to be moved to another hotel room. We said OK and he proceeded to take us out of the hotel and take us on a 10 minute walk to another hotel. We had to walk through a dark alley (it had a cement ceiling on it so no light was shining in it) that had feces in it. We then ended up taking a right out of that alley and going up another alley that was desolate and a dead end. Our hotel was on that part of the alley. The room was big, but it was a dump. Right away we objected to the room and wanted to be put in another hotel. The person from the Ambassador said we could write a letter and have our money refunded, but there was nothing he could do about the room. My new wife and I (we were on our honeymoon), discussed the issue and decided to go talk to the manager at the Ambassador. Along the way, we stopped at other hotels checking to see if they had any water problems and if they had any availability. None of the hotels said they had water problems. We went back and met with the manager and explained to him that we were not happy with the other hotel, how we paid $255 for the night to be in San Marco square and on a street with a lot of life and shops, and how we did not want to be walking through unsafe alleys that have feces in them. The manager took me outside to show me an alley behind the Ambassador (which was more like a courtyard) and explained to me that some people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel safe in that alley. The alley was well lit and he pointed out that they had three security cameras monitoring it. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure why he was showing me this, so I asked him if the alley we would have to walk to for the new hotel had security cameras in it, he said no. So instead of making me feel better, he made me feel even worse about the new hotel. We then asked him to show us the water damaged room and he refused. He said if I were injured in the damaged room he would go to jail (according to Italian law) and he was not about to go to jail. He did show us an economy room and even that was much nicer than the hotel we were put in. The funny thing about showing us the economy room was that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book an economy room, we booked a classic. He couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get the type of room we were in right. Since we were in a classic room and not the economy room that had water damage, why were we bumped? After seeing another post on this site saying they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get their room because of plumbing problems it is pretty clear that they just overbooked the hotel and that is why we were bumped. The more we talked to him about the situation, the less helpful he became. Instead of coming up with other options for us, he just kept sighting Italian law stating that he was only legally obligated to put us in another 3 star hotel. At one point he told us we could sleep in the lobby if the other hotel was not going to be good enough for us. That was pretty insulting. He continued the insults by constantly looking at me and indicating to me to control my wife. My wife was never out of control or angry, she was just trying to make her point be heard and he kept cutting her off by saying the same things over and over. Amongst the insults, he managed to tip his cap about customers that use Orbtiz to book rooms in his hotel. He informed us that since we only booked the room for one night and that we booked through Orbitz at a cheaper rate, we were bumped to another hotel. Other guests had paid more for their rooms so it seems that you are taking your chances if you book this hotel through Orbitz. After about a half an hour of this, he finally told us we could have a refund if we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy with the new room. We would just have to write a letter to Orbitz. If we did that, he would grant us a refund. When we got home and contacted Orbitz he declined the refund sighting Italian law saying all he needed to do was put us in another 3 star hotel. We knew this manager was sketchy, but we took it on faith that he would live up to what he said. Sadly he really showed us the type of business that he runs and the type of person that he is.

Continental brekfast was decent. The worst thing was the lack of hot water. In five days we managed two hot showers between the two of us. Complaints met with indifference and no offer of a solution. We thought to ask for this to be reflected in the tariff, but after listening for 20mins to some other guests wanting that too, but giving up due to the total immovability of the staff, we decided to pay in total and enjoy the rest of our last day.

I was really worried because there was no getting out of the deal. Once I got there I was relieved because it is really not as bad as it has been rated. It's not the greatest either but it is ok... I saw worse in Venice. Let me tell you that the location could not be any better. It is VERY close to San Macos Square which is great. The decoration is ok and the only thing that bothered me was the carpet because it had some spots were it is completely worn out. Our bathroom was remodeled and looked great but I did see that in some other rooms it had black (or really dark) tile.. If you get to go to this hotel ask for a room that has been remodelled. We were lucky because we just got it without asking. The hotel was clean and confortable. It is rated as a 4star -- I would rate it as a 3 or 2.5 star level. We paid us$150 which for venice is not bad. Although I was in better bed and breakfasts thru Italy for much lower price. Breakfast was really good, all kinds of stuff Loved this part!

The staff were friendly and helpful but possibly that is because I treated them with respect (it always works wonders, I find!).
