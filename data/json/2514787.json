Quiet street in the best of locations. ALL the staff we met were superb, very polite and could not have been more helpful. Free internet 24 hrs a day, complimentary coffee and tea in the lounge area, free use of the gym and great complimentary hot breakfast, lots of seating outside on the patio area. We stayed here for 4 nights and could not have been more happy with our choice of hotel. Within walking distance of all the major attractions close to Macy's, Madisson Square Garden, Empire State building, (view from our bedroom window), Chrysler Building. Grand Central station, Times Square, and both the underground and Penn Station. Loads of places to eat nearby. We walked from the hotel to Central Park and to the other end of the island to the 9/11 memorial and Staten Island Ferry. Twin and double rooms avaialble all with en suites which have baths and showers and complimentary toiletries available should you forget something, wi-fi in all rooms good quality beds and tv's. We caught the airtrain from JFK airport to Jamaica, last stop on the airtrain at the airport and then the Long Island Rail Road train from Jamaica Hub to Penn Station about a 1/2 hr ride. Penn station is located 2 blocks from the hotel on 31st . So easy to access and very easy ride directly from the airport to the centre of the city. Cost $5 for the airtrain ticket, payable as you enter or exit the airtrain at Jamaica, and $6 for the LIRR train ride. We caught the underground from Penn Station on the E line back to Jamaica - Sutphin Boulevard $2.25 then airtrain $5 back to the airport, would recommend the LIRR train which was much quicker due to the stops on the subway, felt safe but was crowed on the underground.

My room, however, was so small that it did not even have a closet. The television, apparently, had been pulled from the wall, so there were holes in the wall. I reserved a double room, but when I got there, none were available so they brought up a cot for me to sleep on. This would have been ok but the cot was very rough and I am still feeling the springs in my back. On the other hand, unlike several reviewers, I found the staff to be very nice and helpful. Also, the location is great. It is two blocks from Madison Square Garden so, if you are going to a Rangers or Knicks game, there is no better place to stay. It is also fairly short walk to shopping and a little longer walk to the theatre district and Times Square.

People having breakfast are usually tourists which don't care about time. I have stayed in two different rooms at this hotel, both had stains on the carpet. The wi-fi is horrible and don't expect it to work with Android devices. You call the unhelp desk and they don't help you at all. I am an IT professional and they claim I don't know how to configure my device (yeah right). The location is great, 5 minutes to Penn Station and accessible to a few subway stations. Do not, again, do not use their car service company. It is a total rip off and they charge you hidden fees that are only disclosed when you arrive at the destination and have no way to back out of the service. The TV is LCD but no HD service, I don't understand why hotels do that. In a nutshell.... if you are looking for cheap lodging in NYC which is close to everything and free breakfast, go for it.

Overall the hotel had a great location, just 2 blocks from Madison Square Garden and 1 block from the nearest subway station. Additionally, the included breakfast saved our group a lot of time in the morning. They had various food options and they swapped them around everyday. Lastly, we were able to check in early (almost 4 hours!) on the first day which again saved us a lot of time of waiting. The hotel also lets you store your bags in their lobby after you check out and before you head over to the airport with absolutely no cost! This is much different from other NYC hotels I have stayed at in the past.

I gave it 3 stars mostly for the impressive cleanliness of the room (carpet excepted). Other than he usual ground in dirt and stains in the carpet, the room, bed, and fixtures were immaculate. Bathroom clean and no mold, no peeling paint nor wallpaper, heat and AC worked well. We booked a nonsmoking room, but the minute we walked in the bathroom was full of fresh cigarette smoke as if someone just had one in there. Running the fan dissipated it. Then after a day out, we returned to find the room cleaned and the AC turned on at 60 degrees! It was November at the time, and the room was an icebox. Also, for some bizarre reason, the housekeeper took our hotel provided shampoo away. We had conditioner, soap, lotion, no shampoo, even the tube we had already opened was gone. Weird. Front desk cheerfully gave us more. The odd parts: the curtains don't close. Really. There are very thin see thru sheers, but the heavy curtains are attached to a rod the is fixed in place in the casement. The hooks go in little holes in a plastic strip which is screwed into place on either side of the window, there's not even a short rod to slide them on. They are there to look pretty while the streetlights stream into your window and the people across the street peep at you! We used some binder clips to hold them sort of closed every night. The noise in the hall every night was unbelievable. The door was loosely fit in its frame and both light & noise came thru like the door was paper. The guests had a habit of having private conversations all night in the hallway, and houskeeping felt the need to collect trash bags from a closet every night between midnight & 1am. There's a free hot breakfast in the morning: biscuits, cereal, eggs, sausage, coffee, etc. However a couple hours later both my husband and I had severe indigestion. We've travelled the world and eaten some really strange things (see our Japan reviews), but this \"normal\" food did us in! You get what you pay for. This is NY, go anywhere else for breakfast!

If you are planning your visit with family or a group of people, given the circumstance, you may want to consider something a little bigger. The rooms are very close to each other, and the walls are not the best for sound proofing. If you are a light sleeper, consider that. The hotel is very large, but the breakfast area is just an extension of the lobby, therefore you may end up eating in your room, given the lack of seating area. The quality of the breakfast is no frills. A lot of questions were asked in regard to what certain things are?? But having breakfast is better than not, so that's a plus. On the first night, we had to be moved to a different hotel because everything was booked sold out. The second night we had to wait quite a while for the room to be ready.

The next day after having breakfast we wanted to go back into the room to get ready before heading out. Without notification, the hotel had disabled our room key card. Confused, I went to the reception desk to get it reactivated only to be told that we had only booked the hotel for one evening and we had to check out by noon. After asking them to double check because we had paid to stay for 3 nights and we only stayed 1, the reception had a look and told us we only had the room change for one night, and we were told we had to pack and up and moved out of our room to a new one within ONE HOUR. We were furious; when we checked in, the girl who checked us in did not say anything about moving rooms again the next day, it was assumed if they gave us a room we would stay in it for the entire time. We ended up spending 2 hours of our time packing up and moving to another room, it was a extreme hassle and we wasted our entire morning doing something unnecessary.

The bathroom is accessible, with a walk-in shower - but nowhere to transfer to, unless you count the floor. The room is very dark with one small window at the back so we have to have all the lights on even in the morning. The good points: comfortable bed, TV that works, iron and ironing board in room, lots of plug sockets. However, for an accessible room, the light switches are too far away from the bed, and the bed is really quite high - having to transfer up to it. The housekeeping service leaves something to be desired - we got clean towels and they remade the bed. They didn't clean the coffee pot or anything else.

The hotel is literally a block and a half away from Penn station making getting around the city super easy. It is a 45 minute train ride from JFK which is not only the fastest way in to the city but the cheapest. Our room was small but perfectly suitable for our needs. The beds were compfy. Our room overlooked the street and had a window that opens, which I prefer. The bathroom was clean and extra towels were delivered upon request. The breakfast was WAY better than expected. Fully stocked with juices, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, cinnamon rolls, bagels, breakfast cereals, etc. The fact that it is included in the price is amazing. The breakfast would have easily cost $10.00-$15.00 in a restaurant. Service was pleasant and efficient. Also, double and triple checked for bed critters and found none. The hotel seemed quite on top of any problem, perceived or factual. We were two sisters traveling alone and felt absoulutely safe. We will stay here again.

Decent price of $137 plus taxes per night which is pretty good considering this place is virtually brand new. Room was very small and tight, with the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in a modern hotel, but I glady trade that off for the great location - you don't come to New York to stay in your room right? Madison Square Garden, with all its subway connections, is a couple blocks away as are many casual dining options. Arrived a few hours earlier than expected and this was before check-out time, so I was expecting to have to leave my bags at the front and come back at check-in time. However, they found a room that had been cleaned already and let me settle in right away. Service was very friendly and helpful. Had read some reviews of this hotel that there was a bedbug problem from a handful of people who had stayed there, and was a bit worried. Since Hotwire bookings are non-refundable, I never considered canceling. Instead, I made sure that I had a good look-see around the room for any signs of the critters but failed to find any. I'm sure this is a bit of an issue in many places in New York these days, so I'd be careful anywhere you stayed, just to be safe. There's an above average breakfast served in the morning, with your basic cold and dry foods, but supplemented with a couple of steam pans with hot items like eggs, bacon, and biscuits. The breakfast area is next to the lobby and looks out on to the street and there's a generous patio area as well for those who like to dine al fresco. I also used the gym which is downstairs. if you want a Coke at 2am, there are vending machines in the lower level as well.

You are a 5 minute stroll from Madison Square Garden, I minute walk to 28th/7th (123) station, 15min to Highline Park/Meat packing district or 20 minutes to Times Square by foot. Check in was smooth and the staff friendly. Our room was New York style small but that\u2019s to be expected. That said it was clean and well appointed. The lifts are very old and slow, we were there over the Christmas Holiday and the place was packed, luckily we were on a high floor as most times the lift would fill up coming down and anyone lower than 7 regularly missed out. (I recommend asking for a high floor). The gym was great and we never had to wait for a piece of equipment even though the hotel was full. It has running machines, free weights and an exercise bike. Breakfast was hard work the free breakfast consisted of cereal, yoghurt, bagels, toast, cold boiled eggs, cinnamon buns but absolutely no fruit during the stay which was disappointing. The coffee was terrible. Two out of four mornings we ate standing up as the dining room is completely inadequate for the number of guests. At least 50% would cone get their stuff and head back to their room. So if you are looking for a tranquil start to your morning you won\u2019t find it here. We had one glitch in our stay which was on the 2nd day we only received two towels, a call to house keep resulted in being told one would be sent straight up. I rang again an hour later as we were about to leave for diner (had to share after our shower) and was again told one would be sent straight up. Nothing cam and on the way out I heard a housekeeping lady say they were well short of towels as the laundry had not dropped off (this makes perfect sense as we were in the middle of a massive snow storm, if someone had of just told us this we would have been fine). Anyway we left a note and extra tip the next morning and were back to three. Check out was a breeze and the guys behind reception were extremely nice.

Pros: Location: One block from Madison Square Garden so within walking distance to Times Square and Theatre District. Sleep: Once my head hit the pillow I was out like a light; very comfortable (and important when we're spending all day out and about). Gym: Great free fitness room with weight bench, 2 treadmills and a bike. Cons: Free Breakfast and Facilities: This hotel was packed and fairly impossible to get a seat at breakfast time (the whole time, not just later in the morning). Most people filled their plates to take back to the room - quite a wait for one of the two elevators to get to you at that time of day. We had 3 people in our room and were unable to get a towel each to use on one day (may have had something to do with the snow storm?). Rang housekeeping 3 times and each request was just ignored. Noise: Walls are paper thing and you could hear all neighbours coming and going. Conversations in rooms of people near the lift could be easily heard - try to get a high floor away from lifts if possible. This'll make it easier getting down to the lobby in the morning's also.

There were no instructions in the room provided, so we just presumed that you moved the handle to the left and the shower would turn on but oh no. In the end we had to contact reception. I have to admit that I have never used such a complicated shower in my whole life. Not to mention the small bath towels we had, I think they must of been designed for people with dwafism or something. The doors felt like they were made out of cardboard, they were not soundproof at all, even if somebody was whispering about 15 feet away from your door you could hear every word. Also the air conditioning in our room was so loud. Infact it was so loud that it was enough to wake up a dead person. The hotel in general was quite noisy, especially for the first 2 nights we were there, we had these really loud spanish people in the 2 rooms opposite from our room and I think they were up all night running up and down the corridors, slamming doors and just being generally noisy. It was ridiculous the amount of noise they were making and since the doors are so thin when they were talking it actually sounded like they were in the room with us, which is kind of freaky. The dining room (if thats what you want to call it) was like a stampede. The hall was not big enough and there were not enough tables, I even saw some people eating their breakfast standing up because there were no tables. And since all of the food was free people were just taking whatever they could get their hands on wether they ate it or not. One day there were no bananas left because one person decided to take 5 of them! The dining room nearly went up in flames one day because somebody put a scone through the toaster! They had a very weird selection of foods such as beefburgers and scones. Who would eat beefburgers for breakfast?! I know I certainly wouldnt.

We also liked the location of the hotel (close to MSG, TImes Square, Penn station/subway) while being on a quiet street. Breakfast was ok...really busy but not much you can do about that. We liked the 24 hr coffee/tea and water that was offered. FYI, we took a shuttle from LaGuardia Airport for $5.00/person (company was called NYAS...look for person wear blue jackets)which dropped us off at Penn station. From there we just walked which took less than 5 min. To go back to the airport we took the same shuttle company which does a pick up at the NE corner of W34th Street and 7th Ave every 30 mins at 10 and 40 on the hour. We paid $12/person going back to LGA. Sure beats paying $40+ for a taxi! Overall we enjoyed our stay at Holiday Inn Express MSG and would recommend to anyone.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "amaybride", "ReviewID": "UR60011033", "Content": "I would absoulty recommend this hotel to anyone.

Everyone that works here that we dealt with from maintance, housekeeping, breakfast person to the front desk was awesome! I have to give extra kudos to Topacio that worked the front desk. She was so awesome. She went above & beyond her job description to make my sisters & I stay in NYC that much better. Thank you Topacio. We will stay here again on our next NYC trip. There are only 2 things that I would suggest staying away from. 1. Try and not get a room on C level. It's the lowest level of the hotel. Only floor with vending machines. Our first night there was bad because our room was on the C level next to the stairwell & all night long the stairway door was opening & slamming closed & people using the vending machine. The next day we switched rooms without any problem. 2. The hotel offers a shuttle to the airport via a 3rd party. It is not ran by the hotel. We opted to do this. It's $20 per person. The problem with this is that it picks up more people than just you from different hotel locations (we didn't know that). We were in the van for about 1 hour before actually heading to the airport because the shuttle had 4 more stops after he picked us up. So I would not recommend this shuttle.

Loud guests who engage in conversation in the hallway can also be disturbing, but this only occurred once during the night.

The hotel is clean, safe, in a good location, and the room furnishings/bedding are in good condition. Rooms are quite small, even slightly smaller than typical Manhattan rooms with just a body-wide space to walk around 3 sides of the bed. However, there are a few moderate inconveniences: First, there are only 2 elevators for a larger 15-story hotel, and there is no separate staff elevator -- so, expect long waits every time you go up and down, particularly around check-out times. It is particularly inconvenient that the elevator stops very often for hotel staff members getting on and off, including housekeepers and their carts (on multiple occasions we stopped at 4+ different floors just for hotel employees getting on/off \u2013 at times, hotel employees were in the elevator when it was full, leaving guests to wait for the next one). Secondly, we called the hotel front desk because the bathroom fan was running 24x7 and could not be turned off. We were told that most of their rooms on high floors are required to keep the fans on and nothing could be done. Even with the bathroom door closed, you could hear a constant fan humming through the door which was a little annoying ...the good thing was that on the 15th floor with every little NYC street noise \u2013 overall this will not prevent me from staying here at a good price, but it does prevent me from giving this hotel a high score. They have an \"OK\" free continental breakfast -- mostly pastries, juice, coffee, yogurt, etc. -- nothing special, except the fact it's fast and free. So, if you find a bargain rate and can live with the above inconveniences, this is a good place to stay.

Now the negatives: I would reccomend staying on a lower floor, as there are only 2 elevators for the whole hotel, and the wait could stretch to 4-5 minutes during busy times; also the breakfast area was terribly packed, making it difficult to find a seat and get food.

We were really happy with the Holiday Inn Express in Madison Square Garden. On the first night, we were placed on the first floor right next to the lifts. This was unfortunately really nosiy, especially when everyone came down to breakfast in the morning! However, after notifying the front desk of the issue, they kindly moved us to the 7th floor which was a lot better! The rooms are a great size and very clean! They provide you with ample towels and nice little creams and shampoos. The TV is HUGE and has all the major channels which is a nice break after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. The added bonus of staying in the hotel is the morning breakfast. Whilst it's no gourmet buffet, some toast and coffee really hits the spot! It also means you don't have to go wondering the city for breakfast in the morning. The location is good, but considering we spent most of our time in Time Sqaure and towards Central Park, it can be a long walk back. There isn't much around Madison Square Garden itself, with Macy's located some 3 blocks away. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel for those looking for a short break to New York.

We are early risers and there was no waiting on any of the mornings of our stay .Don't let the mention of cues by others put you off. They should have gotten up earlier!

Subway is 5 minutes away no matter which way you are heading. Empire state, Maddison Sqaure Garden, Times Square and Macy's are all just around the corner. We had a long walk downtown to Brookly Bridge. It took a while but it was nice to take a look at Chelsea and Grenwich village on the way. This hotel represents excellent value for money compared with other hotels in Manhattan. A little tip, I became a priority club member when I booked. Just for the seven nights stay I have enough points for a free nights stay somewhere already. Also, as a priority club member the hotel will deliver breakfast to your room.

Trying to remain objective and not 'rant', this is a breakdown of the highlights of my recent stay: The room was not ready when promised at 2pm (regular check-in is 3pm), and I requested an early check-in & I'm also a gold member of the hotel's frequent guest program. Upon check-in, and interatcing throughout the stay, and when checking-out, none of the staff were very pleasant. The whirlpool in the room (which I paid extra for) was not working, and took two maintenance workers about 45 minutes to noisily repair. Also, the glass partition between the bathroom and bedroom rattled loudly. There was also low water pressure in the shower, and the shower curtain was torn and mouldy. Another few problems included: the phone beside the bed was not working, and the room was missing its \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. When notified, the staff did nothing about this..... which caused the housekeeping staff to wake me up while letting herself in around 8am. Overall about the hotel though........ the location is a bit \"off the beaten path\", so I would not recommend travelling alone at night in the area. The hotel is very close to Madison Square Garden, but about a 5-10 min. ride on the subway away from the main tourist area/ Times Square. The hotel lobby and hallways seemed to be fairly clean, and well-kept (although the room needed a bit of plaster & paint repair). The exterior and entrance areas were also very presentable. One major benefit (which is available at all Holiday Inn Express locations) is the \"express start\" breakfast, which consists of unlimited hot food and drinks for no charge. Another plus is that they stored my bags at no extra cost until the room was ready. Overall, I would NOT stay here again and would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I know. However, I would highly recommend the Holiday Inn Express just uptown from this one, at Fifth Ave. and 45th.... it was far superior and very impressive.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cNice but expensive\u201d", "Author": "Vinceremo", "ReviewID": "UR14746644", "Content": "I was in NY to see Bruce Springsteen at the Madison Square Garden so for me the location couldn't be better.

In New York you don't spend very much time in your room, but it was a great bed to sleep in at least. So I'm happy with that. The breakfast (included, which is very rare in the city) was one of the better I had. Not very environment friendly with one time-use plates and glasses, but apart from that good. Different breads, cupcakes, cereals, fresh fruit and juices. The juices and coffee was available 24/7, so that was perfect when you came back after a long walk. When I was leaving for the airport I was in a great hurry. So I asked them to order a cab, which they gladly did - for an extra fee of $25! They told me taking a cab on the street would be cheaper, but I didn't have time to chase one. That was really bad for a hotel with prices rather expensive even for New York.

The doors slam and our neighbors weren't considerate. The doors were right next to each other in a small hallway so that might have increased the noise a bit.

It seemed like it was in somewhat of a bad neighborhood when we first got there, but then we realized that the only really nice areas of the city seem to be in Times Square and parts of midtown Manhattan/Central Park areas. So for the price we paid ($113/night on Hotwire.com), it was worth the stay. I never spend much time in the hotel rooms when I am on vacation anyway, so we used the room for sleeping, showering, and ate breakfast. The rooms were somewhat small-not alot of room for moving around or storing luggage. They were basically big enough for the beds, desk, and entertainment center. The breakfast was great! I was expecting a small cold toast-bowl of cereal continental breakfast, but it was far from that. Different meal everday, consisting of everything from omelettes to biscuits & gravy to pancakes. Very good. The staff were very nice, housekeeping was great, hotel was clean. Another great thing about this hotel was the location (which is usually why I pick the hotels I do). We had a view of the top of the Empire State Building from our room, which was a site to see, especially at night. It was a block from Madison Square Garden, in the center of Manhattan so about 30-60 minute walk to the tourist parts of Manhattan, but the subway was also only a block away and we used this to get pretty much anywhere we went. It only cost about $12/person for the 5 days we were there. The only thing I wished was different about this hotel was the fact that it did not have a pool, however, Holiday Inn Express does not usually have a pool, so I can't complain about this particular one. Also had complimentary newspapers, free internet, vending machines, coffee/hot chocolate/juice in the kitchen 24 hours, and within walking distance to a convenience store and some good places to eat.

What made this hotel stand out to me was the attentiveness of the staff. I travel for work regularly and it is rare to find Holiday Inn Express staff this enthusiastic to help tourists. The people offered the \"WOW\" factor here. If assistance in getting around town is important to you, then you will find this hotel worth the money! The parking garage is a few blocks away. If you have to park, drop off your bags first, it is a bit of a hike. Again, I didn't pay for the room so, I was more than pleased with the value. I think if I had paid more than $250 a night, I would have felt like I didn't get anything special.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LIVERPOOL", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value, location and service.\u201d", "Author": "waltonwarrior", "ReviewID": "UR12135811", "Content": "I don't usually write a review after a holiday but after staying here I thought I should.

We arrived at the hotel right at the check in time of 3pm and were told that no \"non - smoking\" rooms were available right away - it would be another hour until they were ready (I guess because we booked through hotwire we didn't have specific rooms reserved right away). We could however get a couple of smoking rooms on the 12th floor right away. As none of our party smoke we pondered this for a few minutes and as it was raining out and we had already been soaked we decided to take those rooms. Both rooms were spotless - there was a very very faint smell of smoke in one of the rooms but it wasn't strong enough to cause us any bother at all. The rooms were very well appointed and comfy - with two double beds in each. We also never noticed any smoke odors coming out of any of the other rooms on the 12th floor. All the staff I encountered were very friendly, always smiling and obliging. The bellboy was helpful and friendly and answered all our questions with patience. The cleaning staff were very polite and never made us feel like we were in their way. Our room was cleaned thoroughly every day and we always got fresh linens and lots of clean fluffy towels. A breakfast was included with our reservation and this was also great. Plenty of good hot and cold food was available each morning. It was busy down there every morning which shows you how good it was! It was crowded but not impossible to find somewhere to sit if you have little patience.

Being near the lifts meant the room was bit noisy and as they started breakfast early we were awoken early. So we asked to move - no problem. Next room on 9th floor was perfect - very quiet. The rooms are smallish but very adequate especially as we thought the room rate for New York was very reasonable. The inclusive breakfast was absolute bliss. The breakfast room can seem crowded but if you are patient you will get a table. Everything you could want for breakfast and more was available.Coffee is available in the lobby all the time as well.

Well, I'm not so happy. A few major problems. Front desk was friendly but very unaccommodating. Also it has a 3 star rating, but I've stayed in much nicer 2 stars downtown in NYC. The first problem is the barking dogs. This apparently is a pet hotel. Saturday night was horrible. The room next to me left their small yappy dog in the room alone all day. And the dog barked, yelped, cried and winded all day and all night until 4 in the morning when their owners returned. WHO DOES THIS TO THEIR ANIMALS? I would never leave my pets alone scared in a hotel room. I'm in town for a job interview and I got no sleep. none. No exaggeration. You hear everything through these walls and the dog sounded like it was 2 feet away from me. The hotel did nothing about it. The hotel was sold out so I could not move rooms. They sent security up who verified there was a yappy whining dog in the room. That was about it. Next the heat/air did not work. Again, I couldn't switch rooms because it was sold out. I had to keep the window open to try to cool it off in the room. Also, I wanted to do a late check out. I was 100% willing to pay to do so - I wanted to check out at 2 and not noon on a MONDAY and they flat out said no to it. After inquiring and saying I would pay to do so they said there would be a $50 charge. I asked how long that would give me and hey said a 1/2 an hour. CRAZY. CRAZY. CRAZY. The room was clean and well sized for a NYC hotel. It was clean and secure. I would not call this Chelsea. Technically it is but it's closer to Madison Square Garden and the Empire State building than anything quiet and trendy like Chelsea. Location was just fine though, it's close to all the subway lines. I got a good deal here through hotwire. Equal to the price of a 1 star shared bathroom this weekend.

Housekeeping leaves their carts in the hallway at all times, if that gives you an idea of what kind of place this is. My complaint, in fact is with housekeeping. I was traveling on business; I left my receipts on the desk in the room. Housekeeping threw them out. They were not near the garbage, they were sitting in the middle of the desk. I spoke to the manager about this; for my troubles, the next day I returned to the room to discover the door to my room had been left wide open. Fortunately nothing was gone, as far as I can tell. After all this, silly me left receipts on the desk again (should've known better) and they were again thrown out. I even put a note on them to the effect of \"don't throw this stuff out\" -- didn't matter. The crowning achievement was housekeeping also helping themselves to a small amount of cash that I left on the desk by accident (less than $5). After speaking with the manager the first day I never heard from him again. Left him a couple messages. Also really annoying is the fact that the street in front of the hotel was being re-paved (29th St). They -started- work on it at 6pm and wrapped up around 1 in the morning. When you're on the 4th floor facing the street this is not exactly conducive to sleeping...
