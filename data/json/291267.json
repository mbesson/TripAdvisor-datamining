Since it's a older property and somewhat like an office building, its concrete - steel reinforced so very quiet. I stayed in a double on the 9th floor. Quick, fast elevators. Had to go one floor lower for ice but no big deal, can use the stairs. Clean, well maintained pool as well with operational hot tub alongside. Fresh water shower not working. In house fitness room was closed but hotel does provide free passes to gym across the street. Good one too. Accommodations were decent and clean. Double bed and pillows of average quality. TV with plenty of channels. Room carpet could use a serious deep cleaning. Not to mention the hallways. (I don't understand why hotels do not clean carpets more often. Little things like that can go a long way in improving guest experience). The bathroom/toilet was a little worse for wear but clean enough. Note: Room windows do not open. Staff was all round very pleasant. The front desk staff and housekeeping personnel especially helpful and friendly. This is a big property, so I can imagine the stress on the entire team to meet all guests expectations. Concierge even heated my soup up for me in the staff microwave.

I said that this was not stated anywhere on our booking info or on their website, the reply \"it would't be sir as true website does not publish this\". I then asked to see the room after hearing others complain. I was shown a room that was unclean, stank, and was built in the 70's. I returned to reception where my other half was waiting and explained that we were not staying and wished to cancel our reservation. At this point another ember of staff joined the duty manger and both were unhelpful and rude. At first they refused to give us any further help, I had to argue to get them to write our cancellation number on their letterhead which they pretended not to have. After 5 minutes of arguing they finally opened a drawer and wrote our cancellation number on letterhead. I can not stress enough how dirty the hotel was and how rude the staff were. The hotel is also over half an hour away from the airport, when I stated that this was not an airport hotel they claimed that they were the nearest Howard Johnsons to the airport so this is why they called themselves an airport hotel.

We finally got there (it is 25 minutes from the airport with no traffic - unclear how it's considered an airport hotel), and what a disappointment. The room was dirty - the floor looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in months, bathroom floor and shower were stained and looked unclean, and the covers on the bed (which I tried to touch as little as possible) were also stained and torn. The room was so stuffy and hot that the windows were completely covered in condensation from the inside and we couldn't get the AC to cool it.

Ignore the bizarre negative reviews below.\u201d", "Author": "BGIWorldTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR110139993", "Content": "Based on the reviews below, I must ask if these individuals stayed at the same hotel I stayed at? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just returned from a relaxing three night stay at this wonderful property booked via AA Hotels. When I landed in Miami at 16:30, I called the hotel to ask what time the next shuttle was, they said 17:00\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. It arrived at 17:05. I was warmly welcomed on arrival and within five minutes I had my room key and was in the elevator to my room (324) on the third floor. The room was very spacious and had all the amenities I could ask for, fast & reliable wireless internet, television with about 30 premium cable channels, coffee maker with tea and coffee sachets, air conditioning etc. There is a restaurant onsite but I never used it as I preferred to go to the restaurants at the nearby Westfield Mall such as IHOP and Chillis. The bathroom is also quite spacious and MOULD FREE. It's comprised of a show/bath combination and even has a hair-dryer. There is ample wardrobe space as well as an in-room safe. Not once I did I encounter a stained carpet, mould anywhere in my room, cigarette scents, rude staff, dubious credit card charges or a late shuttle. If anyone below who is complaining had bothered to check, they would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recognised that the shuttle service goes to the airport, the mall and the nearby Walmart to accommodate guests who have stayed their primarily to shop. There is a shuttle schedule at the front desk and as I wisely did, they should have called the hotel to find out the pick-up times from MIA before waiting an inordinate amount of time for it to arrive. I myself took the shuttle to Walmart the Saturday morning at 10:00, and it returned promptly at 14:00. What I loved about the reliable shuttle service is that I was able to take it to MIA the Sunday, and then catch the 150 Airport Flyer Bus to South Beach thereby saving a bundle. Even on that day, the shuttle was on time in departure and its return the night. It is clear to me that empty vessels indeed make the most noise. Overall, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for affordable accommodation, near a shopping area with an efficient shuttle service to and from the airport and shopping centre, Howard Johnson is it. Even if your just overnighting in Miami it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an excellent option\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the hotel is just 25 minutes from the airport and much cheaper than the other so-called airport hotels. I paid $62 USD a night. The only reason I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not giving the hotel five stars is because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the 8th floor room I asked for weeks in advance and some of the staff needed to smile a bit more.

In our reservation we noted that there was a breastfeeding mom and we needed a refrigerator and that I was highly allergic to mold. The agent acknowledged our request but we NEVER received a refrigerator and later told us that it was first come first serve. From the moment we got off the elevator we knew we wouldn't enjoy our stay. There was a very weird & musty smell on our floor. The hallway carperts were visibly stained as well as the CURTAINS in our room. Clearly there were no renovations to this floor. The bathroom reminded you of those \"passing through\" motels. However, the worst was the visible mold in the bathroom, on the wall, and windows. I began swelling within ten minutes of entering the room. We contacted the front desk, explained our concern about the refrigerator to store the breastmilk and the mold. His response was \"You are going to have to get some ice on the other floor and sorry there are no more rooms. You can go to the Ramada Inn.\" (Note: he remained pleasant) However, this was now after midnight! Needless to say, we never got the refrigerator, I couldn't take the mold anymore so the next morn, we packed up & checked out.

One morning I was having breakfast and I saw Mr. Negretti waiting on tables, getting juice etc for people and helping out everywhere. I spoke to him and he remembered me from my emails. I asked him what he was doing there and he said he and another guy from the Sales department were helping out in the restaurant that morning. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He was so nice and caring to everyone and a big asset to the hotel. The last day I was shopping in the Mall and someone stole my handbag which was unfortunate but these things happen in life.

This was my second time there. The first time was in August 2009. I had no problems on that trip. Howard Johnson now offers just two continental breakfast tickets per room for each day of your stay. When we arrived we were short on the coupons but did not bother to say anything at the time because we did not think it would be a problem to come back when we were ready and get the extra ticket. I went to the front desk and told the lady we were short one and she told me that it was impossible. I did not know it was impossible for humans to make mistakes, but in other words I was made to look like an idiot. She told me to wait a while until she finished off some paper work that was in her hands. I waited a few seconds then another front desk employee asked my concern. I told him I was waiting until the other lady was through because I thought she was going to take care of the situation and hand me another coupon. but then she says to me, 'you need to tell him\". I felt like I was being tossed around. I explain the situation again to whom I perceived to be the supervisor and low to my surprise he told me that I was wrong that I got the correct amount of coupons and that I was not short. Now I was being made to look like a liar. I was highly upset because this man was not even on the desk when we first arrived. He just took her side and refused to give me another coupon. We got in a heated argument, yes that's right, he argued with me word for word and even told me to shut up and said that I was stupid also, when I told him he was stupid. I have a degree in Professional management and what I experienced with Howard Johnson front desk staff was very poor customer service. You should never argue with your customer. The continental breakfast was only, tea, juice, a small cup of fruits and a pastry. I asked him, why would I lie for a cup of tea. I told him I was not coming back to that hotel and he said, 'good'. Even if the hotel has a strict policy on the amount of coupons they give out they should allow for short comings as in my case. I would of gladly signed a note to say I received an 'extra' coupon. In fact as a supervisor/manager there are times when all the rules are not laid down in the books and you have to be able to make decisions on your feet. Do you loose a customer and possibly more for me posting this bad experience or do you just go ahead and try to keep a happy customer. the next day I went to use the internet service and the printers were not functioning. The guy at the internet desk was nice enough to allow me to use it free of charge just because he knew that I was not able to print anything. I still offered to pay when I was done but he did not accept it, for this I was able to enjoy the rest of my stay at Howard Johnson but I can't say that I will return. Other than that it is a nice hotel. This was on the morning of August 12th.

It was so bad we had to have a room change. The nights was quite uncomfortable, this was due to to lumpy mattress on the bed, some areas on the bed sunk way in , it was like lying in a whole and other parts was like lying on a mountain. The bathroom was cleaned on a daily basis, but the floor tiles was old and needed to be upgraded. The AC worked some of the time and other times we were very warm. The continental breakfast was a joke, not many options to choose from. The restuarant was under renovations and we had no choice but to seek food on the outside, no room service available, so this really had an impact on our vacation mode. When we checked out we made reference to the mattress and I hope that they have made changes. We are planning to return to the hotel soon.

Let's start with the free shuttle. It runs every TWO hours and if the driver doesn't see you standing outside MIA (since the driver was traveling at 70 mph around the airport, he won't) you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re spending most of your day at the airport. Your next option is to take a cab. The airport is 11 MILES AWAY (remember, they call themselves an airport hotel) which equates to a 45 minute cab ride (there will be traffic) which will run you $35. No extra charge for the cab driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extra-loud musical choices (he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand English so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste your time telling to turn down the volume). Check in: Here is their scam. I watched as 6 different people attempted to check in and each one was told that the hotel could not honor their original rate given by Howard Johnson (because you did not call this specific hotel directly) and that their original rate increased by $20.00. Every person, regardless of their quoted rate ($79, $89...) had their rate increased by $20. My wife called their bluff and informed the employee we were paying the original rate and that it was not open for discussion. We received a stranded passenger voucher from American Airlines for $69. After we asked to see the manager, the front desk employee quickly agreed to the $69 rate. She then attempted to appease us by reassigning us from the 2nd floor to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153penthouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (It should be renamed the outhouse). The room was simply old, stained, dirty and depressing. Someone previously mentioned the hotel is conveniently located on the Palmetto Expressway-they are absolutely correct. Hojo will provide you with a truly memorable experience: You will actually feel like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sleeping on the inside lane of the adjacent highway. A 1950\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Army tent has more soundproofing than this gulag. I would like to mention the Howard Jonson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gitmo-Miami Airport does offer free entertainment. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quick financial transactions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the hallways or the tranquil screams from the carjacking that occurred across the street at the Traffic School (if you grew up in Baghdad, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll love the neighborhood), there is something for the entire family. If you have an early flight to catch, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in luck because the lack of hot water will ensure an invigorating cold shower. Bring plenty of cash; everything cost you at this Corrections facility.

This place has all the warmth and charm of Abu Gharib except they will charge you 40 bucks to stand on one of their milk crates.

Little things that would keep me from feeling REALLY comfortable for more than 1 night...chipped decorative panels in the elevator, old & dirty window tracks, etc.. The bathroom was clean enough & could use some updating. There were a few places where the shower tile grout could use some attention, but nothing gross. The bedding was interesting. There were sheets & they were clean, but the blanket appeared to be some type of felt... like you use in arts & crafts. It smelled like fabric softner & gave me comfort that it had been cleaned. It was more tacky than anything. No blanket at all would have been better. The carpet was dark, but I could see some stains. Again, nothing gross, but showed the place was obviously lived in. Pictures on the website of the lobby, bar, standard King, & bathroom look exactly as mine did. Only you have examine a little closer to see the wear & tear on things.

The staff were very friendly & helpful everywhere in the hotel - the front desk, the concierge, the bar maid ! Everyone I came across were all super helpful & friendly. Another advantage to this hotel is that they have a desk where you can rent a car. So this is very convenient. No need to rent a car at the airport since you can do it right there at the hotel and the price was also very competitive.

I selected it for two reasons: advertised proximity to the airport w/ ease of pickup, and advertised top-grade 24/7 business center. Upon arriving in Miami, I discovered that their airport shuttle only runs once an hour and only makes one stop at the airport. I found the spot and waited the hour, but the shuttle went whizzing by in the outside lane without even looking to see if there were passengers to pick up. So I waited another hour till I finally got picked up. Then I find that the hotel is actually a half hour away from the airport. Yes, as the crow flies, it's close to a mall and restaurants, but they neglect to mention that it's on the other side of a freeway, with no easy sidewalk access, and on the Sunday evening when i arrived, everything was closed anyway. (Does Florida still have blue laws?) So nowhere to eat except the very unsatisfactory hotel restaurant, and nothing else available to do. A priority was the use of their business center, since I needed to re-establish some important communications after several weeks away. When I first asked, I was told the man in charge of the business center was running errands and would be back with the key within a half hour. An hour later, I was told that the business center never does open on Sunday (even though the sign on the door said 24/7). Still later I was told that the business center wasn't operational at all at that time, and indeed when I looked through the window, it was piled high with boxes and obviously being used as a storage room. It was difficult to find employees who spoke understandable English, and without exception the employees were rude and unhelpful.

On arriving, we were given a room on the 2nd floor, which was clean and serviceable, but I noticed a rather loud buzzing coming from (I think) a nearby utility room. It wasn't a big deal, and I would have stayed in that room if it was just for one night, but my husband decided to ask if they could switch us to another room. The concierge was very friendly and immediately offered us an upgraded room on a higher floor, since they didn't have any more basic rooms. The upgraded room was actually a \"Home Office Room\" and was bigger than the first room and had a larger desk, mini-fridge and extra armchair. It also looked generally newer so I presume it was renovated more recently. They usually charge an extra $10 or so for this type of room, which I think is definitely worth it. At any rate, we had a very comfortable stay - comfortable bed, clean and roomy bathroom, and nice freebies like internet and parking (which my other hotel choices would have charged extra for). There are plenty of chain restaurants nearby, as well as grocery stores, so it's convenient, but certainly not in a hip area of town. However, we had a car and it was never more than 20-30 minutes to get to any destination - South Beach, Dolphin Mall, etc. Someone else mentioned a funny smell in the hallways - I noticed this too - I think it's the cleaning solution they use. Of note, the rooms do NOT have any objectionable smells. In summary, this is a well-maintained business hotel.
