Now halfway through my 12 month stay, I am afraid to say, it has not. Anyway, lets start with the positives: - Good location, Botanical Gardens with a cheap taxi fare to Soho, Central, Admirality and Wan Chai; - Door staff and housekeeping are fantastic, can not do enough (and don't laugh when in front of me when I have forgot my key card for the nth time); - All areas are clean and are well kept; <<Deep Breath>> Onto the negatives: - The website advertises this place 'as a perfect place for a short term or long term stay' with the promise of a kitchenette. This kitchenette consists of a 'fridge (with a minuscule freezer) , one cooking ring and a microwave. This means for one year I have to either fry or microwave all my food. Don't get me wrong Hong Kong is one of the best places in the world to eat but sometimes I would quite like cheese on toast, sadly not an option. These facilities are fine for a couple of weeks/months but for a long term stay it is frustrating, I have asked around and for a similar price you can get better kitchen facilities; - Speaking of the freezer - it hasn't actually worked for four months, but got fixed on the third request; - Some of my possessions have been broken by staff and then replaced without actually informing me of the switch. I had to take these 'replacements' to reception before a manager came to my room and owned up to what had happened. Things do get broken and I am cool with that but, to replace something that I purchased without telling me, automatically presuming that I would not notice is, quite frankly, appalling; - There is no outside space, not unusual in Hong Kong but you can not even open a window in the room (obviously no balcony). The accommodation does have space for an outside area (it is a two tier building). On the plus side it means you will want to leave your room as much as possible and explore Hong Kong. A lot ; - I would prefer a morgue to the 'Coffee Shop', lovely view but no atmosphere. There is no bar within realistic walking distance so this place should make a killing, however having been decorated c1997, closing at 9.30pm, with bright lightening and uncomfortable seating I avoid like the plague. It is telling that unless there is a special party there is usually very few (3/4) people dining. The food is expensive compared to similar places, portions are small (and I don't think that they are attempting nuvo cuisine). If you do order room service suggest that you go for the daily special - usually fresher. However, the 'Coffee Shop' staff are hilarious, if you see the funny side of an adult with the attitude of a teenage child; - Probably my own fault this one. I paid one months room service bill but I did not get a receipt and got charged twice. I know I paid this bill (I get another bill on the same day so I get the single amount from my account which shows on my bank statement); - Careful if you are using the washing (laundry). You have to complete a form but the dry cleaning (expensive) and relatively cheap standard, washing forms are extremely similar, twice now I have used the incorrect one because they did not leave a standard form in my room. Since becoming aware of ploy I have had to request these forms be replenished, twice; - If you are using the laundry facilities, careful some of your clothes still come back quite smelly and have to send them again (it is summer here at the moment so it is a problem); - Bathroom is a little tired, there are a fair few brown stains between the floor and the bath. - This may be standard in Hong Kong, but having only stayed on two other places I can not be objective, the sound proofing a terrible. One pair of my neighbours loved each other very much, I probably don't need to explain why I know this; - Agree with the previous person who said the gym was poorly equipped, however I prefer to go for a walk so no personally no great loss. If any of the management team are reading this review, despite appearances I am not having a whinge, you have the basis of a good place here, I await your comments on the above review. A few tweaks and it would be a good place to stay. Appreciate that I am still staying here, so I do hope that I see some improvement in the next six months and would love to be able to re-write this review. If you are choosing this place to spend your own money in, think twice and look around. See what is important to you, if you are staying for a while ask a few of the guests for their options, you will may get a different view. <<Exhales>> Please note that I have rated as 'Poor' due to the overall standard of accommodation considering the published cost of the room.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIf it weren't the stunning neighborhood/views, It'd deserve three stars.\u201d", "Author": "xerophytic", "ReviewID": "UR138062937", "Content": "Building is clearly complacent on quality- due to great location.

It's next to the botanical garden in Central, not far away from SOHO and Lan Kwai Fong(But it's complicated to walk to there). 5min walk to the peak tram station, 10 min to the Connaught Rd Central for metro and tram, another extra 5 min to IFC/HK station. (But since it's on the hill, it's easy to go down but difficult to go up, especially in a hot humid day in HK.. walking is not very recommended..). By taxi it takes less than 5 min to IFC(25HKD), and also there is a bus going to central in front of the building. The room was spacious(by HK standard of course) and clean, and the view from the room was fantastic. Cheap room service option. Kitchen was nice and had amenities I needed for the simple cooking. Bishop Lei International or Garden YMCA are similar to this one. While Bishop Lei is better located(very close to the mid-level escaltor, easily walkable to Central or IFC) and has a swimming pool, Two Macdonnel has better rooms(btw there are no twin bed rooms here).

I knew it would be tight space wise (this is HK afterall) but was disappointed as I was led to believe 2 single beds could fit in the second room... they sorted it out by taking the desk out of the second room and squeezing it in but it meant there was no space even to open the cupboard... The location is great. Buses from central stop right outside, as do most taxis. That for me was the best point about it. They could do better but having things such as washing up liquid and a sponge, perhaps sugar sachets, salt and pepper... this is self catering... even the most basic B&B these days offers such like.

We were given a room on the 14th floor and the corridor reeked of smoke. The room was better but still had a smoky smell. We asked to be relocated on the first night but were told there were no other rooms. The hotel was full.
