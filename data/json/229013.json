Food is below avg, if u are italian, nothing special, dining room is ok, staff is sometime not aware what they are doing (asked for some pork steaks and got chicken.!!!)

This hotel is grand inside and out. The buffet syle breakfast is wonderful with many choices, hot and cold. The room in which guests have breakfast is stunning, very cheerful and bright. Our room was spacious, clean and well appointed, Despite it being mid November., we slept with the garden doors open and were not cold. Although the furnishings are dated througout the hotel they give a certain ambiance to the place. In its hayday this was \"the place to be\" and I think that as that era was its best, the hotel attempts to revive that time in its history. The hallways are a gallery of photos taken from the time the hotel opened until the early 1960's. Instead of viewing these negatively as in some other reviews here, I thought they were quite charming. It wasn't hard to imagine this hotel during that time. The staff were eager to help us plan our days and always greeted us with a smile. The hotel provided free parking behine the hotel and is onlly a five minute walk to the water taxi stop. There are lots of good restaraunts on the island as well. Lido also has the only sand beaches in Venice, right at the end of the main street, within an easy walk from the hotel.

The pros are few but deserve mention - the building is attractive from the outside, the rooms are clean, the restaurant is in a grand room with a nice pianist, the hotel is just 5 minutes walk from the vaporetto stop, and the staff are friendly enough. However: 1. Room - the room was boiling boiling hot and we couldn't do anything about it; the curtains get caught in the window when it's open; in our room 307); as others have said, the furniture and decor is pretty dated; we had a table/mirror in our room with discoloured cracked glass; the corridors too were very very hot 2. Restaurant - under no circumstances should you eat in the restaurant! In spite of what I'm sure are their best efforts, the menu is terrible and the food completely over-salted. 3. Atmosphere - I know that we were there off-season, but the entire atmosphere was completely un-Italian. We were there at carnival time, and the hotel decorations stretched to a few party hats draped on statues. The whole vibe (especially with all of the dated photographs on the wall) was of Bognor Regis in the 60s and 70s! 4. Wi-Fi - we paid through the teeth for a Junior Suite (see above for our thoughts on the room) and on the morning we checked out I asked for the Wi-Fi code to do online check-in. As we were just leaving, the nice man on reception gave it to us free.....but before he realised we were leaving that day we were going to get charged 20 Euros for 24 hours Wi-Fi usage. At the price, I would absolutely expect Wi-Fi to have been included. I'm sorry to say that we considered leaving the hotel and taking our chances in Venice itself.

And for the most part, we were pleased with our low-season stay. As mentioned by other reviewers, the place is dated. However, the interior well suits the mosaic facade and surrounding sculpture garden and thereby adds to its charm. Due to what looks an extensive bout of refurbishment, the rooms possess a contemporary veneer even if what that veneer covers in terms of the underlying plumbing, flooring and ventilation remains evident. Meanwhile, the conservatory that hosts an ample breakfast and the adjoining restaurant and bar areas more outwardly retain the ambience of a bygone age. As well, there's a facility in the basement that offers all manner of Oriental treatment and therapies, which proved a useful amenity given the single, glaring omission in the renovation. I am speaking of the beds, which dominated our standard double room and featured twins placed side-by-side. While this arrangement was not unexpected, the condition of the mattresses was such that one was forced to sleep in a swale and awoke with body aches that failry demanded massage, Thai or otherwise, to relieve them. After a day of trodding the city to see the sights, an evening's contortionism is decidedly unwelcome. Alerted to this failing, the friendly staff vowed the situation would be addressed. Given we'll not be back to Venice again for a number of months, there's certainly time to get it right (at least, for us). We'll be sure to check here to see what others find in the interim before deciding whether to book again.

Find out the hard way that the cooler for the airco was turned off as the warm season had ended (October travel), but it was still blooming warm. This was solved by just leaving the window on a crack .. Being in the centre of the Lido, few hundred meters from the Waterbus station and not far from the Ferry either, it isn't very loud, although there is always something to do on the strip. As said, the transport to the main island of Venice and others, such as Murano, are only a short bustrip away, and at a very low price.

Every pice of parquet was returned to its original exact position after restoration. A Parquet which has hosted Royalty and Vips in the hundreds since it was biuilt And so on .

Before we booked the room, we rang the hotel to confirm that we were seeking two separate bedrooms in our suite. The hotel advised us that such a room was available. This was also confirmed by email. To start with on arrival the hotel facade is impressive, but that was as good as it got, we were meet by a condescending receptionist, who told us where our room was and no mention of help with the suitcases, my wife was pregnant and my mother was in her mid sixties. We trundled into the antiquated lift and arrived at our \"suite\". The \"suite\" comprised of a box room with some poor quality furniture and a fold up bed in the corner. In the far corner was a gap in the wall towards the main bedroom. No door and certainly not two separate rooms as advised from the staff. Therefore my wife and I had to share a room with my mother for three nights. We then noticed that the panelling was coming off the door.

We arrived on an Easy Jet flight into Marco Polo airport. We then took the blue-line river boat to the Lido. It cost 25 Euro each for a return ticket which we brought from the machine in the airport (selecting English as our preferred choice). The journey took about 40 mins before we stopped at the Lido. On disembarking we walked up Elizabeta Avenue and found the hotel easily. It was about 200metres on the right hand side and is very grande looking. The staff in reception were very friendly and helpful as were all the staff at the hotel. The room was an economy room and it was clean and comfortable, and by European standards - a decent size. The only downside for me was that we ordered a double room and found that we had two single beds pushed together - also, there was no tea/coffee facilities in the room. Breakfast was ok. There was plenty of choice, including a fresh fruit selection, which I particularly like. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant as we wanted to experience as much as we could in Venice, but I did have a massage in the Wellness Centre in the basement, which was excellent and cost around 75 Euro. One thing to point out, is that you have to pay 20 Euro each, each time you use the Spa. The Spa has a Sauna, Steamroom and Jacuzzi. It is probably in the small print that they charge 20 Euro each, but I wasn't aware. I kind of assumed that it would be free for hotel guests... Venice itself is amazing! The wine, the water and the weather. It's very pretty and was worth every penny (except for the 'coverto' - cover charge - and 'servico' - service charge, that you have to look out for). However, if you look carefully, you can find some lovely places where this is not applicable. You can buy a 72hr water bus ticket for 33 Euro at the Lido stop. But make sure you ask for your change. To sum it up, this hotel is a safe bet if you're going to Venice. It's clean and tidy and the staff are friendly and helpful. The location on the Lido is good and the water bus into St Marks and other places, runs frequently and is a good price.

It is not at all: the staff is awful starting from the receptionist who hardly speaks English and would really not bother much to say hello or give you any sort of a welcome smile when you enter the hotel. The rooms look nothing at all as on the web-site. They are very old and shabby, and do require renovation right away. A bathroom is something one does not want to see at all. They are awful. The interior of the hotel is also very old and there is some smell which reminds you of a canteen where the food may only be disgusting. The only thing which is truly beautiful about the place is the exterior of the hotel. From the outside the building does look nice, but I would recommend everyone not to be mistaken because of it. There is absolutely nothing else in that hotel but the exterior look. Having arrived and seen the ugly reception area and the dedicated for us room, I have asked the receptionist to show us any other rooms of higher categories which if we liked and decided to stay, we would have obviously paid the required extra. But fact of the matter is even they turned out to be disgusting. And those most awful bathrooms, if they can be called like that at all, were still the same. The floors design and condition leave much to be desired too, to put it mildly. So, what we did having seen all that nightmare being called a 4-star hotel is left. There is really nothing else to do. Later on we stayed in a great place that day, though 5-star and in Venice itself, but really marvelous. A few days later I contacted that Grande Albergo Ausonia & Hungaria Wellness & Spa hotel telling them what the situation was and asking if they would consider that situation and give us any refund (we were supposed to stay in that ugly hotel from Jan 7 through Jan 9, 2011, but had booked a non-refundable tariff) because it was obviously not our fault that the pictures on their web-site had misled us that much. But I got a \"no\" from the hotel, which only proves in a nasty place everything corresponds to its level. Please, be aware the pictures on the web-site of that hotel are absolutely not what this particular hotel is in reality. You will get very disappointed.

This was quite a surprise because we booked a 3-day package with dinner included, and as the hotel was clearly full, we imagined that we would have a more basic room. Dinner was in the restaurant on the ground floor and was a choice from a fixed menu. There were two parts to the restaurant, one for the group and one for the individual guests. Despite being busy the staff were attentive and very friendly. There were no vegetarian options on the menu but this proved to be no problem for the staff, who had several suggestions and were more inventive than the usual salad-combo. The wine recommendation was excellent (and by no means the most expensive on the menu). This was actually the perfect end to the day. The hotel is situated on the lido part of venice, a 7-minute boat ride to the main part of the city and all the better for it, with a certain calm and elegance \"far from the madding crowd\"... Our excursions into the city were punctuated by these boat rides to and from the different ports and added greatly to the more formal sense of \"day trip\" or \"night trip\" I tested the spa in the hotel for a back massage and was very pleasently surprised by a very professional service from an expert masseurse. The whole layout is quite oriental chi-chi and the fear upon arrival is that this is \"all lotus petals and no benefit\", but whilst I'm not generally inclined to sit around sniffing sandlewood this was money very well spent. I'm partial to a massage here and there and can attest that this was one of the best I've had. The breakfast was in a delightful winter garden part of the hotel - imagine white ironwork and tall windows, some with coloured glass (tastefully done) overlooking a garden. It's best to arrive early and have the peace of the view and the opportunity to stroll around the buffet, as opposed to having to queue for your roll.

The breakfast was much like I expected with a wide range of cold meats, pastries and cereals, be wary of the scrambled eggs though! We ate in two different resaturants while on Lido Island, and all I can say is don't! Venice is a 15 minute boat ride away and much more likely to provide a culinary pleasure than Lido island ever will. Venice itself is magical and best experienced at night when the little tapas bars come to life. We spent our final night in Venice wandering the historic streets eating and drinking in several of the quaint little bars. Take my advice and head for the market area near the Rialto bridge for the best of these, where apparently you can eat cheaply with the locals during the day and drink with the same at night.

There is also a supermarket across the road which was very useful.

The breakfast is good, the selection is not huge but there is a bit of everything. The hotel also has a lovely spa and a massage was included in our rate. The negatives: Our room (I think it was 323) smelt quite badly of blocked drains which got progressively worse, luckily we weren't in there for very much so it was bearable, but something to keep in mind when checking in. It would've have been nice to have tea/coffee making facilities in the room as it's quite nice to wake up and make one at your own pace instead of rushing downstairs to get a seat at breakfast, again, not really a negative but perhaps the hotel can change this if there is enough demand?

It does not only have absolutely beautiful interior and exterior of Art Nouveau (totally renovated a year ago but very much in touch with its old glamour), but also a very helpful staff, an excellent breakfast, a beautiful Thai SPA center (the center is new, opened in july and it was on a very high level of our expectations) and a beautiful terrace - and these are only few things that I have to mention. The vaporetto station is only few walks away, so you only need 10 minuts to Venice but again you are enjoying a beautiful greenery of an island that Venetians by the way adore. Also the kids liked it very much. And during the evening me and my husband were entangled by the beautiful terrace with discrete music playing, the glass of excellent wine while from the background Beethoven is quietly being heard. I give it a 5 plus stars to this hotel!! (my babygirl is whispering on my ear that she is giving it 10 stars\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so it is obviously also a very much child likable hotel.)

The bathroom was big and we had a little closet type room to put our suitcases in. The furniture was minimal but looked antique and added to the room's character. Breakfast was impressive with a large buffet of cereals, toast, eggs, bacon, hams and cheeses as well as pastries and preserves. I was slightly nervous about staying on the Lido as I was worried that it would be too quiet with no bars or shops however I couldn't be more wrong.

There is an American bar open which is a little on the pricey side, but you get to sit on the terrace and soak up the sun and atmosphere. There are also plenty of bars, trattoria and restaurants along the main street that the hotel sits on, so you are never short of choice.

The Vaporetto run regularly over the centre of Venice and also all of the provincial islands and areas.
