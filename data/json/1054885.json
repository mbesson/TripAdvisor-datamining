Close to the airport for a cheapish taxi ride (really is 5 mins away). Walk to the restaurants and bars and it is quiet.. you will never know there is a major airport next door! Nice and clean and functional. Good price, too.

The staff were friendly and very accommodating. The rooms are small and tight but clean and new and well supplied. Excellent location in its proximity to the airport and there is a bus to the main terminals about 50meters away. One thing- DONT ask the hotel to make a reservation for a taxi . If you have tons of baggage or are leaving at a very early hour. There are taxis in the main square 30 meters from the hotel 24 hours a day.It cost me 17 euros to go less than 1km. Its part of whats wrong with Spain.

We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a driving holiday to Galicia before flying back to South America. The hotel is good value for money, although there is no free shuttle offered, so factor in the cost of a taxi to the airport if you have too much luggage to manage the bus from the nearby square. The taxi cost us 20 Euros. Beds are comfortable, rooms clean, if on the small side, and the free WiFi is as at good speed. The exceptional friendliness and helpfulness of the staff is what makes this hotel special. We had a problem on our first night - the air conditioning wasn't working very well in our room. The staff moved our luggage to another room the next day with good AC whilst we were sightseeing in Madrid. There are good bars and restaurants in the square just a stone's throw away (open early even on Sundays for breakfast). You can get a continental breakfast in the hotel for 3 Euros though. Barajas is a good alternative if you are on a budget and also want to see Madrid - the metro is fast and just one change to Tribunal - and only 1 Euro per trip.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cNext to the airport\u201d", "Author": "flyingnic", "ReviewID": "UR91177308", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for only one night, arriving in Barajas Airport in the evening and having a very early flight the next morning. I didn\u2019t want to spend yet another night in the horrible (at night) Barajas Airport (with almost no seats) so I decided to find a hotel close to the airport, not to spend a fortune on a taxi, but also not losing sleep time while transferring from the hotel to airport. It takes only 10-15 minutes, by walk, to get from T 1-2-3 to the hotel, which is located in a quiet neighborhood of Barajas city. Even though it is so close to the airport, the sound of airplanes taking-off or landing wasn\u2019t bothersome. Anyway during the night there is almost no action around the airport. The rooms were spacious, quite modern I would say. The bathroom is basic but ok. In the morning I checked out around 5.30 AM, there was somebody at the reception, so no problems. If I ever need to spend another night in Barajas, I would gladly return to this hotel.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern CA", "Title": "\u201cReasonable Price/Proximity to Airport\u201d", "Author": "cklonowski", "ReviewID": "UR74787518", "Content": "Stayed here two nights, the first was a late arrival around 1 AM, and stayed on for a second night as I was meeting my daughter who was arriving early at T1. So, spent the day in between using the Metro to see some of Madrid. The metro, Barajas, is only one stop from either T4 or T1/2/3 from the airport, about a 10 minute pleasant walk through a suburban Madrid neighborhood, but I only had one small bag. Those with lots of luggage might find it too far. Hotel itself was clean and quiet from street noise despite being a few meters away from a plaza, but you could hear other guests occasionally. A/C was cool and welcome, since there was a heat wave going on.

This met our objective for economical lodging the night before a flight out of Barajas Airport. However, it was somewhat difficult to reach via Metro when loaded down with suitcases, as it was a 6 to 8 block walk to the hotel. The streets were unclearly marked, we had a bad map, and it was hard to find. There are other hotels in this area that are similarly priced, have more facilities, and nearer the newer restaurants in Barajas.

The hotel is privately owned, new, clean, quiet,and extremely comfortable. The fittings are solid and high quality, It has air-conditioning, secure car parking in the basement (paid for separately). It is one minute's walk to Barajas' main square where buses to/from the airport stop and where there's also a taxi rank. We found going to and from the airport by bus (101) very easy indeed. The arcaded mediaeval square is charming, with a number of cafes and restaurants, where we could sit out to eat, surrounded by locals. There's a metro stop close-by too for getting into central Madrid, or you can quickly get to the Madrid ring road,which we did, both for visiting the city and for access to surrounding places", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Barajas Plaza", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1054885-Reviews-Hotel_Barajas_Plaza-Madrid.html", "Price": "$57 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Camarillas, 5-7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28042</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1054885", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/65/67/6567a8e1d233347540f7ba1183d335612large.jpg"}}
