{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hidden little gem Our distribution partner invited several colleagues and myself to attend their sales get together at this hotel. What a lucky break for us as this property dates back a couple of hundred years and has been in this family for over 100 years. The proprietor, Francesc, maintains this gem which is also his family home. IT has only 10 or so guest rooms and is high on a hillside overlooking the sea. It is only one km from the beach. They serve a simple breakfast in the morning but you have only a short walk to several outstanding restaurants. They have a small pool and an outside bar with a very nice selection of Spanish wines.It is really a small gem and we only paid 95 euros.", "Date": "Nov 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR729199478", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "krandy21784"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d666557-r22001602-Hotel_Mas_de_Baix-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "666557", "Price": "$208"}}
