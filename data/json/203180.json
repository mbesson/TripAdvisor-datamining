I can only echo the comments of some of the other raters above and it is unfortunate that others have also had such a horrible experience - I honestly hoped the taxi was dropping us off at the wrong hotel, as the entrance to the hotel was dark, dingy and most unwelcoming. This feeling was echoed inside, with terribly old decor and lack of customer service upon arrival. As we were visiting Rome as part of a very special celebration for us, we had booked a four star hotel. However, this hotel does not even deserve one star in my opinion - the first room we were given was tiny, dark, dirty, full of damp and was absolutely disgusting, it made me want to be sick. We complained to Citalia and were moved to a different room - apparently better - yes, slightly larger but still full of dubious stains / mould / worn out to say the least. We suffered an unfortunate event with leaks (reading above, this seems to be a frequent occasion, worryingly!) and were not treated well, having to call the travel company again --- we were offered another room - yes, three moves in one afternoon - supposedly their \"best\" - still not great, mould patch outside the bathroom, worn out, stained headboard, rips, stains to say the least. Breakfast was dreadful - watered down \"juice\", not fresh, I could barely eat anything. The coffee was awful, did not taste at all fresh and like Italian coffee should!

Lastly, the airconditioning in this hotel basically does not work. It's central air throughout the whole hotel, but it could barely cool the room (would cool less than 24degrees or so).

The airconditioning was very good. The morning breakfast on the top floor has a wonderful view over Rome, and is very well decorated, like eating in a very nice resturant. The buffet had a variety of cheeses, meats, cereal, pastries, fruit, bread, juice and coffee/tea. It was a great way to start the day. The service for the breakfast area was very good. The location was great for us. There are many restuarants within a few blocks, and about five blocks from The Spanish Steps where there is a Metro station. This made getting to The Vatican and Coloseum quite easy. There are many restaurants near the Spanish Steps as well, and the Trevi Fountain is not much futher on foot. The area for sitting off of the lobby is large, and has a full bar there. The man tending the bar will serve drinks and snacks to anyone in the sitting area. The only drawback was wifi had to be accessed from the sitting area for a price. A card with an access code could be purchased at the fron desk. It wasn't to bad; I think a few euro for a few hours? It served well for checking email and seating on our return flight home. We ate at several great Italian restaurants while there; they are everywhere. The Hard Rock Cafe is only a few blocks from the hotel; had Father's day dinner there. We did guided tours of The Vatican and Vatican Museums, Palatine Hill and The Forum/Coloseum. We finally settled on Through Eternitiy Tours for all. The guides were outstanding, and the service provided made our experiance in Rome everything we hoped it would be.

The lift was very small, as per previous reviews on here but we were only on the first floor so didn't really need to use it that often. On entering our room, we were taken aback, it was very roomy and very nice, the decor was pleasant and there was more than enough room for the both of us and suitcases. However, there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke which we could not get rid of despite leaving the window open. The bed sheets and towels were replaced every day which was good and the room was very clean. We also had a safe in the wardrobe which was handy. With regards to breakfast, we found this on the 6th floor, a lovely big room with magnificent views over the surrounding areas. Breakfast was on from 7am to 10 am and on one of the days we didn't get up there until 9.45 and were surprised that there was still a lot of food out and it was being replenished regularly despite there being a lot of people there. There was a vast amount of bread, juice, yoghurts, meat, cheese, fruit, tomatoes, eggs and croissants and a hot drinks machine. There was always plenty there. The mini bar was very cheap which was good and this was payable on departure. We found drinks in Rome very, very expensive so we reverted to the mini bar on quite a few occasions and it was definitely a lot cheaper. Unfortunately, we did not get chance to try the hotel bar as it appeared to be closed everytime we went past. The Eliseo is in a very good location and you can get to most of the sights by foot- we found that the excursions were very expensive and as long as you have a comfy pair of shoes on you can get to most of the sights- spanish steps, trevi fountain are not far from this hotel. Be careful though if you are venturing down the spanish steps, I slipped down them one morning and badly bruised my elbow due to either rain the night before or possibly being washed down. Also, be careful at night, there are lots of people hanging around the spanish steps mithering you for money and they are difficult to get away from! Also there are a lot of people standing outside restaurants enticing you in, just ignore them. We went to various restaurants and cafe's but the most memorable was Harry's Bar- you must visit this place- very, very expensive may I warn you so make sure you have a lot of money with you- we had only 2 mains and a bottle of wine and it came to 114 euros!! Service is fab and decor is gorgeous and there is no one outside here enticing you to go in.

We moved into a different room the next day which seemed fine on the intial glance round but on a more detailed look discovered we had a lovely infestation of ants that were happily crawling around the skirting of the entire room, this meant we spent the week living out of suitcases so as to avoid transporting any of them back home! The desk was made aware of the problem on the same day and nothing was done, we reminded them the next day and still no resolution, we stayed from the Sunday until the Friday and nothing was done about the ants the entire time, the only comment made was that they sometimes get in from the outside even though the largest group seemed to be getting through an internal wall! The only positives I can come up with for this hotel is the breakfast room on the sixth floor, looks right over the park and on a clear day you can see a good portion of the city, also the location at the top of the Vio Veneto is good so long as you don't mind a bit of a walk to get to the major attractions. This is definitley not a hotel worthy 4*, infact I would rate it closer to a 2*. Avoid the resaurant recommended by the hotel if possible, worth a ten-fifteen minute walk to the spanish steps for a far superior meal for the same cost, similarly don't book your taxi back to the airport through them, it will cost you fifteen euros more than if you walk round the corner to the taxi stand.

We had trouble finding a take-out tea (restaurants don't have styrofoam cups!) for my Dad who stayed back in the room in the evening, so upon returning to the Eliseo around 11:00 p.m. asked abt. getting one in the hotel. No problem, was delivered in less than 10 minutes, piping hot! View from rooftop Breakfast Room was magnificent! I'm guessing we were lucky, after reading some negative reviews abt. the food there, but we had a delicious and plentiful breakfast - my Dad (who is very picky), commented it was the best breakfast the whole trip! Restaurants on the Via Veneto are expensive, but there is one around the corner from the hotel (Coyote), that is reasonable and the food was good. Prices are less expensive down on the Piazza Navona. Would stay at this hotel again, for a short stay.", "Date": "September 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgrade, Serbia", "Title": "\u201cDo not expect too much\u201d", "Author": "Shule", "ReviewID": "UR3887269", "Content": "I stayed two night at Eliseo hotel in Rome. I may agree with others that it is not a four star hotel. However, the location is great, it is in a quiet street, and it has some special atmosphere. Bear in mind that hotels in Via Venetto are highly expensive so this hotel offers rooms for reasonable prices. I am not a demanding traveller and I used most of my time to enjoy Rome so I was satisfied with my room. However, it was rather small. Bathroom was nice, but you can hardly fit into the shower. Breakfast was fine although the service was poor - my impression was that lacked staff so poor lady did not manage to serve everyone. Receptionists were OK, somewhat cold and over proffesional. Definitely, you should expect more comfort in a for star hotel but you may be satisfied if you do not expect too much.", "Date": "September 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201c4 star price, 2 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3616892", "Content": "Just returned from a 3 night stay.

My sons room the air con did not work, the hotel has a bar which is shut on a sunday because the guy has a day off.

We thought the hotel was very good value for money, quiet at night and in a very good semi residential area.The location could not be better, if you want a bus they stop outside but we walked everwhere from the Hotel with ease.We have to say that the slog back up via the Spansh Steps after a long day sight seeing was hard work, so we often took the lesser gradient via the Via Vento.The staff at the hotel were courteus and helpful and the breakfasts were good.The views from the breakfast room over Rome, mirrored those from our balcony- fantatsic. You have to take what you pay into consideration when judging a hotel,the Eliseo is a mid price hotel and worth every penny.

Right across the street from the beautiful Borgese gardens, 10 minutes from the Spanish steps, and walkable to the whole of the old city. The Via Veneto is a high level street in Rome. Expensive shops and restaurants. Eliseo is bookended by some high level hotels. Our room was very clean, great size bathroom. Each day the maid service was fantastic. Great friendly service at the front desk. They helped with questions. All in all, I would go back and I would request room 602.

Though initially disquieting, the error was a blessing particularly due to the Eliseo's location on the edge of the Borghese gardens... a wonderful parkland area containing Zoo, art gallery, lakes and much more ...very different from the area around the Hotel Fiamma in the area of Termini ! We found the staff diffident but friendly and helpful when asked and when one of was unwell their concern was genuine and appreciated. The buffet breakfast was extensive and the service cheerful and efficient. The views from the 6th floor breakfast room were beautiful and so unexpected. The rooms and bed linen were very clean and the towels were changed every day. The decor is a bit tired in places and the shower a mixer tap style but lots of hot water any time of the day. Location was perfect, close to the Spagna Metro station which could be reached by a long pedestrian underpass which could also be used to get directly to the Spanish Steps (10 mins walk). Good selection of buses from the Borghese gardens ( less than 5 mins away). Very pleasant and safe area to walk about in the evening with a variety of restaurants.
