Found hair in both the shower and the bath when I first entered the room, and second day when the cleaner had been in, found out that apart from folding the sheets and fixing the bed everything else had been the left same. The food at the restaurant is quite poor as well for a 4 star hotel. The location is not the best but for someone like me who enjoys spending time walking it wasn't an issue.

The rooms were clean and spacious, however, some had heating problems, and there was a lot of noise from the nightclub at the rear of the hotel that stayed open until 4.30am. The main issue was the lack of clear management. We had a couple of incidents. We booked on a half board basis and when gathering in the reception area prior to the evening meal, we were told by the receptionist that wine and water was included with the meal. My colleague and myself double checked this with the receptionist and she confirmed it. When I entered the then closed restaurant, I saw that on our tables were bottles of water and wine. As we had now been told by 2 members of staff of the inclusion of water and wine, I thought it must be correct. At the end of the meal I was given a bill for the water and wine. Then when we complained, the receptionist confirmed she had got it wrong, but we had to pay. I paid, and asked to see the manager the next day. When meeting with the manager he spent the whole time accusing us, or our agent of getting it wrong, however, I insisted that his staff had given us the wrong information. We were offered 5 free bottles of water per night, but only ever received 4. The second problem was more serious. I was robbed in the reception area on our final night (of a 3 night stay). This was carried out by a group of 3 people entering the hotel, and they working, using 1 as a decoy, then the other 2 snatched my bag. When reporting it to the receptionist, I was told it happened all the time. Then as I was in a group of 24 people, some of my colleagues came down to help, and they started to search the CCTV footage. At this point the security guard was seen. I will add here that the deputy manager was extremely helpful, however, yet again the manager was around but did not come over to help out or apologise for what happened in his hotel. Considering this is a regular occurence I question why the security guard is not placed out into the reception area to watch the door from people able to come in and plan their attack. One other point to note was the lack of desire to contact the police. I was told to walk to the police station, but they were very unkeen to telephone the police to report the theft, until we insisted. The hotel is fairly new, rooms are well designed, but if you do decide to stay there watch your possessions. One might question the role of the manager, as there was no sign of enhancing security for the guests and no apology for what happened in his hotel, but a complaint that he was giving away free water. I would not recommend anyone books this hotel. Unfortunately I cannot show photos of the hotel as my camera was one of the possessions stolen. Spa facilities are at an extra cost! The outdoor swimming pool was small but useable.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAverage tourist hotel\u201d", "Author": "Vatikaki", "ReviewID": "UR46117800", "Content": "We stayed there for four nights and it was quite adequate and nicely located close to a bus stop and about 700m from a Metro. It was however in the part of town that used to be the industrial area so parts of it was not that great. The room was nice and quite modern with a nice bathroom (with a proper shower). We may stay there again in future as it was quite cheap.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roaming", "Title": "\u201cBottom Line..

The hotel is new, clean and spotless. It is extremely well designed and the interior decors are fascinating. This was our first time in Barcelona and upon arriving to the hotel the lovely staff explained the essentials we needed to know about the city, metro system and nearby attractions. The rooms are just about the right size unless you are really in search for a spacious room. The bathroom area is large and it is equipped with a nice rain shower. Bathrooms are really lovely and the doors are shaded but they don't guarantee you fully privacy. Our booking came with a breakfast which included a variety of choices. The outside area , which is adjacent to the restaurant, can be used for dining. It is gorgeous with woody floors and a cabana-style setting. Since we were on our own, we inquired about many things and the staff did not save any efforts to guide us, and that was something we really appreciated. WiFi is also free. There are two metro stations close to the hotel, about 10 minutes of walking distance. The hotel is also situated close to the beach ~ about 20 minutes away. We did not use the pool but some of us used the spa and they loved it. they said it is modern and also very well taken care of. The neighborhood is not bad, another hotel is actually located just across the street, but you must also be aware of your surroundings as it is the case in almost any place you would visit.", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel & Spa Villa Olimpica Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1536366-Reviews-Hotel_Spa_Villa_Olimpica_Suites-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$117 - $239*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Pallars 121-125</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08019</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1536366", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/af/4c/af4c66f161aeab01dcb0c26fe641f9b45large.jpg"}}
