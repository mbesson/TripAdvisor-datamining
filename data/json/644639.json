Yes it was super king and spacious, but it was far from being comfortable. Mattresses these days are very comfortable, people who said the mattress on Suite 33 is comfortable certainly have never slept on \"comfortable\" mattresses. Other than that the \"suite\" was actually a very nice room, spacious, very clean and very well lit. However, the bathroom, though very large, needed more lights, it was rather dark. Amenities was minimal, but we expected that considering the rate was not very expensive. There was a little kitchen area with microwave, stove and even dish washer, but no utensils whatsoever. I guess originally, they were designing the suites for long stay guests. The street was noisy, a lot of noisy drunk people at night, there were a few striptease joints on the street and it can get a little 'Bronxy'. I didn't mind though, because again, it was cheap. it was close to a lot of things but I could feel that it was not on the safest street in Madrid. If I have a teenage kid, I wouldn't let him or her roaming around the area alone. All in all it was a very good value for money, pity the bed was very hard and uncomfortable.

If you don't like walking, the hotel is close to both metro and bus routes, but we found that the taxis in Madrid were surprisingly cheap - five euros from the hotel to El Prado, for example. Taxis from the airport to Suites33 came to about 40 euros each way. The bedrooms and bathrooms are spacious and clean, and the kitchen well equipped except, bizarrely, for a complete lack of crockery, cutlery, pots and kettles! The staff are extremely helpful and will provide you with a tourist map of Madrid and directions. A hotel 50 metres up the road provides a good buffet breakfast for 7 euros, and there are any number of good, reasonably priced restaurants nearby. Other reviewers have mentioned that the area near the hotel isn't the smartest, but Plaza de Espana and Gran Via are two minutes away, and there is a local police station almost next to the hotel. The area didn't bother us in the slightest and we had no problems.

The staff were helpful, especially Daniel on reception who recommended bars and restaurants and handed out free maps. This was a great base to explore Madrid and great for the price. Do be very careful on the Metro however when travelling to Madrid. It can be very busy and my friend got pickpocketed by what we think was a nasty little woman. Also, there are different stations for opposite directions of travel although these are called the same. It is quite confusing as only one station is marked on maps.

The hotel doesn't offer breakfast, but you have a kitchen in the room with microwave and fridge, so you can just buy some things (around) and make your own breakfast, or have it in one of the many places at the Gran Via.

As someone who has not traveled extensively through Europe, I heard that hotel rooms are often smaller, dirtier, and less modern than hotel rooms in the United States. Suites 33 was a pleasant surprise as it contradicted those notions completely! The room was spacious, with two double beds pushed together to form a single large bed. Our unit had a kitchen, complete with an empty refrigerator, stove top, microwave, sink, and plenty of cupboards. The only small part of the room was the bathroom, which was a bit cramped, but serviceable and clean nonetheless. While not 5-star modern, the room was fairly up-to-date. It sported a small flat-screen TV (with channels in English, French, Spanish, and German), marble floors, an updated bathroom, and a small balcony. Also nice was an easy-to-use personal safe; great for stashing away our cash Euros. (Madrid is known for pickpockets, so this was a great way to minimize our cash on-hand each day). The staff at the hotel were very friendly, and always greeted us when we entered or left. Most spoke great English. Housekeeping did a nice job each day tidying up the room daily. Lastly, the location is fairly convenient. It's on a small street near the Plaza de Espana and Calle Gran Via. It's a short walk to many centers including the Plaza Mayor, Puerto del Sol, La Latina, and other areas. The street has a few grocery stores on it, and an excellent Middle Eastern hookah and tea restaurant. Only two downsides. One is that the street itself can be a bit noisy late on Friday and Saturday night, but that's likely true anywhere since Madrid parties late. Two, the free WiFi internet at the hotel is spotty at best. Don't plan on going online much, if at all here. Bring a smartphone! Considering we got the room for about $120 (US) a night, no complaints here.

Despite the central location, it is in a quiet side street. We asked for and got a quiet room at the back of the hotel and we experienced no noise even on weekend nights when Madrid is at its busiest. The room was spacious, with a sleeping area, a kitchen area, a well fitted modern bathroom and an entrance hallway. The kitchen had a microwave, a fridge and a two ring electric cooker hob. However, there were no utensils provided. If you bring your own plastic cups, spoons and knives, and tea/coffee you will be OK. There are several mini-markets nearby where you can buy basics, including one next door to the hotel. The hotel seems to be in the Chinatown area so most shops are good for Chinese food, but a bit limited on more western things. A better mini-market is located just up the road toward Plaza Santo Domingo (out of hotel and turn right) about 3 minutes walk away, and for the best supermarket selection go another 3 minutes walk from Santo Domingo to Callao metro station where there is a very large department store \u2013 El Corte Ingles \u2013 which has a vast supermarket in its basement, with good value food and drink. There are numerous restaurants nearby. We enjoyed the Cafeteria Domingo, which is on Plaza Santa Domingo and had their \u201cmenu del dia\u201d, which was excellent for 10 euro (or 11.50 euro at weekends). Three courses plus bread and wine or water, with about 6 choices for each course. The place was usually very busy with locals, which is always a good sign. They seem only to deal in full bottles of wine so if there are two of you ask for one wine and one water \u2013 this will result in a full bottle of wine with an additional bottle of water. The local tourist sites such as the Royal Palace, Plaza Major, Puerta del Sol, Cathedral etc are all within easy walking distance and it is a short metro ride to the Prado area \u2013 or walkable if you have 20 minutes to spare. Have a look at the Templo de Debod which is located just on the far side of the Plaza Espana. This is an Egyptian temple given to Spain in thanks for its help in the raising of the Abu Simbel temple in Egypt, transported and re-erected in Madrid in a pleasant park setting. Well worth a visit and not on the main tourist route. The three staff we encountered on reception all spoke good English and were very helpful and friendly. The check-in was very efficient and we were made to feel very welcome \u2013 not always the case on arrival!.

The hotel itself is in the middle of the block on the right side of the street if you are walking up the hill. We arrived at 10:15 am on the 18th after traveling for about 12 hours and were told that the hotel's policy is no check-in before 2:00 pm so we could leave our bags but we could not gain access to our room. There really isn't a lobby so we couldn't even loiter if we wanted to. That was a little disappointing, but a policy is a policy. The woman at the front desk was very nice but did not speak any English, so I had the chance to shake the rust off my Spanish. There were two male front desk attendants that spoke English, one fairly well and the other comme ci comme \u00e7a. All were very friendly and cordial. The hotel is a few buildings down from the police station which was busy day and night. Muggings, assaults, drunken disorderly issues, prostitutes, drug problems etc. For those who don't know, Madrid is a major city and has all of the crime problems of every other major city around the world. It just so happens that if you stay in Suites 33, you are reminded of the problems every time you leave the hotel and head up hill. There is also a semi-seedy club a few doors up from the police station. The suite itself was a very nice and despite the busy area, very quiet. The suites has a full kitchen, full bathroom (shower and tub) and a king size bed. To note, power in the room requires your room key to be inserted into a slot near the door. This means when you leave the room, power to the refrigerator, heating/cooling and all other appliances is turned off when you remove your room key. Don't plan to store perishables in the refrigerator (or ask for an extra room key). There is an elevator if you don't like to walk stairs.

Mostly Spaniards stay at this hotel, an excellent sign I think. Just want to add one thing I didn't see in the other reviews. Being an American, I was not used to the limited hot water. If you have to wash your hair one day, and there are 2 of you, make sure your partner takes an extra quick shower. Mine took a normal one (about 10 mins), and I was stuck with a wet head for about an hour (takes that long for the individual tank in your room to heat up). Brrrr. Water pressure was great though. We tried another hotel recommended on Trip Advisor, Hotel Plaza Mayor, for a later leg of the trip. That one was more expensive and less modern inside, took awhile for hot water, less water pressure. So I would vote for Suites 33 between the two. Also, if you come by the Metro to Suites 33, there are lots of escalators for your baggage, so you don't have to drag it upstairs much. NOT SO with Hotel Plaza Mayor. My bull moose of a husband had to carry our heavy luggage all the way up LONG staircases - there was NOT ONE escalator in the Sol metro, nor in another nearby metro we tried (can't remember the name). Not everyone has a strong bull moose of a husband like I do, so beware. But you won't have this problem if you stay at Suites 33. PS This hotel is also only a 5 minute walk from fabulous flamenco, Cafe de Chinitas (see my review for tips). Another tip if you're a couple, ask for a \"matrimonio\" bed. (tiene una cama matrimonio?) That way you won't end up with 2 beds pushed together & made up separately, which we had at first till we requested they make them up as one bed.

As promised the rooms were spacious with nice high ceilings. The rooms were also very clean. I think the small kitchenette is probably for business travellors who come to Madrid for work during the week and perhaps don't eat out every night??? It is a great location especially for the palace. Madrid is also very easy to get about on foot so getting to the better areas for Tapas is ok. Only a small problem was that late at night there were girls stood in doorways of underground clubs which looked a bit dodgy. There were also alot of males stood around in Plaza domingo (possible pimps). Even with this both me and my fellow travellor did not feel uneasy as there is a main police station on the street. Another guest in the Hotel did not see this side of the street at night but they mainly turned left out of the hotel and went via grand Via. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. staff are also very helpful and speak good english.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't Fault it!\u201d", "Author": "SarahCharles", "ReviewID": "UR18076072", "Content": "Would deffo stay here again - no problem. Great location just round the corner from the Gran Via, the subway, the tourist bus stop for Madrid Vision. Rooms are modern and have a kitchenette. Take your own kettle though cos although there's a sink, fridge, microwave and hob, there's no utencils. Out of the hotel and either way you'll find corner shops selling everything you want and a cash point turn left. No breakfast as the hotel has only a reception but turn left for Starbucks or right for the 4* hotel which does brekkie. Take the Madrid Vision bus which costs 20 euros for 2 days and you'll see everthing. Don't eat in Plaza Mayor cos the food's rubbish and there are so many other lovely restaurants in the side streets.

We took the metro from the airport and got off the Plaza Espana stop. From the metro stop, it's a quick walk...under 3 mins I would say. There's not signs outside the hotel so you have to keep your eyes open and look for it. even on our last day, I would still just walk right past the front door sometimes. The hotel is comfortable and cozy. The rooms are very new with much more amenities than most European hotels in that class. The beds were big and comfortable. Nice, clean and newer comforters. The bathroom was a good size and the shower worked perfectly. There's a kitchen area, equipped with a fridge and microwave. We couldn't quite get connected to their wifi though. that was major bummer. The hotel was one block from Gran Via, major shopping and good for a quick bite. Within walking distances to Puerta del Sol, plaza mayor. Everythign else is a quick ride on the metro w/ many stops very near to the hotel. It gets a bit noisy at night, esp w/a street facing room. There are several bars on the street, so ppl do talk loudly and since madrid has such an active nightlife, it's something you have to put up with. But I mean other than that, I'd def recommend the place. The staff tried their best to help us to the best of their ability. I'd recommend to eat a bit farther away.
