We had 2 separate stays at Albergo Cesari: the first 2 nights of our trip and the last 2 nights. Firstly, what was good about both stays, is the location and the staff, just as other reviews have said, so I won't go on too much about that. The staff are professionals, and they care. There was one thing in particular that really impressed us, which was the return of my wife's camera that she had left in the lobby when we left after our first stay. It was handed back to her when we checked in for our second stay. Very much appreciated. Now, the differences. If this review was based on our first stay experience, then I would be raving to you about the spotless room, the upscale furniture in the room, the fact that every mechanical thing in the room worked properly: all the latches, drain plugs, lights and switches, etc, etc. The cleanliness in particular was commendable, as my wife really notices the little things. If this review was based on our second stay, several days later, then it would be almost the opposite. The room was on a different floor, had crappy furniture that didn't work properly, showed much more wear, and my wife noticed the bits swept into the corners of the floors. Worst of all, the room reeked of Fabrize, but we soon came realize it wasn't just our room, but the entire hotel that had a musty smell to it (heating system perhaps?). I know the staff were dealing with it the best they could, and it was likely something out of their control. Still though... Would I stay there again? Yes, definitely I think.

The comfortable room was simply furnished with no unnecessary luxury. There\u2019s a TV, wardrobe, desk with minibar (with the compliments of the staff), coffee and tea facilities, two chairs and a very good clean bed. What else do you need after a long day stroll in Rome? The bathroom is spacious with a very powerful shower and everything you need for your stay. Blankets, pillow slips and a sheet are changed daily. You can control the airco by yourself with the control panel on the wall. The room was kept very clean. If you have a room at the street side you can have inconvenience of the buzzing people late in the evening or from the trash men collecting the empty bottles from the restaurants in the early morning. Even when the windows and shutters are closed. In the morning they serve a very good continental breakfast at the wonderful roof garden from 07.00 till 10.30 a.m. There\u2019s something for everyone. Fruit juice, coffee, choice of cheese and meats etc. The garden is also opened from 18.00 till 24.00 again as a rooftop bar. The hotel has no restaurant, but there are a lot of restaurants in the surrounding area. For instance directly opposite the entrance of the hotel. If you need more, behind the fountain at the left end of the square in front of the Pantheon you find a small Spar supermarket in the side street. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. This is really a very good three star hotel. There is really nothing to complain about. Otherwise book a more expensive hotel with more stars. When you arrive at the Roman airport there are a lot of companies who bring you to your hotel by minibus. You\u2019ll find them in the arrival hall. You can also make reservation by internet in advance f.i. by Viator. A one way trip costs \u20ac 20,-- p.p. a taxi around \u20ac 55,-- till \u20ac 65,--.

I cancelled the one at Barberini, and I'm very, very glad to say I made the correct decision to stay at Albergo Cesari. The location of the hotel is SUPERB and is easily walkable to all of the sights.....3 minutes to the Pantheon, 10 minutes to Piazza Navona or the Trevi Fountain the other way, 15 minutes to Piazza Venezia or the Spanish Steps, just under 20 minutes to the Colosseum, and you can get to the Vatican in less than 30 minutes. I live in New York, so walking is the way to go, and that's true for Rome too. It turns out that my friend and I only used the Metro once to do the Appian Way and Catacombs, so staying by the Metro was unnecessary...and it's boring around Barberini at night. The rooftop terrace at Cesari is great for breakfast and wonderful later in the day for a drink or just to get out of the room and \"hear\" Rome. One evening, a woman sang arias in the campo beneath the hotel that added to the whole experience (she was good by the way). The hotel's concierges were very helpful in all that we threw at them, even the bartenders on the roof obliged us our many requests for ice. We want to give a special thanks to Bernardo for helping us get our boarding passes printed for our flight home. The room was typical and ordinary (we were happy to have access to the roof), but very clean and comfortable. Why would you want to spend your time in your room anyway...you're in Rome!!

If that is what you are seeking, this is not the hotel for you. For the price we paid and the service we received, we could not have done better. The rooms and bathrooms, although small, were very clean. The interior of the hotel is relatively quiet. Due to the hotels location on a busy side street, the rooms at the front end of the hotel are noisier than those in the back. The shutters did help block out this noise. The morning after our arrival, the room was so dark and quiet that we overslept....and, I am a light sleeper. The hotels location is perfect. Snce we are in good health, we walked all over the city. Even if you are not fond of walking any distances, most of the sites are within short walking distance and taxis are readily available. The hotel is more than willing to order one for you. They arrive quickly. With the high price of hotels in Rome, breakfast included is a great draw. A continental buffet breakfast was served every morning on the hotel's rooftop. It was more than ample and delicious. It included many different varieties of pastries, cereals, fruits, juices, meats and cheeses. Soft boiled eggs were also included. The cofffee was fabulous and the milk is served hot. We were cruising after our visit to Italy so, we did not want to handle so many bags while traveling to Tuscany. The hotel kept our extra unlocked bags in their locked facility. We heard so many stories about theft in Rome. Obviously, we were a little uneasy leaving them. Upon returning to the hotel, our bags were delivered to our room and all was exactly intact and as they had been left. The owner of this hotel should be particularly proud of its' staff. Those at the front desk were so helpful with everything from restaurant recommendations to directions. Wish,my Italian was half as good as their English.

The front desk staff was friendly and all spoke English very well; they were also kind enough to give us access to our room upon our early arrival around 9:30 am. Hotel staff also quickly arranged a taxi to the train station upon our departure, which surprised us by pulling up directly in front of the hotel in the pedestrian area. We had already learned, however, that the pedestrian-only signs are mere suggestions in Rome, not requirements. The most remarkable feature of the hotel is the rooftop terrace where guests enjoy a plentiful breakfast, including the best hotel coffee (by far) that we experienced on our trip. The buffet was generous, with cold cuts, pastries, cereals, yogurt, fruit and more that varied a little each day to keep things interesting. The terrace also doubles as a wine bar in the evening, and it was a perfect place to relax after a long day of sight seeing and before restaurants opened (\"real\" Italian restaurants don't open for dinner until 7 or later; the ones that are open at 5:30 are generally catering to tourists and not as good). It was so peaceful on the terrace, and weather was perfect for us, so it gave us a chance to unwind and discuss all the exciting events of the day. Service at the wine bar was sketchy -- it was very hard to get the attention of the waiter at first -- but once we had our first glasses of wine we were showered with small snacks (olives, chips, cheese) and regular offers of refills. I have attached a photo showing a small portion of the roof terrace. We highly recommend Albergo Cesari. If you visit, there is a good and fairly authentic restaurant in the piazza in front of Saint Ignatius, located behind the building where the hotel is located. The restaurants directly in front of the hotel are geared to tourists, and while the food was relatively cheap and available when we were hungry early (5 pm), the quality was not great and our waiter \"accidentally\" shorted us a significant amount of change (10E / $15). We ultimately resolved this, but would advise travelers to take the time to find a better option for dinner.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Ky", "Title": "\u201cLove this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Anneeby", "ReviewID": "UR46449824", "Content": "Best location, quiet, friendly, clean, big spotless bathroom, perfect rooftop location for breakfast, excellent attentive staff.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFriendly hotel located in the historic centre with fabulous roof deck overlooking the neighbouring area.\u201d", "Author": "MertonKidd", "ReviewID": "UR46327997", "Content": "The hotel is situated between the Trevi fountain and the Pantheon within easy walking distance of the main sights in the historical centre and has been in the same family for 3 generations.

Yes it is noisy at night but you are in the middle of a city with lots of traffic(although the hotel is in a quiter side street) but the hotel has double glazed windows and if you are hyper sensistive sound proof shutters on the inside.

I did a lot of research on the various hotels in Rome as there is so many to choose from and I believe it can be a hit or miss to pick somewhere good. We had a lovely spacious room, which was extremely clean as was the bathroom (although it could do with some updating). Although there was a lot going on in the streets below, when you closed the shutters, you could hardly hear anything. The breakfast room was pretty small but there was a good selection of meats, cheeses, breads, cereals etc to set you up for the day ahead. The hotel's location is superb. On arriving, we left our luggage in our room and went for a wander, what a surprise as we rounded a corner within a few minutes of leaving the hotel, and there, in front of us, was the Trevi Fountain all lit up at night. We walked everywhere, even to the Vatican and the Colloseum. With the Pantheon and Piazza Navona within minutes in one direction and he Spanish Steps in the other, what more could you ask for? There is also a beautiful wooden toy shop on the street leading from the hotel to the Pantheon, well worth a visit, even if you don't have kids!!! We were also exceptionally lucky in that we got to shake hands with Pope Benedict. Due to the time of year we were there (August), he was holding his general audiences on a Wednesdays in the audience hall which is situated to the left hand side of St Peter's Square. We had some \"inside information\" and we were advised to go really early to queue which we did at around 7am, and we weren't the only ones, there were already a couple of hundred people there. The audience was due to start at 10am. We were advised to get seats nearest the aisle as possible as the Pope on the previous week had walked down and shaken peoples hands. We were lucky enough to get next to the aisle and true enough, the pope shook our hands on the way down. One word of warning for all tourists in Rome, ensure your money and valuables are secured on your person. I had heard that pickpockets were rife and this seemed to be the case, especially on public transport, we saw someone trying to steal out of a ladies handbag on the bus we were on going to Termini.

Operated since 1787, it is housed in a brown-stuccoed building (complete with some missing exterior plaster) a short block south of busy Via del Corso, the main street between Piazza Venezia and Piazza del Popolo, and on the main pedestrian route between the Fontana di Trevi and Pantheon (each about 5 minutes away). The area is filled with restaurants and shopping. A 15 minute walk north will take you to the fancy designer stores and eating establishments near the Spanish Steps and 10 minutes west is Piazza Navona with more expensive cafes. Just south of the latter is Campo de Fiore, with lots of fruit, vegetable, and clothing stands as well as cafes. Equidistant from the hotel is the Roman Forum area which sits just south of Piazza Venezia. The Vatican is on the west side of the river, about a 30 minute brisk stroll from the hotel. We walked everywhere, only taking a cab from our rental car drop-off point in the parking lot of Villa Borghese to the hotel and from the hotel to the airport (the front desk staff arranged a limo for us and he was a delight, a friendly limo driver with fine English skills). The hotel decor is conservative and a bit dull, the formal wood furniture and long draperies and bedspreads in striped green and yellow matching well with the wooden floors. Our room was very large and could actually accommodate two other guests with the chairs that open into beds. Windows were provided with heavy panes and shutters that worked well to keep out the noise and light (while one street in front of the hotel is strictly pedestrian, the adjacent Piazza di Pietra and other streets do serve motorscooters, taxis, and some other vehicles, so there is city noise, including the early morning when the street sweepers come out). There was plenty of storage space in a wardrobe and drawers. The bathroom was a bit dated but very clean; the hot water was slow to develop in the morning when everyone was waking up. The halls kind of wander around with steps here and there, but an elevator is provided to eliminate most, if not all of them, depending on your room location. The breakfast room on the 1st floor has 10 small tables; food consisted of cheeses, meats, fruit, breads, and pastries. Staff was friendly and very professional, making restaurant suggestions and reservations if asked. A computer in the lobby was available for guest use (sign up at the front desk to gain access to it), but was popular and not always unoccupied. Make sure you walk one block south of the hotel to see the charming Piazza Sant'Ignazio which looks like a freshly-painted stage set and the Galleria Alberto Sordi just northeast of the hotel, which is a handsome, recently-restored interior shopping \"mall\". The Colosseum, a 30 minute walk away, is well worth a visit; make sure to save time to look at the museum located on the upper arcade near the elevators, which has a nice selection of Greek and Roman building ornamentation, stone friezes, and pottery. The city is fun to walk; we even happened to be in the Piazza San Pietro when the Pope was making his Wednesday late-morning blessing of the crowd. And as we were leaving on our last day, a large crowd was peacefully gathering with colorful banners at the prime minister's residence a block away in support of farmers.

It's also a great place to shop (Navona not restaurant) All the artists are there daily selling some beautiful water colours, you can also buy various gifts from the sellers there. Rome is an expensive city in general but as long as you know that you won't be too shocked. One word of warning though, beware the roads, the drivers do not seem to know what zebra crossings are for or indicators and crossing the road can be scary as they also drive fast. We were even nearly knocked down by a couple of nuns in a car flying across a zebra crossing at the Vatican while we were trying to cross with our little boy in his buggy.

The room is well appointed and everything works. The staff are pleasant and one of the women in the breakfast room is a delight. It is an oasis in central Rome. When the heat of summer gets to you, just go back home in a few seconds and have a rest. Internet is free and when they say they are ordering a taxi it arrives [unlike some other experiences we had]. It's a fantastic spot for a Roman affair! Don't waste time on other places.", "Date": "August 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton Canada", "Title": "\u201cIdeal Location and Very Spacious\u201d", "Author": "McDocEdmontonCanada", "ReviewID": "UR2355091", "Content": "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here for five nights in late July, 2004.
