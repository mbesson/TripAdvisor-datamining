The location near Clot subway/train station is brilliant, two stops to the Sagrada Familia and five to the Catalunya main square. Buy a ten ticket pass for good value. You can also get the train to and from the airport to Clot (about 25 minutes and three Euro forty). We booked 'free' breakfast and wifi with our room - this was great value as they charge eight Euro for breakfast and it was good food that set you up for the day and decent coffee. The wifi is fine but you can only have one device connected at a time so that is a pain in an age of ipods, ipads and other devices all wanting wifi. Kind of odd that you also need to give a five euro deposit for the remote so that you can watch TV. All in all, great value.

The hotel is in convenient and quite location as the metro stops is 50m away and from there you go easily everywhere you want. We have to agree as well with other reviewers that the negative point is the hot water in the shower as it is very difficult to adjust it and for hot water some times You may have to wait for couple of minutes until to come and then you have to adjust almost all time.

We did not use the TV as one had to pay a deposit for the remote. We didn't want to be bothered as we found this out later on in the evening.

However if you don't have your own, be aware that there is a fee to use the hotel computer. It was explained to me by the front desk that the hotel doesn't own this computer service and it is like the vending machines. We used an internet cafe which was only one bock away as the rate at the hotel was high. The hotel is located in a quiet area but there are some restaurants near by.

You receive a free map of Barcelona at check-in, but you don't need it to find the Sagrada Familia, which is only a 15min walk away. :-) A metro stop is also conveniently in the street behind the hotel. The only negative remark I have is that, if you have a room on the front side of the hotel, it can get noisy because of the traffic.
