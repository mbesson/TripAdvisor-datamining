{"Reviews": [{"Content": "really wnderful! In june we stayed three nights at the ulun ubud. a smal hotel with all seprate bungalows lying on a hill with a really magnificent view ont he green rivervalley it is laid at. With a large veranda youheard nothing else than silence. And it is a charming hotel: not the buzz of a 5star hotel, and yet it has everything, including pool and massage/spa service.And a very friendly staff that took all time for a chat etc. And the shuttle service to Ubud-city is also good: at any time we could ask for it! Beacause of this all we rateit with a 8,5. We will beback some day!", "Date": "Jun 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR587871085", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "dutchboys"}, {"Content": "Surprise package.. a beautiful resort       Honeymoon suite", "Date": "Feb 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR914477637", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "abhiduge"}, {"Content": "Perfect Hideaway this place is gorgeous....the views are speactacular and gives u such a peaceful feeling....the furniture is antique balinese so u feel like ur in a different time n place....breakfast at your balcony, the privacy and the view of the valley, really divine n ultra romantic....i'm going to bali again next month n was thinking to try out a new place....but can't resist ulun abud....so, what the hell....the way the rooms are set up, u can;t see anyone else from ur balcony, n vice versa.....recommended it to my mates n they are still raving about it :)", "Date": "Dec 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR801498346", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fariny"}, {"Content": "Heavenly The most gorgeous hotel grounds that I have ever encountered. Nothing short of magical. This hotel perfectly captures the mood of Ubud in its sinous stair paths that harmonize with the th river valley below. We also stayed at the Uma in Ubud, which was three times the price, but had none of the charm of the Ulun. It wasn't a five star hotel, I would call it a four. It was so quiet and peacful there and served delicious red brem, a cloudy sweet local rice wine upon our arrival. We stayed in the cheapest room, standard. The bathroom wasn't great, but it was very clean, just not as stylishly antique as the rest of the property.", "Date": "Aug 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR580878383", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "benwvl"}, {"Content": "Lovely little hideaway!       pool  views", "Date": "Jul 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR642127551", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Kacenka"}, {"Content": "Gorgeous Resort       Breakfast at balcony.", "Date": "May 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR811557805", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Ranggii"}, {"Content": "Fantastic resort Ulun Ubud is an amazing resort with a ton of character. The rooms are set in individual cottages. We got a balcony that overlooked rice patties. The service is fantastic and the free breakfast is very good. The resort offers a free shuttle to Ubud. Before arriving, I was concerned that this would mean the resort was very far (20+ min) away from the heart of Ubud, but it is only a short 5 min drive which is actually better since it adds to the privacy. We stayed 2 nights and spent the 3rd night at the Sheraton in Nusa Dua because we had a free room. The Sheraton paled in comparison and we mourned having left Ulun Ubud. I would most definitely stay again.", "Date": "Feb 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR753378097", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Wonderful View! Loved the unique hotel and the view. This was our first time in Bali so we didn't know what to expect but we were so glad we stayed here. The hotel drives you and picks you up from the city centre and even waited for us to buy a stone statue so they could take it back with them so we wouldn't have to lug it around. They were so accommodating. I would have given it 5 stars but I didn't love the washroom. The shower was great but there was no shower curtain so the water does splash a bit. Other than that the hotel is great - highly recommend it!", "Date": "Oct 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR514663709", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "rgirn"}, {"Content": "a breath-taking landscape       room 1/2", "Date": "Aug 15, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR563604284", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Ulun Ubud - good value! O.k. Just got back from Bali on May 25, 2005.Have stayed in several places.Ulun Ubud is good reasonably priced accomodation.Have stayed there 3 x (Jan. 2002, Aug. 2002, and May 2005).Consistent quality. Here's what you need to know.For a good overview of what you're getting, go to their website, (---)The present manager, Dewa (Made) Warsa, is a quiet and very accomodating host. He is also very honest so take what he says as true.Despite the posted rates, you can do better in the off season. July and August, and December and January are high season there.We got a rate of US$55 for two, and US$70 for three in May 2005.The resort has 28 villas but not all villas are equal.The place is built on a steep ravine which is both spectacular and very quiet. But if you have trouble with stairs (lobby to swimming pool is 98 steps by my count), reserve an upper level room (there was an 82 and 79 year old couple there in May -- no problem with the upper level suite). Most suites have a private balconey where they will serve your breakfast (included in room rate) if you request.The honeymoon suite is one level below the pool and really private but add another 14 steps.The staff port your luggage for you no matter where you stay. If you don't mind walking a flight or two of stairs, then by far the BEST ROOM (I think) in the place is Suite 407. Right above the pool.The honeymoon suite is also very good; despite the fact that the bathroom has one wall open to the outdoors (the shower is outdoors overlooking the ravine), there is complete privacy there and no bugs!So here is my choice of the best rooms in order of preference:Upper Level (10 steps to lobby), Suite 302, 411, 304Mid Level (2 flights of stairs to lobby), Suite 407, 405, 406, 408Bottom Level (lots of stairs) Suite 102 right beside poolLowest Level (can you say Himilaya?) Suite 101 Honeymoon suite.All rooms are a/c and have ceiling fan. Set Breakfast included in room price is:choice of orange, pineapply, mango juice (or mixed)OR fruit plate, andeggs (scrambled, fried, omlette), andtoast (white or brown), andcoffee or tea. And, you can order pancakes, or other items a la carte. There is a million little touches that add to the value:For breakfast they bring each of you a pot of coffee (2 1/2 to 3 cups), the bring to your room each day a bottle of water per person; the rooms have a fridge, each room comes with a basket of fruit; they turn down your bed, change sheets each day; give you shampoo and soap in little ceramic bottles and keep you well stocked.The resort is located in Sanggingan, about 2 km west of Ubud's four corners (but you will think you are simply in Ubud). They have a free shuttle to take you into town and pick you up (which is on a demand basis; you call/ask they drive), except during high season when it operates on a more or less continous 20 minute loop.For transport from the airport in Denpassar, arrange your ride in advance by email to the Ulun Ubud (--- or ---). The BEST driver to get is I Nyoman Rusma of meta sari transport (you call him nyo/man). You can also contact him direct ((tel --- fax ---) but make all arrangements through the resort is easiest. Expect to pay IDR150,000 for a one way transport (US$15.) You will get a driver who speaks relatively good English, is very polite and respectful, as quiet or as chatty as you want to be, an immaculately clean vehicle with good fully adjustable a/c and a good view -- you ride high up -- he drives a sort of mini SUV -- and you get a good smooth ride. He will likely have a cooler with compentary soft drinks and bottled water on ice for you too. Tell him you got your name from Mr. Robert from Canada; he will treat you well (and, no, I don't get a percentage). For a suggested itinery and other Ubud info. see my reply to Ulun Ubud or Kamandalu in the Bali forum section in May 2005.For those looking to rough it a little, around the corner from the Ulun Ubud is another resort which is cheaper and more authentic (the windows have no glass and there is no a/c) and you sleep under mosquito netting. It is clean, the food is good and authentic. The view is superb and they do have a modern pool. Sayan Terrace Resort is located beside Amandari Resort (Amankila Resort's sister) so you are getting a US$800 view for maybe 1/20th the price. Sayan Terrace is set on another ravine with the high ground between the two ravines holding both Sayan Terrace and Ulun Ubud though they face in opposite directions. (Sayan Terrace is in the village of Sayan, Ulun Ubud in the village of Sanggingan; either place you are basically in Ubud about 2 km from the palace.)Ask for Ratih at the front desk for all your needs (she speaks Balinese, Indonesian, English and French).One more thing about Indonesia in general.Arriving at Denpassar airport, you will need to have US$25. per person for a visa if you are staying more than (I think it's) 3 days, or (I think) US$15. for 3 days or less. There is no place to change money before the visa counter!Departing Denpassar airport, you will need to have IDR100,000 (about US$10.) There are lots of places to change money before paying the exit fee.Change all of your money before you leave as it can be difficult to impossible to convert IDR once you are out of Indonesia. Inside Indonesia, exchange rates vary from money changer to money changer, sometimes by up to 10%!The airport gives a fair rate but you can do better and worse elsewhere in Ubud.", "Date": "May 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR980638754", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Rob1"}, {"Content": "Tropical hideaway A tranquil retreat of 22 cottages, with views across a palm lined valley, nestled on a hill leading down to the swimming pool.

Accomodations are romantic, though the bathroom amenities could be improved. Take your own shampoo/conditioner and hair dryer. The service is excellent, with happy faces everywhere.
