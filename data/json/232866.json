We needed overnight stay for Rome before heading to the South of Italy and Hotel Center 123 passed OK to the task with relatively good value - booked by booking.com. There are some strange points about the hotel though - the staff at night not extremely friendly, yet it may be due to some language luck as the day portiere was pleasant and very helpful . Your hotel may be one out of three buildings (we actually stayed at #3 Hotel) and you do not know in advance which one is yours - do not rush to get in with you cases. The hotel we stayed (Hotel #3) in is reasonably clean state and has a lift to get to the floor with the luggage. Yet announced minibar and TV was not functioning - minibar is empty and off and for TV remote you need to leave 20 euro deposit, which was funny enough. We have not used AC as it was not needed - no comments on this. The room itself is relatively poor with some vintage furniture inside, yet large enough for one night stay. However the bath room with shower inside is claustrophobic indeed - you should be very careful in both bathroom and in shower cabin itself not no hurt yourself. Breakfast is Rome simple - some sweet rolls, hot drinks and juices at the lovely terrace overlooking the backyard garden. You may book the day trips and bus excursions from the reception, which is almost standard at any Rome hotel.

We booked here because we were lucky to get anything in Rome for the price we needed. However for what it is it's not too bad, and the stay was acceptable, despite the rooms. We stayed at the start of June when there was a United Nations conference going on in the city. 2500 people booking out many city centre hotels completely meant a lack of rooms anywhere. We had to go on those same days but by the time that we booked there really wasn't much available. We booked the Hotel Center after reading reviews on here. I thought it looked ok - but it was basically either a hotel of this genre or something ridiculously expensive which we couldn't afford. We got to the hotel mid afternoon and they let us check straight in. The check in staff were nice and friendly and they let us go straight up to the hotel. On a morning they were also nice and friendly when going to breakfast (a simple buffet). They were also nice and friendly when returning late at night and pestering them to get your key from the office (they need to be left but the office is open 24 hours). However the disappointment was the rooms. We had one double and one single room. The double wasn't too bad. The bathroom door had been broken by a guest and repaired - an amateur job but it worked. It was also missing the remote for the TV and the curtains but other than that it was ok. The single room however was a little worse. The wall alongside the bed had obviously been damp or covered in mould at some time by the look of it, there was some mould on the ceiling of the bathroom too and it was really small. However nothing really caused a problem we just took it as it was. Breakfast is a simple continental buffet - bread/toast, ham, cheese, cakes, cereal, yoghurt, tea / coffee etc. It's basic but filling and available from 7am which helps for getting into the city to see the sights. Location wise the hotel is only 10 minutes walk from the Termini station. The direct route isn't desirable at night as it's badly lit but just walk one block down the road next to the hotel and walk up there to the station and it's well lit. It's also only 20 minutes walk from the colosseum and around the corner from many nice restaurants. Overall this hotel wasn't bad considering all of the circumstances, but I would recommend looking elsewhere if you get a chance.

The television which we had paid a deposit for was broken and despite daily promises from hotel staff that it would be fixed, it never was. The lights are on some sort of sensory device where they only turn on when people walk past them, not always very safe as there are quite a few steps and different levels and if your eyesight is not that great in the dark I wouldn't recommend it. I really did not feel very safe walking about at night in the area where the hotel was situated (right opposite the train station) and got taxis to and from the center after dark. It is also quite a walk from the the centre of Rome and we often found it very tiring walking back after being out all day as it is on a slight incline from the centre (fine if your fit enough I might add). The really poor thing I found about this hotel was the complete lack of any customer satisfaction. We tried to lodge a complaint against a member of staff who had literally bawled at us for changing our check-out date due to our flight into Rome being cancelled at the last minute (when we phoned the hotel from our home in Scotland we were assured that this would be no problem yet when we arrived at the hotel they claimed this not to be the case and we had to pay cash in hand for the room again when we had already paid for it online), yet no one was at all interested and we felt like all they were concerned with was taking our money. I really wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, next time I go to Rome I will be going somewhere closer to the center oh and just a tip if you are staying in this area make sure not to get ripped off by taxi drivers as you get off the bus from the airport (it drops you off by the train station) agree a fare with the driver before you get in.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNot recommended at all\u201d", "Author": "kiwihopper", "ReviewID": "UR5581337", "Content": "I booked this hotel through my agent who booked it through a hotel website.
