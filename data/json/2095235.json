The only problem we had was that the room that was given to us in the first place was basically ..in the basement. Therefore : only a small window at the ground level, with no view, impossible to see the sky. We were very unhappy and asked to have another room. The staff felt sorry for us, but couldn't do anything as the hotel was fully booked. However, the promised to give us another room the day after for our 2nd night. We just had to pack our luggage and leave it in the room in the morning, it would be transferred by them to our new room. Which was done: we had a room on the highest floor and even had a free bottle of white wine with a handwritten apology note. For me, service is the most precious point in luxury, and the way they dealt with all this was perfect. Otherwise, the hotel is very nicely decorated, the bed is comfortable, the bathrooms are nice, the breakfast is very good (buffet + possibility to order a lot of other meals for free). I just think that no hotel of that level and price should have rooms in at the -1 level... that's why my mark is 4/5 and not 5.

I was immediately impressed with the decor and the modern conveniences of this remodeled old building. Very cool. I booked an Executive Room (as it was all that was available). It had everything I needed for my week stay. The room I was given was on floor 2 and faced the back of the hotel. It was very quiet and I never heard another guest during my entire stay, although I know the hotel was quite booked. The bed and bedding were exceptionally clean and comfortable. The bathroom had a fantastic overhead rain shower head that really felt great. I found everything I needed as both a business traveler and a vacationer. In room safe, coffee maker, two tv's, great wifi internet. It should noted that the staff at the JL 76 is extremely friendly and helpful. Anytime I had questions or required assistance. The front desk was more like a concierge desk. Outstanding! Two other fantastic options with this hotel. First the honor bar. It is a small area that let's you come in and relax with a drink anytime. This was incredibly convenient with the odd hours I was keeping during this trip. This was a major plus. Also, the small restaurant made the most incredible pancakes (and other items) in the morning. Lots of different options, my favorite were the banana pancakes! The food was top notch. I didn't try for any other meals but ate a wonderful breakfast here every morning I stayed. Look for packages that include breakfast for additional savings. Overall, I'm going back to the JL 76.

Not quite. And too expensive.\u201d", "Author": "spartac", "ReviewID": "UR117937620", "Content": "This was the last hotel of our 3 week and some vacation in Europe. I wanted it to end on a high note, so I took the best room category available (room 201) in this ``Boutique Hotel``. Disappointment. I am not sure when this hotel opened but it doesn't seem to be a fully oiled machine. For example, on check in, the front desk person seems more interested in getting us processed than anything else (and there was no line up). No info on hotel, what's included or not (I had to ask). No map. She gave us only one key, I had to ask for a second. One other time I asked the person at the reception what was the best way to get to the Airport he had no clue. Eventually another member of the staff helped but I would expect even a junior person to be able to help (or find) this basic info. The room: was clearly made to look design hotel. But I had quite a few issues with it. First: it wasn't small as such but all the furniture was suffocating the room. We had one armchair too many. One would have been a lot better, instead of the second one blocking access to the balcony. The room didn't have any airy (let's not even talk minimalistic) feel. And speaking of balcony: quite uninviting. Wooden camping-like small chairs. The bathroom was the perfect example of ```smells like a boutique hotel, but isn't one``. The shower looked neat, with an interesting only half door covering the shower. Interesting. Until you start taking the shower and the water gets in the bathroom. There is no slope so it just stays there until you wipe it. Worse: there was no tablet to put the soap and the shampoo. There was a metallic arm sticking out of the wall, so I thought they were supposed to have those two in one soap/shampoo bottles and just forgot to put one. But it wasn't put on day two wither. So you really had to put all the things you need either on the floor or on the bath, one meter away. It really made no sense! And next to this you had an awesome feature like TV on the wall of the bathtub. Neat but honestly I would have preferred that they make the room functional instead of adding features. Bed? Real King size for once, rare in Europe. But only so so comfort. And the linens felt really cheap. It was too expensive. I paid an average of 195 Euro per night (One night at 150 euro and the other at 24o euro!) , no including breakfast. The area is quiet, but having stayed twice in the Museum neighborhood, I can tell you that it's a bit far off from most everything and a solid 40 min walk to the interesting areas, once you're done with the museums. Not a whole lot of interesting eateries or caf\u00c3\u00a9s around. All in all: Not all bad, beautiful hotel, but I don't recommend the place, and certainly won't return.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampere, Finland", "Title": "\u201cGreat boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "tervol1", "ReviewID": "UR117506465", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel JL No76 for 4 nights. We liked the hotel's location in the museum district. From Schiphol airport you can take the number 197 bus which stops just 2 blocks from the hotel. We found this easier than taking the train to Amsterdam Centraal and changing to tram from there. Getting from the hotel to the centre is a nice 10 minute walk or just a few minutes tram ride. In the neighbourhood there are some nice restaurants and shops so everything you need is basically within walking distance. Our executive room was on the 4th (top floor). There were some quirky things about the room that were more boutique design than practical. For example, the bathroom didn't have sinks. Instead, the sinks were located in the room right next to the bathroom and room door. Although slightly inpractical, this didn't bother us too much. The bathroom was otherwise excellent with a luxurious jacuzzi bathtub with a TV and a spacious shower. The hotel being practically brand new, everything was sparkling clean and fresh. The room had a Nespresso machine and we enjoyed the chance to have a nice cup of coffee in the room. A nice touch was also the honesty bar in the downstairs lobby where you could help yourself to some drinks. The breakfast was fantastic, the buffet catered for every basic need and there was also \u00c3\u00a0 la carte list for extras, such as delicious pancakes. We also ate one evening at the hotel, the food was quite basic but worth the price. One nice thing was also that tickets to the museums could be bought from the hotel, which saved us a quite a lot of time that would have been otherwise spent queuing outside the museums. The service was excellent and staff were always cheerful and happy to answer any questions we had. Overall, Hotel JL no76 is a nice luxury boutique hotel with great value for money.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic hotel which has the wow factor and staff to match\u201d", "Author": "nadeemcrowe", "ReviewID": "UR117036020", "Content": "I am currently staying in this hotel and yes... I have had some issues with my room but I have had my room swapped and I will take these issues up with the manager. However this was a matter of bad luck (sort of) and I don't want to take away from what a lovely hotel this is. First of all the area - well it is saying something when you walk out of the hotel and you can see the Louis Vuitton sign sparkling on the street adjacent. This is Amsterdam and its most upmarket with the most expensive shopping street in the city at your door. The street which is home to the hotel is on a small tree lined road parallel to the fashion district and is peaceful and pretty. When you arrive at the hotel it has that \"boutique\" feel you expect. Classy, kitsch and dressed with persian rugs and quirky contemporary art. In the reception is also the \"honesty bar\" - a not so mini mini bar for all guests to use, take what you want and write it down on a card which you then leave at reception to be billed for later. Now - the rooms. I stayed in the executive room. I walked in and my initially though was \"wow.\" Now I am a 25 year old solo traveller but I have stayed in some nice hotels across europe but I think this is my favourite. Clean, cool grey on the walls, simple and functional storage with plenty of room and a grand double bed with coco-matt mattress which really has that \"jump in\" allure. And then what every boy loves - GADGETS. A jacuzzi bath, build in high definition TV at the foot of the tub so you can catch up on CNN while the bubbles ease your tired legs. A nespresso machine to begin your day with a shot of caffeine and the best bit is everything works. I have stayed in endless hotels with gadgets galore but you turn the TV on and are met with a snowstorm. There are several english channels to choose from and the picture is crystal clear both in the bathroom and the widescreen in the main bedroom. To finish this review I would like to commend the hotel staff. The service is no doubt excellent and this is always best tested when you have a complaint. The issues with my room were dealt with superbly - there is a lesson to be learnt from many hotels by the way I was death with today. It makes such a difference when someone shows some understanding when you explain you have had a rough night. This hotel is perfectly placed and perfectly appointed. It makes your trip feel special and I would thoroughly recommend you stay here.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cquiet location\u201d", "Author": "william7093", "ReviewID": "UR115609162", "Content": "nespresso coffee maker in room very good , jacuzzi bath great for relax tv in bathroom , and big comfy bed , room was a little on small side but luxury makes up for that ,would stay again", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, great place, great location!\u201d", "Author": "ajdSingapore", "ReviewID": "UR115200763", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights recently, very friendly staff, top location, nice building, tastefully decorated rooms and loved all te art in the hotel.

With many of my fiends from US, Asia and Europe we all stayed in Hotel JL. First and foremost, the hotel is located in just a perfect spot, close to the Vondelpark (love my morning run), Amsterdam's version of Rodeo Drive is literally around the corner and the museums are around the other corner. Some of my friends being first timers to Amsterdam were absolutely falling in love with this neighborhood, also because it's less than 10 min walk to the Leidseplein and canal area. The hotel itself has a cool, contemporary elegance and feels very welcoming and relaxed. Some of my guests being frequent travelers said they would on their next visit to Amsterdam skip the big brand hotels and stay in Hotel JL. I personally think that the staff is really making all the difference in the world and one small example is: when we returned from a biking tour (on the hotel bikes) showing windmills, canals and all that: when we were parking all the bikes on our return at the hotel. The receptionist, her name was Cindy, came out with a tray of glasses with ice water for everyone. I was gobsmacked. A small gesture with a great impact. A throughout our stay the staff was making all guests feel at home. A great example of a boutique hotel with that sincere personal touch often difficult to find at the big brand hotels.

We stayed in a room on the 4th floor with nice views on the tree lined street. The room was small but with great attention to details! We didn't use our jacuzzi and TV set in the bathroom, but liked the rainshower a lot! Beds are heavenly, its a layered mattress with cocoa gras and they are super comfy!

It's in a quiet residential street, but still only steps away from the high end shoppingareas of Van Baerlestraate and P.J Hooftstraat. Trams 2 and 5 will take you to \"down town\" in only 5 minutes time (about 15 min to the central station) or you can walk to Leidseplein in about 7 minutes. I had a pleasant experience during my business trip. Good service from all staff members throughout the stay despite what others have experienced. The beds are actually some of the best hotelbeds I have ever slept in. I may have been upgraded as I reserved a standard room, but was surprised to see a jacuzzi with built-in TV in the bathroom(only in Executive rooms according to the website). My only critizism is that the mirror over the sink is put up way to high. I am avarage height, but could only see the upper half of my face while doing my make-up ... I know the Dutch are the tallest people in the world, but dont forget the rest of us : ) Had the breakfast one morning, and it had a more than sufficient variety of choices. It was possible to order pancakes, eggs of your choice etc. Did not try the restaurant or room service. I think this hotel deserves better than its current rating on Tripadvisor (Nr 242), but I believe this will get better as more guests rate this new hotel.
