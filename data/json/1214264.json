We were emigrating to Barcelona but in the process also had to work. So we picked a hotel with free parking and free internet - since we were also to be house-hunting, looking for somewhere to live in Barcelona. A little about the location first of all. Campanile Sud is located very close to a motorway junction off the A2 - slight problem when we were there because they were rebuilding the motorway exit thanks to the new Splau! shopping centre / Espanyol's new stadium complex. Campanile Sud is on the outskirts of Cornella, which in turn is on the outskirts of Barcelona, the other side of Montjuic. In terms of what we were looking for, Campanile fell slightly short in a couple of small but vital areas. Firstly we needed secure parking as we were moving house and our car contained all our belongings. Here they have limited free parking, in an open car park, or paid parking underground at 6 euros per day. This is not made particularly clear on their website. Secondly wifi is only really available in the lobby, in the rest of the hotel you have internet accessible via network cable. Not that either matters too much when the internet is as embarrassingly slow as it was at the hotel. It was fine (probably) for people holidaying - though why you'd want to holiday on the edge of an industrial estate is anyone's guess. For business purposes it was inadequate. The third problem was a cultural one. It was Sunday night when we arrived, it being fairly late we asked the receptionist to order a cab into town as we had to meet a business client. Not only is all of Spain closed on Sundays, cabs don't turn up either. An hour later, having been told we could wait in the street and hail one (hint - it was deserted, there were no cabs within a couple of miles) we stomped off to the train station and took a train from Almeda (10 minutes walk away) into Placa Espanya, eventually turning up 2 hours late for our meeting. I wouldn't mind but if the cab company are not co-operating feel free to tell as and we can make alternative arrangements... The cab issue wasn't that important, the parking issue was a little inconvenient but workable, the slow internet was, strangely, the killer. We found a flat in Barcelona fairly quickly and were able to check out a week early which is just as well as I would have lost at least one client if I had carried on staying there. Overall, I would recommend the hotel to friends but with the caveat that they go in with eyes open and understand that it may not be as plain-sailing as they might hope.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Serbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "okce", "ReviewID": "UR58703200", "Content": "The hotel is great.It's position is nearby metro station and you can come to the city for 10-15min.The hotel have one computer with internet in the reception lobby and in the lobby exists wi-fi.The rooms are great because hotel is new,and everything in it is new.The room is clean and towels are changed every day.The hotel staff are kind and helpful in every moment.Breakfast is ok.The Hotel have a restaurant which have great food and food isn't expensive as in the center.I would go to this hotel when I go back again to Barcelona.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Campanile Barcelona Sud Cornella Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1214264-Reviews-Campanile_Barcelona_Sud_Cornella_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$73 - $104*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Avenida Maresme, 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08940</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1214264", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/49/cd/49cdeec83b52591c7ceffed050417be93large.jpg"}}
