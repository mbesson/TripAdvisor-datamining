They tried to tell me they were mosquito bites but it was too cold and snowing out for mosquitoes. When I googled the bites, they were classic three in a row bed bug bites often referred to as breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, don't let the photos about the beds fool you. They are nothing but cots with a metal bar that curves upward down the middle. All of our backs screamed with pain each morning. It was like sleeping on a hill.

It is six storeys high and has a different hotel on each floor! We were on the third floor, accessed by a very compact lift, just about big enough for three people. The rooms are quite small, but we were there to see the sights so a decent bed to sleep in and the means to wash ourselves were all that was required, and the hotel amply provided them. The breakfast in the morning was sufficient to stave off hunger pangs well into the afternoon with plenty of cereals, fresh bread rolls, cheeses, jams etc etc. the location of the hotel, literally, a stones throw from the termini station was ideal. We bought a three day travel pass that gave unlimited travel on buses, trams and the metro, great value. If you want to see Rome you won't find a better location than the Marco Polo.

We were booked into the room behind the reception desk and next to the restuarant and this was very noisy due to the paper thin walls so we were woken as soon as the kitchen activities started and could hear every conversation until people stopped coming & going past reception. We requested a different room and the staff were helpful and found another room after another night. The next room was even noisier and it sounded like the people in the hotel above were in our bathroom. No problem, we knew the people above were leaving that day having heard their conversations so we thought it would get better. Next morning the water was cold in the shower and when we complained at reception they indicated that a lukecold (not even lukewarm) temperature was acceptable (this was in October). We immediately booked into a different hotel and were advised that we would have to pay the remaining 2 nights accommodation. I just want to say that we were happy to pay for our accommodation twice just so we could enjoy the rest of our stay in Rome.

We could, probably, move to the Marco Polo on Saturday when it should be repaired (this was on 28/12/2011 Wednesday and we were staying in Rome until 01/01/2012 Sunday) We went to The Tre Stelle Hotel ,one of about 5 in the building. It was actually ok, basic, but it suited our needs.Actually it looked better than The Marco Polo!! Now, you are probably thinking, why am i writing this then about The Marco Polo when we didnt stay there yea? Well, its because, like you are doing now, I read the Marco Polo Hotel reviews before we went to see what other people, who had stayed there, thought about it. And there was several that mentioned that they HAD to move to another Hotel/changed rooms owing for some reason, or other. Now perhaps I am old fashioned, or something, but when I book an Hotel I like to STAY in that Hotel. I mean, fair enough, the Manager did phone us on the way there but it appears to be a regular occurance at his Hotel things breaking down and diverting clients to other Hotels. So. if you are thinking of staying at The Marco Polo Hotel in Rome, firstly assertain that you CAN actually stay there. we, my Wife, Son and I went round to the Marco Polo, on the Friday 30/12/2011, to see if the boiler had been fixed (we wouldnt have moved there anyway by then), it was just to see. It hadnt.One of The Hotels, in the same building as The Marco Polo, is called Fawty Towers!!! However the location is where we wanted, by The Termini Rail Station. And the Hotel that we were sent to wasnt much farther away, about 1 1/2 blocks away. Other than that we had a lovely time in Rome, for The New Year (this was our second time in Rome we spent Christmas there 6 years ago) its well worth going its a lovely City, alot moreexpensive this time though. They, the Hotels, charge a 2 euro tax per person per night and watch out for the service charges. I would check at the Restaurants/ Cafes etc PRIOR to ordreing a meal if they charge a service charge, and they charge for entry into The Forum now.Oh, and one more thing, that i have also informed Thomas Cook about (as well as the above) if you go on a Tour Bus make SURE that you know where each stop is because thet havnt got the Tour operators Logo on the regular bus service bus stops. They stop at them but, brsides The Vatican and Termini, you may find it difficult to know where to get back on the bus Ok?", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "angelo w", "ReviewID": "UR121625843", "Content": "I stayed at the Marco polo hotel in October 2011 and I highly recommend it for business reasons and those who, like me, and those who want to spend a pleasant family holyday.

Also, there are a few restaurants near the hotel. The minus is that the breakfast is not so great. Especially the bread was really very hard. Also, the sleeping room was small.

On arrival the hotel had been told by the agent that we had booked two double rooms when in fact we had booked two twin rooms. This the hotel put right straightaway with no fuss or bother. If you require a twin room it may be worth while emailing them direct with your requirements after booking as they had definitely been told that we required double rooms - I was shown the paperwork. My direct emails to the hotel re: hairdryers and taxi service were answered promptly. Even though we arrived at 11.30 am the hotel had made sure our rooms were ready. On the day we checked out they allowed us to leave our baggage with them which enabled us to have a full day sightseeing before returning for luggage and taxi. The breakfast was superb and really set us up for a days sightseeing. There are no facilities for evening meals but there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance.

The first night we spent in a room described in other reviews, very small and not clean, showerhead and hairdryer broken, view on the inside balconies/shaft including the garbage of other people/hotels , etc.. As we were to stay 5 nights, the next day we asked the reception if there was an other room available, which -luckily- there was!!! Totally different scenery!! Nice, big(ger) room, bigger and OK beds, clean, everything working, including TV and mini-bar, nice and clean bathroom, view on the main street, we were very happy to have made the swap!! The internet site of the hotel states the hotel has been completely renewed in the 2001, but this is, obviously, not true. A lot of rooms are apparently still in old state. The reception desk has also not been remodelled as the pictures on the web site lead to believe. Hopefully they will not restyle it, because the counter of the reception desk is beautifully decorated with (fake?) marble, totally in line with the spirit of the city.

But no fresh juice, eggs, or ham (but there was Mortadella!) or common cheese (they had a kind of sweet and a cream cheese), no fresh toast, the fruit presented was so-so. Coffee and tea were OK!

So a tip from us, if you want something done from Italian people, try asking it nicely first! And say hello (bon giorno), goodbye (ciao or arrivederci) and please/thank you (prego/grazie) all the time! They really appreciate that!!

The toilets were susceptible to not flushing , there were no tea and coffee making facilities and at the risk of getting hospitalised with food poisoning, we refused to eat the stale cereal, warm milk, rotting fruit and room temperature ham (the six pieces that were on display) for breakfast. The reception staff were LESS than helpful and extremely rude and I was called a liar after a dispute about the room size. This absolutely ruined a part of our European holiday.
