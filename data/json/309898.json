It is about 200 meters from the Bras Basah MRT station and there's a bus stop nearby. Right across the hotel is a 7-11, and beside that a Kopitiam food court, a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf outlet, and a Wendy's. You'll never go hungry, that's for sure, although the bottled water at the nearby 7-11 is overpriced at S$1.80 and S$2.80 respectively, for what you can get at the mall supermarket at S$.40 and S$1. The surrounding area is well-lighted, very safe, clean and green, what with the Singapore Management University about a hundred meters away. Just next door or directly across are Bayview Hotel, Hotel 81, Strand Hotel and Rendezvous Hotel, which might explain the competitive pricing. We stayed for 3 nights for just over S$500 for each double and twin room, including breakfast and taxes. We had two de luxe rooms, both of them spacious enough for two occupants each--with a flat TV, an open wardrobe cabinet that also has the ref, the safety deposit box and the coffee service and electric kettle. There was also a dresser, and a bathroom that has enough room for a bathtub, a big sink with a mirror and marblelized counter and the water closet. Because guests had to use their Ving card to make the elevators move up, we felt very safe. The staff was courteous, prompt and efficient. We had requested for a higher floor, privacy, quiet rooms and windows in our online reservation and we got them all. The front desk also allowed us to check in at 10AM without us asking for it, and gave in to our request of a late check out at 1PM without too much fuss. The Filipino staff was just as generous in giving us tips on where to shop, how to use our MRT pass and get back our deposit, the best food outlets, etc. The minus points are for the absence of complimentary bottled water, the so-so breakfast that was the same during our 3-day stay and did not have refills of finished dishes, the very limited cable channels and poor TV reception, the malfunctioning Ving card, the small pool/spa, the cramped gym, and the skimpy toiletries--only one small soap disc at the sink, a small bottle each of shampoo and bath gel for the bathtub, and a travel toothbrush with a tiny toothpaste.

Location - Near Orchard Road 2. Location - Very near Bras Basah MRT station 3. Location - Right opposite to a 24 hour open food court and Seven Eleven. 6 Reasons NOT to stay at Hotel Bencoolen: 1. Room was extremely small. It was like, you enter the room and jump onto the bed. We even checked out their 'larger' room (which was 50 S$ per night extra), but that too was pretty small. They have a family room (150 S$ per night extra) but that was just too big and expensive for the 3 of us. 2. We were charged 30 S$ for our 6 year old daughter; irrespective of that there was no place even on a floor for an extra mattress! 3. Hotel is pretty old (I think around 40 years) and was low on ventilation and light. There was this smell of damp air and cigarette smoke in the lobbies. 4. Carpets within the room were dirty and stained. 5. This hotel motivated us to go for sight seeing early in the morning and come back late in the night. 6. I am not commenting about the staff and service as it does not matter! I seriously suggest people reading this review to not go by the 'cheapest' listed rates and general reviews but inquire about the room itself. Looking back I feel that, in Singapore it is not important to stay in the city center as the MRT and bus connectivity is very good.

When I got back I had to wash all my clothes immediately and keep my luggage outside to avoid transferring the bugs to my apartment.

The reception can speak English. 8. There's a aircon type hawker food stall across the street called \"Kopi Tiam\". It's open 24 hours. There's also 7-11 across the street. Dislike: 1. Well for the friendly hotel rate, breakfast food is simple. I went to Kopi Tiam to take breakfast instead. 2. The lobby has a funky smell. It's the smell of the carpet.

My collegue and I booked this hotel together with our flight, so we did not know what to expect. We arrived early at 12noon, greeted by the not so friendly but helpful receptionist and discovered that the check-in time was supposed to be at 2pm. We were so grateful as we were allowed early check-in as there was available room at the time. The room was small but cozy. We were hoping for twin beds but got a queen bed instead. But we do not really mind. The room was well equipped with a bedside table, a rack to hang clothes enough for 2 people, a hairdryer, coffee/tea making equipments, a small fridge and a safe. The bathroom was also small but clean. Our room faced towards the bencoolen street and the window allowed us a nice view of the stone forest (yeah.. the buildings), the pool and the small garden. Yes.. the dome of the mosque was also obvious from our window. As we came in the month of Ramadhan and we were fasting, a simple guide from the receptionist made our search for 'halal' food for breaking fast easier. We went to the umm.. if we were not mistaken.. 'Al-Jailani' - an indian Moslem restaurant about a short distance away from the hotel, about 3minutes walk to the left of the hotel. It was convenient to be able to get 'halal' tasty food nearby as we do not have to go in search for good food elsewhere. Our business there was to prepare and sit for the exam, and the hotel suited us nicely for that purpose. We were also relieved to have the Bencoolen mosque just adjacent to the hotel and were able to get our Qiblat right as the receptionist has no clue as to what a Qiblat is. But we did not blame her as she herself is a non-Moslem. However, a tiny arrow in the room directing to the Qiblat (as what we have in hotels in Malaysia) would be a great help and a relief for us Moslem travellers. Our stay was purely for the exam.

Also, as it is the University area the area is very safe and you can even walk on the road late at night. The room was small, but was clean and cozy. The bathroom was spacious with a bathtub and extremely clean. Crisp linen and comfortable beds. They have a mini refrigerator and a closet in the room, helping you to keep the room tidy. The staff was nice, and very helpful. When they realized it was two young girls looking for a hotel, they were extra helpful. They understood our situation, and was quick to give us a solution. They in fact held on to the room (the only room that was available during a long weekend) till we checked out from our original hotel and got our luggage shifted to Bencoolen Hotel. They did this even with out a payment!! We only had breakfast from hotel and it was satisfactory. They can definitely better it by introducing a variety. It gets a bit boring if you are there for a long stay like us. However, if you are bored with the food, you only have to cross the road; and there's a Food Court serving different types of food. I have to write a very special mention about Aman, the doorman. He made our stay extra special, by greeting us every morning, in Sinhala - 'Ayubowan' :) He was concern and was keen to ensure our stay in Singapore was wonderful. He gave us tips on what to do, and where to go. Help us plan our days/places to visit etc., It was really nice to see a warm and smiling face when we come down for breakfast every day.

Lots of shopping & dining in every price category near-by. The room was the smallest I have encountered in my decades of travel, if you're claustrophobic, stay away. It was 7sqm, tops! Bathroom is small as well, but newly renovated. Water hot & pressure good., basic amenities are available. Only 2 English TV channels are insufficient.. My room faced a back alley, if you're a light sleeper the 3.30am garbage pick-up may be disturbing. The aircon blew right on the bed, there was no option but freezing or shutting it off entirely. Housekeeping & laundry was very good. There was an issue with the key cards as well, card insert was not marked with arrow so inserting it to activate the lighting/ electrical system was a puzzle every time. Entire wiring needs overhaul as some lights worked at times, some didn't, depending on the day. Breakfast \"al fresco\" curbside is a neat idea, however food & quality on offer was far below par. Pool deck cozy, but small. OK for a refreshing dip, though. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Certain staff smoke in the lobby but tell guests to go smoke outside!! No harm done, though. Due to a flight-delay I had to cancel my first night at the very last moment and was surprised that I was NOT charged for it, which I sincerely appreciate!! Overall, if you just need a clean place to crash in a great location, Hotel BC may be an option.

The first night we arrived at around 11pm and were given Room RS6 on the 2nd floor. It was a nightmere - notwithstanding its new decor, the room was absolutely unbearably noisy. (I can assure you I am NOT a light sleeper.) You can hear every single movement concerning toilet flushing, people taking showers and washing hands ALL NIGHT LONG. I think this has something to do with the interior design of the piping. The fact that this room is located on the 2nd floor may be part of the reasons for the non-stop toilet activities - you get 10+ bathrooms above you! The first thing we did the next morning was to ask for a room change. The very helpful front desk staff did so almost immediately, making me curious if this is an ongoing problem with the room, or all rooms on the second floor. Anyway, we moved to another room on the 3rd floor. This room apparently is more tired and is not yet renovated. (An old bathtub rather than a shower room .) But this is like a gem to us already (because we can hear no more toilet flushing). My conclusion is unless you get earplugs and prefer new decor to good sleep, stay away from RSX (2nd floor) rooms.

I stayed in a twin room on the 5th floor. The room was quite large as twins go, with a well equipped bathroom. The shower is in the bath but has good water pressure and heating. The beds are king size singles. The room has TV, internet access (wireless) although that feature is very expensive and hard to connect to. $5 per hour from the time you sign on or $25 /day. It is not possible to pay onto your room account (cash at counter only) and so you have to make a trip to the reception to get connected. There is another coin operated Internet Kiosk in the foyer area for those without wireless. The TV is remote controlled for convenience and the lights are controlled from beside the bed. A small desk and mirror, standard hanging space, coffee making facilities (no tea) and be careful, the whitener supplied also contains sugar (so its sweet or black - no choices there). The TV has limited channels in English and no video/dvd option so don't count on sitting back and relaxing in front of the box. The staff are friendly enough - but only just - something not quite right but couldn't pick what it was. The taxi booking system to the airport is a rip-off (sort of like the internet service). Charged at $28 pre booked. I left for the airport at 4.30am but walked outside to see a cab rank and 5 taxis sitting doing nothing. Average cost for taxi to airport from the airport to the hotel is $18. There is a good selection of well priced restaurants, clubs and bars within walking distance. This place represents good value for Singapore. It is clean and quiet too. Breakfast is included in the tariff served outside on the sidewalk between 7.30am and 10am. This is a nice touch in the tropics. The breakfast is bacon, fried eggs, baked beans, toast, tea and coffee, orange juice and various jams etc. Help yourself buffet style. I paid $128 per night although the advertised price was $108 for the room. In Australia or New Zealand you would pay between $60 and $80 for the same standard of services and facilities - hope that helps. Don't get your hopes up but you won't be dissappointed.

The room contained a double bed and a single bed, a writing desk area, a TV, a fridge, air con (with temperature control, but if you turned it off, you had to approach reception to turn it back on), tea and coffee making facilities and a mini safe.

There are 2 types of juice, some watermelon, beans, fried eggs, noodles, toast, and cornflakes. There is one coin fed computer with internet in reception. I slept very well in both rooms, and heard very little noise from the corridor or other rooms. Housekeeping made up my bed and cleaned the bathroom every day after 12. When I had a problem with a plug being stuck in my room, reception immediately sent someone to sort it out. Reception was always very friendly, and helpful. They put my luggage in secure storage after I checked out, in order that I could go sightseeing for the day. There were a few small maintenance issues that would have made it a first class room - there was one socket loose, and a couple of small rips, or marks on the wallpaper. The lights, bathroom fan and a couple of other things were controlled by a control panel by the bed, but the pictures on some of the buttons had worn away, making it a hit and miss affair as to weather I was switching off the lights, or asking reception to send up housekeeping.
