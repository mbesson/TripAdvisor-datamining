We've had excellent stay there for 3 nights in mid November. Advantages: - Good location in elegant part of Istanbul, reputable for its fashion stores. It is just 15 minute walk from Taxim Square, but the area is lot quieter and more relaxing than Taxim itself. Just be aware that the location is bit away from Sultanahmet, historical and touristic centre of Istanbul and you will need to take either taxi or metro/tram to get to attractions such as Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and Blue Mosque. - Super-friendly and professional service from English speaking staff. - Nice, modern and comfortable rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c each featuring different jazz musician. We stay at John Coltrane, No. 62 on the top floor, which is bit smaller than other rooms but has small balcony with nice view over the area (although you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see Bosphorus from there). - Tasty continental breakfast with suitable choice - Other services such as transport to/from the airport handled very efficiently and professionally. Disadvantages: - There are not many, really. Perhaps whole property is quite small, which results in bit cramped lifts, corridors. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a major problem. - The hotel is located in quite densely built up part of Istanbul and it takes a day or two familiarize how to navigate in the neighborhood. If someone wants to visit with a car, I would say it is not a good idea. - For us it was advantage, but the neighborhood around Hotel Jazz has European/Western feel. If you are after old Orient experience, opt for hotels in Karakoy or Sultanahmet areas. Tip: There is another hotel the Gallery Residence, just 100 meters away, which is run by the same owners. The Gallery Residence - which seems similar to the Jazz Hotel but more suitable for longer term stay - has fitness room and sauna, which guests of the Jazz can use for free.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brazil", "Title": "\u201cAgain lovely Istanbul,on a very nice hotel and reasonable price!!\u201d", "Author": "HelianaCalmon", "ReviewID": "UR120343848", "Content": "The Jazz Hotel is located on the very best part of the modern Istanbul and steps away from the Osmanbey subway, and just one metro stop from the Taksim square.

The hotel d\u00c3\u00a9cor is extremely nice from the outside, lobby, hallway (very small), elevator (even smaller), and the decor of the room (very small as well) all very nice. The service from the very few staff members was exceptional, and they were very tentative to our needs. Other than the Decor and the hospitality of the 3 or 4 staff members, I have nothing else good to say about this hotel. The room was extremely small, the bed was extremely uncomfortable, there was construction noise every morning as well as through out the day, the refrigerator was very small and barely kept its contents above room temperature. Upon our arrival to a very hot and stuffy hotel room, we set the air conditioner on 18 degrees Celsius and it blew minimal. The room was h until the second day of our trip. There was no ice to be found at the hotel. When we requested ice to chill our room tempeture drinks out of the fridge we were brought a cup of ice. One of the staff was kind enough to go to the local market and purchase us ice the second day, after which we just purchased our own ice daily. There were over 800 channels on the television but only 3 channels were in English and 2 of them only played English programs for a few hours in the evening and a hour or two in the mornings. The floors in the room were incredibly slippery, both my girl friend and I almost slipped and fell at least 6 times.
