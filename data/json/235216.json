My family and I (wife and 3 young children) had the unfortunate luck of visiting New Orleans during Hurricane Isaac. Upon check-in, they gave us a room on a high floor and away from the elevator just as we had requested prior to our arrival. They even gave us a two room suite so our children had their own seperate area to sleep, watch television, and play! The room was absolutely fantastic! It was clean and well appointed (microwave, refrigerator, sink, two flat screen televisions, etc.). The staff during check-in was absolutely fantastic. They gave us a map of the area, recommended points of interest for the family, and made excellent restaurant recommendations (everything was within walking distance, even with my 2-year old in tow). The breakfast provided every morning was more than enough for my family. It included made-to-order waffles, eggs, sausage, bacon, grits, muffins, danishes, cereal, and more. Hurricane Isaac hit during our second day at the hotel. The entire staff was more than accommodating during the storm. They continued to check on our family to ensure we were not in need of anything (food, water, blankets, etc.). Miss Janelle even loaned us her personal DVD player in order for my children to watch movies and keep occupied during the storm! There wasn't a day that went by that my family wasn't greeted by every staff member when they saw us. The General Manager (Mr. Stanley) was even at the hotel and very involved in the day-to-day activities. It was absolutely fantastic to see the General Manager of an establishment so involved with his customers. My family had to extend our stay by two nights due to the hurricane, and, not one time, was there a problem making sure we were safe and had the proper accommodations. The entire staff at the Quality Inn & Suites in downtown New Orleans treated us like family during our entire stay. I will stay at this establishment everytime I visit New Orleans in the future, and I recommend to anybody looking for a home away from home to stay at the Quality Inn & Suites in downtown New Orleans.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest bang for the buck in French Quarter\u201d", "Author": "mgi1983", "ReviewID": "UR137823255", "Content": "My girlfriend and I decided to take a weekend trip to New Orleans, and she had been there multiple times, staying at Le Pavillion and other high end hotels. She mentioned the Quality Inn and that the service there was outstanding. Although a bit hesitant, I went along with it. My concerns quickly vanished. We drove all night and didn't plan well, so we arrived about 3 hours before standard check in time. The staff was almost apologetic and took the blame when they said our room was not ready yet, but would be within an hour. (Still two hours before standard check-in). We grabbed a bite to eat, came back and not only was the room ready, but we had been upgraded to a suite for our troubles. Uhh, what troubles? Getting there way too early was our fault, but I'll take it! So we get a suite, before we go up, the bellboy gives us a map of the french quarter and where all to go. The room may not be a Ritz Carlton suite but it did the job for us. A king sized bed, flat screen TV, couch, fridge, microwave, desk, nice sized bathroom. I mean really, what else do you need? The location is great. It's just a few blocks from Bourbon street and if you ever want to get sleep at night, don't get a room on Bourbon. It's also just a short walk from the Riverwalk, and all kinds of touristy stuff. So more about the service. One night we were hungry and felt like being lazy so we called down to the front desk to see what restaurants delivered. The answer: A lot. The night desk clerk pulled a large box from under the desk with about 100 menus inside. He told us what he thought was good and didn't steer us wrong. One day we wanted to go to a Saints game and found tickets online. Only problem: No printer. We called down again and the desk clerk let us use their printer. It is a bit pricey to use their garage to park your car but worth it. Again, valets are extremely courteous. Basically, it seems they will bend over backwards to make sure you have a pleasant stay with everything you would need. Stay here. It's really worth it and costs half what most hotels in the area do.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood price, average stay\u201d", "Author": "cantravellor", "ReviewID": "UR137675376", "Content": "I would probably give this hotel 3.5 stars.

It is also a basic hotel with no bells or whistles but it does have a small workout room that was clean and functional.

I found this breakfast to have less options than other hotels and the quality of food was also worse; however it's free. Room was dark but was nicely laid out with our room and kids' room seperate with bathroom in middle which gave privacy. Service was fine - no issues, staff friendly.

At least two staff members helped us with recommendations and the layout of the city. I was most impressed with the gentleman who helped us with our bags. Not only did he take of our family of 6 bags, he also sat down with us and provided us with a \"his special map\" of the town. He sat down with us and hi-lighted places to go, eat and see.

When we arrived George greated us and was very helpful. The area was very busy that week and were getting ready for the basketball finals. When we booked our room there was a non-smoking Queen available although we preferred a smoking king, we were fine with that because we realized they were busy. We did ask George if there happened to have been a smoking king cancellation so we could upgrade if there was one was available. He told us there wasn't a smoking king available but there was a non-smoking king which he voluntarily upgraded us to at no additional charge. Not being from the area when we arrived we parked in the wrong garage and he told us that instead of paying for that garage while we were there the two days that if we parked in the one that the hotel used not only was it valet parking but we could come and go as we pleased and not have to pay additional fees when we re-entered. There was a charge through the hotel to use this garage (from what I had read on internet most hotels in area do have an additional parking fee so we weren't suprised by this) Using the garage that he recommended actually ended up cheaper on us so this was a plus. After checking in I was looking at the travel brochures for the area. We asked if he could suggest anything to do while we were there he offered some suggestions on tours and such and also asked him if he could recommend a restaurant in the area and he suggested a couple to us Deanie's Seafood was the one we went with and it was a very good recommendation. Over dinner we decided to do the Haunted Histories walking tour which he was able to book for us for the next evening when we got back to the hotel. We got to our room and it was very nice! Another employee brought our luggage up on a cart and even unloaded it for us when we got to the room. A very large comfortable king size bed with plenty of nice fluffy pillows. There was a small desk next to the TV, a microwave and a fridge in room in a small kitchen area with a sink, there was also an in room safe at no additional charge. The bathroom was very spacious, clean and well stocked. Air Conditioning in room was excellent as well. There was a snack vending area on our floor which was an even number floor and the ice machine was one floor below us, they were on the odds. Breakfast was great! Awesome selection with two different waffle makers, eggs, sausage or bacon, gravy and biscuits, cereal, yogurt, and fruit, Attendants kept everything well stocked.We very much enjoyed our stay here and like several other reviews it's pretty un-assuming from the outside but a very nice inside.

This is a no frills place to stay but who comes to New Orleans to hang out in a hotel room? 2. \"Location is in a bad part of town.\" I would say that just in every city you have to be street smart and New Orleans is no different.

The walls feel a little thin, so i'd recommend a room away from the elevator, it makes a loud beep every time its passing a floor. If you are a light sleeper, youre likely to be startled by it if you are sleeping near there.

Great customer service goes a long way, but it does not make up for the hotel's issues. The Good: The service really is as good as everyone says. Art (a popular man at the front desk) is fantastic at his job. He really does go the extra mile. He anticipated any issues we might have and acted accordingly. He was very helpful in setting up tours and airport transportation, and provided valuable information about the area. Also, breakfast is included and is pretty good, even for the picky eaters in my party. Our room had two bedrooms, connected by a bathroom. It seems like it was a one-bedroom suite where they just made the living room into a bedroom. We were very happy with the room. The Bad: The hotel is quite old and needs renovating. The photos are more flattering than they should be. The location, while a 4 block walk to Bourbon, is located in a pretty sketchy area. In order to get to the bars and restaurants, you have to walk through a really ghetto section. Even though there were three of us travelling together, we had to take cabs home because it simply wasn't safe enough to walk home. Across the street is a vacated office building, and there are several parking lots nearby. This would be fine if we had no intentions of going out to dinner or for drinks at night, but no one wants to be that stressed on vacation. Overall: The hotel is a good value for a family or a group who has no intentions of leaving the hotel in the evening. Otherwise, bring ear plugs and just stay in the quarter.

As I said, the rooms are plain and the facility is a bit dated, but all areas of the hotel were very clean, including my room and bathroom. Bed was sufficient, and the room was quiet. The breakfast was free and better than I expected, with hot foods and a pretty large selection. Wi-fi was also free in my room. What really sets this hotel apart, however, is the staff. I had several interactions with them, and everyone from the on-duty manager right down to the cleaning staff and doormen were extremely welcoming, polite, friendly and willing to help out with anything I needed. I really can't say enough about the service - even with the average rooms, I would return to this hotel just because of the people.

The staff was very friendly and courteous. my one night stay there was better than expected. (I stayed in three diffrent hotels in three nights for the points.) Breakfast, gym and parking are offered but I did not avail myself to them. There is a SUBWAY restaurant on the corner.

No reflection on this property, Actually there is a comforting staff/security that greets you and often times gets to know you. Bourbon & Canal intersection is an easy three-block walk. The streets are NOT always smooth and there are holes all over, walk carefully. Three for One beers, Great Restaurants, Music and Dancing are copious. Streets are well lit and there are many NOPD Officers visible all the way to this Quality inn in a safe part of town. Getting from the New Orleans Louis Armstrong International Airport (MSY) is safe, simple and cheap when going by bus. From the upstairs platform take the E-2 (Jefferson Transit is the only city bus that serves the airport), for $1.50 all the way downtown to Tulane & Loyola on WEEKDAYS (till 9:20 PM last bus).then walk the four blocks to the hotel. On WEEKENDS taking the E-2 from the airport will only go two-thirds the way to downtown. It will let you off at Carrollton Ave where you will cross the street to the side of the Burger King and wait ten minutes for the #39 (Orleans Parish bus, another $1.50) that takes you all the way to Canal St.(last Stop) three blocks to the hotel.

We enjoyed our stay so much last year that we booked again for 3 nights and brought friends with us this time. I booked months ago by phone, asking for 2 kings, but being a weekend, they only had 2 queens. I asked if they'd make a notation to upgrade us if kings became available. The night before arriving, I called to repeat my request and was told the same situation existed but they'd try. We arrived very early, around 9am, and of course no rooms were ready yet, so they took all our luggage and locked it up in a room behind the desk. The manager noted my request and asked for a cell number so he could call if something came available. We went out sight-seeing for the day and didn't return till around 3pm to find that we had been upgraded to a king suite and a room with 2 double beds - at no extra charge. The staff will tell you that the queen rooms are quite small, something we knew from the previous year, but they are such a great value for New Orleans and the location, that you don't mind. Both rooms were spacious with a love seat, making it very comfortable. Our suite had a separate bedroom/ refrigerator, sink & coffee area/ large bathroom. Although we don't spend much time in hotel rooms, it was nice to come back before changing for dinner and relax for a couple of hours. The staff is literally the friendliest & most accommodating people of any hotel we've stayed in the world. I don't know if the manager (same man we met last year) personally selects them for this reason or if they are trained, but it feels genuine. Each morning, they'd greet us and ask where we were headed, and in the afternoon when we returned, they'd ask how it was and what we'd eaten, etc. When we came down dressed for dinner the first night, the bellman went outside to hail a taxi for us, without hesitating - sometimes it's an easy feat and sometimes not. The second night when none of them were stopping, the desk clerk noticed what was going on & called a cab service so we wouldn't be late for our reservation. When we returned that evening, we asked if anyone could recommend a good place for breakfast. I expected the answer to be \"here\" since breakfast is complimentary and quite nice, although we didn't avail ourselves of it except for coffee. Instead, he immediately gave us 2 choices, and the one we chose was fabulous - not a place visitors would know but definitely one the locals are familiar with. Our flight didn't leave till 7pm the last day, so they again stored our luggage without a second thought. The system was down, so to expedite check-out, the desk clerks simply said they'd email the bill, not to worry about anything. When we returned for our luggage later that day, the manager gave us his card and told us to call on him anytime we were in town, and the bellman we'd become friendly with actually gave us a hug - like we were family. That might sound strange, and normally I wouldn't feel like hugging someone we barely knew, but it felt right. The staff makes you feel like you're staying as family members, not just anonymous guests. The service here is more attentive than many 5 star hotels we've stayed at. Only negative - and it's a small one - is the water pressure in the shower, but that may be typical of the city as someone told us. The drain in our sink seemed a bit slow the first day, but after the maid cleaned the room, I noticed it improved greatly. That tells me that when she cleaned the room, she noted it and had someone look at it - again the attention to detail. You cannot go wrong with this hotel.

We had a wedding in town to attend and decided to extend our stay and make a vacation out of it. As may others have stated, the staff here is exceptional. They made you feel welcome and greeted you warmly whenever you saw them. The check in process was quick and smooth, we were given room 414, an end room that had a separate living room area which was nice for a week long stay. The room had a coffee maker, microwave and small fridge. it also had a safe. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and well kept though it did look a bit worn in places, but nothing to gripe about. My wife used the gym, which is small, but had some cardio equipment. The free breakfast was nothing fancy by had scrambled eggs, bagels, toast, make your own waffles, instant oatmeal, grits, bacon or sausage, yogurt, apple juice, orange juice, coffee & teas and some fruit. Danishes and muffins and perhaps a few other things... Nothing fancy, but for free it was great! Location wise it was perfect. Having never been to New Orleans I did not know about the various areas at all, but found this to be a great spot. You are literally a 5 minute into the French Quarter and about the same or less to the Canal Street & St. Charles Street Street car lines. Always felt safe walking to and from the FQ even late at night as there is another hotel on the route that has doormen / valets out front at all hours of the night. We had relatives staying at the Maison St. Charles (A Quality Inn as well) and we likes that place too, it looked more like a small apartment complex from the outside of the rooms, in a good way, and had a nice pool in the courtyard. If you have kids this might be a better place for that reason, but is a couple miles from the FQ, though the Street Car stops right out front.

Based on others' write ups, I settled on this hotel because it appeared reasonable, within walking distance, yet, out of the noisy ear shot of the French Quarter (it is, in fact, within a few blocks of the Waldorf Astoria, Ritz Carlton etc.) , and even included a breakfast. All of that was true but it exceeded our expectations. Per suggestions through TripAdvisor comments, we had requested a room near the top with a king bed. When we came into the lobby, amidst a busy crowd of people in for a Saints' game, we asked if our request had been granted. We learned that we'd gotten a room with twin beds (not the way we wanted to start our weekend). But the Manager, Stanley Mascair, immediately asked if we could wait a brief time so he could make sure we had the room we wanted then proceeded to find us a room at the top with a king bed. During the short wait, I made a list of top rated restaurants that I'd read about and asked Mr. Mascair about them and the likelihood of securing a reservation so late. He said he'd be happy to try to make the reservations for us. And, in spite of this busy weekend and last minute requests, he was true to his word. We were always greeted cheerily by the staff whenever we returned to the hotel. While on our way to the airport, my husband realized he'd left a pair of pants hanging in the room closet. A quick call to Quality Inn and Mr. Mascair reassured him that they would send the pants to our home, if they found them. I thought to myself, \"good bye pants\" but they arrived within days of our return home. This is a clean, modestly decorated hotel in a great location, with great bedding and 5 Star service. --C.

The answer is simple: the staff. Oh, to be sure, the rooms are really nice and comfy. And the location a block off Canal Street is an easy two minute walk to Bourbon Street or the St. Charles Avenue streetcar. And the price is easy on the wallet for New Orleans. However, the staff make this one most enjoyable hotel to stay in. This trip was different, because I was making a couple different stays there (with time in between). Upon checking in, the first time, they immediately commented on how I would be returning shortly for another stay. And when I did return for the next stay, I didn't even have to give my name to the reception desk clerk. She recognized me, greeted me, and brought up my new reservation --- all without having to ask my name. She remembered it! No, she remembered \"me\"! Furthermore, my second check-in was an \"early check-in\" (about 12:30pm). Most hotels will give the arriving guest the perfunctory reply and say something about how one has to wait until 3:00pm or whatever. Well, that is not what happens at this Quality Inn. They immediately checked with housekeeping, and the manager,himself, promptly went upstairs to check on rooms to find a nice room for my early check-in. He came back, told the desk clerk which room to give me, and when I opened the door to the room the lights were turned on to give a \"proper greeting\". Now, that's impressive! And when I checked out to leave New Orleans and go to the airport, the manager, who was on the phone, cupped the phone so as to not talk to the person on the other end of the line, and said good-bye to me (by name) and thanked me for staying with them.

The reception staff could not have helped us any more they answered all our questions and promised to call us once our room was ready. Sure enough around 3pm they called apologising that the room we had booked was not available yet and advised us that they would upgrade us to a suite ! When we returned we checked in. Such a smooth easy process from the great friendly staff. Our suite was amazing. A small kitchen with microwave, sink and fridge, bathroom, separate bedroom from the lounge area, and Two tv's Most importantly the bed was very comfortable and the room nice and quiet and very clean and inviting. The location of the hotel is great, less than a 5 minute walk to the french quarter and away from all the noise. Friends that we were travelling with were all complaining that their hotels located in the quarter were noisy. The daily breakfast included in the room rate was also fantastic. Waffles, toast, bagels, cereal, coffee, pastries, eggs, bacon, muffins, juice, fruit and much much more. ....... Most importantly the best thing about the hotel is the service. All the staff go out of their way to help you, and are genuine in their caring about you having a great holiday. They go above and beyond to make sure you know all the little secrets of the city, from buying tickets on the streetcar, to advice on what to see and do and eat.

This isn't because the hotel was inadequate. Rather, it's because I chose the hotel based on TA's ranking system and expected something better. It isn't. On the plus side, it's reasonably well located, clean, has very friendly staff, and is well-priced. On the negative side, it is in desperate need of a make-over, the rugs are shabby, the rooms are dated, and it has almost no amentias. Also, the location is just off Canal Street in a very business-like district...no charm here. I think the problem must be in TA's rating system. I booked this hotel based on TA's recommendation, and I expected the #1 rated hotel in a city to be significantly above average. This isn't...it's just average at best. So, my recommendation to anyone thinking about this hotel is don't expect too much. It's a non-descript hotel in a non-descript part of the city that is reasonably priced.

Well, 1 out of 3 ain't bad I guess, but it also doesn't make this the best hotel in New Orleans either. I wasn't sure whether to give the hotel two or three stars, but my experience overall wasn't good and I will not return there so I chose two stars. First things first, the owners and all the workers here are top notch and I can't say anything but good things about them. However, that is about the only thing going for this place. The location is two blocks from Canal and then two blocks from there to Bourbon Street. I didn't feel unsafe in anyway, so that was good. The outside of this building is hideously ugly, but that doesn't really bother me that much. The inside lobby is nice but nothing special, and they upgraded me to a corner room, which was like a suite with a living area, coffee area, bedroom, and bathroom. The views from the window were fine given the location. The heating works fine, which is normally not needed in New Orleans, but I surely needed it this time as it was in the 30's at night when I was there. However, that is where things fall apart. The window had a piece of duck tape holding it on, and there was a big crack in the single pane window that allowed a constant draft to come in. Fortunately, the heater worked fine enough to combat that draft. The bed itself was fine although the remote control didn't work for either TV's. Didn't bother me as I wasn't in the room much anyway. I was out partying late, as it was the first weekend of Mardi Gras and during the weekend of the Saints Superbowl. So, I slept in and took a shower at 11 AM. There was absolutely no hot water left at all. I put the shower to full hot and only lukewarm water came out. I took a shower as fast as I could. The next night, I didn't stay out as late, but I couldn't sleep because the Saints had won the Superbowl and people were hollering until 7AM in the morning. This didn't bother me as I was there to celebrate as well, just got burned out after two nights. The next morning I woke up at 9AM, mainly because I wanted to try the breakfast. The shower was nice and hot then, so maybe I beat the other people to the hot water that day? Now, onto the breakfast buffet. Based on the comments, I was expecting a grand ole spread, but I was sorely disappointed. There were no fruits except bananas and apples. The coffee and juice were good, and I needed that to nurse my hangover. The eggs and grits didn't appear to look that fresh so I just had cereal instead.

Complimentary Breakfast - excellent as others have mentioned - fruit, waffles, eggs, beverages, cereals, bakery items, etc. 4. Advice - we received numerous good tips on restaurants from the staff and really enjoyed our visit. Our airport transportation was easily arranged through them as well. 5. Fast Elevators - we were there on a busy (Conventions/Saints game) weekend, the hotel was full, but we never waited for an elevator. 6. Comfy, Clean Rooms - ours was wonderful - spacious and kept very clean with great mattresses. 7. Quiet - even though the hotel was bustling, our sleep was uninterrupted by indoor noise. 8. Computer Access - while the hotel doesn't have a business centre, they will let you use a computer they have in the office. We printed our boarding passes, etc., that way and used the wired internet access provided in each room for our laptop. 9. Bathrooms - good sized, great showers, well stocked. 10. VALUE - YOU WILL NOT GET A VALUE LIKE THIS VERY OFTEN IN YOUR TRAVELS. We felt like geniuses! Thanks to all those reviewers who told their stories so we had the pleasure of staying here.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wingdale ny", "Title": "\u201ca pleasure\u201d", "Author": "billWingdaleNy", "ReviewID": "UR47316418", "Content": "for an affordable, comfortable stay i would recommend this hotel,the staff make all the difference and though this is an older city hotel they went out of their way to accommodate us. i would recommend it to anyone and their comp breakfast included waffles and eggs, quite a suprise. great folk,great staythanks!!!", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Collins, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cNumber 1 for a reason\u201d", "Author": "The_Cottonmouth", "ReviewID": "UR46637156", "Content": "The Quality Inn is pretty much perfect for a stay in NOLA.

After checking-in I looked up at my husband and I could tell he was just as dissappointed as I was. The elevator was dirty and the hallways needed to be vacuumed. The room was OK...the bathroom is small and I hate that the sink area is in the same area as the shower - not practical at all! The bed was hard and there's nothing to compliment about the bedding. I have to say, I was happy the room was clean and I was appreciative of the free internet and cable TV.

We went on up to our room, which was great - a very large, very clean suite, with everything we could ask for. The bed was very comfy, with tv's in both the living room area of the suite and the bedroom, and, since it was a corner room, we had two different views. After we rested and refreshed, it was back downstairs to talk with Blair - I tell you, he made us feel like we were old friends! He recommended two great places to eat - Dickie Brennan's Steakhouse, and the Acme Oyster House. We were going to do both in one night, but were so stuffed from the wonderful food at Dickie Brennan's, we couldn't eat another bite - so, we did Acme the second night - both restaurants were absolutely top-notch! The hotel was about a 4 - 5 block walk to the French Quarter, which is not bad at all - you could also take the streetcar down Canal Street to the French Quarter or the Riverwalk if you don't want to walk, but we enjoy walking and seeing all the sites. Blair also booked us on the \"Rebirth of New Orleans\" tour, which I would highly recommend to everyone - it is a fantastic tour to see the different parts of New Orleans, especially the 9th Ward.

I got a nice room with queensize bed, kitchenette and living room with a second tv. All that for not 100USD a night. Next morning, I was welcomed by Stanley Mascair, general manager at the frontdesk, with a nice : 'Goodmorning Miss Ireen, how can I help you?' I told him, I didn't come to New Orleans to only see the French Quarter, I wanted also to see the areas hit by Katharina. One of his helps hurried to get me a brochure and helped me make a good choice. I saw the 9th ward, in a small bus , with an excellent guide. I was knocked off my socks by the scale of the devastation and the grim future of the ones who lived here. But I'm glad I saw it with my own eyes. When I returned to the hotel, I was asked again, how it was, if they could do anything for me. I told about my big bag of laundry. No problem,we can take care of it or there is a washer and dryer on the sixth floor. For no money, I had all my laundy clean and dry.. Never forget Mr Baba, who came by as I was at the washer. I asked for a basket or big plastic bag. No worry, Baba will take care of that. He came back with two giant bags. I had no change, to give him a tip. He said: No worry, Baba is here to help you. Isn't this really nice! I was enchanted. This has become so rare in our world of chain hotels, where no one really cares. I told Mr Mascair about my satisfaction.

If you are coming to New Orleans, spend a few dollars extra and stay closer to the river (Sheraton, Hilton, Marriott, Harrah's, Doubletree, Ritz Carlton, Crowne Plaza, Westin, Wyndham, Holiday Inn, to name a few). This Quality Inn is unfortunately a few blocks off of Canal Street (a main road) and too far inland (where there are less people and not alot of action). The dark streets and shady characters can make a traveler a bit nervous at night. If you want the full experience (Bourbon Street, Decatur Street, Casino, River) the New Orleans Marriott or Sheraton is probably in the best location. The positives of this hotel are the price and the staff. When I arrived (on an airport shuttle.. which, by the way, avoid! just split a cab with someone), my room was not ready so I was upgraded to a suite (two bedrooms, bathroom, sink, fridge) for no charge. The staff was able to recommend places to eat and things to do, also. I would rate the staff a 5, the hotel itself a 4 (considering price), and the location is maybe a 1.5-2.", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location!\u201d", "Author": "caspyboy", "ReviewID": "UR14002066", "Content": "This hotel is a 5 minute walk from the french quarter and a perfect base for exploring the surrouding area on foot. For the price, it is great value considering the location. Staff were very friendly, polite and a pleasure to deal with. The manager on duty was terrific and offered to upgrade us to a suite for no extra charge. He also gave us a discount on the parking fee ($14 a day). Our room was clean, spacious and had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and we had two TVs, a fridge, microwave and a safe. Full cable and wi-fi was also great. Breakfast was great and the staff were so nice that they kept the breakfast area open half an hour longer than usual. It included coffee, juice, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, bagels, grits, eggs and alternated between breakfast burritos or sausage biscuits. The breakfast area is large, clean and bright with a view of the street. We were overall very happy with our stay. For the price, you cant beat it in that area! The great staff, clean rooms and perfect location made our stay in New Orleans a pleasure. We'd stay here again on our next visit.", "Date": "March 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "stepwallace420", "ReviewID": "UR13272442", "Content": "We stayed here during Mardi Gras '08 and loved this hotel.

I paid around $80 per night over a holiday weekend. The rooms are not large but about meduim size as for hotel rooms. You get a large TV with cable (HBO), a desk, a fridge, and in some rooms a sofa. There is a 24-hour Walgreens one block away, on Canal Street, where you can buy grocieries for the microwave. If you are buying liquor, then you should take the St. Charles streetcar from downtown out to a Rite Aid were you can buy it for 1/2 the price they sell it in Downtown liquor stores and even more cheaper than the price in bars. The free breakfast was not very good. They have a waffle maker but only syrup for topping. Many Choice hotels now serve strawberry toppings, but not this hotel. THey provide microwavable bacon/sausage biscuits that are not tasty at all. But then again, it is free, and since there are so many places to eat in New Orleans at a decent rate it hardly matters. Even though the manager claimed that breakfast usually runs a little longer than than the announced ending time, I noticed that the housekeepers started putting things up exactly on the minute. In fact they were somewhat rude about it. Partly I think this is a result of the people (many from other countries, it seems) who now work in New Orleans hotels because native New Orleaneans have left since Katrina. In the past i am sure staying in the breakfast area after the official time would have been no problem, but things seem to have changed! The desk staff and management were top noch! They all spoke to you when you arrived at the hotel, but were quick about checking you in, and more than glad to help you with directions. The French Quarter is only 2 block from the hotel. For the price you will be happy to have stayed here. You get all the things you need in a comfortable setting. Save your money for the French Quarter by staying here. Plus the staff really act as if they are glad you are there.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pretoria, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cBargain with excellent front desk staff\u201d", "Author": "Ricpta", "ReviewID": "UR12814279", "Content": "Spend 4 nights in January 2008- a bargain at the price.
