Cons - VERY old property; the condition of the carpet made me keep my shoes on (it looked greasy); no hot water in the tap in the evening (maybe we didn't let it run long enough? guess 5 minutes wasn't enough...); bathroom sink and tub were chipped and rusty in places; there was no one in the office when we arrived around 11 p.m. - the office staff was out getting food, so we had to wait in the parking lot for about 10 minutes; and the worst of all, the toilet tank leaked into the bowl so every 3 minutes (yes, I timed it) the water would refill in the tank WHOOOOSSHHHH for 8 seconds. After an hour or so of trying to get to sleep I finally got down on my hands and knees and turned off the water line under the toilet. When I told the office staff about it in the morning she said she would have someone look at it, but no, the second night was the same....however, I knew to turn the water off before we climbed into bed. There were also a couple of weird things, like getting the door to unlock, and a strange person in another unit, but that could have happened anywhere. All in all, I don't think I could recommend this place to friends or family, BUT I kind of like the little cabin-like units, on a couple of acres in the middle of a city, and I possibly would stay there again. Maybe. But definitely NOT in unit #134....", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cmothballs and pinesol with a certain je ne sais qoi\u201d", "Author": "screenname0123", "ReviewID": "UR111427084", "Content": "Wow, what is that smell?

They then went and locked up the kitchen and second bedroom.....leaving us with bath and one double bed. The room was very cold.......even when we turned the heat up it never got any warmer......over our entire 2 day stay. When checking out ( and being sure to leave our 2 keys as they charge 40$ per key if not turned in) we were informed that there was an addition \"pet fee\" of 15$ per day..... When I asked why we were not told of this before, we were told that was \"just the way it is\" The bathtub was chipped baddly and very stained, the tile around the tub showed alot of black mold. The carpets were frayed, and the room smelled baddly. Being on chemotherapy, and having to be cautious of infections, the conditions of this place worried me. If one likes to stay at a place where you are treated like a criminal, and have no concerns about your health or comfort this would be a place for you. For the average person I would steer clear of this place.

The only reason we wanted to stay here was because it was listed as \"inexpensive\", with only ONE dollar sign next to it in the hotel listings. We arrived and got a room...which ended up being more like a mini cottage. It was super-adorable. Very retro and cute. If you are not into vintage-y decor, though, you will probably hate it. The room had one bed, a small kitchenette and bathroom. Everything was dated, but not in a bad way...it was more like staying in a \"theme\" motel...but I suspect the management didn't do that on purpose. Anyway, the most awesome part of the room was a tiny cutout in the wall, made to resemble a \"fireplace\" with a fake log of wood on a stand that was plugged into the wall in this cutout area. When you turned the device on, there were red and orange lights that rotated in this fake log, which gave the appearance of a pretend fire. It was adorable, and extra-cheezy. I loved this polace and am sad to hear the rumor that it may be shut down! As an added bonus, shortly after we returned from our trip to Vancouver, my husband and I were watching the X Files on television. I know they did a lot of filming of that show in the Pacific Northwest. Anyway, they filmed parts of one episode at this motel. We recognized it right off...well, also the large \"2400 Motel\" sign that is on the premises was in one of the shots, so that helped us identify the location too.
