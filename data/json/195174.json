At first I thought my single seemed small but it REALLY grew on me, and it was big enough! The walls were upholstered in toile, and I was under a mansard, so a cozy slant over the bed. The tiny bathroom was all done in marble, with a heated towel rack and a terry robe. Free wi-fi-- at first could not get it to work but then it did, and perfectly. every day the maid tidied up and then turned down the bed. Room service was prompt, food excellent. Because I had so many meetings I only had one meal in the dining room, but the room is gorgeous, with white upholstered chairs, walls covered with black and white photos of celebs... Gorgeous public rooms, a library with purple and red chairs, a beautiful room to have tea in, a garden room with patio chairs, lovely tucked away public rooms everywhere. The elevator was the old fashioned kind with a gate and two doors, and staff was always rushing to open and close it, but the wooden stairs were also grand, with portraits everywhere and purple stairs. The gothicness, with the red velvet curtains and candles and velvet, REALLY appealed to me, as did the rush to make sure I was happy and pleased, eagerness to run an errand, post a letter, help me out. I almost don't want to write this review because I dread everyone knowing about it and it becoming more expensive (what happened to Number Sixteen in South Kensington, once a sweet little find, now an expensive place...)

The decoration was done more in modern haunted house \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all the wood had been stripped and painted very black, the colours on the walls were deep purple and the curtains were in deep brocade red. The sitting room had a number of burning candles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is normally such a nice touch but with the current decorations only made the hotel look more sinister. For the two days we were there, we saw none of the former staff members. The new staff, while very nice and accommodating, they did lack some of the professionalism one was used to at Number 11. In checking out, I asked if the hotel had changed owners. The reply from the desk clerk (yes, now there is a hotel front desk!) was that it had been taken over by a new owner who had redecorated it. When I indicated that the old clientele might not appreciate the new, very dark, decoration, she responded that the new owner was looking to change the clientele. I suggested that they could have informed the old clients before coming of this decision. When I went downstairs to the dining room and looked at the pictures on the walls, I would not suggest you take children to the hotel. Oh, one last thing, the price has also gone up.
