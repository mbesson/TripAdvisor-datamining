But when it comes to finding an affordable hotel in a good location for under $100, that's a different story. There are a lot of scary places and hotels way off the beaten path. And what may only look like a 15 or 20 minute car trip on the map can often turn into a 2-hour nightmare on LA's infamous roads. That's why I have chosen to stay at the Comfort Inn whenever I want to take a few days in Los Angeles beyond what work will pay for. (I actually get to stay in many of the city's finest hotels for work but I'm not about to spend $300-$400 on my own nickel!) The Comfort Inn is literally right next door to the city's Metro station that's just a few quick stops from Hollywood and the Kodak Theater. IF you don't mind a long trip, you can also take the train(s) to LAX, but it's at least a 1.5-2 hour journey. It's also on several major buslines, including the Beverly bus that goes all the way through Beverly Hills and connects to busses that'll easily take you to Santa Monica and the ocean. But what really keeps me coming back is the service and staff. Peter the manager is a great guy and his team are all efficient and courteous. They also offer FREE internet and a breakfast that includes eggs, sausage, waffles, toast, fruit, cereal and yogurt. The great irony is that the breakfast and internet would cost you an additional $30 or $40 bucks at least at the hotels that charge $300 and up a night! Finally, the rooms are very clean with a flat screen tv, and a really nice shower with a massaging feature, a refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave right in the room. Don't be concerned when you arrive - the street and outside could concern some people who haven't stayed in Urban hotels. But once you get in the lobby and are greeted by the staff, the experience will be a very good one.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBig rooms, good location\u201d", "Author": "CornwallS", "ReviewID": "UR118491861", "Content": "We stayed here for one night and everything was just right, including the price.

We took the LAX Flyaway to Union Station $7 and then the Metro Line red ($5 day pass, $20 for 7 days) to Vermont/Beverly Station. The Hotel is one building away to the left from the Metro station. We were greeted but a pleasant guy on reception and quickly checked in. The reception area looked clean and modern, we then took the lift (elevator) to the 2nd floor, the lift did not look as modern and looked like it could do with some TLC. The hallways in the hotel looked in a good state if a little dated, the doors to the rooms could do with a fresh paint job though. The room was large with two double comfy beds with a bedside table and alarm clock between the beds, Two sitting chairs and table, A large unit containing drawers and cupboard below the TV, A large flat screen TV, Fridge, Coffee maker, Microwave, large walk in wardrobe (Closet), Ironing board, Iron and a safe. The room also had it's own air conditioning unit and free wireless internet access. The bathroom was a good size with a large mirror and sink area, toilet and a low level bath and shower The shower did have a strange attachment that produced a rain effect as one of the settings. The breakfast was reasonable including three cereals, a selection of cakes and pastries, bagels and bread that could be toasted and a waffle maker. There was also fresh fruit and plenty of juices and plenty of tea and coffee. A member of staff was regularly clearing up and keeping the cakes and pastries topped up. The area surrounding the hotel felt reasonably safe, we walked along Vermont Ave (Left from the Hotel) in the afternoon and found a selection of shops, including a small supermarket and plenty of placed to eat including McDonalds about half a mile up the road. There are also plenty of petrol (gas) stations along the road. The area after dark felt reasonably safe, we felt safe enough to walk from the metro station to the hotel after midnight. In summary - The hotel is a good location for travellers not using a car as it is in a great location on the Metro Red line that can take you to the Hollywood/Highland station where the Walk of Fame and Chinese Theatres can be found, Universal Studios (Universal City Station) and Union Street Station for Trains and LAX Flyway. The Hotel also has a car park and only a few blocks away from a free way. The not so good stuff - The d\u00e9cor might not be to everyone's taste yellow and green in the room. Some of the paint was peeling around the edges such as at the bottom of the doors, the outlook from a lot of the rooms is onto other buildings, the breakfast selection is limited compared to other hotels and the breakfast room is small. The hotel is not in the centre of Hollywood and is certainly not near Universal Studios compared to other Hotels.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poway, California", "Title": "\u201cHorrible place!

I stayed 2 nights at this hotel in February during the course of a school trip. We were a group of 3 teachers and 23 grade 9 students from Montreal that were on a school trip to California and the Grand Canyon. We had stayed in a Hampton inn in South San Francisco and then took a bus to get to LA. I had called the hotel a week before to ask them to put us on the second floor since we were with minors and we did not want them going out the window in the middle of the night. The guy on the phone assured me that everything would be in order when we would get there.....are you guessing the end of the story? Almost all the rooms were with a window facing a large balcony that other rooms could access. I immediately went downstairs to have the issue resolved, even if it was past 10 o'clock at night, and I have to give thanks to the night manager that changed every room to other rooms that did not have balconies. He was not too happy but I did not give him a choice. I told him that they were minors and that it was his responsability to do so. The kids were very disappointed because we had been in a nice and clean hotel room in San Francisco and ended up in dirty hotel rooms that were scary. I did not sleep a wink all night because people were going up and down the corridor. I looked through the peephole and noticed that it was gentlemen with women. It is probably a hotel where prostitutes take clients. Let's just say that it is not a hotel where you want to take 15 year olds!!!! The rooms were disgusting....the curtains were dirty....the sheets were dirty....the bedspread was dirty....I was thoroughly disgusted with the place. It was also scary as hell. The only redeeming aspects are the fact that they switched my students to rooms that did not have balconies and the fact that they allowed us to have a pizza party in their breakfast room. We came in late from our day of sightseeing and did not feel like going out to dinner to a restaurant in the area...did I mention scary area also? The night manager, Peter I think is his name, helped us find specials on pizza and the kids were so happy to come down in their pyjamas to eat pizza and talk until curfew time. Since we did not allow them to have parties in their rooms, the setting was perfect for them. I would discourage anyone to stay there.

Cannot comment on the free breakfast because we wanted to venture and check out the local eateries (recommend going to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffle -- YUM!) Overall, the hotel was okay and would recommend it. The BIG plus side is that it is right next to the Metro Red Line which will take you anywhere in Los Angeles. We just parked our car in the hotel and took the Metro (parking is below the hotel and is safe.) I highly recommend taking the Metro. It is not only clean and safe but also cheap! If you are staying in this hotel, then most likely you are on a budget, so the Metro is a great tip for you budget travelers. With the Metro we were able to go to Union Station, Oliveras Street, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Universal Studios, Hollywood & Vine, and other tourist areas. One way ticket is $1.25, but for a whole day it is only $5 (unlimited rides.) There are not a lot of restaurants near the hotel and I would not recommend walking at night looking for places to eat. Just take the Metro (literally less than 2 mins walk from the hotel) and it will drop you off in good restaurants in the area.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice Low Budget Hotel for L.A Area\u201d", "Author": "DivaSoloTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR65233936", "Content": "As a single female who had never been to LA before I traveled there for a conference and a mini 4 day vacation to check out some tourist sites. My conference was in the Hollywood Blvd area, so I quickly booked a hotel in the same area, but a month later found trip advisor and learned that my hotel was subpar and other accommodations in the area were either to much money for not a lot of features or to much money for seriously subpar accommodations (e.g.- bedbugs, renovation incomplete, horrible customer service, etc). I also learned through the LAPD website that the crime rate in Hollywood area was concerning, as I would be heading back to my hotel between 8pm and 11pm a night after finding a place to eat dinner, safety was optimal for me as I was alone. So after reviewing over 12 hotels in the LA area I booked this Comfort Inn hotel, as most reviews were good and the bad ones were from people who didn\u2019t do their research first and had \u201cDiva\u201d like high expectations for a low budget hotel in L.A. I would recommend before booking any hotel go on \"Google Map Quest\" and take a street view tour of the address to see what the area looks like. Why I picked this hotel and what I liked about it was as follows: 1. I picked this location because I was using public transit for my entire trip including going to Santa Monica, Long Beach, The Grove, North Hollywood (Universal Studio\u2019s & Jay Leno Show) and to and from the airport which is easy and cheap. Comfort Inn is literally 20 to 30 steps from the top of the stairs of the Vermont Subway Station. 2. It is located on a very busy street even at 11pm at night (cars and people are there) so you don\u2019t feel isolated. 3. For the price point of a low budget hotel in a large city like LA, I found the front desk clerks to be very friendly, receptive and made me feel welcomed and that they valued my business. I was able to ask them any question no matter how ridiculous and they answered it with a smile. 4. I had very low expectations for my room so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the door. There was a nice flat screen TV, large dresser with marble top, small clean fridge, microwave and coffee maker. My only advise is make sure the fridge is plugged in before putting any food inside and make sure the temperature gauge is set to #6 or more as your food won't stay. 5. The bathroom was clean, had a nice marble counter over sink and housekeeping always changed my towels and I liked the presentation of making it look like a fan. It's those little details that are nice. As an eco-friendly conscious person I liked the little sign on my night side table that gave me the option to not have my bed sheets changed by placing it on the pillow each morning, which I used frequently. 6. There were no bedbugs or insects period which was nice. The room did have a mild odour but it was because the room was very warm with the sun shinning in, so any odor in the carpet rose but nothing offensive. 7. I liked the queen bed I had which was firm the way I like it and huge. The pillows were big and soft. If you\u2019re a light sleeper ask for a room on the side or back of the hotel. 8. I liked the complimentary breakfast which is included in the cost of your room. I didn\u2019t expect to find eggs and so I was pleasantly surprised to have boiled eggs at breakfast. I hope they someday offer scrambled eggs as an option here and there. There is also a Denny\u2019s literally half a block up the street you can see it at the street lights from the hotel door and as a person who doesn't really eat in Denny's I had my best dinner meal of my whole stay in there for a cheap price on my last night in town. My only complaint is that the ice machine is very loud as it make ice and louder when someone goes to take ice. I\u2019m a Canadian from a large city so I have been exposed to many cultures and have seen and worked with the homeless, so I personally don\u2019t have a fear of other cultures or homeless people. This hotel is probably not for people who come from small towns or cities where they have never been exposed to or fear other cultures (especially Hispanic and African Americans- *please note I am of Carribean decent so that statement isn't ment to be racist ) or of the homeless, as there are a very few homeless people in the area, but they never ever bother or talk to me. I personally felt safe around them and they knew I was a tourist because they saw me come out of the subway with my suitcase. If you\u2019re on a tight budget and contemplating renting a car; don\u2019t. I took the transit everywhere it only cost $1.25 to $1.50 per bus or train or you can pay $5.00 for a day pass and ride all day anywhere. Don\u2019t buy a week pass if you don\u2019t arrive on a Saturday as their week passes are preset to Saturday to Saturday for $17 I got ripped off by the check cashing place I bought my from on a Thursday for $17 and they didn\u2019t tell me it expire on Saturday. Overall, I would stay here again as for the price point and location (especially to public transit); I was able to spend that extra money I saved touring and shopping.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cIf you are looking for a nice, clean, relaxing hotel experience...this is NOT it.\u201d", "Author": "hailea3", "ReviewID": "UR63652775", "Content": "If there is anything good to say about this hotel, it would be that it is very close to the red line metro train and the beds had decent comfort.

We were looking for something budget and close to downtown. This is not the worst hotel we have ever stayed at, but its pretty darn crappy. Here are the details, you decide if you would stay here.... 1) We had to pay a $4.25 \"surcharge\" and $5 to park in their lot, on top of the fee we already paid Travelocity for a one-night stay. $10 bucks for no reason, without being disclosed when we booked?!?!? 2) We booked a king bed and when we got to our room we saw 2 fulls. We went down to get the rooms switched and it was a HUGE DEAL! They said that what we book online isnt guaranteed, and we get whats available when we check in. Our paperwork clearly said king, not \"standard room\" or anything that might be misconstrued. 3) The furniture was nice at one point, but it is all dinged up, dented, and the paint is missing. The bed spread is nice, but the curtains are covered in crap. There are stains everywhere on them. It really makes me wonder how clean everything else is. 4) The free continental breakfast looked nice from the outside, but there were a number of things wrong with it. The waffle maker excited me, but the batter was all wrong, no matter how long you cooked them the middle was eggy and wet. The orange juice was fake tasting and overly sweet. No peanut butter for the toast. Cereal was stale tasting. Front desk did not care. 5) It is not in the best area. A family next to us has a 3 year old boy who kept a toy gun tucked into his waistband and \"fired shots\" at breakfast. Cool. Not sure why previous reviewers had good thins to say??

The hotel did overlook a road which may create a problem for light sleepers, though with the aircon on we didn't notice a thing.

The breakfast area was also scrupulously clean and all food was at the right temperature (cold if it was meant to be cold, and likewise for hot foood and beverages) even though we arrived late in the breakfast timeframe.

Certainly wouldn't recommend the stay for a relaxing holiday, but it is ok for a night or two at the right price. Reception staff were reasonably friendly so no complaints there.

The room is really very very nice, clean, comfortable and well maintained. I paid AUD $284 which is about US $205 for 3 nights which I thought was a good deal through Expedia the only thing about this hotel is that they have a few extra charges they charge upon check in which I think was something like US $5 per day for parking and US$2 each for the in room safe and unlimited local calls, adds up to just over US $9 per day which even with these added is still good for Los Angeles and the quality of the room. I guess if you don\u2019t have a car you won\u2019t pay the parking bit, I just would have preferred it to be added to the rate I paid through Expedia. The room was a little smaller than most other area motels I have stayed in, but was big enough, very comfortable kingsize bed but extremely high off the ground desk with reliable wifi available free of charge, 32\u201d LCD TV, not the greatest selection of stations but ok, small fridge and microwave, really nice clean bathroom which I suspect has been recently renovated. The bathroom has a shower tub combination with a shower curtain which I am not a huge fan of, but the shower curtain had magnets sewn into the bottom which kept it in place against the metal tub and that worked really well. Really nice linens on the bed and enough good sized towels My room fronted onto very busy Vermont Avenue and this may be a problem if you are a light sleeper but didn\u2019t seem to bother me during my stay.

The parking area under the hotel is a bit tight and one morning there were more cars than spaces, so that could be a problem. If you have never been to Los Angeles the area the hotel is in may be a little off putting but it is typical for a large urban US city from what I can tell, you probably won\u2019t want to go walking around late at night but if you are using a car which you really do need in Los Angeles the location is good with easy access to the freeway a few blocks away and a metro station is on the same block.

The coffee can be variable from watery to normal. In the room there is an issue whenever someone next door or above you flushes the toilet or has a shower/hot-tub... you can basically hear the pipes/water... and loud! Also - being an ex-smoker it was mildly annoying to be placed in a room in which the entrance was on an open-air balcony (most room doors are indoors)... therefore making it a meeting place for all smokers late into the night - the associated chattering and smell of smoke annoyed me at best.

Plus it could connect to downtown very quickly. There was also a bus on that corner that went very near The Grove and further towards Beverly Hills.

Also, of the three Pepsi machines, only one was working at the time, but it was fine because the Circle K across the street provided all of our snacking needs. All-in-all it was a great stay, especially for the low, low price, and I will totally return next time I'm in L.A.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cgreat deal, great location for exploring L.A./Hollywood\u201d", "Author": "amiellen", "ReviewID": "UR24702599", "Content": "This is a good budget hotel, the complimentary breakfast was just the ticket for a group of teenagers.

IMHO, for the money this place offers good value. Because of the economy and its impact on my travel budget, I had to find a nice, clean place to hang my hat, be in an acceptable location for access to the general area (Hollywood, Studio City, LAX, etc., and be secure; all that for a reasonable sum\u2026 and getting that \u201creasonable sum\u201d element on track can be a daunting task in Southern Cal\u2026especially for a last minute booking. Because of the comments on this board, I was steered here and fortunate to get into this hotel on short notice. The location is good with quick access to the 101. My room was clean and well appointed; everything worked. Bathroom was nice; towels were abundant. The furniture & carpet was updated and fresh. There was the requisite in-room safe to store my laptop and other valuables when necessary. As previously mentioned, the beds were very comfortable and the general atmosphere was pleasant & quiet. My room was towards the rear of the facility on the 2nd floor, so you may want to request a room away from the front which faces North Vermont Ave. (a busy city thoroughfare)\u2026 if you are extremely noise sensitive. The wireless internet connection worked without any glitches and is included free of charge. There are numerous restaurants and grocery stores nearby and one can walk if you\u2019re so inclined and /or feeling adventurous. I would not recommend any late night strolls, but I found the area to be OK; no Beverly Hills\u2026but no slum either! There are lots a cool Asian-run businesses everywhere around. Parking is typical of any big city; there is a reasonable $5 per night charge\u2026 but it\u2019s covered, well lit and I never had a problem finding a parking space, howbeit tight (leave the Suburban at home unless you have major parking skills (lol) . The Manager, Peter, was always helpful and customer support was good. The included breakfast is simple and apart from the fruit and fruit juices, not orientated for maximum healthy living as I like\u2026 but it was OK to fill the gap. (I would love to have seen some bran muffins & oatmeal thrown in the mix; then it would have been AOK for me!) I found this to be a clean place, with good bed in a decently appointed room, together with reasonable security, easy access to the freeway system and inclusive of a staff that seemed ready to do whatever it would take to make my stay comfortable.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Brits_abr0ad", "ReviewID": "UR20962267", "Content": "This was the first hotel we stayed at on a three week touring holiday.

The beds were very comfortable ensuring a good nights sleep, which we needed. The rooms were clean and well maintained, although on our second visit we had to ask to have the bathroom door looked at. This was done immediately, which considering it was 6 o'clock on a Saturday evening and the maintenance guy had gone home was amazing. The desk staff were very helpful on both stays, even letting us use the main computer to check in at the airport because the one for guest use wasn't working. As others had mentioned the breakfast at this hotel is excellent, considering it's complimentary, in fact it was THE best of all the hotels we stayed in. The only problem is you have to get there early if you want a good choice and would like to sit down. We left it 'til about 9 am one morning and there wasn't a lot left and nowhere to sit. Not a major problem when there is a Denny's across the road. It's not the Ritz, but you are paying budget prices. It is excellent value for money.
