When we first walked in we weren't greeted by the front desk clerk, but was told to hold on while she continued her converstation on her personal cell phone (to which she was cussing and yelling in front of our 2 year old). After about waiting for ten minutes she finally got us a room which we asked for a room with one bed, she then said that she gave us a two bed room because it was \"bigger\". After having to drive around to the back of the hotel and walk up the none air-conditioned flight of stairs and hallway, we entered our room. The room smelled like smoke and dirty feet. The entire room was disgusting. They were cobwebs in ever corner of the ceiling, there were burn holes in the blankets, the balcony (which did not have a secure locking system) was covered in cigarettes, the lawn chairs that were on the balcony were covered in dust, the bathroom hardware was dusty and dirty, when we turned the shower on it smelled like fish, there was trash in the drawers from preivous guests, the channels on the television that were promised were not there (no kid friendly channels at all). On top of everything the fridge was broken which ended up spoiling a lot of our food that we have brought with us, the air conditioner had a sensor that only turned on when someone was in the room and the thing didn't even work because someone had broken the knob off. When we called down to the front desk (after fixing it ourselves) the front desk clerk said he would still have someone come look at it because \"we'd just complain about it again\". No one came and looked at it and we ended up sticking a ballon in front of the sensor to keep the room cool. But the worst part about our stay was the 2 guys trying to break into the bar and pool, which was right outside our room. They were drinking in the parking lot and going in and out of the hotel. There is no sercurity at all at this hotel, NONE of the locks on the doors work and we feared for our safety. Please do yourselves a favor and DO NOT stay here.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cFun for a family getaway\u201d", "Author": "karamyl", "ReviewID": "UR116121237", "Content": "This is a great hotel for a summer stay, especially with children.

We had a room on the 1st floor with a double bed at $63/night. The location was just okay. It was very central to Sesame Place and PHiladelphia but wasn't real conveniently close to either of them. The road has 12 lanes of traffic broken into groups of threes and is very tricky to navigate. When we got to the room I checked it over for any potential problems and cleanliness. Everything looked okay except the wall near the bed had old soda splash stains all over it. When I ironed a shirt the ironing board wouldn't fold back up and the cleaning lady never dis it for us either. The hotel entrance us not secure at all and the lock is broken. The 1st day things were okay but day 2 was AWFUL. I put the card on our door for the room to be cleaned. The options on the card are \"sleep in\" and \"freshen up\" I made extra sure it was on \"freshen up\". We led for the day and when we returned at 9pm our room had not been touched AT ALL. I called the front desk and the woman was INCREDIBLY rude and said there was nothing she could do because housekeeping had all gone home. The best she could do was bring us some towels. I was irate. They should have someone on duty to take care of problems like that. What angered me most was she seemed to think I was lying that my card was on \"freshen up\" as she claimed the housekeeper reported it as \"do not disturb\". Things were okay to that point but that put me over the edge. I was a GUEST. when you are far from home and living out of a hotel with a toddler you need to have things like the trash done EVERY day. Her attitude and unwillingness to help was UNACCEPTABLE. when we returned on our 3rd day everything had been cleaned (except the soda stained wall). The bed was hard as a rock and the rooms smelled musty. The hall was hot and stuffy and smokey and the breakfast was stale and bland. The pay phones (not for me but still) were both out of order. The one computer \"business center\" was also out of order. We never saw the pool. I would bit stay here again simply due to the ridiculously small rooms, hard bed and rude staff.

When we arrived for the first night the staff was extremely helpful in getting us our room. Upon arriving to our first room, everything seemed great, especially for a little older hotel. We did notice one thing though, that the security bar on the sliding glass door was broken. This really wouldn't have been a problem to us if we had been on the second floor. Being on the first floor in an unfamiliar area (not saying that its not a safe area), you want to make sure your sliding glass door has security locks. So we went back down to the front desk and asked to be relocated. The desk clerk was very friendly and had no problem relocating us to a second floor room. The room was very cozy for an older room, it had a fridge and a microwave. The bed was very nice, as well as the bathroom. We had great night sleeps for both nights that we were there. The room was remade when we returned from doing touristy things during the day. The breakfast was great. If you love French Toast, you will love the breakfast. They also have a variety of other items as well such as bagels, danishes, fruits, and yogurts.

My group had a flight canceled so we had to stay here. First off, it was the middle of summer & half of the a/c's didn't work at all - they just blew warm air. The place smelled like an ash tray, nothing - and I mean nothing - in the place was clean - everything felt sticky, everything in whole hotel was at least 20 or 30 years old, the carpet & furniture in each of our rooms were full of stains - all 20 years old or more and Lord only knows of what - and to top it off the shower & shower curtains were stained with mildew & not even cleaned. Seriously, you could take a dump on the floor, rub it in, & no one would be able to tell the difference.

It was in a good location,but 12 lanes of traffic and nothing too close to go to get anything. We wrote on our reservation that our daughter had severe asthma and needed to be far away from smoking and we arrive LATE and we walked into our room and it smelled like an ashtray, so we went to the front desk and they got us another room next to the room we were supposed to have and we settled in an the room did not smell smoky at all. When I got up in the morning, to take a shower, there were snicker bar wrappers on top of the shelves in the shower and it was very dusty. WE have an 2 year old that is potty trained and I set her on the potty and there was a ring in the toilet and dust and dirt on the floor and the toilet was not clean... so I cleaned it myself. We went to breakfast and it was an egg that was rubbery and they had the SAME breakfast every morning. The only fruit were oranges and maybe a banana. They put 3 out one day. We were there for 6 nights and no variety. The only people that were friendly were the 2 cleaning people. One in the morning would smile and say GOOD Morning and the other one gave my girls balloons in the room after cleaning it one day. There was 1 women that was tall and crabby! The pool was nice, but shuts down @ 8 pm and they had volleyball leagues and they kind of got loud. We were in the way back and could not hear any traffic. Also, there were 5 stray cats they would hid in the woods and go into the dumpster and eat. So, I would not go back to that hotel with kids- The fitness room was OLD stuff and the treadmill did not work.
