{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Budget accomodation in central location We stayed 2 nights at the Flamboyan. The location is in a small street a few hundred meters from the Discovery Shopping Mall and the beach just behind the mall. The room was simple but clean with working A/C and a fan. The sheets and towels did show some stains however. Also the bathroom fittings were quite worn out. A complimentary breakfast is served in the porch in front of each individual room with a choice of toast and jam or indonesian fried rice. Airport transportation is also provided and is only 10 minutes away. For the price of around $30 a night I was not expecting much, so I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful gardens and even small swimming pool along with the individual patios for each room. A bit of renovation would definitely improve the place, but with an increase in price also I suspect. The staff, as I experienced throughout Bali, was polite and helpful.", "Date": "Apr 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR567314194", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "kane_paris"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d648139-r14828436-Hotel_Flamboyan-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "648139", "Price": "$164"}}
