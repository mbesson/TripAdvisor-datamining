Playa is quite a busy, noisy place - which is great if thats what you're looking for, but not if you need an early night (Jet-lagged Europeans take note!!). We stayed in the awful 'Hotel Labnah' in the centre and it was so filthy and noisy we moved hotel; we tried the Barrio Latino as we'd stayed there a few weeks earlier (can recommend this hotel too!), but it was full and were recommended the Hotel Casa de las Flores. The charming staff and airy & bright rooms absolutely saved the end of our holiday, for which I'm eternally grateful! The room (24) was really nicely decorated, had the best shower in Mexico and, most importantly, was very clean. I've read reviews of this place saying it was noisy (I read one review where someone complained about birdsong - hilarious... damn those evil birds!!); I didn't hear a peep out of dogs etc... maybe I'm just a heavy sleeper, but I wasn't disturbed by anything. The girl on reception made us feel really welcome, she even came out of the office to come and have a chat with my girlfriend who was waiting in the courtyard with our bags; which I thought was a nice touch. We also spoke to (who I think was) the owner/manager - who again was very friendly and approachable. The breakfast could do to include a few more items; as it was just cake, coffee & juice, but outside of that I have zero complaints. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants peace and quite in charming surroundings and who doesn't mind a 5 minute walk to the main drag. PS.

Everything is very convenient and cheaper than in the more fashionable part of town - laundry, restaurants, internet - and you are living in the real Mexico, not in a gated resort. We are quite talkative people and easily got into conversation with the receptionist and later the owner, with whom we had several interesting conversations. The receptionist was very helpful, assisting us to book a hotel in Vallodolid, our next stop.

The room was perhaps the largest hotel room I've ever had with large windows and a very pleasant, simple decor set in a wonderful little courtyard.

After a five hour bus ride we smiled when we opened our room to find that someone had taken the time to fold the towels in the shape of a swan. I'm writing this review mainly because we were nervous after some of the reviews we read online. The owner did hang out in the reception/lounge area (this is her home, afterall), but she was helpful and friendly. It is run much more like a little European gasthaus than a 500 room Marriott with a professional concierge. Several other reviewers complained that the beach towels the hotel provided were tiny. They must have seen this and made amends, because the ones they gave us were enormous. (really too large) The pool is pretty and tiny -- more of a decoration than a place to swim. We swam in the ocean instead. The casa is located on an uninviting street about 5 blocks from the beach. Instead of a 3 minute walk to the beach at the pricey hotels, it's more like 7 mins.

I felt less of an intruder when I had to sleep in a childs bedroom in Asia when the place I was staying was overbooked. Huge sense of ennui from this place, like the owners just want to pay their bills under sufferance while the guests need to be either invisible or of sufficently glamourous quality to deign notice. As a not old and not that young European I can vouch that the same qualities mentioned in other posts are not confined to statesiders. Plus side, very near to collectivo stop for Tulum and or Cancun which is a very definite plus, and in a genuine neighbourhood which I am sure passes by many others in hotels in more beachside locations.
