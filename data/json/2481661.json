Their experience was one of a kind. They found the hotel very clean and cozy. The owners were extremely friendly; in fact, one of the owners drove my children, on his personal time and vehicle, to where they needed to go and brought them back to the hotel. Being first time visitors, to Puerto Rico, it was extremely important to find a hotel in a well located area with a decent price and this was it. I will recommend this hotel to anybody that's looking for a safe, clean, and reasonable accommodation and I look forward to staying there, myself, in the future. Keep up the good work and thank you for the kindness shown to my children.
