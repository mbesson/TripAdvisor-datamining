Actually, its located near the former wall, and the neighborhood is interesting because of its mix of post-1990 development efforts and the lingering effects of its former no-man's-land situation. But a U-Bahn station is just 5 minutes, and the S-Bahn about 8 minutes away; and you can even walk to the Nikolaiviertel in less than 15 minutes. The neighborhood is mixed industrial/residential, but safe; and what those who arrive by car will appreciate most is the ability to find a free parking space somewhere on the hotel's street. To reach the hotel itself, you need to use a key for the front door, for the elevator, and for the fifth-floor hotel; but once inside, there is a friendly receptionist, and everything is quiet, clean, and business-like. My room was fine in every respect, as was breakfast. And the bill was considerably less than one would pay for comparable quality in (formerly) West Berlin. Obviously, this hotel is not for those who like to be where the action is; but for those who like to leave the action behind when they retire for the night, and who can appreciate its \"different\" location, this may be just the thing.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newark, DE", "Title": "\u201cA good value...but\u201d", "Author": "smcolosi", "ReviewID": "UR21477006", "Content": "We stayed at the Alameda for 4 nights in Sept. When taxi arrived I thought we were at the wrong address! Saw sign for \"hotel\" but we were at some sort of workshop with busy workers about. With difficulty (had to climb to 5th floor to send lift down) we arrived. We were greeted by a pleasant woman who showed us around and to our room which was quite small but clean and adequate. She handed us 3 keys: one for our room, one for the lift and one for the hotel entrance lock. After 8 PM there is no staff reception and you must let yourself into the hotel. While there are security monitors and motion sensors I found this unsettling especially as on the first night we were the only guests as far as we could tell. Felt very vulnerable, especially if there had been a problem--getting out or needing help and no German. On other nights with other hotel guests I felt more comfortable. Must say, this did not bother my husband nearly as much as it did me. The hotel is in a sooty industrial area in one direction and quiet residential area in the other. No local pubs or restaurants that we could find. It is about 15 min. walk to nearest subway station which was 2 stops from the Alexanderplatz. The staff were nice and helpful. Breakfast was wonderful, varied and plentiful. The woman who ran it was most pleasant. The hotel itself is satisfactory and a good value--(why we stayed there) For the price I could \" put up\" with the locale , industrial feel and lack of restaurants. BUT... because of no evening desk staff I CANNOT recommend this hotel and would not stay here again. IF... they were to provide staff say, until 11PM I would consider changing my review.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cAbove average 2*\u201d", "Author": "freiberufler", "ReviewID": "UR7987099", "Content": "I stayed at the Alameda for one night in June. It was for business and the client wasn't prepared to pay more than about 80 euros a night. At short notice I couldn't find anything else closer to Mitte than this. At first I was a bit taken aback by the location - right next to K\u00f6penick power plant and in a bit of an unattractive street - but having travelled up to the 5th floor and being met by a very friendly lady my confidence was restored. I was given #8, an L-shaped twin room which was immaculate. The bathroom was very clean, but like another reviewer commented before me it smelled a bit odd, probably due to the lack of good ventilation. It was quiet save for the thunderstorm during the night. Breakfast was good and plentiful. Staff were very friendly and the place seemed very well kept. I ended up paying 75 including breakfast. My taxi into Mitte was about 10 euros, so I don't know how long public transport would have been to the main attractions. For those trying to find a well-priced hotel in Mitte I'd say this would be a good second or third choice - the location is a bit off the beaten track. But overall it was well above what I expected for a 2*.", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago, il", "Title": "\u201cA little out of the way\u201d", "Author": "crazyhorse99", "ReviewID": "UR5448754", "Content": "I just stayed at this hotel for a few days last week. Traveling solo, I was first put in a room (#8) with two single beds and a little balcony, which was okay, but the room was an awkward narrow shape, and the balcony is shared with another room, so there's not a lot of privacy if you want to have the balcony door open to get some air circulation). They put me in another room with a double bed (#10), which was a much nicer use of space - a better room. The bathrooms in both rooms were immaculate, but they both smelled a little mildewy (though I saw no signs of mildew). There is handsoap provided by the sink in the bathroom, but no soap (or shampoo) in the shower, so make sure you bring your own. The hotel is between two subway stops (Jannowitzbrucke and Heinrich Heine-Str on the U8) and it's about a 10 minute walk to either one, which is convenient. But the area is quite desolate - there are no cafes, shops, nothing within the vincinity. And while my Berlin friends said the neighborhood is safe, I didnt feel comfortable walking from the subway station to the hotel at night by myself - it's a little too quiet. That said, it's very noisy in the mornings - the hotel is at the top of a five story building (I should mention here that there's a convenient lift to the fifth floor), and the courtyard of the building is in use by one of the businesses, so there was a lot of noise and commotion in the early morning. If you are an early bird, this won't bother you, but bring ear plugs if you want to sleep in. Overall, it's not that special or cool or hip of a hotel, and I think it was overpriced in comparison to similar-range hotels that I've stayed in. I would choose something a little more centrally located next time, in a more useful area for hanging out.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter.UK", "Title": "\u201cStylish & cheap\u201d", "Author": "Rich2", "ReviewID": "UR4735200", "Content": "We loved this little hotel in East Germany.

Both were very friendly with inexpensive food. U-bahn & S-bahn about 5 to 10 min walk. Can walk to the 'centre' but better to hop on the U-bahn, as quite a distance. There was no problem with the surrounding area and the walk back in the evening was quiet and uneventful.
