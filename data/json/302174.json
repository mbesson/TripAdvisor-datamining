Regal is awkward to get to from taxi point of view, and has way too many loud tourists often in the lobby area, but general facilities for business are ok, the Internet has improved a lot, used to be poor, the general restaurant is very average and noisy, the expensive one is so so, and the gym is a bit pokey and stuck away at the end of a hall in B3 level, no windows, but ok equipment. I have tried cheaper...they are all definitely 3 star levels, I have tried more expensive, and they just are no different, so overall the Regal remains pretty good value for money for the area, just keep your expectations in the middle.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "dentalbuddy", "ReviewID": "UR139618467", "Content": "I make it a point to check tripadvisor before we book into a particular hotel. The reviews for this hotel were generally good but everybody commented on the long waiting time at the front desk for checking and checkout. We arrived on the 31st August and expected a long wait. But, to our surprise, we were shown our rooms in less than 15 minutes after all formalities. The friendly lady at the front desk was very cordial although I can't quite recollect her name. The other staff are not always smiling though and could don a smile when they recognize hotel guests.. The room was very clean and big enough for HK standards. The outstanding thing was the room was nicely laid out and very inviting. The bed was even more comfortable giving a good nights rest after a hectic days shopping. Tried the Wifi, but had to pay for it and I took the 24 hour option on the advice of the front office staff based on their reply that the 24 hours is not 24 hours from the time of first login but will be based on usage. Unfortunately, exactly 24 hours later, my login expired. Check out was equally fast needing less than 10 minutes flat.

The best thing about it was that it was close to the station and relatively central. In terms of things to be aware of - the service is hard to comprehend, maybe it is just the way things are done in HK but we were hoping for international quality. We had free shuttle service to and from the airport included in our room rate, yet we were told on arrival to the airport that the service is booked out and it was first in, first served. After a difficult and partially lost in translation conversation to the concierge at the hotel, there was a spot on the bus found for us. When we finally got to our room at the hotel, it turned out to be a smoking room. I was surprised no one double checked this with us. Being a non smoker, it was intolerable to be in the room. In addition, traveling with a friend, I have requested two single beds configuration but the room we got had a double bed and we were told there were no other rooms available until the next late afternoon. The guy at the reception asked me if i would mind to share the bed with my friend! We got a fold out bed in the end (at 'no extra charge!') and were relocated to a different room the next day which was good I suppose. We didnt use the restaurant facilities in the hotel - it didn't look or smell that appealing. The roof top pool was basic but ok and so was the gym in the basement. It could do with a little more air conditioning - with three other people working out, it was quite stuffy.

We arrived late at night from a long flight, being in Causeway Bay means it is quite a journey from airport even if you go by MTR and taxi, for a short stay Id definitely stay Kowloon side. Our room was ready and we were surprised at the size for a four star in Hong Kong. We particularly liked the long window seat which was a perfect place to put our suitcases. Nothing else was terribly spectacular about the room , though I was also pleased that we had a separate shower. Everything was clean and in good condition except the air conditioner, the noise was dreadful. We tried turning it down but it made no difference so we turned it off all together which then meant we woke in the middle of the night boiling hot, we turned it back on and just had to put up with noise. The other negative we discovered was the lift, how slow can a lift be? We wasted so much time waiting for a lift. To get to the pool you had to take two lifts, one to the Clubroom floor and then change to take another to the rooftop where the pool is located. As pools go in Hong Kong this is a nice one with no high rise blocking the sun, but what lets it down is the lack of service and the pool furniture, four sun lounges and two tables total !! When we got to the pool at 9am two of the sun loungers were being saved , which seemed ridiculously unfair that the pool guys allowed this, when clearly there is not enough lounges to service guests. We stayed by the pool all day enjoying the sun but not the service. The two pool boys did nothing all day, they didn\u2019t even check the water as they claimed to do every two hours. The two sun lounges being saved were unused for 3 hours whilst other guests had to sit on the concrete, this is outrageous. At every other hotel we have stayed at in Hong Kong pool staff come out regularly with cold towels, and cold water, no such service here. There is a water fountain inside the pool reception area with paper cone shape cups, that is it. Alternatively you can do the long wait at the lift to go down two floors to wait for another lift to take you to your room to get a drink and then do the waiting for lifts to get back by the pool, very poor. At lunchtime we wanted to order some food, we had to go searching for the pool attendants as they were sitting inside doing nothing, certainly not being proactive in offering menus to guests at lunchtime. Then when we made our choices we were told we had to phone ourselves , seriously what were those two pool attendants being paid for , certainly not service. Foolishly we ordered chips with our meal because obviously they had to do the long wait in the lifts and so were stone cold when they arrived. As there are only two tables in the whole pool area and both were being used some friendly guests allowed us to share their table. The dirty plates were still piled on the table from the previous diners, no one had moved them , so we put them on the floor to make room for our plates. When we left the pool area 3 hours later all those plates were still on the floor and piled on the table, such dreadful service, still it was marginally better than the gym which has no service Again after a long wait for the lift heading the other direction to the basement this time, you get to the gym. Access is by keycard and whilst there is a long list of gym rules, including no children under age 12 without supervision and guests must wear appropriate gear this didn\u2019t stop 5 kids obviously under the age of 12 in thongs using up all the cardio equipment for a bit of a laugh leaving serious excercisers wanting for a machine. Once on the cardio machines the tv monitors needed rebooting but of course because there was no one supervising no one knew. We went to the gym on four occasions and every time it was unsupervised and the tv monitors didn\u2019t work. One night we ordered room service, whatever you do, do not order the bolognese sauce, the chef clearly doesn\u2019t know that Bolognese means a tomato based sauce.. this sauce had no tomato and was grey but worse had been flavoured with chinese five spice..served with pasta it was inedible. We wouldn\u2019t stay at this hotel again, besides the fact Causeway Bay is not the best location to stay with little decent shopping around, limited restaurants and devoid of any atmosphere that is Hong Kong or Kowloon the hotel just doesn\u2019t provide any service, where so many others in similar price bracket do.

As we arrived early around 1230pm, the lady told us that the check in time is 2pm and we have to come back at 2pm to check in, she gave us a note with hotel room number and informed us that when we're back at 2pm we can just show it to the front desk again to get the room key.

Personnel in Hong Kong hotels can never do enough for you. However, at this hotel I sustained an injury by falling in the shower. The floor of the shower is not suitable for the purpose it was designed - extremely slippery when wet. They do provide a small bathmat that is inadequate for the area of the shower floor. As a direct result of the hotel's failure to secure the safety of the shower for their guests, I fell and severed an artery in my wrist (I am only 34 years old so this is not expected). The injury was of a serious nature and all Duty Manager\u2019s showed concern and agreed taht the bath mat was too small for the shower area when they inspected it. I had to attend the hospital and a Doctor gave me stitches and presented me with a bill for 7600$. I then gave this to the hotel, given that the staff had admitted liability. However, when I met with the VP for International Sales, he refused to accept the liability that his staff had already admitted and refused to pay! Just to add insult to injury, the hotel delivered additional 4 mats to my room to cover the whole area, 2 days after the fall and 1 hour before I checked out! A sure admission that there is an inadequacy in their bathroom set up (see attached). I was astounded. 5Star hotels build their reputation on caring for their guests. My bill for the room was double the cost of the hospital bill (I was staying in their Club Floor) and yet the person at the very top of the Regal Hotel group does not live by the standards set by the industry. Super disappointing and totally out of character for the usual high standards set at HK hotels - in fact 5Star hotels internationally. There is something terribly wrong when the person running the hotel and the group does not live by the 'Your Satisfaction Is Our Goal' mantra that is posted in their email signature. Shame on you Regal Hotel and I feel sorry for your staffs that were undermined by your arrogance and inability to handle my case fairly. Your staff showed genuine concern and apologized while you were too scared to admit your faults.

I highly recommend taking the Trams as they traverse the length of Hong Kong island and are amazingly cheap at 2.30 HKD which is about 30 cents US (!!) and offers a slow, relaxing view of the city. The tram stop is just outside the front door of the hotel. The nearby area is very busy at all hours of the day and is, I suppose, part of the Hong Kong experience. If you prefer Starbucks or McDonalds, they are also closeby. A public sports field and the Hong Kong Central Library are about 5 minutes away. There's a jogging track at the sports field which has a soft surface and is good for joggers not wanting to run through the streets of Hong Kong. The hotel provides a shuttle service to and from the airport which is very convenient though travel time is long--about 1 hour 30 minutes as it makes stops at other Regal Hotels and has to make it's way through Hong Kong traffic. If you decide to take the MTR from the Airport, you get off at the Causeway Bay station. On my departure I decided to try the MTR Airport Express which was also very easy to do and took maybe 30 minutes. I didn't try any of the restaurants, gym or pool facilities as I was busy shopping, eating and sightseeing during the day and even evenings. Our room was spacious, well-appointed, beds were comfortable. An electric kettle was provided and the bathroom provided a shower and bathtub. There's a refrigerator which contained drinks and snacks. An in-room safe deposit box was available for use and it was large enough to fit my 11.6 inch laptop, other electronic gadgets and valuables while we were out. Our room was quiet and I slept well. There's also large screen TV. The hotel was well maintained and the lobby area is quite pretty. The christimas decorations are now up and are quite beautiful.

Mr. Farmer is an excellent host with a strong team in the executive club, special praises to Angela Mak, Minah, Andy, Oscar, Billy and Edgar (very good man - made me felt so welcome with a phone call and then setting up the wifi booster for us) and the rest of the team that made our stay so warm and friendly. We really felt at home with a lot of support and help from the team. The rooms are being refurbished, so there will be noises. When we checked out, the room next to us was having its carpet changed, and this means that Regal is upgrading as much as they can to make it a great stay. The toilet paper is thin but then again you can ask for more toilet rolls, not a problem. The water pressure was good, although we could not adjust it and the room was cosy. Whenever we had problems, we called housekeeping or reception and was always provided a quick response. well done to the team. Swimming pool looks nice we didnt swam but the view from the roof you can take good pictures of the stadium. Great View! We were provided Room 1910 during our stay from 30/10/2011 to the 3/11/2011. I feel very strongly that this hotel has a very good future and is blessed with a caring GM. We spoke to the GM when he was in his rounds one morning at the breakfast lounge on 31st floor on the bad internet connection and in the evening, we were provided with a booster and we had no problems connecting after that, too bad it happened on the day before we checked out though. However, we had dinner at the chinese restaurant on the 3rd floor on our last night and we just wanted to note that the welcome letter should be worded better as we thought the entire meal would have been the 15%-30% discount but we found out that only selected dishes was discounted, therefore the fish we had was not.. we didnt really mind but wished in future that on that welcome letter, to have it worded better to ensure there is no confusion. One thing we did pointed out to the lady taking comments on the 31st floor breakfast time was the lobby reception, at times it was like walking into a police station or igloo as the staff there could give you the coldest stare, as if we are not welcome even when they open the door for us to go out. This is subjective but I felt a bit uneasy every time we went downstairs and wish that the people was just a bit friendly. A smile is very important as most people is paying a lot of money to stay at the Regal, at least a thank you smile to say hey thank you for choosing Regal. We really want you back, I think a suitable customer service training will be good for the lobby staff, some of them do look like security guards, which is good, in a sense. , All in all, our next trip to Hong Kong, we definitely will come back to Regal. The beds are cosy, the room is large enough and you get good views from your room. If you are not happy when you are there, just speak to Mr Farmer, and as you can see from the replies, I believe he is making a lot of good things happen at the Regal. One last thing if you could let Andy from the 31st lounge know that we will hope he will be able to show us where is the special roasted goose he is telling us about. (he says it is as good as yung kee at central) It is always good to get a local to tell you where the good food is, Too bad Andy told us on our last day when we waiting for our shuttle bus to the airport, and Angela if you see this, thank you for all your help and concern, you work really hard, we appreciate it!

So I'm just back from a two day night stay at the Regal and despite all the bad trip advisor reviews I read before my stay I must report that I was not only surprised with the hotel but was absolutely delighted with it! First of all the hotels lobby is lovely and I was impressed the moment I entered the hotel doors, then after an easy checkin I made my way to the room where I opened the door to what was simply a gorgeous bedroom - very 5 star indeed. There was a plate of complimentary fruit and chocolates left for me too which was a nice surprise also. The next morning I used the roof top pool which boasts great views of the city. The pool area isn't massive with just a few longers so it I could imagine it could get very busy in the summer months. Its probably important to mention the rate I paid for the room- i paid \u20ac100 per night. I booked online... I actually think this was a deal to support the fact that they were laying new carpets in the hotel. I was on vacation in the city so this sort of thing doesn't bother me one bit. The only main dissappointment I had about the Hotel was the Real Palace restaurant on the 3rd floor. The food was very average and the staff werent helpful or even that nice either. Our table was wonky in that it was sloping to one side(my glass of wine almost fell on my lap) when I pointed this out to the staff they simply mOved the table around in the middle of my meal and werent very apologethic.they charge 10% service charge to the bill which to be honest I felt the meal wasn't worthy of.... Also the restaurant room itself is also very open and bright which results in a very clinical atmosphere, not the kind of ambience you'd expect from a find dining restaurant. The hotels located near the busy causeway shopping area... Just a two minute walk. The MRT is also close by as is Starbucks, McDonalds, and 7 Eleven is name but a few handy shops on the hotels door steps.

I keep coming back because I can find a good price online but every time I stay, it pisses me off how rude the staff are, especially on club floor.

Staying on club floor requires u to exit on 31st floor and take another elevator to 32-34 floors.

Oh yeah, the toilet paper they use, I fold twice so there is four layers, it rips very easy. You will end up with crap on ur hands if u r not careful. Went to Italian restaurant for late night snack.

The receptionist told me that I had not booked a room with two beds, nor had I booked a room with a third bed. I tried to explain to her the type of room I booked, the third bed I had requested and prepaid for, and the total US Dollar value I had prepaid - in order to explain that I had already paid for three bed accommodation. As I tried to explain this to her, she interrupted me several times, and her body language made it clear that she was not listening to a word that I was saying. I felt like she believed I was lying to her. Further, as I was trying to explain to her what I had paid for and the accommodation I was expecting, she asked me how much I had paid. I told her I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $611. She then had the audacity to take out a piece of paper, write down the rate in HKD for each of the three days, add the numbers together, and ask me what USD/HKD exchange rate I would like to use. Then, she told me that the value was nowhere near $611. This was pretty demeaning - implying either that I could not do basic arithmetic or that my short term memory was insufficient. The receptionist then told me that my room was not ready (it was 6PM) and that I would have to pay (for a second time) for a third bed, unless I could produce a confirmation from booking.com. I asked her if I could sign onto the internet to show her the receipt on my email account, but I was denied. She told me if I wanted to pay for the internet, I could show her the confirmation, or I needed to go find somewhere with free wifi to download the form to my iPhone. I was disappointed in the events that transpired. First, I was disappointed that a room was not ready at 6PM for check-in. Second, I was completely taken back at the way I was treated by the staff. Not only was the receptionist rude and offensive, but the doormen and the concierge were also not interested in customer service and friendliness in general. Third, I could not believe that the burden of having to work out the problem between the Regal Hong Kong sales office and booking.com fell upon me. Booking.com is the Regal Hong Kong's sales partner, and I believe that any discrepancies or issues should be worked out by the hotel staff and management, and NOT by the customer.

The airport transfer runs on a schedule with the 1st bus at 7.45 am which when you arrive at 5.30am means a fair wait. Whilst the transfer was fine we opted for the airtrain for the return journey as the return schedule meant sitting around the airport for far too long. We arrived at the hotel at approx 9am to be advised that our room would not be ready but we were offered access to the gym to change and then our bags were held pending our room availablity. Plentiful ideas for a local area exploration were offered by the staff. We returned at approx 11.30 to be greeted by the news that our room was ready. The room and its amenities were superb. We used the roof top pool which was a great way to cool off from the HK heat. The breakfasts were superb with many options from hot food to pastries to fruit to cereals. No complaints here. The best part of the whole deal was the use of the Club Lounge magnificently hosted by my new mates, Andy & Aki. If someone from the hotel reads this these to fine gentleman deserve recognition. They were very friendly, attentive and knowledgable about HK with many suggestions for our stay. When offered free drinks on the 1st evening they did not have my wife's favourite drink, Jim Beam.

That said this hotel is in a fantastic location and even the standard rooms are large and not cramped. The downsides of the Regal I would say is that it is in the midst of trying to better itself. One afternoon in dire need of a jet lag nap i discovered that the room above me was having it's floors drilled or something. A call to the manager had them stop work there and he even offered to move me to another room for my nap ( I wouldn't have had to move rooms just nap somewhere else which I thought was a creative solution) I echo the comments made by some others, the non-updated floors have that musty smell that happens in the tropics when the carpeting has been around too long. My biggest complaint with the place however is probably something that has to do with the owners or main managers. There just doesn't seem to be that level of service for a hotel of this caliber that you get at other hotels in Hong Kong and Asia. In the rooms are no fewer than 10 different cardboard advert tents cluttering up the room and bathroom. It feels like the hotel is really just selling you a room in order to sell you more stuff. It is very off putting. Also the wifi issue, horrible and expensive. TV too, they have what look like nice flat screen tvs but the signal and channel selection is really bad. It just seems that there a too many places they are trying to cut corners and it ends up landing in the lap of a less than great experience. If the management got their priorities corrected and put the guest first and not their desire to get into the guest wallet they would probably be able to charge more and get more from customers. One imagines the owners running around demanding answers from staff why they are paying for curtains to be cleaned or why is it costing $x to have a shower fixed instead of pointing in a corner demanding to have things polished better or insisting that carpeting with stains and smells be replaced immediately. You can just feel the cheapness of the owners in the hotel. I wouldn't not stay here again but i'd only be staying if I found a great deal on the room rate. The dumpling restaurant outside the main lobby btw is fantastic.

We only chose this hotel because of the swimming pool and close proximity to Causeway Bay shopping district. While the hotel is in a convenient location with tram stop out the front and short walk to MTR, this is probably the only saving grace. Hotel is in dire need of refurbishment and this extends to the rooms. The hotel is suppose to be 5 star - perhaps back in the 1980's given the mirrors, glass, marble and gold/brass fixtures and fittings now bordering on tacky. Our experience was more like 3 stars. We had pre-booked and paid for a 3 night stay in a non smoking deluxe room which we had subsequently confirmed by emailing the hotel. When we arrived we were told that there were no deluxe non smoking rooms available - and to compensate the hotel would be upgrading us to a suite - but only for one night which meant repacking our bags the next morning and changing rooms. After advising the hotel this was extremely inconvenient and our preference was for a deluxe room for the entire stay rather than have to shift rooms mid way, we were advised we could remain in a suite for our entire stay at no additional charge. The room was spacious but the fixtures and fittings very dated and whilst the hotel tried to compensate for this with the replica Florence Knoll sofa and armchair, there is still much work to be done. In terms of cleanliness, the carpet was stained and dirty. The bathroom had a very unpleasant odour and we were forced to keep the bathroom door closed at all times. The hairdryer did not work and when we notified housekeeping, rather than sending up a portable hairdryer immediately, they attempted to fix the existing hairdryer. It was was almost 30 mins before I was able to dry my hair (using the portable hairdryer). Floor is supposed to be non smoking, but the guests in the room next to ours were smoking. This became problematic as the cigarette smell was seeping into our room through the gap between floor and door adjoining the two rooms. To rectify this we needed to complain to reception. Hotel is suppose to have WiFi in rooms but the reception was extremely weak. Unlike most other hotels, the Regal HK did not offer free WiFi access in the lobby. Additionally, the cost of WiFi was on the expensive side with room WiFi being the same price as that in the lobby. Whilst the lobby did offer better reception, there was nowhere for guests to sit and relax without being obligated to purchase a beverage, as we were told the lounges were only for use by hotel cafe/bar patrons (and there would be a minimum charge of HKD $40 for use by hotel guests) You could probably describe this as a hotel popular with business travelers and large tourist groups from mainland China. The personal touch and customer service orientation were literally non existent. There are a number of hotels in the same area and whilst a swimming pool might be lacking, they more than compensate for this with features and benefits, contemporary styling and customer service.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surabaya, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cNever Ever Stay in The Regal Hong Kong!!!\u201d", "Author": "XoMartel8", "ReviewID": "UR113569900", "Content": "We regretted every second since we stepped into this hotel, we booked 2 rooms and planming to stay here for 3 days 2 nights, and our stay was started with rude treatment \u00a0and totally unprofessional local hire.

So they made us linger in the lobby, unfortunately,there are no seats for us to sit on and wai t for the slowww service, there are empty chairs in the lobby lounge but the sitting hostess said that we cannot sit there unless we consume, which i think is so dumb, they have a group of waiting guests (waiting for their slow housekeeper to clean the room) and we are not allowed to even sit on their chair. After 30 minutes of waiting time, the receptionist informed us that it will take them another 45 minutes to get both room ready,that means the rooms were not ready until 4 pm. After complaining, They offered 3 free drink vouchers for 4 of us at the lobby lounge which is the only seating area in the lobby (oh yeah, it's that area where we cant sit unless you consume). We finally got the room, it was small, old, and definitely need to be spring cleaned real bad. Lack of power outlets for us to use, they offered travel adaptor for A price.\u00a0 To make matter worse, they are having construction work done right above of our room, they were drilling holes all morning, they started at around 10 and yes we were still in the room and even maxing the tv volume doesn't even mask the noise a bit. We finally complained to the receptionist to make them stop for a while or at least work on something else less noisy, the rude receptionist persistently said no we cannot do that because they need to continue working till 6 pm.

Most of the hotels only had premiere and executive rooms available, which were priced really high. Then I went through my corporate travel agent, and managed to get the superior room at Regal Hong Kong hotel at a decent rate. They had a free shuttle service from Airport to Hotel which was very convenient.. though it took like 1.5 hrs to reach Regal HK hotel as it visited all the other regal hotels (kowloon and city) enroute, and dropped/picked other people. Once we reached Regal hotel, to my surprise, I was upgraded to Deluxe room which was wonderful. I was taken to 31st floor where they have a personalized concierge and visitors desk, and my check-in was a breeze.. My room was on 23rd floor and decently sized.. I had to rush to office immediately, so didn't explore other amenities much.. and once back from office, I was mad tired so hit the bed which was very cozy and comfortable, and the linen was clean and thoroughly washed.. I had a very sound sleep.. but next morning, I heard some banging going on outside which was quite persistent.. so I called the reservations desk, who said that there is some renovation work going on.. and they apologize for inconvenience.. I told them I can't sleep with such sound.. and after 10 mins or so, the asst manage (Ms. Karen) called me and she upgraded my room to a premiere room, and shifted me to 27th floor.. This room was pretty much the same as Deluxe room, except, it had a better view and a slightly bigger bathroom.. Since then, I had no issues with any renovation sound or anything.. They have a swimming pool at the top floor (34th floor), which is really wonderful. I just used it once, but the water quality was great, and temperature controlled.. They also had a gym, but I never used it.. The food at the hotel was great.. they had like 3 restaurants, but I only went to one of them on Sunday for the lunch buffet, and it was great food.. The room service was a bit sluggish, and once you order something, it took about 15 mins to get it delivered.. and the lifts too were a bit slow, but this could be due to the full occupancy and lot of people going up and down.. And the best part was that the hotel is right in causewaybay, which is the heart of HK, and a great place for all the shopping freaks..

OK I don't normally complain on this forum but let's start with the things I didn't like about this hotel : Firstly, the hotel design is flashy and overly ornate without taste - think mirrors on every conceivable wall surface, chandeliers hanging from all ceilings, elaborate \"baroque\" carvings on cornices and columns, and gold paint on everything else. There is a general muskiness in the air and the hotel seems dated (though clean). My room, despite being an executive room on one of the highest floors, was rather small with a queen sized bed, small work desk and cupboard and a 42 inch flat screen tv. The whole room somehow looked ridiculously yellow due to the copious amount of gold used on all walls and even the ceiling. Ceiling was high and there were nice views from the full height window - you could look out between some buildings, to the harbour. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on, save for my backpacking days way back then. The mattress is shockingly hard and thin - it feels like you are sleeping on a wooden plank with a thin layer of sponge laid over it. The pillows lose their shape once you lie on them and after a couple of minutes, you will find they have been compressed to the thickness of a pancake. I asked for a \"deluxe memory foam pillow\" from their \"pillow menu\" in hopes of a better sleeping experience. This \"deluxe\" pillow turned out to be as hard as piece of plastic, I kid you not - I must have misunderstood their description or maybe they have a different idea of what \"deluxe\" means. That said, the room, despite its awkward lack of aesthetics, taste, overall comfort and general sense of muskiness in the air, was clean and properly maintained with relatively new fittings. Service was acceptable, with prompt responses to some small requests, but there was nothing that really made you feel extra special as a guest. The good points are : The location - very conveniently located within comfortable walking distance (3 min walk) to Causeway Bay station and a busy shopping node. Lots of shops and local eateries in the immediate vicinity. Free shuttle bus to Hong Kong station (to get to the airport) which departs every 10 minutes. But be sure to jump onto the bus once you see it - if the driver is late on his schedule, he will just shoot off after waiting for just 5 seconds. That happened to me and the hotel manager just looked haplessly on. Free internet. Apparently they have a really fantastic Italian restaurant on the 31st floor but I didn't try it. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel because of the uncomfortable bed and the musky over elaborate design. The bed is really a dealbreaker for me because I think it's important to feel rested and fresh for your day of sightseeing.... Unless you get a really fantastic price for this hotel compared to Excelsior or ParkLane which are also in the vicinity, and you are only staying for a few days OR unless they do something about their beds and mattresses, I wouldn't stay there again.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "reise999", "Title": "\u201cDirty room, unprofessional staff\u201d", "Author": "reise999", "ReviewID": "UR53141463", "Content": "I stayed this hotel in Jan 2010 for two nights.

On the negative side - there is no bar; nowhere to relax unless you are in the 'club floor' (which didn't seem worth the bother to me); the wi-fi didn't work in the room; the internet was expensive (in many hotels internet is free nowadays); the toiletries are minimal (I spent the first few days going out to buy basics); the bathroom grout needed re-doing; the 'free' newspaper was indeed a free newspaper (the one you get at the MTR station); the door staff only ever opened the door near them (not the one I was going out of); the coffee shop looks like a gilt version of a staff canteen and the decor (personal taste, I know) is utterly vile. Oh & the pool is pretty crap too. So if you don't mind the decor and you need a room for the night - it is a good bet.

The check in was a breeze and the counter staff who assisted my check-in took less than 5 mins to settle me to my club floor. Before I left the counter, he assured me mine is facing a seaview.

The Club floor is from Level 31-35, where level 31 is the club floor lounge area. I was pretty impressed as they have 2 exclusive and private lift access to club rooms. You will require a key card to go to your floor, unlikely the rest of the non-club floors. I presume they have renovated fully their club floors as the carpeting and lighting are different from the rest of the floors. Of course, it smells so much pleasant. When enter my room, it is full of mirrors all over with high ceiling. It is trying to make the room looks bigger but i guess even without it, the 29 sq ft room still acceptable for me. I was pretty impressed with their amenities. They have ipod system, DVD player, coffee blender and a large 42 inch LCD TV. They have all I want to have in this room for a relaxed holiday, apart from shopping of course. Their bed is queen size, though at the hard side, but it is still ok for me. Most interesting for me, is that they have a pillow menu! You can choose different types of pillows for your stay. This is definitely a plus point for the hotel. The bathroom is equiped with a rain shower (quite strong) and a triangular shaped bathtub, interestingly they have included a rubber duck and bath salt for you to soak your body and enjoy it. There is no lock as the shower cubicle and bathroom door are glass walls. You may feel uneasy if you are sharing with friends, but couples or families are fine. They provided a digital weighing machine, and it can also measured your BMI, etc. This is so cool. As for the breakfast, you have a choice of taking at the lounge (with spectacular view while taking breakfast or teabreak) or the cafe. Both are equally good, so you do not worried about it. The cafe design, again it looks tacky, but still it is their style of the hotel. I just concern about their food, which is good enough for me in Hong Kong, though the main good food in Hong Kong should be their local delights! In addition to all, they provide free internet access, 2 PCs for you to use at their lounge, free rental of DVD, free shuttle to certain places such as airport, disney, their regal group of hotels, etc. in hong kong for hotel guests. Not to forget, their roomtop pool was recently renovated and oh my, the view is needless to say, breathtaking with the whole view of Hong Kong island city skyline... what else you need other than a soak in the pool side enjoying the wonderful scenery? Location is undoubtly one of the best in Hong Kong island where it is just near to any part of Causeway Bay. Overall, this is a very good hotel for me during my stay using their club floor facilities. Despite the checkout is a little longer, but it is still manageable with 4 front desk staff to take care of, as long as your time is not their peak period.

Overall an older property with older bathrooms, OK for a business trip but probably better suited as a tourist hotel, with a its great location in Causeway Bay. Pros - Fitness center has new equipment, is reasonably sized for a hotel and has been recently renovated. Includes 3 treadmills as well as other cardio equipment and some free weights and machines. - Bell service efficient for arrivals and catching taxis. - Served by airport express bus from Central or a HK$40 taxi ride from the airport express train station at Central (at HK$100 the airport express is generally the fastest way from Hong Kong airport compared to HK$400 for a taxi). Regal also has a bus direct from the airport but that only runs every 60-120 minutes and can take over 90 minutes for the trip. - Good breakfast buffet with a selection of hot and cold western breakfast items plus some asian food choices. - Housekeeping was prompt when an iron and ironing board was requested. Cons - Didn't find the bed that comfortable, and despite air conditioning the room was humid in June. - No complimentary bottled water in the room and tap water not recommended. Instead hotel minibar charges HK$45 for a 500ml bottle of Evian (by comparison, HK$6 will buy a 1,500 ml generic bottled water at the local Wellcome grocery store a 5 min walk from the hotel). - Hotel laundry is also expensive, at HK$75 for a shirt. With the humidity,if you wash anything yourself it may not dry in 24 hrs. In summary, hotel somewhat overhypes itself on their web site and reminded me of an older, somewhat tired out Vegas hotel.

In fact, if you like shopping it's an ideal location! The hotel contains several restaurants. However, we only ate at the restaurant on the first floor and although the food was very good it was quite expensive. There are plenty of other decent and cheaper restaurants in close proximity to the hotel.

For example, the last two times I was in Honk Kong for work, I stayed in both the Shangri La and the Peninsula. I moved to the Regal after being displeased with a previous hotel for a 4 night stay, and although its not anywhere near the standard of some of the other higher rated hotels, it is still worthy of its 4* status. The location is excellrent, within easy walking distance of Causeway Bay. The gym is need of a little work but I have seen a lot worse. The rooftpop pool is very pleasent. The decor is not old-fashioned, it is in a 'Regal' style. It is the way they want it to look and I felt that although it was nice, it was trying to be a little too opulent for its own good. I don't know about what type of room the previous reviewer stayed in because my room was very large, with two double beds, floor to ceiling windows and a very spacious bathroom, which had a corner bathtub and seperate shower. Apparently each room has a huge individually commisioned painting above each bed, above ours was one of a butterfly, which at first I thought was a little garish but grew to rather enjoy it. If I was travelling on a budget, or if I couldn't get into the nicer hotels then I would stay here again.", "Date": "November 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cThis is never a 4* hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3985163", "Content": "We visited The Regal Hotel in Hong Kong in February and thank God it was only a short stop on our trip. The Hotel is rated as a 4* hotel but I have stayed in better hotels that were only rated with 2*! The decor is so terribly out of date, the rooms are incredibly small and every time we turned the lights on they blew. The gym was located in the basement of the hotel and was in a tiny room that consisted of about 4 machines. In fact every aspect of this hotel was old, grubby and needs a huge overhaul. The only positive asecpt was the staff, they were friendly, polite and extremely helpful.
