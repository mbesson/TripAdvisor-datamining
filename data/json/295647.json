Great price, toaster oven, microwave, phone and wifi worked well and were a nice aspect to the condo. The other areas of the condo definitely need attention. The overall look of the condo, inside and out needs serious attention and updating. The deck outside was nice, but all you could hear is the pounding of the music below from senior frogs. The chaise lounges, chairs and cushions were all rusty and dilapidated. The boogie boards were already broken and unusable. Wear shoes as there was glass and raised \"nubs\" of concrete to stub your toe on. Inside, the living room furnishings were very uncomfortable. The cushions were very worn (you could feel the frame through them)and the coverings were faded and not clean. Air conditioning in the living room worked well. TV worked well although hard to hear over the thumping music down below. The kitchenette was below average. I understood via reviews that this condo was \"very well appointed\". Not sure what happened between then and now, but we were disappointed. All of the stuff in the kitchenette seemed like a mish mash of odds and ends. The refrigerator was difficult to regulate, too warm or too cold and froze our fruits and veggies. It also would have been nice to have a broom to clean up sand that inevitably was brought into the condo. So, I used the painbrush under the counter with the dustpan. The bathroom was fine and clean. The shower was impossible to regulate. Very low water pressure - ok fine - but the the water was either scalding hot or cold. There were more than enough towels, but when they replaced them with clean ones they were sour smelling. The bedroom - AC never worked well and had a horrible sour smell. The management company came up to clean it but it never would cool. The pillows were very nice. The bed - very hard. Sheets were clean, but the comforter was dirty and faded with crusty stuff dried on it. The sour smell I am speaking of is not the musty smell of humidity while in the caribbean. This is a sour smell like forgetting to get your clothes out of the washer for a few days. All in all, I feel the condo needs some updating and attention. Certainly it was very well priced, but the pictures on the website do not accurately depict the current condition of the condo. If I had to do this trip over again, I would have saved up more money for an a nicer condo or all inclusive resort.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful ocean view, BUT noise from Senor Frogs very loud\u201d", "Author": "snorkel4314", "ReviewID": "UR102561274", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at Plaza Marina D2 for a week. Absolutely amazing ocean and beach view, and the condo itself was very nice. However, Senor Frogs open air nightclub and bar is down below the condo, and they start playing music about 10:00am, and it continues until 2:00-3:00am. About 8:00pm the volume gets turned up even louder. So you get to listen to this continually. I suspose if you shut both sliding glass doors on the balcony, and cranked up your tv or your own stereo, and turned on the air....you might be able to muffle it a bit. But that kind of defeats the purpose of an ocean front condo, doesn't it? Nice breezes and all. We had never been to Mexico before, so were not aware of the noisy reputation Senor Frogs has. Now we know. Rented this condo from VRBO, as the price was good, and the location looked great. The website also advertised a private, fresh water jacuzzi on the balcony. Well, there was one, but it was dirty, there was no plug for the drain, and only cold water. We asked the management about it, someone came up, said they would 'get a plug', but nothing materialized. The website mentioned that Senor Frogs was close by, but did not disclose it was underneath the condos. Upon returning home, I emailed the owner of D2. I told him he had a very nice condo with a great view, but that the noise problem should have been disclosed. He wrote back that he was currently staying in the condo, and could NOT hear any noise, and that he had not had any complaints about noise prior. He further stated that D2 is on \"the south end of the building, Senor Frogs is on the north end of the building, as far away in the complex as it could be.\" That is true, D2 is not directly over the nightclub, and it is the end unit, but the nightclub is about 2 units away, as there are only 4-5 units total above it. So, if a lot of noise doesn't bother you, this is the place.

However, I cannot be less than effusive about S5 at Plaza Marina in Playa del Carmen. First, This unit is the best rental value of any beach front rental in Playa. Second, the personable owner, Gwen, has thought of everything including complimentaries beyond shampoo and soap that most owners don't bother about. These included substantial towels, ice, bottled water, a functional kitchenette with plenty of glasses, plates, silverware, cooking utensils (if you can't afford the $3.50 breakfasts or 85 cent beef tacos), a direct phone line to the US, WiFi, universal cable. Third, the wonderful concierge, Angie, went out of her way to help us find whatever we needed within the town including directions to pharmacies, doctors and camera repair along with tips about tips, taxis, parasailing, inexpensive dining and stores. Fourth, the unit couldn't be located any better next to the ferry pier to Cozumel and at the southern end of 5th Ave. It also adjoins to Playacar. Fifth, I am a 61-year old disabled retiree and my nephew, a college student. We went to Cancun on a business/pleasure retreat the beginning of Dec. 2010. Both of us suffer from Tinnitis and were concerned that the unit was above a bar. However, unlike any of the other units, Gwen had recently installed new noise-proof sliding glass doors that amazingly eliminated any noise problem during the evening. Besides, Senor Frog cuts off just before midnight. While you're in Playa, don't bother renting a car. There's terrible parking problems throughout the city which was designed for the pedestrian and the local police are just waiting to stop and separate anyone from their money who drives a designated rental. Furthermore, there are very dangerous and unforewarned speed bumps and raised pedestrian walkways everywhere that will damage or destroy your struts and wheels let alone your alignment. Cabs are $1.65 (20 pesos) by law within most of the city. If you're coming from the Cancun airport, take one of the inexpensive buses. Cabs are $65 USD at most one way to Playa or back. There are inexpensive tours to the cenotes, beaches and ruins all along 5th Ave. Take a \"Collectivo\" which is the most comfortable and inexpensive. If you want a knowledgeable private guide for a little more, Gwen can even help you with that. If it's not reserved, you can't lose reserving S5. I strongly recommend this unit to anyone on a budget who doesn't have pets.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Onoway, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPlaza Marina Condos D2\u201d", "Author": "JanetandTony", "ReviewID": "UR89599672", "Content": "Awesome location.

The wonderful balconys overlook the Ferry Terminal; if you like to watch the hustle, just sit with a cool beverage and watch the ferries load and unload passengers and supplies.

It was a 2 br, 2 bath unit with a kitchen and laundry. from April 6-10, 2009. I am accustomed to staying inurn all inclusive resorts and I was a bit nervous because I was travelling with 2 adults and 2 children ages 7 and 6. We not only survived but we thrived. The savings were amazing! We are a water family and all of us wanted nothing more than to snorkel. We discovered a place called Akumal where we were able to swim and play with wild fish all day for $175p per adult. We swam here because I wanted to insure that the babies would swim in the sea water before I spent $75 us per person at XEL-HA. The location of the Plaza Marina was literally connected to Senior Frogs and the Ferry dock to Cozumel. All of the happening places to see at night were well within walkin distance for the family. The beach was rough, but Akumal was a placid, saltwater swimming pool. We rented a car from http://adventure-carrental.com/ and they were great to deal with. Their rates were all-inclusive, just bring your rental confirmation with you. We rented to condo from www.rentalsyourway.com and the transaction went really well. If you are going to PDC, keep in mind that there is a Wal-mart and a Sams club in town. There is no need to stress about what to bring.

We enjoyed the condos for the most part. The easy access to 5th ave was a big plus. you are very close to eating establishments bars shopping etc. Don't eat at Carlos & Charlies, it's right up the street. The food was terrible and the cost was very high, 380 pesos for lunch which was inedible. We enjoyed lunch at the Blue Parrot, Mandarino's (pizza and champagne), and Teqila Barrel. We found a little bar just north of 20th on 5th called El costenitos, beer was 19 pesos, that's about $1.35 U.S. Change your money at the banks, we got over 14 to the dollar all the time, only 13 on 5th at the cambios. I'm rambling a bit, sorry. The condo as I said was nice. They cleaned it everyday but Sunday and did a great job. We tipped 50 pesos each time. The music from Senor Frogs was a little annoying especially on Sat. night, they went till about 3 a.m. with a live band. All you hear is thump thump thump. Condo didn't have a t.v. in the bedroom so if you wanted to watch news or movie late at night it was difficult to hear. Beach is very nice and only about 50 yards away. They provided towels boogie boards etc. for guests. Free long distance to U.S. and Canada, as well as wireless internet was also included, very nice. No pool which we missed a little while we tanned on the deck, nice to cool off once in awhile. We've stayed A.I. in Cancun 12 times before and will never do it again, we will go back to Playa and buy our own food and eat out, much better choices. Went to Bad Boyz beach club Thurs. and Sat. to hear JJ and the Nasty Bastards. It was a full house and lots of fun. It's located between 4 and 6 on the beach, kinda hard to find.

We generally stay in hotels but as this was a last minute trip during the holidays (busy season), it was nearly impossible to find any vacancies in the area. A friend suggested VRBO and they were able to find us this condo. I'm going to detail everything about the condo regardless of importance. A lot of these things were minor to us but for others they might be important so I noted them. The unit would be good for a family of 4 as long as the kids don't mind sharing the 2nd bedroom. There are 2 full-size beds in the 2nd. One night my husband slept in one of them (due to noise on New Year's Eve) and found that he had to sleep diagonal -- apparently the beds are shorter than average (he's 6'1 but I found that at 5'7, they seemed short too). The master bed is comfortable. The mattress is covered with thick foam. The sheets were not high quality (def. not a high thread count). Toilets - The seats were made for a shorter bowl (see pics). A little weird but manageable. In some restaurants & tourist spots, they don't even have toilet seats though. The toilet in the master bathroom ran so after you flushed, you had to wait a moment and jiggle the handle to get it to stop. A minor annoyance overall. VRBO site says that the condo offers free wireless, and I suppose it does if you remember to bring a power cord with you for the modem. The wireless unit was plugged in but not the modem and I couldn't find a cord. Management was no help at all where this was concerned. I *believe* but am not positive (because I accessed the Internet thru my phone so it worked regardless of wireless) that the access code for Senor Frogs is beach. The unit is in the back of the building and we found that it was extremely quiet, despite Senor Frogs. There was one night that noise was a problem, and that was New Year's Eve. Interestingly, it wasn't Senor Frogs that was the problem even on NYE. There were a couple of guys that were yelling in the courtyard below the balcony for a while and the restaurant across the courtyard (on the 2nd floor, same as D5) played music at odd intervals and then stopped. That was it though. D5 is quite spacious. Toilet paper, soap, shampoo and large jugs of water are supplied. The taps in the condo are filtered but we used the jugs of water supplied anyway just to be safe. The electrical outlets are the same as the U.S. No hairdryer was supplied but with the humidity, I found that it was pointless to use one anyway (I'm not used to much humidity at all so if you're from the E Coast, you probably wouldn't notice it). Beach towels are also provided. We stayed for 7 nights and were told there would be 3 cleaning days and rec'd only 2. Not a big deal since we're not messy but good to know if you're expecting more. The 2nd bathroom, the water in the shower never got warm. It wasn't frigid but I wouldn't call it luke warm either. The kitchen and laundry area are nice. The laundry facilities are full size and worked fine. The information said there would be laundry detergent -- there wasn't but we asked about it and they supplied us with more than enough. The a/c is great and both bedrooms have their own remote controls so that you can increase, lower or turn off / on from whereever you are in the room. There is no beach in front of the condos besides a tiny little corner, thru the hall, across from Senor Frogs, but the beach is only steps away and very nice. The location overall was terrific. Steps from the beach, 5th Ave and the ferry to Cozumel but just far enough that noise wasn't a problem. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. It certainly wasn't the Four Seasons but we didn't pay for the Four Seasons and it is Mexico, after all.

The first week we had booked a one bedroom condo in the Plaza Marina Condos (D7). We found this condo from internet searches (VRBO I think) and selected it primarily for price and the waterfront location. The condo pretty much met our expectations as it delivered what it advertised. The condos are directly above Se\u00f1or Frog's disco bar and restaurant (mainly bar) and the owners are very up-front about this, but they claim the noise is not much of a problem. This is true most of the time, but we learned that the volume level can vary drastically from one night to the next. If they have a large group of party-hearty patrons, the DJ will crank up the volume and level of enthusiasm. It is loudest in the front room and patio. The bedroom is toward the back where the noise is less. Four of the five nights were OK and we could even sleep even without the air conditioner to mask the noise. But one night the volume was loud enough to disturb sleep even with all doors closed and the AC on. My neighbors in the condo next door were there over Los D\u00edas de Muerte and they said the volume was pretty bad for three nights in a row. Positives: Location - Right in the heart the tourist district. Walk to everything. Great ocean view and the ferries to Cozumel are right in front of you which are a lot of fun to watch. Easy walk to the bus station. Price - These are on the lower end of cost comparison with other condos and we thought it was good value, especially for oceanfront. Negatives: No internet - The owner never claimed the unit had this amenity so I really can't complain, but my laptop detected wireless networks associated with other condo units. I asked the condo management if I could tap into one of these other nets (I even offered to pay a reasonable access fee) but they refused. No beach - The picture of the condos shows a beach in front. The beach is no longer there as the waves come directly to the foundation walls. Either the water is higher, or the beach that used to be there eroded away. Not a big problem as there is plenty of beach just on the other side of the ferry pier, but you can't fall out your door to the beach as I expected. This is certainly not the fault of the owners or condo management as all of the beaches in PDC suffer from this condition. Patio privacy - The condos have nice large patios, but the only thing separating you from your neighbors is low wall about 1 meter high. The patios are narrow (~3 meters) so if your neighbors are out there when you are, having a private conversation is a bit awkward.
