Room had a TV. Free wifi - need to ask for the wifi card from the front desk. Breakfast was bread, cereals, coffee and orange juice. They had jam, butter and chocolate spread. Overall, okay.

There are a number of restaurants and coffee shops around, the majority of them are of low quality and relatively expensive, there are also a number of Indian, Arabic and Muslim restaurants that give the impression of low price restaurants although I didn't stop by. The neighborhood is a bit messy and is not really comfortable to walk around especially at night though nothing bad happened to me. It\u2019s also true to say that the neighborhood is crowded and has a lot of shops around. The staff at the reception was OK and those working in the breakfast place were better. The room and its toilet were clean but a bit aging (especially the bed sheets); the size of the room was very small to a degree that you can hardly move freely inside it. The breakfast was the poorest to eat and the hotel was full of young teenage travelers who were very loud For the money I paid, I believe I would have booked in a better place.

However, comfort is good, rooms are cleaned daily, there are numerous television stations etc. Breakfast is typical Italian: coffee, tea, croissant, toast with butter and jam.

As far as the check-in is concerned I was satisfied, because it was done fastly and without any problems. The rooms are bright and have simple but sufficient furniture. So, everything was nice and I thought that we had luck for a two star hotel since even the bathroom was clean. However, the hotel is not as \"good\" as it seems at first sight because later we saw that there was mould at the ceiling of the bathroom. Furthermore, it is impossible to take a shower without having the bathroom and all your cothes totally wet, which is very pesky. The breakfast is simple, just jam and rolls. Please beware of the juice they offer... it is not tasty and I was not sure where it really comes from. The dinner we booked for the whole week was in a restaurant in the street of the hotel and it was actually okay. The staff there were very pleasant in comparison to that at breakfast and at the reception. In general, the hotel has a really good location regarding the transport facilities (250 metres to main station termini) but the streets are noisy, dirty and the area is dangerous in the evening. Finally, there was one thing that made me suspicious: Where was the fire exit? I would recommend the hotel only to people who are not very demanding, who do not go out for clubbing (hotel closes at 2 a.m.) and who just want to visit the beatiful sights.

What a terrible surprise when we arrived to find that the hotel was truly nightmarish. The street noise was absolutely awful and the street itself undesirable (and it is possible to find a good hotel near Termini no matter what anyone tells you). The elevator was broken (which the staff didn\u2019t tell us) so we had to haul our luggage up 5 long flights of stairs. The hallways were like something out of a horror film, I kid you not. What a slummy building. Once upstairs, the room was NOTHING like the photos we saw online. The furniture and colors were essentially the same, but the room was dark, filthy, and the lights didn\u2019t work save for one scary institutional looking thing on the wall above the bed. The toilet didn\u2019t really flush well, there were hairs and other things I won\u2019t mention on the bathroom fixtures, and the bedspread was grubby. When we asked to change rooms, we were given keys to a marginally better room with two twins, but the street noise in that room was worse (if that\u2019s even possible) the room was still dirty, and the doors to the closet were broken so we couldn\u2019t access pillows and blankets. When I saw two large bugs run across the floor and into a hole in the wall, I decided to just change hotels rather than spoil our time in Rome. Although the reservation document listed no cancellation policy under the section provided, the very rude front desk clerk yelled at me, would not listen to my grievances about the state of the rooms, insisted that he was entitled to charge us for the room and actually said \u201cIf I can take your money, I will.\u201d You can find better hotels in Rome for this price.
