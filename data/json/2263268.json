Our bed was king size and confortable.We had free unlimited Wifi which keeps me connected with my Facebook :)My daughter loved the Jacuzzi bathtub. Breakfast was included and surprisingly selection of foods were very good! Everything was very fresh and tasty!! Location wise it was little bit far from the central are but taxi fair is not expensive. Hotel has own shuttle bus service. Though we didnt get chance to use of it.

I read their positive reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. I arranged for the shuttle from the airport for 140 Hong Kong Dollars (about $18 USD). I had to wait about a half hour, but I was the only one on the shuttle so it was basically like getting a cab for the price of a shuttle. The hotel is super clean, well air conditioned, and nicely decorated. I had a single room, which was tiny, but I know that is pretty typical for Hong Kong. Inside my room, I had an Ipod dock, a desk, and real nice smelling shower ammenities. I didn't realize it the first night, but my room on the 10th floor (? I think), actually had a partial view of the water. One complaint I have about the room is that there is a window between the bathroom and the bedroom area. I know this is popular in hotels as I've seen it before, but I can not understand why. Breakfast was great with really good coffee and service. The desk staff was really helpful with suggestions of places to go. The only suggestion that was off was that they told me that I would be able to see the light show (at the Harbor) from Victoria Peak, which was only partially true. You could see some of the spotlights, but not enough of the show to appreciate it. The shuttle from the hotel was easy to use and, at least at 9 in the morning, was not filled up. I usually took it to the Airport Express station (10 minutes away) and easily caught the metro or walked to the Star Ferry to get to Kowloon or other Hong Kong attractions. It was a little trickier getting back to the hotel. Usually I got back to Hong Kong Island after the shuttle stopped running so I took cabs which were not that expensive. Most of the cabs had not heard of the hotel, but I handed them the card with the hotel address as well as driving directions that the hotel provided and was always able to get home without a problem. Given the location of the hotel, I don't think it would have been feasible to walk back home from the metro. But I did pass construction for a new Metro station, so eventually it seems that the hotel will be walking distance to the Metro. Overall, I would recommend this hotel. I think it is appropriately priced for the quality that you receive. Even though the hotel is a little far from the metro, given their shuttle service and the cheep price of a cab, this should not be a deterrent from choosing this hotel.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel!\u201d", "Author": "keechhidalgo", "ReviewID": "UR138275926", "Content": "We thoroughly enjoyed our rooms which provided us with gorgeous views of the harbor, the city, and the mountains.

The rooms themselves were slightly smaller than expected - having stayed in other hotels in the Kowloon area previously. For a few days though, we had no issues. The hotel is a boutique hotel with a somewhat retro-contemporary style \u2013 similar to some European boutique hotels. The rooms themselves are quite compact (square footage is very expensive in HK so people should not be surprised at this). The bathroom has a decent shower with a \u201cwaterfall\u201d feature. As is the case when you go east, there is plentiful supply of bath accessories \u2013 such as toothbrush, slippers, etc. We could have done with extra pillows but did not bother requesting any. Our package included breakfast and while children may struggle for options, they have continental and some English choices \u2013 so you will get croissants, toasts, ham, juices as well as some local Chinese options \u2013 such as noodles. They also have a chef preparing omelettes a la carte and fresh fruits (melon, pineapples, peaches, etc) which is a nice touch. The swimming pool is a mere dipping one located next to the restaurant on the 3rd floor and was not available during our stay. Even if it was open, I doubt we would have wanted to use it \u2013 so don\u2019t plan with this in mind. Due the location of the Hotel in Kennedy Town, travel to the sights and other areas could be quite expensive. However, there are ways to keep costs down. Here is my suggestion for travel from the hotel: To Central Areas \u2013 Use the Hotel shuttle bus. This is free but needs to be booked in advance. You will be given a schedule of departure times when you check-in. Should this schedule not work for you, take a taxi to Central for around $30HK and the use the MTR/Buses from there. To Kowloon \u2013 Taxis cost over $100HK as you will need to pay the toll crossing charge. Get to Central (as above) and then take the Star Ferry to Kowloon. If you take the shuttle, this trip will end up costing you around $10HK for 4 /persons. There is a ferry every few minutes and you could also return this way. Overall, the hotel was good value for money and if you get a breakfast package, when added to the free shuttle and free WIFI, it is well worth considering in spite of some shortcomings.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAn interesting hotel\u201d", "Author": "JayDeeBee1950", "ReviewID": "UR132009309", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights.

At first, we were a little skeptical considering it is located a little farther away from the hustle bustle of the city. We were upgraded to an executive suite which was very generous of the hotel manager. They really went out of their way to cater to our every need and kept a close watch on our stay at the hotel ensuring that we were well taken care of. This was one of the best boutique hotels we've stayed at throughout our trip to Sout-East Asia. Highly recommended. Should not be judged based on location but rather the quality of service they provide. Very upscale rooms. Here's a list of the pros and cons: Pros: Great service Breakfast is absolutely satisfying Hospitable staff Great views of Victoria harbour Easy accessibility from the train station Shuttle takes you to the IFC mall which is useful as that will be your gate way into downtown, the subway station is located there. Only a shuttle bus ride away from IFC mall - which is a great way to spend an evening, shopping and checking out the restaurants. There's also a roof top patio where you can bring your own food to and view the stunning Hong Kong skyline at night. Away from the loud noisy and somewhat smelly downtown tourist area Cons YET still highly recommended: The shuttle bus only comes hourly The area that the hotel is located in is a bit gheto-like, not an area that really fits the hotels look and appeal How to get from the airport to the hotel: (Note the shuttle only operates till 8p.m so you should take a taxi to the hotel, its very inexpensive. Let them know you need to go to Kennedy Town, to the New hotel, Doorsett Regency). The airport is connected to a major Hong Kong (central) train station. Take some money out at the ATM machine (by the tourist information desk) You can take the airport train directly to either the Kowloon island or the Hong Kong island To get to Doorsett get off at Hong Kong Station (last station) Buy your tickets at the ticket desk which you can't miss when you're walking away of the airport section of the station. You have a choice of either buying just a round trip ticket for the airport train or buying a 4 day subway pass plus a round trip airport train ticket (it really depends on how much you'll be using the subway, we made really good use out of it because we didn't have to worry about getting around as much) The train is very safe and inexpensive compared to taking a taxi into the city. It's also a great way to see the city. Room for Improvement: 1.

I find this to be a real value for money hotel on HK island as the rates for most hotel are usually higher than Kowloon. Here are what I think of this place: Pros: 1. LOCATION: You pay for what you get. The location is not in the central of everything as Kennedy town is 6min by taxi ride away to IFC mall (HKD52-60), 20-min tram ride to Central station(HKD2.50) or there's free shuttle bus from the hotel every hour. Very convenient to get around and do take the tram ride. It's really interesting... 2. ROOMS: The rooms are clean and new.The feeling is modern design with an interesting door. There's an iphone charger in the room which is very convenient. The toilet has rain forest shower head and it is pretty awesome to use. I was staying in room 2207 and 2209 and we had a good view of the harbour except some crane is in the way on certain days and obstruct the view a litle. 3. FOOD: Breakfast was good in general, with a good mix of western and asian dishes. I like the pancakes and I find their salad selection good. Please turn up EARLY as we were there at 7.30am and there were still seats until it reaches 8am, the breakfast queue was all the way to the elevator. 4. SERVICE: The staff at the reception area seems generally fast and well-trained. We had asked for various information from where to board on the tram to what time does Ngong Ping open to where can we get dim sum in the neighbourhood. All our questions were answered attended to promptly and efficient and always with a smile. The staff are excellent with their knowledge. CONS: 1. BEDSHEETS: Okay I'm a little fussy about the sheets and here's what I noticed. There seems to be really fine black lint all over the white bedsheet on the first day I arrive and I supposed this is due to the bedsheet being washed along with other materials. I had to use my link remover to scrub off the black lint to feel okay as I have a sensitive nose. This is really minor. 2. SHUTTLE BUS: Do inform the young driver where you are going when you get on the bus as they make stops sometimes at Sheung Wan first and sometimes at the IFC mall first. So if you do want to make it to the correct stop, it's better to make sure you know when is the next stop. 3. FACILITIES: There's a pool next to the breakfast area and I was thinking who in the right frame of mind would do laps when the neighbours in the opposite block can see you. TIPS: 1. ROOM: There is a very long marble seating area next to the window so if you are having an extra guest in the room, you can probably ask for extra bedsheet and the third \"bed\" can be set up. 2. There's a ttv-insider channel which was very helpful as the days go by and I ran out of tourist places to bring my parents to tour, the suggestions on the channel were good help. The hotel has placed 2 guides/maps on the room desk and those were updated and useful. There's also small cards placed near the reception and breakfast area for tourists to pick up.

Apart from one issue, we had a pleasant stay. The bad: we were flat-out lied to when we checked in. We had booked a premier harbour view room with king bed four months before trip. On arrival at 10pm such a room was not available. Front desk apologised profusely and said we'd have to make do with two singles the first night before a double bed was available, but by way of compensation they would upgrade our room type. Fine: we were tired and just wanted to sleep. They next day they did push the beds together and made up with appropriate bedding. Two days later I wondered what kind of \"upgrade\" we had got and checked the hotel's own website. Imagine my displeasure when it appeared we had actually got a downgrade to a grand harbour view room, according to the respective photos on the web site (check it yourself if you are thinking of booking here: two windows in the premier room versus on in the grand). I went down and challenged the duty manager on this. Much muttering and shaking of head. He could not explain the discrepancy in the photos but kept insisting our one-window room was a premier room. I accepted his word but pointed out the obvious case of misleading advertising. As for the declared upgrade, the only way \"up\" would have been to a suite and our room, perfectly adequate as it was for a five-day stay, was most definitely a single room. The manager offered to shift us to a suite for the final two nights of our stay but the inconvenience of repacking and moving wasn't worth it and the offer was declined. In summary: the front desk of this hotel appears to have a regrettable tendency to assume the phrase \"upgrade\" will fool gullible and/or weary travellers into accepting something less than they have paid for. I'm still not sure whether we were victims of outright fraud or merely misleading advertising but the room we booked did not reflect the photos of that of the same category as displayed on the hotel's website.

The dining space was cramped and we were sharing a table with another American guy (fiance: \"our new dining friend\"), which we felt iffy about. Haha! I guess my tip here is to avoid the rush hour for dining. We only tried the hotel food once because there are lots of choices for food outside the hotel.

We didn\u2019t have problems with the shower drain or the sink drain. The rain shower had very good water pressure. I liked the glass partition between the bedroom and the bathroom because I could watch the television while brushing my teeth, and you could lower down the blinds using the switch next to the sink if you want privacy. There are also several light switches and it took us a while to figure which lights are operated by each switch. The beds were comfortable, too. As for breakfast, we were stuffed every morning. The food was delicious and served buffet-style \u2013 bread, sausages, beef steaks, chicken wings, congee, hash browns, noodles, dim sum, a selection of vegetables for you to make your own salad, eggs cooked for you the way you want them, boiled eggs, fresh fruits, coffee, tea, and juice.

This was not a problem for us, as there is a complimentary shuttle service to Sheung Wan MTR station and several bus lines which allow you to reach the Central area in roughly 15 minutes. The good: - Our room was immaculate, and well equipped with gadgets such as an ipod docking station. We got a free upgrade, and were assigned to a room on the 30th floor, with great views of the harbour. Bed was very comfortable. - The bathroom was excellent, and included a hydro massage jacuzzi and a separate shower-head with good water pressure. There is a glassed window between bathroom and the room, which can be covered by an automatic blind. - As mentioned above, the location of this hotel was not an issue for us. There are many buses which leave you at a bus stop which is less than 50 mts away from the hotel: for instance, buses #101 and #104 from Soho area, and #18 and #18P from HK Convention & Exhibition Centre. There is a nice Pacific Coffee Company located in front of the hotel. Free shuttle to Sheung Wan MTR (where ferry leaves to Macau) and Hong Kong Station (from where you take the Airport Express) runs all day through. Otherwise a taxi from the ferry terminal will cost around 45 hkd. - There was free wifi internet within the hotel's premises. As always, this is very appreciated. The not-so-good - Not really a complaint, but just a tip if you are planning to book in this hotel: when taking the shuttle bus towards the city, let the driver know if your destination is Sheung Wan MTR. Otherwise the shuttle bus will go first to Hong Kong station (even if it is farther away) and only after that will return to Sheung Wan to pick up any passengers.

Fruit was good, however, there was only two types of cereals: rice crispies and chocolate rice crispies.

It leaves from the hotel, stopping at HongKong MTR (right outside Airport Express), loops to the nearby ferry terminal and then stopping again at the MTR to pick up \"left-over\" passengers. HK MTR itself is walking distance to Airport Express and Central MTR and Central bus depot. Please note that the shuttle bus leaves the hotel ON THE DOT at each hour starting from 8am-8pm. It will arrive at the MTR at approximately 00.15 on the first pick up and 00.25 on the 2nd pick up. Wait outside at the Airport Express check-in, right in front of Starbucks. If you miss the bus or if it's full, the hotel is still very accessible by tram and bus. Multiple busses goes to central and the tram services runs across the island, past many places of interest but is a lot slower than the buses. Do equip yourself with an Octopus card as most of their transport systems use it. Forget getting the tourist Octopus card that gives you unlimited rides at 55HKD. You're better getting a normal Octopus card and topping up the value as and when you need. It's very convenient doing it at the MTR stations. Right in front of the hotel there is a small eatery that serves cheap and good food but you may have a slight problem if you don't speak Cantonese or Chinese. They serve the best milk tea I've ever had. Breakfast variety is limited but is not a big complaint for me. Rooms are decently sized for its prices and very comfortable. The room also comes with iPod/iPhone docks. Ask for a room on the higher floors that has a sea view. The hotel's location may not be at a central location but I'd rather pay the same price for a better quality room further off (as opposed to booking a small dingy room for the same price at say Mongkok or Tsim Tsa Tsui).

We got a free upgrade to a king-sized room upon checkin -- not sure why, but we were thankful just the same! The room was obviously new, very clean, modern and stylishly decorated. We especially loved the shower, with its rain showerhead. What impressed us most about the Dorsett Regency was the staff\u2019s eagerness to please. When I noticed an unpleasant plumbing smell in the bathroom, and wrote about it on TripAdvisor, within hours, the management had called us on the phone to apologize, investigate and offer us another free upgrade. The new room was much more spacious with all the nice touches the old room had to boot. I had also mentioned that the coffee seemed weak, and the next morning there was a marked improvement. A Pacific Coffee shop is just across the street on the way to the tram and bus stops in case you need your fancy morning coffee fix. While out exploring on our own, we quickly discovered that a tram ride to the nearest MTR station -- Sheung Wan -- from the stop around the corner from the hotel takes quite a bit of time. The trams are quaint, but not fast. Buses are more convenient, but are more likely to get delayed in traffic due to construction. When the Island Line of the MTR is extended further west into Kennedy Town, the location of this hotel will be much more convenient for guests exploring Hong Kong\u2019s Central and Causeway Bay and Kowloon areas. We'd probably stay here again, even though it tacks on a few minutes of getting started every day owing to the location. It's not hard to walk to interesting markets in Des Voeux and Queen's Road, but to get out of Kennedy Town on public transport, a little planning is required. It seems most of the buses heading into and out of Kennedy Town stop nearby, but two or three may come and go while you\u2019re deciphering the bus routes.

The bus service, with plenty of them available, can be reached with a minute's walk. The place was surrounded by restaurants of all kinds.

There is a lovely park half a kilometer away buzzing with morning activity. So location wise the hotel was great for me. The shuttle service of the hotel made the distance from city centre easy to negotiate. I found the driver of the shuttle smart, polite and helpful. I had got a harbour view room in the 28th floor. The view of the sea on one side with a docked cruise ship and a hill on the other side of my window made the look just stunning.

Thank you to Ms. Maggie Lam, Guest Relations Manager, who eventually granted our complimentary breakfast for 5 since the supervisor at the dining area told us on the first day we arrived that the breakfast is free and even asked us about the no. of diners and room nos. The concierge are friendly and thank you to Tom, the receptionist for extending our check out time to 6pm for 1 room only. They charged 1,000 HKD on your card for any incidental fees in which Christy, the receptionist, said they will revert it accordingly. We will come back if MTR is ready.

The bathroom is so spacious that there are two vanity basins. The rooms are clean and up to standard. Guess the bonus will be the good view of the harbour and high floor that they can offered. Although the location seem far from shopping area, the hotel provided shuttle service to bring us to the shopping area. If you ever needed a taxi, the hotel staff will fetch one for you.

I agree with previous posters that not many people know this hotel, and arriving from the airport was a little tricky, however, the Airport Express Bus A10 stops right outside the hotel. When I arrived well after 22.00, the welcome was very friendly, and my room on the 28th floor with a city view ( and a huge bay window to sit in) was stunning! Who cares that the rooms are tiny, the beds are tiny and that there is a glass wall between the bedroom and the toilet? It may be slightly problematic if you are sharing rooms as friends but otherwise, the room for me was to sleep in comfort, and sleep in comfort I did! The hotel appears brand new, with comfortable beds, lovely powerful showers, clean bathrooms and altogether comfortable rooms. The decor is somewhat flamboyant and kitschy (padded walls, plastic chandeliers and plenty of crazy mosaic tiles), and one wonders which wannabe interior designer has been let loose here, but it does not impede on comfort at all. The area the hotel is in is a friendly well-to-do area with not many tourists yet bus stops and tram are just around the corner, barely a minute's walk, there is a decent Chinese diner around the corner and a 24h Mc Donalds for late arrivals, and some very local shops and the ubiquitous convenience stores, too. The hotel also has a free shuttle bus into Central. Reception is friendly and very helpful (although not always accurate although this may have more to do that Seibu Loft has not bothered to update their stores on the internet yet) and they will go out of their way to help you finding your way around. I would definitely stay here again, a great choice in busy and expensive Hong Kong.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South East Asia", "Title": "\u201cHELPFUL STAFF\u201d", "Author": "tom_ume", "ReviewID": "UR121454683", "Content": "We stayed here for 9 nights in December.During my stay the guests next door were making a lot of noise at night till 1am by leaving the door wide open.

Took advantage of a special deal and stayed 6 nights. Checking in was smooth and quick, at the same time, I was given the password for the free Wifi. My room at the corner on the 9th floor was spacious by HK standard, with ample space for luggage and shopping, it overlooks neighbouring apartments but heavy drape addressed the privacy issue. The only noise issue came from hotel guests out at the corridor, there were no traffic noise at all from where I was, which was nice. The room is on a non-smoking floor but I found an astray in the room, wonder what message is the hotel trying to give? Anyway, it is nice to be in a room that doesn't stink of cigarette or moldy smell. I should note that the hotel opened in August so all the amenities are still in a good condition. The bed was quite comfortable, the linen felt good when rubbing against my skin and extra pillow delivered promptly upon request. The bedside and in-room lighting was good and the air conditioner does not blow directly onto the bed, making sleep very comfortable. The bathroom small but bright, was quite clean and comes with amenities such as hair dryer, tooth brush, comb and cotton bud. The only complain I have is the shower door doesn't do its job to prevent water from flowing out to the floor, leaving the floor drench each time I use the shower. Extra hooks for towels would be nice too. The wardrobe is small but has enough hangers and a handy in-room safe. The bar fridge was too warm and I did not use it for the duration of my stay, I should also note that the fridge was not noisy at all. Having lived in Kennedy Town, it was easy to figure out the public transports. Taxi from Central is approximately HKD30 and buses with terminus at Kennedy Town (notably no. 5) costing HKD3.50 to HKD6 from Causeway Bay, making Kennedy Town quite a convenient location. Kennedy Town is also a terminus for HK Tram, costing HKD2.20 per ride, the last stop is just 3 minutes walk to the hotel. To get across the Western Tunnel to Kowloon's Tsim Sha Tsui East, Mongkok and Jordan area, take the 906 'Lai Chi Kok' bus. There are also countless mini buses serving Kennedy Town from Causeway Bay, Mongkok and Aberdeen. The neighbourhood is local but friendly, the shops open till late and a couple of convenient stores that opens 24/7 nearby. A good restaurant for yum cha on Catchick Street called Kueng Fatt should be tried out, for those who fancy a Western feed, the water front end of Davis Street should be able to accommodate, or head to Percy, a deli opened by an Aussie, also on Catchick Street for good Western take aways.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cA good choice\u201d", "Author": "byjing0h", "ReviewID": "UR121412745", "Content": "Check in was very prompt and the rooms are clean, confortable, well-equipped and of reasonable size. The hotel is relatively new so all furniture and fittings are also in good condition. There is a glass window between the room and the shower/toilet. I\u2019m not sure what purpose it serves but there also is an electronically operated partition that can be drawn over the window by those who may want some privacy. The fridge was not switched on but that was promptly attended to by the room attendant. The breakfast menu does not change a lot from day to day but the food is of good quality. Free in-room Wifi is available and paid printing and copying services are provided at reception. There are plenty of convenience shops and eating houses (including McDonalds and Subway) surrounding the hotel. The hotel\u2019s website should be clearer about exactly where the shuttle picks up from at Hong Kong Central station. I took the Airport express train and followed the signs at HK Central station that pointed to the free hotel shuttles. It so happens that the Dorsett Regency is not one of the hotels serviced by those shuttles. The Dorsett has its own shuttle that collects passengers from outside the HK Central station\u2019s airport check-in counter. (Yes, passengers flying out of HK can check their luggage in at HK Central station). I eventually got into a taxi and found that the driver did not speak any English. I kept saying Davis St (hotel location) and showed him the hotel address. He kept repeating what I said as Daisy St \u2013until I gave him the hotel\u2019s phone number. He then rang the hotel and took me there within about ten minutes. The taxi from KH Central to the hotel was HK$50. That includes a $5 surcharge for each large item of luggage. The hotel shuttle is a white mini bus and as it has no livery it can be hard to notice the first time around. A sign on the front passenger side windscreen has the name of the hotel. On one occasion the sign was upside down. The shuttle\u2019s last pickup from HK central is 8.25 pm daily. The hotel does provide a very handy printout of the bus stops and services to and from its vicinity. A bus trip (Number 5x, 5B or 10) from HK Central is $4.40. A prepaid Octopus travel card is the best option for getting around on Kong Kong\u2019s excellent bus/train public transport system. You can buy it on arrival at the airport and return it when you depart. Any unused credit will be returned to you less a $7 processing fee. You can also buy an Airport Express return pass that gives you a return trip to/from the Airport to HK Central or Kowloon stations and upto 3 days unlimited travel on the train (MTR) network only. It costs HK $300 and includes a $50 deposit that you get back. You may use the same pass for bus travel also but only if you top it up for bus travel first. You can do that at most convenience stores. Compared to many other HK hotels the Dorsett Regency is a little out of the way. But if you use the free shuttle service and/or the cheap and efficient public transport the location will not be a problem.

The hotel is only a short taxi ride away from Central Station and the Star Ferry (taxis here are inexpensive) and the hotel offers a regular free shuttle bus which is really useful.
