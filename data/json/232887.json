We had got the SIT bus from Ciampino Airport to Termini station (8 euros return if booked online - which was really easy to do and you just print off your ticket). From the station it was a 5/10 min walk to the hotel, up the street with the market stalls, from the side of the station that the bus drops you off. Easy to find. We only had 1 suitcase and were fairly fit so it was no problem. The hotel was a bit of a strange setup in that there were 3 or 4 different hotels in the same building. The entrance to the Gabriella Hotel was on the first floor. We arrived at midday and were able to leave our suitcase in a locked room behind reception since we were too early to check-in. Then we went to explore and came back at 4pm to check-in. Our room was on the 2nd floor and to get into the corrider where the room was you had to get reception to buzz open the door. Which was fine but would have been easier had the room card key swiped open this door too! The room was small (the bed took up most of it) and the bathroom was fine (although a bit of a tight squeeze to get in the shower cubicle and not much room once you're in there!). Everything was clean though and we had a TV with BBC World Service so had something to listen to in English. Breakfast started at 7am so we got thereabout 7.30am and most mornings were there by ourselves. Only allowed 1 hot drink, otherwise you have to pay extra. It was a coffee machine which also had hot water for tea. Better to get a teapot and 3 presses of the hot water with your teabag than 1 small coffee. Fruit juice was the usual horrid watered down kind that you always get abroad. There was cereal & milk, yogurt, pastries, bread rolls, jam & butter, cakes. It was fine. The room was quite warm so when we got back for the day we tended to leave the windows open until bedtime just to air the room, however the traffic then sounded like it was in your room! The windows were quite soundproof though. There was an air conditioning unit in our room but no controls so you may need to pay extra for it. In summer you would definately need it. All in all it was conveniently located near to Termini station, close to the Metro and buses which were easy to use (1 euro per journey) and there was a Spar supermarket at Termini (close to the SIT bus stop). It wasn't luxury but we got 4 nights hotel with B&B and Ryanair flights for \u00a3250 each, so you can't complain. Would I stay there again? Probably would find a hotel an equal distance from Termini but on the other side, so that you are closer to the Colosseum, etc, but only to save my poor feet from all the walking we did. Please wear comfy shoes (I took 2 pairs which are normally comfy and my husband wore trainers and the soles of our feet were still aching - may be better with thick soled walking shoes since the marble floors of the Vatican, the cobbled streets and the uneven surfaces in the Forum, really do make your feet ache.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Frankieman65", "ReviewID": "UR126595954", "Content": "The hotel is ideally located in a very good position close to the centre but also not far to the main station for sight seeing around Rome.Nice, family-like hotel with pleasant atmosphere and good and helpfull service:the lady at reception was so helpful answering our many questions and recommending restaurants.

It might have happened because lady who was there every day (possibly a manager) was not in on that day. In overall we mainly were at the hotel during the night time, all day we were sightseeing, for the purpose hotel was good, there are lots of similar hotel in area, looks like all buildings/ flats are converted into accommodations as you can find a few hotels in the same building.

The mattress was so thin you could feel the springs, we had to pad the mattress with 4 blankets to get some sleep. We were charged a 20 euro deposit for the TV remote. There were so many paper signs in the hallways about what you CAN'T do, and to have a 2nd cup of coffee at breakfast was an extra charge. We ended up eating at a cafe in the morning. Then to top it off our plans changed so we had to stay 2 extra nights in Rome, rather then move to another Hotel we decided to stay, another huge mistake. We were charged 40 euros more per night, alot more money than the surrounding hotels. But worse was reserving a taxi to the airport. Now the city of Rome has signs everywhere max rate is 40 Euros, the airport transport was 20 Euro, but the staff said they can only make reservation with the taxi and said it will be 50 Euros because we were leaving at 4:30 am. We agreed to the price. The next morning the taxi was 10 minutes late, the driver went upstairs for another 10 minutes. No taxi signs on the car or meter. The driver took the long route to the airport arriving at 5:50 am (it's only a 25 min ride) our flight was at 7am. When we arrived he said the charge was 65 Euros. I had to call the hotel and speak with the staff on my phone at my expense while they argued for another 5 minutes. My husband took our bags from the trunk telling the driver to take the 50 Euros or we will call the police. What a horrible ending to a wonderful vacation. I will never stay or recommend Hotel Gabriella. The location was OK, close to the train station and all the sites.

Our first impression was that it was not even worthy of 3 stars. The desk staff was gruff and unhelpful, even when it came to finding tours to take while we were there. Rome happened to be very warm, even though it was May. When we asked the desk clerk how to turn on the air conditioning (the room was hot on our arrival), we were told that they do not turn on the air conditioning until June 1st. That meant that we had to leave the window open, even while out of the room. Trying to sleep at night was useless. The bed was as hard as a rock and the pillows were flat, like pancakes. That, combined with the loud roar of traffic (all night) coming in the open window, made sleep impossible. The bathroom was small & the tiny, corner shower leaked, soaking the thin step-out towel provided as a bath mat. The \"amenities\" were useless & we consider them equal to the ones put in dumpy, flea-bag motels in the US. Not only that, they would not even provide wash cloths, for use in the shower. The desk clerk told us that we should use the hand towels in the shower. the last night we stayed, the TV was out. Oh, there were also not English language channels, at least we never found a channel in English. When we asked the clerk for a channel guide, or at least what the English channel numbers were, we were told that he didn't know, because they change all the time. Just another example of their lack of service.

Hotel Gabriella is found at the first floor of a historic building which also comprises other hotels.

By saying that, I wasn\u2019t really too disturbed by the traffic noises despite our room facing the traffic. When we arrived we were able to immediately go to our room, if you\u2019re early they do have a storeroom to place your bags, which we took advantage of when we checked out. The staff at reception are very helpful despite the feeling that some look like they don\u2019t really want to be there. Location wise its fine, and on most days there is a little market across the road from it as you walk to Termini. We didn\u2019t feel worried at all about any danger, even later in the evening. It\u2019s probably just the right distance away from some of the other dodgier establishments closer to Termini, which seem to have drunks hanging round \u2013 watch your valuables around Termini. You may find some interesting looking people hanging around the front door but ignore them and get out and experience Rome! The room is very basic. I have travelled through most of the major European cities and this room was by far the most basic. Makes some French rooms like palatial in comparison. However the bed was comfortable and the bathroom more than adequate, except the shower always leaked meaning I flooded my bathroom more than a couple times. Sure you can\u2019t get any English TV channels but why go to Rome to watch BBC news? The breakfast \u201cbuffet\u201d was embarrassing. A tiny table with a basket of croissants and a basket of bed. A plate with cheese triangles and one with condiments. There were a few not so tasty looking cereals there as well and some very watery squash. They did offer you one free hot drink \u2013 order more and they will charge you. In fact they left specific instructions about this rule everywhere; it felt like school or something! The hot chocolate was brilliant, and as we both ordered it we got a big jug of it \u2013 more than one each\u2026 which I wasn\u2019t complaining about! The area has not many wonderful choices for restaurants. We went to one on the same street that spread out over a corner and it was awful. The one closest to the hotel, across the road and walk right about 3 minutes down was the best \u2013 it looks like a caf\u00e9. They had cabonara to die for. In fact everywhere else I went to in Rome had awful pasta in comparison, including pasta that was microwaved! In Rome? It\u2019s outrageous. So I recommend this place if you want to eat on your way back to the hotel. Overall it was a place to crash every night and sleep, which it did fine. Would I go back? No. I think this place woke me up and made me realise I would pay more and stay somewhere better.

It was on the inside facing a courtyard, but couldn't tell since the window/shutters couldn't open therefore no external light. The noise at night (from the youth hostel in the basement) and in the morning from the staff arranging breakfast was bad. Also, one day we were back at the hotel around 1pm, and the staff/family? were having their lunch in the breakfast room, loud talking, plates rattling, kids, screaming!!! Tough to have a lie down before going out again after lunch!! One good thing was the breakfasts, there was plenty of food and variety, which is a rarity in Italy. Also found the male staff ( son/father etc) not very approachable, luckily didn't have to ask them much since we knew are way around. All around, I doubt I will return to the Gabriella anytime soon.", "Date": "September 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place, Nice Staff\u201d", "Author": "leasildk", "ReviewID": "UR8081579", "Content": "I' ve recently been to Rome, and decided to stay in this small but very clean and well located place.

Overall I would say that hotel Gabriella is OK/good, certainly 2 star and probably 3. First the positives - Location -Whichever airport you come into - they'll all run buses to Rome Termini station , and this hotel is very short walking distance from there, so good access and fine base. Make sure you buy a metro pass and use it well...it'll save your feet! The staff are very friendly - its a family run hotel - and make you feel at home...the place is small enough that you feel you are being looked after personally. Our room was clean and tidy, good airconditioning and nice bathroom. Now the downsides - We paid around 120 Euros a night - and thats top price for what you get (you may get it cheaper if you're lucky!) - the room was very small (we had room 3) - just enough room for the bed and tiny TV - and although the bathroom was spacious and looked nice, things needed repair - broken hairdryer, toilet seat and tap. The main problem was noise in the morning - there is a market right outside in the street every day - and it woke us up at 6am setting up each morning...PLUS...the noise from the kitchen preparing breakfast was very loud each day. So...you were woken up each day EARLY! Make sure you ask for a quiet room when you book (if there is one!). Finally a tip or two for your Rome trip - AVOID the Termini car/bus park after dark....its v dodgy area - give it a wide berth! Walk through the station itself to get from one side to the other (its really nice inside!) - outside it's a center for local gypsies and drunks. DO take an open-topped audio tour bus ride around the city on the Red-line bus - a great way to see Rome. Dont be tempted to use the other open-topped buses - what they dont tell you is that they dont run nearly as often as the Red Line ones - so not as good for getting on and off. DO go up the dome at St Peters...the views are outstanding...but take the lift half way...you'll see what I mean!

We loved the breakfast every morning; croissants, pastries, rolls, meats, cheese, bread, cereal, yogurt, fruit, fresh juices. It was just a few blocks up from the middle part of Termini station, so very accessible for transportation. We didn't have any problem with the Termini area and it actually came in very handy. A couple of nights we got in late and there were several take-away pizza/kebob places open until 3am, a laundromat, and a pharmacy (I got very sick and this was wonderful to have right there!) all on the same street.

The breakfast was more than ok, excellent coffee, choice of meats, cheeses, yougurts, cerial etc, along with croissants and filled croissants. The area although busy was nt too noisey and outside, in the morning market stalls lined the streets which were fun and reasonable, a silk italian tie cost 5 euros! there are many excellent and fair priced restraunts, bars and snack bars in the area.

My wife and i staid for two nights at the end of May. As it was my wifes birthday and it was a surprise to her, i had to decide myself which hotel to choose. I faced two problems: First the hotel prices in Rome are incredible high and as we are anyway all day out and only stay at the hotel to change clothes, take a shower or sleep, i did not want to spent too much money for the hotel but safe it for sightseeing and restaurants. Second when i found Hotel Gabriella the reviews showed two sides of a medal - very positive ones and then some which were completely horrable. Being from the tourism business myself i understand that there are alway guests, who are not satisfied with anything and expect more than they are willing to pay. So when we travelled i was a little bit doubtful if this was the right choice. But i can assure you that if you compare the price-service-benefit ratio Hotel Gabriella is a good choice. I did not find any argument against it. And all negative reviews seem to me to be incorrect. Hotel Gabriella is situated some blocks (maybe 3-5 minutes walking) from Termini (main train) station. It gives you perfect access to all public transportation in Rome and is also easy to reach from the airport. Although some previous guest felt unsecure, we were on the way even during night time returning from Dinner or walking. We passed Termini station and all the side streets but never had the feeling of unsecurity. Everthing was ok. Be prepared that the building is shared by three hotels. Hotel Gabriella seemed to us to be renovated shortly and our room (according to the reception a standard one) was good. Relatively new furniture, clean room as well as the bathroom, not to much space to move, but sufficient if you want to use the Hotel for the purpose described. The breakfast was good, fresh rolls, cheese and ham, a variety of cereals, joghurt, fresh fruit and butter, marmelade etc. Coffee was great and you could choose either American, Capuccino etc. Staff was friendly and helpful, all questions were answered and i do not have any complaint.

While the accommodations met my expectations for a 2 star hotel, I was fairly disappointed with the service from the staff and it left me with a somewhat sour impression. The pros of this hotel are: 1. Rooms are decent size and the bathroom fixtures were new. The shower was especially nice (great water pressure!) and there was always hot water. 2. Our TV did not work initially but someone came in to look at it right away and it was fixed in 10 minutes. 3. It is 4 blocks from Termini station (about a 5 mins walk) and therefore, you have easy access to the metro, train station, buses, etc. 4. A variety of restaurants located along Via Palestro (same street as the hotel) and all are open fairly late (especially recommend the Bistro, we had a fantastic meal there). The cons of this hotel are: 1. Most of Rome's key sites are not within easy walking distance. The Colosseum, Spanish Steps and Pantheon are easily 20-30 mins away but you are close the Metro so there are alternatives. I simply personally prefer to walk most places. 2. The breakfast was good with great coffee but the service was awful. The tables were not cleared on a timely basis and on two seperate occasions, an elderly gentleman that worked at the hotel was quite rude to us for no apparent reason. On the first day he asked what we wanted to drink and i asked if they made cappuchinos or lattes (i had seen them on other people's tables) to which he rudely replied, i have coffee and milk, you can put it together yourself - then stalked off in a huff. He then returned to tell me very rudely, to put my yogurt container in the bins on the tables even though i had just peeled off the lid to start eating! The next day, he was behind the coffee counter when i walked by and he yelled at me, \"What do you want, coffee, tea, what?\" I was only pouring myself juice and had not even spoken to him to deserve such attitude. I noticed he had the same demeanor towards other patrons of the hotel so tried not to take it personal. 3. Rooms were not cleaned very thoroughly. I noticed on several days that they appeared to have restocked the bathrooms and re-arranged the towels but had not cleaned the actual fixtures.

Rome hotels are not cheap. Before we booked I wondered why the reviews fell into two camps, very enthusiastic or cross. Now I see why! Against: The hotel was being renovated. There was no ceiling in the passageway and work began there about 8am in the morning. We had wires and pipes sticking out of the walls of our room (to be fair, we did come back one day and find a radiator had appeared). Some of the wires looked longstanding, though. We did not wish to sit on the only chair in the room as it had rather a disquieting stain on it. Our bedroom was quite small and dark, we could hardly get round the bed. There wasn't a lot of storage space. The bed linen was clean but sparse - we only had a sheet and (for some reason) two thin satin bedspreads. The next day one of the bedspreads had disappeared. I found a blanket in the wardrobe but it was dirty and stained. The towel rail fell off in the bathroom. The service in the breakfast room was charming but sometimes erratic. For: the location is good, walking distance to Termini and lots of buses. The area could seem a bit daunting but we had no problems (apart from pickpockets at the bus station). The local cafes were friendly and the receptionist recommended a nice restaurant to us. The double glazing on the windows did a very good job at blocking out the traffic noise.The bathroom was newly done and the shower was fabulous, much better than our home one! The bedroom and bathroom were clean. The breakfast room was clean and light. The breakfast was good, but sometimes things ran out and they didn't notice for a bit, so perhaps that is why some people liked the breakfast and some thought it was sparse. The reception staff were pleasant. I think if the owners spent a night in each of the hotel's rooms they would see what small but crucial improvements could be made, and understand why they get mixed reviews sometimes. If it was me I would just add lots of huge mirrors, light and bright colour schemes, good lighting, better bed linen, and some contemporary posters. I would also move the furniture to minimise the effect of a large bed in a small room. I think if the renovations are completed to a good standard and they look at the details of the rooms they provide this could be a good choice for a few days in Rome. I think perhaps some of the other rooms might have been larger or better than ours. We wouldn't return to it as it was, though. We just felt a bit flat about our choice of hotel, somehow.

But, when my wife and I walked in...we honestly thought we may have had the wrong hotel all together. Thank God we were only staying for one night. First of all, it appeared that the Gabriella was undergoing some renovation and improvements. So, *perhaps* this review should be taken with a slight grain of salt if the room we stayed in was one of the rooms left they haven't gotten around to upgrading yet. When we tried opening the door to the lobby, it was locked, and we noticed a sign (handwritten on a piece of white paper) that the lobby had moved to another room. The new \"lobby\" was a makeshift office that was in the corner of another room (dining room I believe) that consisted of a man at a desk with a computer and phone on it. The man was nice enough though when we checked-in...and offered to help me with the bags we were carrying. The man from the desk took us to our room (on the same floor as the lobby), gave us the key, and bid goodbye to us at the door. When we opened the door to the room, we were instantly disappointed. The room had the a very cheap Motel 6 kind of feel. There was barely enough room to get around to the other side of our bed (that's how small the room was). It was dark, dingy...and again...very cheap looking. To make matters worse, nothing inside the room seemed to work: A/C: nope (thankfully, it wasn't too hot yet) TV: nada Lamps: only one of them worked Windows: hard to open/close Now, even though the room was dingy...the bathroom looked like it had been renovated somewhat recently. However, renovation doesn't necessarily mean better. This was perhaps the most poorly designed/engineered bathroom I had ever seen. First, the shower stall was just inches in front of the toilet...so if you were sitting on the toilet, you had to point your legs sideways just to fit in. Second, the sink faucet was so short that it barely jutted out beyond the rim of the sink. You literally had to jam your hands up against the sink basin in order to get underneath the faucet to wash your hands. (See included pictures). Who designs bathrooms like this? As I mentioned before, we were only staying there for one night...since we were catching a flight home to the US the next morning (this was the end of our Italy trip). And we definitely tried to minimize our time in the hotel room during that day. The area outside of our hotel didn't exactly make my wife and I feel like it was the safest area either. We did get up in time to catch the free breakfast in the morning...but we decided to pass on it when we walked by the buffet. Unspectacular to say the least. Overall, I would have to say that my wife and I were extremely disappointed. I hope (for the hotel's sake) that since we were only staying for 1 night...they decided to give us one of the worst rooms of the house. Still, if staying there means that you could be stuck with one of those rooms, I don't know if I would want to gamble to stay there again. We didn't feel like complaining and/or asking for a different room since: A) We were only staying for 1 night B) The Gabriella is supposed to be only a 2-star hotel anyways I was just disappointed that the quality of room didn't seem to coincide with what the TripAdvisor reviews was representing (which is a little rare).

The room itself was very clean, the bed was big and comfortable and the maids changed the linen everyday. The bathroom was also very clean. The staff were friendly and recommended a really nice place to eat too. Rome isn't too big so you can walk to most places, and Gabriella was in a good location. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "January 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertford", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable and convenient\u201d", "Author": "CarolJJ", "ReviewID": "UR3836592", "Content": "My teenage daughter and I wanted to stay somewhere central and safe in Rome and Hotel Gabriella fitted the bill nicely. Situated about 5 minutes from Termini Station on a quiet street, the hotel's reception was on the first floor. Our room was spotless, well-furnished and (I'm glad to say) air-conditioned. Staff were friendly and helpful, all spoke English and we could leave our bags at the hotel after we had checked out for some more essential sightseeing. The decent continental breakfast was served in a pleasant breakfast room. We shall definitely come here again.

We thought we could not go wrong with the great reviews!!! So we booked there. When we arrived and opened that hotel room door, we were slightly disappointed. Now we are not aware of what the other rooms were like but we spent the first hour in the room calling other hotels to get a better place, but they were all booked. (We later asked if all the rooms were a similar size and they replied that they were). Slight disappointment. We realised we should have spent \u20ac180/200 a night. The room was small. There was literally a few feet from the foot of the bed to the furniture. The decor was a bit boring with the usual lower end hotel style look, furniture was a bit bland. Walls in room were slightly dinged and torn a bit from use. The walls and corners of the walls were nicked and dented a bit. The glass on the table where the TV sat was cracked; the bar/fridge had a half consumed wine bottle in it. The air conditioner was not working. So we were forced to open the windows at night, which allowed noise in. Honking horns and revving mopeds. The hotel is also located by a main intersection, so we heard many buses and trucks, and it is also located by a university so that brought much noise and activity too. Sunday morning was the quietest. Because the air conditioning was out, we had to keep the windows open. When the windows were closed the noise is really blocked out good, but we roasted when the windows were closed. The windows do a good job of blocking out the noise though. The doors to the hotel close heavily. In the morning when all are coming in and out of the rooms for whatever, you hear the doors slam. Was difficult to sleep with the noise from the doors. Can be overlooked. The Bathroom\u2026small shower. There was some mould spots on the shower here and there, not a big deal though. The toilet seat was wiggly loose. The bathroom door open right on to the bed. There is no space at all in this hotel room. Me and my wife were stepping over each other as we tried to get around the room. There was a light out in the bathroom, no biggie but it just adds to the agg. There was dust and lint build up on the bathroom lamps, the smell was a bit musty. There was also a stain on the bathroom ceiling where the toilet water tank sits. There was no tissue paper provided for blowing nose or wiping stuff, would have been nice to have. But if that is not important then all is well. Not a bad place just not my cup a tea. Also posted pics of our view from our room, facing the street. The star-rating on the sign indicates 2 star. One night on a Saturday, after a nice romantic walk and dinner, we come back to the hotel to find trash bags piled up on the front on both sides of the walk in. This made us feel bad about our choice in hotel. On the positive side, the hotel staff were great, helpful and full of good info about the city. Definitely a family runs the place. If you want a budget, this is what you\u2019ll get. The outside hallway was nice. The main attractions are 30 to 45 minute walk \u2013 all was a walk in a half for me; \u20ac8-\u20ac20 taxi ride, depending on traffic. When walking near the termini you pass a few bums and not so great areas, I didn't feel too safe at night walking past the Termini area. Too far out of the way for me. One night going out to dinner, we left a restaurant in Trestevera area at 12:30 midnight, we did not get to the hotel room until 3:30AM because all the taxi drivers were busy, Saturday Summer night issue only I think. We got asked if we wanted to pay 40 euros to get to the hotel by some scammer taxi guy, but we declined. If we stayed in a hotel in central Rome we would have not had to worry about a taxi to the hotel and not be stuck walking 90 percent of the way back to the hotel between 12:30AM and 3:30AM;my wife was ready to beat me up! The hotel is farther out than we expected or desired. Basically near the Termini, which is a bit out for us, maybe not for others. There is a great area of shopping on the Via Nazionale, that makes the walk to the main city area ok. There were some nice cute restaurants around the hotel, but we chose to stay in the city area for fun during our visit, not anywhere near the hotel. Walking around the city, we saw beautiful hotels near the river and some nice areas that appealed to us better. Basically you will need to pay \u20ac150 and up a night to get comfort and higher standards. Other than that, it is a good budget hotel and you just have to see for yourself. Personally I would not go back there or that area again. Rome is so beautiful and I think to stay in the city area anywhere near the river would be a good option for us next time. Near the river and main city area there some nice places, real Rome feel with small cute streets. Areas I will look to stay next time will be anywhere along the river, Piazza Novana, Camo dei Fiori.

While in Rome we stayed at the Hotel Gabriella, and I have to say that we were very pleased with the accomodations. We paid approx. $105 a night (before taxes) for the stay, so obviously we weren't expecting a 5 star hotel. The front desk attendants and staff were all very pleasant to work with and the room was very decent and clean. Loved all the marble in the bathroom! It was VERY close to Termini (the main train/metro stop in Rome), and there are lots of restaurants and shops in the general area to visit. Also, there's a vendor shopping area set up every morning just outside of the hotel. Got a few nice deals on some Italian scarves! What do you get @ the Gabriella - great location, somewhat small but very decent room, 13\" television, nice and clean bathroom, and free breakfast. What don't you get @ the Gabriella - 5 star accomodations, a great view from your room (we had a view of a busy street). Suggestion - set up your accomodations through Hotels.
