We have stayed in placed where the a/c started and stopped all night, waking us with every start and smothering in warm humidity when it stopped. The Holiday Inn Express, Green Mountain (note- there is another location ON the strip, which we have never visited) was perfect. We were greeted by Dan who immediately offered show info but never pushed when we explained we were visiting friends, not shows, and gave me a cute little welcome bag for being a Priority Club member. The room was spacious, sparkling clean, and the beds were really comfortable. The pool was totally empty, a shock for this time of year, but clean and just the right temp. The hot tub was warm, bubbly, and a great spot for relaxing. There is a nifty outdoor sunning area outside the pool with the most unusual comfy looking chairs. We were happy where we were, but you should try those chairs -- not your average vinyl. They looked like something you would find in a 4-star hotel or better.

Breakfast room was a bit small and run out of tables but they kept up with the food supply! Pool inside was also nice and clean with a lot of space. Water was a bit cold for our liking but we enjoyed swimming anyway :-). When we asked they let us stay an extra hour so our daughter could swim since we had gotten in so late the night before and was unable to. Everyone was very helpful and friendly.

This was somewhat of a last minute trip, I called about a week before to reserve a room & clerk told me the only king bed that had availed was in what they called the \"penthouse suite\". He was able to give me a pretty good price on it so thinking it was going to be a great room I went for it. It was a nice room with a small kitchen,( with fridge that leaked inside) large living room & separate bedroom. There was a Jacuzzi tub in the same room as the bedroom which seemed very nice, we never used it. Now, the shower & toilet was a total different story. I was not pleased AT ALL. The shower was like a cube in the wall with a curtain hanging in front of it. There was a very small ledge in the shower, only big enough to set the hotel sized shampoo & body wash bottles on. The toilet had it own room with door but it was pointless to try and close the door. It was so small!!! The door cleared the toilet by INCHES!! There was no way to be in there and shut the door. I\u2019m a pretty average size woman & it was hard even for me. There is no way a person of a large size could go in & shut the door. I don\u2019t understand the design of the shower/toilet being so small when the rest of the room was so large! We will NOT book this room again, we would probably try this hotel again because the location was perfect. If we stay here again we will book a standard king room if they have a full bath/shower and normal toilet space. The breakfast was I\u2019m sure great, because there were so many people packed in there eating & waiting in line to get food. We decided to skip it because there was so many people in there, I\u2019m sure it was because of the holiday.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plano, TX", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Stay\u201d", "Author": "TexasTraveler707", "ReviewID": "UR110300399", "Content": "We were here for 1 night only.

I like HI Express in general, so I was happy to find this one on Green Mountain Drive. It's off the main drag, so that famous Branson Gridlock will not be a problem here, but it's still close to shows and attractions. This hotel has a great pool area, video games for kids, the usual good beds and free internet. But that BREAKFAST!!! I have never had home fried potatoes at a HI Express, but someone here was busy cooking - sausage, biscuits, gravy, bacon, eggs, home fried potatoes, and of course the usual bagels, cinnamon rolls, juices and coffee. The bountiful breakfast was like a breakfast buffet at a restaurant or full-service hotel. And, it was FREE. This HI Express was originally a different brand, so the bathroom is a bit smaller than the standard, but it has a sink both inside and outside the bathroom, which prevents traffic jams there. We booked two rooms for two families - one with an infant, one with a teenager. The in-room fridge and microwave were a hit with the young family - easy to warm up things for the baby and keep her food safely cold. The pool was a big hit with the teenager. There is a travel desk on site, where you can get tickets to shows, so you can arrive here without any idea of what to do in Branson, and they can help you out. The staff at the desk and in the travel office were all excellent. As a Priority Club member (easy to sign up - do it!) I was given the courtesy of a 2 pm checkout, which was great with the baby. We were able to get her nap done, then go see the 3 pm Chinese Acrobats show on our way out of town.

When we complained about it, all we were told was that the hotel was a smoke free facility, and there was no attempt to verify our complaints, or to help us find a solution. b] On the day we left, the New Year's eve thunderstorm was just about passing over, and we couldn't get to the car because of the heavy rain. When we tried to borrow an umbrella from the counter staff, there was little more than a shrug of shoulders and a lame excuse that the umbrellas were all out. Again there was not attempt to help us find a solution. In the end I had to borrow a towel from a passing bell boy, so that I could make a dash in the pelting rains to the car. I don't think these are problems related to the hotel itself, as on we had a much more helpful encounter with the counter staff on arrival.

I never felt like I had put anyone out! The complimentry breakfast was beyond ok...as I have ate may breakfast's at ok Buffett..There's were above and beyond Ok...Even if we were cutting it short to breakfast ending, we still were brought out hot food and sinful cinnomon rolls. Ever day they changed it up and that was very nice. I can't not mention our room......I wish I could post pics, Our King size Jacuzzi suite out did rooms we had rented that cost twice as much, the room was somuch larger than I expected! The Jacuzzi had more than enough room for 3 if needed. The bed, sheets, linens, pillows and comforter were high quality. Best sleep at a hotel in a long time.

The second day housekeeping did not even show up, and we had to call the front desk at 3pm and request that housekeeping be sent.

The lobby received a face lift with new furniture inside and a new entrance that helps keep out the weather. Outside the lawn work makes the place look so attractive. In the near future, the enclosed pool will be completed. Families with children will be able to enjoy the water year round in this conditioned atmosphere. The addition of the fitness room is great for runners, fitness fanatics or just for us older people who like to take a morning stroll without facing traffic or weather issues. Comfortable beds, clean bathrooms, and very good breakfast food makes the quality and value of the hotel excellent. Add to that the personality of the staff and you have a very special treat in store if you choose to stay at this hotel. It is on the yellow route which can take you quickly to the \"blue\" and \"red\" routes and get you around all the traffic on Highway 76.
