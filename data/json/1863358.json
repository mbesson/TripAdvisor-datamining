I am very disappointed with my decision to choose this place solely on the other reviews. I should have done my homework and considered the many other better hotels in the immediate area. Although this place is called \"Hotel Sultan House,\" it really is not a full service hotel. It is more like a guesthouse with fewer than nine (9) rooms in the entire establishment. There's a room in the basement (yes, that's right), one right next to the lobby and dining area, and three (3) each on the second floor and third floors. I don't know who would want the room in the lobby, although this room was never available during my stay. Yunus, the hotel manager, used it for his personal room and slept in it every night that I stayed there. When I first checked in, Yunus had me sit down on the couch in the lobby and go over the highlights and tourist areas of Istanbul. This was helpful. But then he launched into his sales pitch with the brochures of company tours, dinner shows and other tourist traps. If that wasn't enough, Yunus offered to give provide a free shuttle ride back to the airport if I paid for my stay in cash. This was a first for me. I don't know what Yunus' game was. Was he planning to not report the income to the government or maybe just personally line his pocket? Who knows. Just tacky. The rooms are small, the bathrooms are even smaller, tiny in fact. No bathtub in the room, only a small shower. Sultan House is located on a corner and you will here everything going on outside on the street. The room lack any garbage cans, except for the tiny one in the bathroom. A request for an iron and ironing board went unfulfilled. The furnishings looked and felt cheap. But the hotel was clean. The rooms were made up in a timely manner. Yunus seemed pleasant upon arrival and departure. During the rest of the stay in-between, he wasn't the friendliest person. I caught him chatting it up with his facebook friends a few times. Don't bother Yunus during these sessions because he just ignores you. Yunus did provide some incorrect information regarding transportation and operating hours of local tourist sites. Service was not world class. Some of his recommendations were off the mark. Yunus also advised another guest that he should go to Haydarpa\u00c5\u0178a Rail Station to catch a train to somewhere in Europe. Well, unless a rail crossing was miraculously built to connect the European and Asian sides of Istanbul, this wasn't going to happen. Yunus should have known that Haydarpa\u00c5\u0178a Station only serves rail lines to Asia. For destinations in Europe, you need to go to the famous Sirkeci Rail Terminal, the terminus for the Orient Express. Amazingly, Yunus didn't know this. Continental breakfast was provided with the stay. It was not great, but it was not bad either. Very limited, just olives, cheese, cucumber, tomatoes, and cold cuts. Nothing substantial. Just don't rely on it to fill you up. You'll be hungry in half an hour after leaving the hotel and will need to get a simit to hold you over. I can't believe they didn't offer any simit with breakfast. This is the most traditional of Turkish breakfasts -- simit with tea. The few number of rooms and guests is probably the main factor with the limited breakfast choices. The best thing going for Sultan House is the location. It's located minutes near the major tourist sites. But, the immediate surrounding area is not the best. Abandoned buildings are scattering around. I wanted to see the ruins, not live among it. The streets are narrow with few restaurants. There's one restaurant around the corner that Yunus recommended. But, that turned out to be an overpriced tourist trap. There's a lot of tourist vehicular traffic during the day. There are better hotels and restaurants 5 minutes away in a much better neighbor, all around Kucuk Ayasofya Rd. The \"staff\" consists of 3 people - Yunus, the overnight guy and the maid. That's it. The overnight guy is nice, but he doesn't speak anything other than Turkish. So, if you ever needed anything, he had to go into the guestroom in the lobby and wake up Yunus to get assistance. During one midday break, I went back to the Sultan House for a rest. But, I found the front door locked and I couldn't enter the establishment. They probably didn't have anyone available to work the reception area and so, they lock the place up? Yunus subsequently appeared and opened the door after he heard my banging. He was probably was doing the deed on the porcelain throne. But that's no reason to bunker down the entire establishment. This place is no oasis. It misses the mark so often, it's ridiculous. Place is run by amateurs. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else where you'll get better service, comfort, and experience.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cClean and helpful\u201d", "Author": "Andriani_11", "ReviewID": "UR120902019", "Content": "Staying in a clean place was our top priority.

The hotel is in an extraordinary location and we were extremely pleased with the convenience to transports and the proximity to all the major attractions in Sultanahmet. It is literally around the corner from the Blue Mosque. Although some areas in Sultanahmet represent what we consider to be awful touristic traps, with inflated prices and hawkers on the streets, Sultan House is in a quiet street with mostly local people around. There are loads of restaurants within a very short walk of the hotel and we also recommend the restaurant nearby called Soukullu where I had the best lamb of my trip (twice) and they also have a very good meze selection which we ordered to our room via the front house manager at Sultan House when we were too tired to go out one evening. We had three dinners there when in Istanbul (including the room delivery) because the food was so good, and they even prepared homemade vegetables for our baby to eat. To be honest, we weren't that impressed with the decor in the rooms upon arrival, everything is beige and seemingly cheap, which wasn't exactly what we had in mind. But after visiting several other hotels in Turkey around the same price range, we have to say that Sultan House is certainly worth it. Its true, the beds are extremely comfortable, the showers are hot with good water pressure, they have a hair dryer in the room and the rooms are clean and adequate. The wireless internet is excellent, reliable and free. We slept well at Sultan House, although on weekdays there are school kids that mill around outside enroute to school that did make a bit of noise on the street, but this really didn't bother us because we weren't in Istanbul to sleep late and miss the days out. Anyway, the breakfasts from 7:30AM were really good and they always had something extra each day, omlette, pancakes, sweet cakes and special breads were served for instance when we were there, in addition to the normal Turkish breakfast options (note, no fruit juices were served but I'm fairly sure if I had asked they would have gone out of their way to accommodate me). Sultan House is a family run operation and the family are very hospitable to all of their guests. They made us, and especially our baby, feel extremely welcome. I would happily stay at Sultan House again when in Istanbul.

The breakfast is typical Turkish fare and is tasty and fresh. The rooms are on the small side (particularly the bathrroms) but are still comfortable. There is a lovely restaurant with delicious food just down the road called Sokkulu and it is well worth visting.

The Sultan-Ahmed territory is famous historic tourist occupied place for sightseeing in Istanbul. It was my first trip to Istanbul with wife so I was trying to find out that place where we will have the best relax and comfort mainly. The hotel location is perfect just five minutes by walk to Sultan-Ahmed Mosque and Haga-Sofya palace. The operation manager had shown an excellent professionalism and very good negotiation skills during our stay in the Sultan-House hotel. The hotel room were very clean and tidy. The breakfast was very tasty with home made delicious starters. I would like to bring my thanks to all hotel operation stuff for theirs warm hospitality especially to operation manager. I would definitely stay in this hotel on my next trip to Istanbul. My advice to travelers this hotel is the best option for staying and visiting main ancient buildings in Istanbul. Best Wishes!
