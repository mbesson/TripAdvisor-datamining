Pretty much nothing has changed from since 2009, except they have changed the locks (key to key-card), I was given a slightly bigger double room this time round, with more space to move about, and part of the hotel is still undergoing renovation works, but no big issue. Since it was winter, the hotel pretty much turned off the aircon, and had the heater turned on, which made it a little stuffy at nights. Had to wake up at times in the middle of the night to keep the windows open for awhile, then close them again before heading back to sleep. There still was free wireless (but only for one equipment) and hot showers, the two supermarkets right at the cross junctions are also still there (together with MacD's, can't miss it!), however the nice little cafe/restaurant just steps away from the hotel (right next to Starbucks) has closed down, they were under renovations when I was still there two weeks back. But fret not, there are still two cafes/ restaurants (Suffren and Le Picquet, if I remember correctly- LP is a a must-try!) just down the road the hotel is located on, good on the days I was lazy to venture out further for food. Subway/ RER ride to Orly airport took about 40 minutes that early morning I left, but journey from CDG took considerably longer, I think it was more than an hour.

My daughter loved the built-in bed she got, and I was pleased that it wasn't an uncomfortable, little cot that was rolled in. The beds were comfortable, but as I recall, the pillows weren't great. Still - they never interfered with our sleep. The hotel staff was professional and helpful; the elevator was in good working order; the hallways have retained an old-world parisienne flair; the dining area was very clean and efficient; the TV/sitting area was a convenient place to check email; and there was a Starbucks right next door - perfect! The view isn't great, and it's not in the most glamorous neighbourhood, but the location was perfect: turn left out the door and walk straight until you come to the Eiffel Tower in about 4 blocks - perfect!

One night we asked for another set and the receptionist refused to give us towels by responding that \"we should have asked sooner\" given it was 10PM\u2026we had left the hotel at 7AM that morning...after arguing with him he reluctantly disappeared and came back with another set of towels. I asked the receptionist to help me make a restaurant reservation. She called once, didn't get an answer, and gave me the phone number to try again later. She didn't offer to try again, she told me to try again. This hotel is a value if you don't mind rude staff and being treated poorly.

After reading the reviews on this site about the Hotel being under renovation I was expecting the worst. But I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that it seems the renovation was nearing its end. I could see only one room in our floor that was under work and we did not hear any sounds of work in the morning. The room was clean but a little bit small though I would say just big enough for two people not intending to spend that much time in the room. The bed was a double bed and big enough so we did not have to fight for space. Bathroom was also quite nice and not too small. The air-conditioning did not work well but luckily you can open the window. The room had a flat-screen tv with many channels. Almost all of the channels had programming that was either French or was dubbed bud there were a couple of English, German and Spanish channels. Also the hotel has a free wi-fi but you had to ask the login-information from the front desk. Worked well when I used it. The hotel is located in a great location. You can be at the Eiffel tower in about 10-15min of walking and the elevated La Motte-Picquet - Grenelle metro station is across the street. You can be at Champs-\u00c8lys\u00e8es in about 10min with the metro or you can take a little walk to for example Les Invalides if you prefer it. There are many, many cafe's and restaurants very close. We did not try the breakfast at the hotel as we found a nice little pastry shop / cafe at the corner of one of the intersections on the Boulevard de Grenelle. Also from the hotel on the other side of Boulevard de Grenelle (next to the McD) starts Rue du Commerce which is a little charming shopping street. So there are many nice things really close to the hotel but thanks to the good metro network of Paris you can also go to different place quite quickly. So to summarize. The hotel is great and located in a great place. Hotel staff spoke fluent English and were very helpful. For a two-star hotel this was a good and a pleasant experience.

We travel frequently and our minimum standards are at the very least those akin to Marriot hotel chains. First of all, this hotel is situated within a 5 to 10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and has a metro station pretty much right outside the door to take you anywhere in Paris. So the location is superb! Other reviews say a two stop metro ride from the Eiffel tower, but why would you bother when you can just walk there so easily? And the view walking/approaching the tower is just as spectacular as the tower itself. If you are arriving from the airport and choose to take the metro to this hotel destination, you have to switch metro cars twice to get there (airport to Gare du Nord to Opera to la Motte Piquet), which is a bit cumbersome with luggage, but you can always take a cab instead (which would likely run you $50 euros). There are great restaurants in the area and a huge selection of restaurants to choose from in this area that clearly cater to English speaking tourists, as we had no problems finding menus with engligh descriptions. Definitely eat at Carmine on the corner, a wonderful Italian restaurant with the best service we had in Paris (and that says a lot, as we found restaurant service in Paris is pretty terrible). There is also a place on the corner across from Carmine that serves GIGANTIC seafood platters. We arrived to the hotel early (around noon) and there were no problems with early check-in. The front desk staff were very accommodating and it was very appreciated after a long flight and some jet lag. Also, if you speak limited French, the staff can accommodate you in English. The first thing I noticed about the hotel itself is that it is older (as are most buildings in Paris!) but that it part of it's quaint charm. It does not subscribe to room key cards, rather they provide you a big clunky key to open your door (don't forget to drop the key off in the basket at the front desk when you leave the hotel for the day, a new process to us). The room size is average to small, I believe ours was a double as they call it. I think our room number was 216 so we were on the second floor, but they have a lift too if you don't want to walk a few flights of stairs after a long day. The room has beautiful french doors that act as the 'window' of the room and it was so beautiful outside that it was nice to leave them open to get the fresh air. The view itself was not overly spectacular (see photos) and next time I would choose a room with a bit of a better view. The bathroom is immaculate and made of marble. The toilet has an intense flush and is very powerful. The bathtub is extremely deep and long, but there are no shower doors or curtains which means a lot of water on the floor after showers (not for me so much as my boyfriend). Ladies: WHERE THE HECK IS THE HAIRDRYER? Oh, it's that 1950's antique looking device on the bathroom wall! It looks like a vaccum tube and is not overly powerful, so ladies, bring your own hair dryer (with applicable Europe plug device) if you want to avoid some bad hair days in Paris. It was a funny and enjoyable experience though - we were amused by the device. I don't think the hotel should change it because it enhances the fun and new experience of the hotel. The beds - not the worst, but definitely not the best. After four nights, my back was hurting a bit from sleeping in the bed. The pillows - terrible! These pillows were almost the worst ones I've slept on; hard as rocks and lumpy. My boyfriend somewhat agreed with this as well. He likes to sleep with numerous pillows and the hotel staff had no problems bringing extra pillows, so the staff was accommodating in that regard. The room service (ie: the cleaning) was always done on time and the room was kept very clean throughout our stay. Bear in mind, the hotel prohibits you from bringing food into the hotel rooms (although we did eat \"take away\" crepes in our hotel one night but I'm sure the hotel would frown upon this given that their notice advises you not to eat in the hotel rooms. I can't speak to any fitness facilities or breakfast/eating areas, as we did not explore the hotel outside of the lobby and our own room. I believe we paid approximately $130-$140 Euros per night. At the end of our trip in Paris, we went to London via the Eurostar train. It cost us about $16 Euros for a cab ride to train station to catch our Eurostar train to London. Our cab driver cursed at the traffic in angry French and it was kind of hilarious! All in all, we would return and stay in this hotel again for future visits to Paris but I would likely ask for a room that had a better view.

Further, I understand that the hotel was under renovation when we stayed, but the service could have been more satisfying. There was no Internet terminal, and the breakfast was very, very, very bare. Only bread and juice; nothing else. The rooms were small.

However, the lady at the reception (short, boycut hair) was very nice and was huge help with the tours and bookings, and I really appreciate that. Hotels need to realise the importance of having an Internet terminal in this day and age, when it is the oxygen for traveling. It is impossible to look up information without it about tours, buses, etc and makes things really easy.

There was a little market on the street in front of the Monoprix on Sunday which sold hot food, fresh fruit and vegies, lollies etc. Turning right out of the hotel and walking 50m we had our breakfast each morning at Cafe Grenelle consisting of a cafe creme (coffee with milk) and a croisant. For 4 of these it was 22 Euro which is $34 Aust Dollars ($8.50 per serve) which was the norm for our entire stay. Turning right at this cafe and walking another 50m was Sandwich Grec which sold the best pizzas and kebabs. The staff at the hotel were very pleasant and helpful and ordered our taxi for us the night before we left as taxi drivers don't like families of 4 with 4 pieces of luggage and 4 pieces of hand luggage. We were turned away at the station and had to wait for a mini van looking taxi to roll up. So pre-booking and letting the company know how many and how much luggage cost a little booking fee but gave us piece of mind as we had a train booked and couldn't be late. Thanks Tourisme. p.s it cost us over $400 AUD to go to Euro Disney and spent hours lining up for 2 rides and nearly another hour for something to eat - a real waste of time sorry.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.

It's well priced and yet it's as charming, and it's location is as good, as any other 5* hotel in Paris. It really does tick every box and I can't recommend it highly enough. Our stay: Stayed in a Triple Room for 3 nights in July 2009. Our journey there: We had a fairly tumultuous start to our travels in Paris, literally speaking. We'd foolishly assumed that since there was a metro station on the doorstep of the hotel that we could navigate our way there from Gare de Lyons. Don't make this mistake too! It turned out to be a logistical nightmare. We had to lug suitcases (weighing 30kg+) around for nearly an hour -- walking to another station and then carrying them up and down countless flights of stairs (which resulted in a nasty tumble done one flight). Moral of the story: if you're traveling with luggage from GDL, take a cab. Service: (+) Staff were very friendly. (+) Desk clerks all spoke fluent English. (+) We got free wifi in our room (just had to ask politely for it at the desk). (+) Staff kept our bags after we checked out and before we left for the airport. (-) One cleaner didn't speak English and kept coming back to our room when we'd said we didn't want it cleaned. Location: (+) Eiffel Tower a 5 minute walk down the street from the hotel. You just need to print a google map and you're good to go. (+) You can take the subway almost EVERYWHERE else you want to go in Paris. (+) Metro station right outside the hotel. Some reviewers complained about the noise from the trains. The noise was audible to us but it wasn't so bad that it kept us from sleeping. If anything, I was glad some of the noise lifted from the subway because it's really such a minor issue and I think it might have been one of the reasons the rooms were so cheap. (+) Plenty of side streets with reasonably priced cafes and shops. (+) Maccas across the street (presumably open 24hr). (+) On Sunday mornings there are markets held just on the corner of the hotel. You can pick up some freshly-cooked breakfast, souvenirs (at half the price that you'll find most other places) and even some knock-off designer gear. You must spent an hour walking through the markets. Room: (+) The room was clean and seemed as though it had been renovated recently. Windows opened out onto quasi-terrace. We were also lucky enough to be on the 3rd floor right at the end of the hall (facing the metro). So we had access to the spare toilet and the window looking out onto the street. Hotel Facilities: (-) There was a narrow elevator behind the reception desk. It was broken for 2 days that we were there although it seemed like an irregularity. (+) The carpet stair leading up to our room were adorable. Some were wonky and awkwardly narrow in some spaces but we found that really quaint. (+) No swipe key. You'll just get a bulky key that you leave at reception when you exit the hotel. If you're traveling to Paris to see Paris, then you should stay at Tourisme Hotel.

The hotel condition is average with a weird smell which is particularly strong along the second floor lobby where we stayed. It has an old-school lift which I find it somewhat interesting (yes the lift is working). The hotel room is nicely sized. However, I found the bed uncomfortable and it is certainly due for a change, in my opinion. The mattress is old and instead of a flat surface like any other bed, the center of the mattress has sunken in which is really unfortunate especially if you are sharing the bed with someone else as both of you would tend to slide down to the center and knock onto each other.

The ensuite washroom was also a good size. It was also great having the A/C. Although the continental breakfast was a little steep at 6 euros, we ate there anyway...it's just easier that way with kids.

Part of me would have rather paid a bit more and had more amenities at a different hotel. The rooms are quite small and the bathroom is super small, so be aware of that. This is common in Paris. It was OK for me, but some people may not like this. Our room was clean, except the bathroom could have been a little better. One person a the desk was very nice, the other ignored us and didn't want to be bothered with answering any questions. We just asked about local places to eat. We were on the first floor, so you can hear the rummble of the metro. It runs until 12:30am, so this could really annoy some people. Ask to be on a higher floor if this may be an issue for you. At the same time, you are right at a metro stop, which is helpful. The Eiffel tower is about a 10-15 min walk, so we got to see that everyday, which was pretty wonderful. There are some great cafes on the street and we ate at a couple of them. The 15th arrondissements is pretty much just residential, so stay in the 7, 1, 8, or 4 to be a little more towards the action. There isn't much nightlife in the 15. I would also recommend one of the bus tours.

We went several times to get waters, sodas, pastries, and even wine/cheese for our picnic. As an added benefit, there was an old-fashioned street market that sets up from 8-12pm on Sundays. It was wonderful to browse the wine, cheese, bread, fruits, and other delicacies. We skipped the hotel breakfast in favor of walking the neighborhood cafes each morning.

The room was very clean, the airconditioner worked great, after we figured out how to work it. The location was 20 feet from a good metro, the hostesses were helpful, friendly, and wonderful. It wasn't posh luxury, but for a middle class girl it was great. A neat old building, with character. The halls weren't fancy, but the rooms were thoughtfully decorated and attractive. It felt French not Days Inn. The neighborhood felt safe and although it was busy, it lacked some of the crazied crowdedness that the more upscale, touristy areas seemed to have 24 hours a day. In the evening it was quiet and even peaceful. Grocery store across the street, delicious bakeries on the street, nice cafe bistros. What more could you want for a reasonable price in Paris? I should emphasis how lovely the staff treated me and my boys. They had a breakfast room, but we never took breakfast as I'm not a coffee drinker and the grocery store was much cheaper for our American cereal and milk, and teenage boys can really eat a lot. Everything was crazy expensive in Paris. But there was a little grocery store called the Fran Prix across from the hotel, that was a bit more reasonable. About 100 yards from the hotel was a big store kind of like super target, that had almost any regular item you might need (but they didn't have tennis balls) and that included a big grocery store. I loved walking out of the hotel and being at the metro. And it was a good metro that made getting to all the big spots easy. The walk to the Eiffel tower was lovely, it was only 5 minutes to the park. The park was HUGE. The tower itself was a good 15 to 20 minute walk, but every time I went it was amazing. Although I am sure we walked 10- 15 miles everyday and we were exhausted by 9 every night. Several mornings I was up at 7:00 and took my kids to the park in front of the Eiffel Tower and let them jog around while I \"power walked\" and it was great. I felt like I belonged to the city in the cool morning, teams of street cleaners, lots of dogs and dog owners. It was like being with a gracious hostess, the morning after a late party, and watching while she picked up and straightened up her beautiful home for another day. And the city really is beautiful. That area of Paris isn't so crowded, but the buildings were gorgeous and it was just nice. Hotel Tourisme is also at the beginning of the Rue de Commerce, which is a long street with a bunch of stores! It was fun to walk down. Again it was crowded but not like the Champs Elysee or the St. Germain area, or Mon Martre or the Marias. Also it was more Parisian middle class people, not tourists and millionares. It had a comfortable feeling, not a show off feeling and the prices were a little closer to the reality that I live. The people were lovely. They were patient while I tried to communicate what I needed or wanted. We never met anyone in the area of the hotel who was even remotely rude or condescending. Parisians in this area were lovely. Although we were on the go every waking second. Several times my boys 13 and 15 asked for a break and we went to the Luxembourg Gardens or Parc du Mars and just hung out. The kids LOVED it. They sat by the big pond at Luxembourg Jardins for an hour or more at a time, ate sandwiches watched people, or just relaxed not being force feed my agenda of history and art. Yet the gardens are a work of art and the Palace and the landscaping beautiful. Plus getting there we pass the Sorbonne, wonderful old buildings, the Pantheon, and the Cluny. I did spluge on the museum pass for 4 days. It was great. I'm not the biggest fan of museums - I get bored and don't care especially when everything is in French and I can't understand a word. And the cost of the museums will knock you out over and over again. But with the pass, you feel ummmm kind of like you need to get your money's worth and that motivates you to go, it is already paid for you don't feel the need to look at everything for hours so you can kind of power visit, teenage boys appreciate that. There are museums all over the city that are free with the pass. Which means almost anywhere you are, you are close to a free, clean bathroom. Which is worth the price itself! Bathrooms in Paris are almost non existent, usually cost money and are stinky and wierd. We powered through alot of museums. Like I would never made a specific trip to the Pantheon but because I had the tourist pass as we walked to the Luxembourg Jardin, I did and it was beautiful, got to see Foucalt's pendulum which was really cool and explore the tombs in the basement, which believe it or not teenage boys think is kind of neat. (Go figure!). The Cluny was neat to see, I especially liked the Roman Ruins which reminded me of a gorgeous spa and I could easily imagine the citizens coming for baths and how relaxing it must have been 2000 years ago. Wish my little town would build a public facility like that! We loved our week at Hotel Tourisme.

Upon arrival, we called the number for the shuttle. Unfortunately, the agent only spoke French - but they were expecting us. It took us about 5 minutes to pin down our location in the terminal and were able to convey the exit number. The shuttle was waiting just outside that door within 5 minutes. The shuttle picked up 2 more couples and we made our way to the hotel. Since we arrived early, we left our luggage under the stairs (outside the small lobby). And off we went to explore Paris by foot. After about 3 hours, we got back and checked into the room. We read that the rooms would be small, and it did meet expectations. The bathroom was much better than we anticipated. The only hitch was that I had to lug each bag separately in the tiny elevator - but it wasn't all that bad. The room ended up being quiet and we could hear the metro trains pass us faintly. Which brings me to the best part about the hotel - the location. Right outside is the entrance to a very clean and safe Metro station. It's connected to 2 different lines - so it's a breeze to get around the city. There's a grocery store right across the street and some very good restaurants on the way to the Eiffel tower (a 10-15 minute walk). We walked around late at night and it felt safe with many tourists around. We were pleasantly surprised the second day when our standard CRT TV was replaced with a big, flat screen TV. Too bad we didn't have the time to enjoy it - there's so much to see in Paris. Overall, it's a great hotel if you're not too fussy about the space and amenities. There were no bellhops.

The rooms are OK, spotlessly clean (sheets and towels changed every day), 32' LCD TV)... Another tip: don't have breakfast in the hotel. Although it's only 5 EUR, it's OK but it's the same every day. Go to McDonalds instead, but until 10 a.m. - they have Le petit dej (huge and very tasty breakfast) for 4.50 EUR.

Staff that greeted us were polite but not really friendly. Didn't sense the warmness from them. But they did what they had to. Location: Metro stop is literally outside the hotel. The entrance that is. But to walk to the lines, you walk underground for say 5 mins? 3 lines run through. Shopping street Rue Du Commerce has chains like Gap, Zara, H&M Will definitely recommend this hotel for those who want to live near the Eiffel Tower and are on a budget. Room had 32\" LCD tv.

(Believe me when we say we looked!) We received rate of 77 Euro per night for a double, shower, no breakfast during high season in May. Only cons are faint noise from Metro, water flushing/ using noises from rooms above, and wet/ watery floors after shower use. (You can just wipe it after.) Bathroom spotless except for.. a little bit of black on shower floor wall. Scratches in room. Who cares.. we're not that picky for 77 Euros in town!!

We chose Tourisme Hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and were pleased to discover that reviews were right - this hotel was a perfect find. Let me start with location - very central, walking distance from the Eiffel Tower, close to the metro station connected to three main metro lines that can take you anywhere in Paris in no time at all. The area around the hotel has lots of brasseries and bakeries, as well as other shops, anything you might possibly need is within stone's throw away. Perfect. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but rather opted for breakfast in one of many lovely bakeries nearby. Hotel is spotlessly clean and rooms are cleaned daily. Staff are extremely helpful and polite. My husband has recently had knee surgery and needed to apply ice patches on his knee frequently. Staff were more than happy for us to use their freezer and help ourselves to it whenever required. Rooms are good size and very quiet, even with windows open there is very little noise coming from the outside which was perfect for a good night's sleep.

As mentioned previously, the metro station is right outside and serves 2 good lines - really easy to get to the heart of Paris and to Gare du Nord and Paris CDG. The area around the hotel is also very pleasant, loads of shops, cafes, restaurants - even a Monoprix and McDonalds over the road. It's a nice area to wander around, the Eiffel Tower is about 10 minutes away, same for Rue de Cler and the street markets there (I'd also recommend the Cafe du Marche on that street - very reasonable prices). You can also stroll up to Les Invalides and the Musee de l'Armee in about 20 minutes which we found well worth it. As for the hotel itself, we found it represented very good quality for the price - 102 euros for a triple, the breakfast at 6 euros each was OK (although, I almost hate to admit it but the McDonalds breakfast was probably better value!). I must admit though that I was a bit disappointed with the hotel, I didn't find the staff particularly friendly and our room was very small and a bit tired-looking. Don't get me wrong, I would still probably recommend it and it was spotlessly clean it's just that next time we visit Paris I think we'd probably pay a bit more for a different hotel. One tip - I really wouldn't bother queuing for ages to go up the Eiffel Tower; take a walk around at nightime when it's lit up like a giant lighthouse and the lasers are sweeping across the sky (the first 10 minutes of the hour is when all the lighing effects take place). We went up to the top of the Arc de Triomphe ( a straight metro ride to Etoile) which I found much better, cheaper, less crowded and, on a clear day, really fantastic 360 degree views.", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cCute Hotel at a Great Location - Great Value for the Price!\u201d", "Author": "Meitali_and_Yacov", "ReviewID": "UR27838176", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for 10 nights at the beginning of April, booked the hotel based on reviews on this site, and they were right!
