We then went on a 4-day road trip leaving most of our luggage and souvenirs in the room. We informed the Hotel of our time away. When we returned for a relaxing final 2 days, we discovered that our room had been used in our absence. A full bucket of unmelted ice was the first clue, as was the radio and TV on. We aren't sure if our belongings were touched, so on that I won't comment.I will say that we were Very happy with the Hotel until we returned from our road trip. A four-star Hotel should NOT use a pre-booked, pre-paid room for ANY reason.The staff and manager tried to deal with this as best they could, but it should Never have happened.

A clean and spacious room with a stunning view of Chapultepec castle. Very friendly staff. Convenient to Chapultepec Park and its various attractions. A decent fitness center, with a 19th floor view, no less.But there are definite negatives. The location is not convenient to anything except the park. It's an uncomfortably long and complicated walk to decent restaurants or cafes, and the closest metro stop (Chapultepec) is a circuitous ten minute hike. For me, though, the biggest negatives were the outrageous prices for everything beyond the room itself. Internet access? That will be $25 per day. I'm not kidding - $25 dollars per day! Want to use the locker room after you work out in the fitness center? That will be another $12.50. A 200 ml bottle of water from the mini-bar? That will set you back over four dollars. For like three good size sips of water. (And while the maid is supposed to leave a carafe of agua purificada in the room, mine never did. Good thing there's a 7-11 two blocks away.)They are clearly aiming for the corporate expense account here (Torre Major is close by). But I would rather have the expenses built into the room rate right up front rather than feeling nickeled and dimed to death.

This hotel is the top property of the Fiesta Americana chain in Mexico City. It is located a half block from the Reforma Avenue, accross the street from Chapultepec Park, and equidistant from the Zona Rosa and fashionable Polanco neighborhoods. It's high points are the excellent service from all the staff, well appointed rooms with excellent views of Emperor Maximilian's Castle in the Park, beautiful marble bathrooms, and the possibility of walking to the Anthropology Museum, the Modern Arts Museum, the Tamayo Museum, and the Zoo (take the kids to look at the thriving Panda family). There is only one Restaurant, which has an adequate breakfast. We did not try it for other meals. There are two convenience stores two blocks behind the hotel.

We arrived at the hotel at approximately 7pm to find that the room we had booked with two double beds was not available. The receptionist told us that we would have to take a room with 1 King size bed and that there was no extra rollaway beds available. This would mean that 4 of us would have to sleep in one King Size bed which was totally unacceptable. We then talked to the manager and he said he would give us a suite at no extra cost but again this would only have 1 King size bed with no additional beds available. If we wanted two rooms which is the only way we could have sufficient beds, we would have to pay for the second one. I was extremely disappointed with the way this was handled and the manager was completely unhelpful and did not care that he had overbooked the hotel by allowing guests to stay longer than their original bookings (which was the reason the receptionist gave us initially to justify why our room was not available). This should have only been allowed if they had rooms available. We were in a strange city and then had to find another hotel at the last minute with two very tired children. I have never had such poor customer service from a hotel before and this would make me think twice before booking with this chain of hotels again.", "Date": "Mar 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR481109818", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Aussie-in-Mexico"}, {"Content": "Exceptional service, even to a non-guest.

She failed to guanantee it with a credit card. When I arrived at 10:30, the manager advised me very professionally that the reservation had been cancelled and no rooms were available. Within 1 minute, he made a booking for me a the Marquis Reforma at the same rate as my Fiesta rate. The porter collected my bags, drove me to the Marquis and accompanied me inside to make sure all was well.

I do continue to book through Expedia, because the rates are considerably discounted. Service: excellent in all areas of the hotel.

Gym/spa: very good, small gym with treadmills, bicycles, stair stepper, and weights. Great view of the Chapultepec castle from the gym. No fee for guests. The gym is located right next to the spa, which offers massages and other spa services. For a fee, guests can use the locker room, which has both a steam room and sauna. There is also a hot tub in the spa area. Dining: room service is good. The menu is kind of limited, but if you get tired of the options, there is a Camino Real within three blocks that has a variety of restaurants. And if you want even more variety, the La Condesa neighborhood is very close by, with a variety of restaurants. I would highly recommend this hotel for business travelers or even tourists. The Chapultepec park is just right across the street, and the museum of anthropology is within walking distance, as are other art museums within the park.

The concierge level had turn down service, robe and slippers, an exercise bike, a suit valet, and a nicer bathroom.
