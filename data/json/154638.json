It is not a luxurious hotel but it is clean and the staff couldn't be more helpful. I went with a friend. We were doing a short Mexican tour. 3 nights were booked at this hotel. Yes, it is in the gay area of Zona Rosa and, as a couple of women on our own, we did not feel at all vulnerable. The Police station is right next door to the hotel so there is quite a heavy police presence in this area, although not obtrusively so to make you question your safety. The area taken care of, now to the hotel. Not a very large lobby but welcoming on arrival after an 11 hour flight from the UK. Check in was quick and easy. Room was spacious and clean. The surprise was when we sat on the beds and found out how hard they were! Expecting a poor night's sleep because of that we were more than surprised to find out that they were actually quite comfortable and we did get a good night's sleep. Because of our hectic schedule we made a conscious decision to eat in the hotel and found the food of extremely good quality and a reasonable price if compared with what we'd pay at home. May be expensive by Mexican standards but certainly not by UK standards and neither were the in-house drinks. We used room service a couple of times and also the restaurant. The waiting staff, particularly the head waiter, were very helpful and attentive and we certainly couldn't have asked for better. There was a good breakfast selection. The only problem I had was .... tea! I just couldn't get a decent cup of tea so gave up trying in the end. On our check out morning we had a major problem with a transfer we were expecting and the reception and back office staff went out of their way to help. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff we had contact with and would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in Mexico City. The only thing that would help would be a few more lifts. There are only 2 for the large number of floors, hence rooms. During the day, not a problem but in the mornings, when so many people are checking out and others wanting the lifts to go to breakfast, it can be quite a wait to get one with space in, especially as each lift only has an 8 person capacity. I can't really comment on value for money on the room tariff as the hotel was booked as part of a package deal here in the UK and the package included another 2 hotels as well as the tour itself. We certainly didn't feel we'd been overcharged on the whole package once our holiday came to an end.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "jeanne pace", "Title": "\u201cClassic hotel in heart of Zona Rosa\u201d", "Author": "mooshimom", "ReviewID": "UR125006887", "Content": "Hotel Geneve on Avenida Londres is a beautiful old hotel-spectacular lobby full of interesting memorabilia and displays.

It has a 4 diamond restaurant called tezca on the corner, but you never watch people in it. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff is really helpful. You have free internet on all the hotel, and sometimes, depending of your reservation you can get free breakfast. The restaurant is really simple, but rather good. On the mornings, they serve all kinds of bread, eggs, beans, chilaquiles, pancakes, waffles, yogurt, fruit. One of the biggest secrets in this hotel is outside. They have one of the best tourist taxi drivers in all of Mexico, Mr. Carlos Cuellar. He can take you almost everywhere, he's really helpful. This man really improve our visits to Mexico. Something you have to consider if you visit this area, Zona Rosa is Mexico's most open neighborhood for sexual diversity, so a lot of people will be surprised with some of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scenes\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 you find during the night.

Best of all it has a pool on the roof which is heated to nearly hot tub temperatures, as well as small grass yard, a manned bar, and really nice views all around the city from the 17th floor. Rooms are nothing special but they're completely functional with AC, TV, two queen beds and a pull-out twin sofa bed. So the five of us were able to fit in to one room. Perhaps even more best of all they were running a summer special of pay for 2 nights, get the 3rd free so our total bill, with a glass of wine on the roof, was $234 for three nights. Not too bad for a decent hotel with heated pool in a great neighborhood. Be sure to try Biwon, a Korean BBQ place around the corner--great theater for the kids--and the Cupcakeria which just got written up in a big travel magazine. Everything's right in the neighborhood, including lots of cheap, delicious breakfast spots--like Tacontento. Huge breakfast tortas and other Mexican specialties for around 35 pesos.

The price was excellent and the reviews seemed favorable. Overall, it is an OK place to stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, and the WiFi is really fast and dependable. The neighborhood is very eclectic with everything from excellent restaurants and shopping a few block away, so seedy sex shops just down the street. That being said, there is also a police station a half a block away, and police are constantly on the street. Even at night, we felt very safe walking for dinner or shopping. Still, this is not a Marriott or Intercontinental. It's a Best Western and a bit of an older one at that. It is in need of a make-over. The beds and pillows are perhaps the most uncomfortable I've ever encountered in a hotel (and I travel extensively throughout Mexico so I know what hard beds are ... these are really the worst). The air conditioning never worked properly, and since the windows don't open, the room was always warm and stuffy. Though on a side street, it is quite noisy with horns honking and traffic (perhaps because there is a gap between the window frame and the building that lets all the noise come in), the carpets are stained and need replacement, and while some days towels were soft and fluffy, other days they were thread bare.

This hotel is a great base camp if you plan on spending most of your time exploring the city. It's a 2 minute walk to the metro stop \"Insurgentes\" on the pink line and almost anything you might want to do in the city can be accessed via the metro. However, Mexico City is HUGE so things seem closer than they really are. There are mediocre restaurants in the hotel, but with several Sanborns and Vips neaby, there's really no reason to eat in the hotel even if you're not adventurous enough to look for other more authentic places to eat. It's a short walk to the Independence Angel and strolling along the Paseo de la Reforma is a nice way to digest dinner. There's a good indoor market nearby that opens at 10 am for picking up souvenirs and other crafts. And just as an FYI, you are right down the street from a bunch of gay bars, so the area is very lively at night and there's lots of PDA around. If you are a homophobe unfamiliar with metropolitan areas or are travelling with young children who are kept sheltered, this might be a problem for you. As for the hotel itself- it is a large hotel and there isn't a whole lot of personal service. The area overall is a little noisy, after all, you are downtown in a big city with a lot of police presence. There is adequate space in the room and bathroom - in fact, by European standards, the place is huge! The views are nice - better from the upper floors, of course. The room decor is hideous and the pool is tiny - but if you're rarely in your room or swim, who cares? Probably my only complaint is the the beds are the hardest I've slept on in my life and the pillows are like sacks of old heavy clothes. If we choose not to stay there again, that will be the only reason why. (Oh, and my daughter Shelby just reminded me that the toilet got clogged and there wasn't enough shampoo.) Taxis are not nearly as cost-prohibitive as in other cites so even if you don't choose to take the metro (it does get ridiculously crowded), it's still a great base camp. We travelled with a 4, 7, and an 11 year old and you can ride in a special section on the metro with kids. Definitely visit the Zocalo, Chapultepec Park (especially the palace and museum of Anthropology), the Basilica of Guadalupe and Xochimilco. And take a day trip to the pyramids. Off the beaten path is the Leon Trotsky house that he lived and was murdered in after his exile from Russia and the Freida Kahlo and Diego Rivera home - very educational and worthwhile. But even 6 days was not enough to see enough of this amazing city - we'll be back. All in all, this hotel was a good value and we had a great time in Mexico City.

As a business traveller the HR is excellent quality for price, friendly, delightful stay with spacious comfortable rooms, excellent meals with two restaurants (one with a breakfast buffet). For the cigar smokers, there is a cigar bar attached with high quality low price Royal brand cigars. Free internet (either wireless or wired, depending on the room). An excellent indoor-outdoor penthouse bar and even a gym and pool. What is not to love. A secure ATM about fifty feet down the block. Walk outside and you immediately understand the oasis concept. Zona Rosa, at one time a great tourist district has become everything that you may not want, especially as a solo traveller. Sleezy harassment every step of evey block. Out on the street after 6:00 PM is a major challenge. Dive for one of the secure taxis and you are fine, but you better make sure it is secure. One fatiques of this very quickly.

There is a huge amount of toursit security in the Zona Rosa and as a group felt very safe walking the streets at night. We were all enjoying our stay except for one HUGE sore point which ruined our experience of Mexico city. The sore point was a tour company (VIAJES PREMIER,S.A.) operating in the lobby of the hotel, I would suggest you ensure you get a receipt for what you pay for and make sure what is included is contained on the receipt and not just the total you have paided or you may find yourself going on one of those infamous Mexican tours. The guide picked us up in a van, did a couple of circles of the same block of buildings, then took us to a Mariachi restaurant with an all inclusive deal. Then when we wanted to leave the restaurant, the staff handed us a bill for the night out. No way out of it we had to pay, and as the hotel is not responsible we left with somewhat lighter wallets and a promise to never return to this hotel due to this experience.", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Union City, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, call a chiropractor\u201d", "Author": "Wandering_Guy", "ReviewID": "UR5021017", "Content": "Just returned from spending one week in Mexico City; the first three nights at the Royal Zona Rosa. If you are planning to get around Mexico City using the Metro (highly recommended) then the Royal Zona Rosa is an excellent location, right across the street from the Insurgentes Metro station. It's also centrally located within easy walking distance all of the shops and restaurants of the Zona Rosa area. The room was clean and the water was hot with excellent pressure (not always the case in Mexico as a quick check of many reviews on this site will atest). The shower curtain, however, was installed so that it was impossible for water not to flood the bathroom floor. Luckily, there was a drain in the middle of the floor, but it still meant standing in some water until housekeeping did their thing. A word of caution: the beds are hard as rocks. The room was equipped with two queen-sized beds, and both were equally uncomfortable. I'm not sure that the floor wouldn't have been softer. After three nights, we moved to the Hotel Maria Cristina, where the beds were much more comfortable. All-in-all, a good hotel, though if you're willing to walk a few blocks more to get to the Metro and shops, I think there are better values to be had in the area.", "Date": "April 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery, very happy with everything at the Zona Rosa!\u201d", "Author": "NewYorkDave", "ReviewID": "UR4564809", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the Royal Zona Rosa for 5 nights.
