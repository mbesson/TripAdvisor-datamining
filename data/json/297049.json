The sound insulation was not good, but the reception reacted swiftly when, two nights running, we complained about the noise from the neighbor 's TV. Breakfast is good and can be enjoyed inside and in a conservatory-style adjunct to the villa (or rather villas: the hotel is spread out over three of them, all close together). At times, the influx of breakfasters exceeds capacity. I heard from my colleagues that some of the rooms are very pokey, but the reception tries to switch complainants to better rooms. I also heard that the - free - internet connection was not good everywhere, but in our room it was fine. The location is in a quiet tree-lined residential street, but rather far from the metro and major sights, and about ten minutes walk from restaurants.

I was there for business with a personal day on either end. San Pia is located in a really nice residential neighbourhood on Aventino Hill. At first glance it seems like its off to its self, but it is actually abut 15 minutes from FAO (hence alot of people coming fro FAO meetings stay here), 15 minutes from Circus Massimo, and 20 minutes from the Colloseam/Forum/Palatine Hill. Though i didn't do it, it is also possible to walk to the pantheon, trevi fountain, spanish steps, Santa Maria del Popolo and the shopping district around Via Corso (i would guess it would take about 40 minutes to get to the start of Via Corso, then the other sights are nearby aso you go up Corso towards Pizza Popolo). The hotel itself is lovely, very traditional in its styling. It is spotlessly clean and the service was perfect. The staff knew your name and were very friendly and helpful. My room was rather small, but perfectly functional. I had a king size bed (very little space on either side), bathroom with a shower, huge window, large patio with a table and chairs, TV (can't comment on this, didn't turn it on for my whole stay), mini-bar, safe and a vanity for my clothes. The bed was comfy, though a little hard as all european beds are. Shower was great. One side of the room was a huge windown and a door to the patio, as this was facing the street i was a little worried about noise and light (i am a ligt sleeper), but the room had these cool electronic blinds that covered all the window and teh door at night so you weren't bothered by the street lights. The room had free internet in the room and free wifi in the comon areas. Two minor annoyances - you had to get a new password every 36 hours which got annoying if you forgot and in my room the internet cable didn't quite fit into my computer and if i moved at all it fell out. That was frustrating while skyping with my family. Breakfast was included at the hotel and it was fine, decent selection, very european (ie no bacon and eggs or omelets or anything like that). I enjoyed it but found that after 8 days, i was pretty sick of eating the exact same thing every morning. The hotel has one elevator, and it is very small and very slow. I don't think you could get two people and their luggage in there at the same time. My one and only issue with the hotel (and its nothing they can really change so this didn't affect my rating, just thought people should be aware) is that like all old european buildings the walls are pretty thin, so if you face the street you can hear every car and motorcycle that drives by, and the street cleaners and garbage men, etc. Even worse though, is that you hear everything from neighbouring rooms. Truthfully, it could be that i simply had a loud neighbour, but it was enough to bother me. Especially as i was working and had to up early every day (and especially on my last night when i had to be up at 4am to catch my flight home). I probably should have called reception and asked them to talk to the man, but i didn't want to cause a fuss. One other thing to be aware of (which is probably the same for all hotels in rome) - there is a 2 euro/night tax added on to your room that you pay at the end. I had been told by colleauges that this had to be paid in cash, but mine ws just added on to my bill and i paid it all on credit card. So in summary - i loved the hotel: Positives: location, price, service, decor, patios, cleanliness, friendliness, free internet, free breakfast negatives: thin walls", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cI felt like I was on a honeymoon by myself here!\u201d", "Author": "Hannahlrobertson_11", "ReviewID": "UR125015007", "Content": "I decided to book this hotel as I heard it was in a nice, leafy area of Rome; so I could unwind after my 24 hour journey from Australia and relax for two days before starting Contiki.

A receptionist replied that she would do her best. Viola! I was greeted to an amazing European-style balcony.

What feels like a remote retreat is actually walking distance to the centro storico and tourist sights, and right next to the less touristy, lively Via Marmorata and the characteristic neighborhood of Testaccio, where you can soak up some true local flavor, and shop and eat as the Romans do.

It is part of a local chain of hotels, Aventino S. Anselmo Hotels, apparently owned by the Catholic Church. It is quite basic, with a commmon reception area and a breakfast room. The hotel rooms are fairly spacious with nice bathrooms, but all the rooms are different - so it all depends upon what room you get. The rooms have minibars and a safe locker, and the bathrooms are equipped with hairdryers. The TV menu is large, but 98% are Italian programmes, and I needed assistance to find the BBCWorld and CNN. The bed was quite hard, but if that is to your liking, then it's fine. The breakfast was OK with a modest selection of fresh fruit, yoghurts, ham, cheese and hard boiled eggs, and bread and pastries. They provided a good selection of gluten free items upon request. And the coffee was excellent. It is posssible to have the breakfast served in your at no extra charge. During the day and evening the breakfast area served as a bar/coffee lounge. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the hotel could arrange for pick up at the airport for about the same amount as a taxi would charge. If you arrive late in the evening og do not know Rome from before hand, this pick up service is very useful. It is possible to go by train to the station \"Ostiense/Piramide\", and from there it takes about ten minutes to walk (with luggage: take a taxi just outside of the station). The hotel is conveniently located for those who enjoy walking. it is within walking distance to both the Forum Romanum/Colloseum and Trastevere, but there are very few shops and restaurants \"around the corner\".

Even though we were not in the center of Rome we found it easy to get where we wanted to go by cab, bus or walking.

We were looking for a really nice hotel in a quiet neighborhood to enjoy the Roman leg of our third trip to Rome since we were married.

We used tripadvisor to narrow down the choices and settled on the Aventino Hotels Group part of Grupo Pirolli. We checked on the site for availability for the and found rooms for our time frame and \"10% discount\" as part a 2009 rate pricing special for all their properties on the Aventine Hill(Villa San Pio, The Aventino, and the Sant\u2019 Anselmo) . We made the reservation at the Villa San Pio by selecting our dates and giving them our credit card information on line. So far so good.... The site confirmed the transaction with \"You will receive the confirmation to the email address ______@____ It detailed the dates, price and type of accommodation reserved. It close with \u201cIf you do not received the confirmation email within 24 hours please contact us at [--]..... \u201c.

Since I had made reservations at the Villa San Pio I answered back from these other properties when I got responses the next day that I had accommodations already reserved. About a day later I this email from the Aventino Hotels informing me I didn't have a room: (\"THIS IS NOT A CONFIRMATION (WE HAVE TO CHECK THE REAL AVAILABILITY) Dear Guest,thanking you in advance for your choice, we are pleased to inform that your request has been correctly registered.

For any other question or information please contact [--] I was surprised and checked with the other hotels I was interested in Rome by phone staying up until 3AM. They were now booked for doubles like we were seeking. I emailed the Aventino Hotels ASAP for clarification and they made it clear I could not get the pricing I had reserved by that I could still get a room at the full price and that they had not made an offer but rather offered me an opportunity to apply for a room at a certain price. I indicated the initial wording indicated I would indeed get a room but that the email confirming it could take as long as 48 hours. There was no doubt in their on line system. After several emails and two days they restated the full price offer and my wife suggested that we check the pricing and availability on their site.

Our room (515) was excellent - elegantly decorated and furnished, and extremely clean throughout. Being a corner room it had plenty of light and also had a small balcony overlooking leafy streets. The en-suite bathroom was beautiful, although the bath with combined shower looked a little tired (our only critisism, and a minor one at that). The hotel grounds whilst small, were very nicely maintained. The restaurant and outside seating area were very pleasant and peaceful, and were a nice place start and end the day. The staff in the restaurant were excellent and very friendly, whilst the staff on the front desk were pleasant and efficient and our booking was well handled. We booked a family room (double bed plus good sofa bed) directly with the hotel and were offered a special price of \u20ac216 for two nights (that's total, not per night), which also included an excellent buffet breakfast. Having researched hotels in Rome extensively prior to booking this one, I suspect this is possibly one of the best value hotels in Rome! The hotel is a 5 minute (\u20ac7) taxi ride from Roma-Ostia train station. If you're flying to/from Rome Fiumicino (Leanardo da Vinci) airport ,you can easily get a local train from the airport that takes about 25 minutes and costs less than \u20ac6 per adult (kids are free). The local trains we used weren't crowded and it was a hassle-free experience. Finally, for sightseeing, the hotel's location is great too. Everything we wanted to see was within walking distance (we like walking!), and there's a Metro station a few minutes away although we never needed to use it. From the hotel we managed walk to the Colosseum/Forum (15 mins walk), before heading up to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps(+25 mins), then visiting the Vatican(+25/30 mins), before returning to the hotel via the Trastevere district.

Definitely did not look like the pictures on the website. I didn't really like the location of this hotel either. It wasn't really close to anything and walking to any points of interest really is an arduous task. I thought it would be a little off the beaten path but it felt more like staying in the 'burbs. Another problem that made me crazy was trying to take taxis back to the hotel. Previously we stayed at a hotel near Piazza Barberini and it was much easier to tell the cab to drop us off at the landmark, but there are no landmarks anywhere near the hotel and most of the cab drivers had never heard of it, so just getting back became an ordeal.

We got in the Colosseum ( 11 euros ticket) and Villa Borghese ( 14 euros!) , so the Roma Pass is totally worthy. Especially in Rome , when the metro is not so helpful in getting you to the destination, oftentime , you have to take the metro and the buss to get to a place. A metro ticket costs 1 euro per trip. To get to the hotel from the airport, we prefer taking the shuttle bus for 15 euros per person. The bus takes you to the hotel door ,saving you the uphill experience. The leonardo da vinci train to roma termini costs 11 euros , and from there you have to take a metro to either piramide or circus maximus station. If you buy the Roma Pass , save yourself from walking to the station by taking the public buss . There's one station just down the hill , and almost all numbers (no 75 including) will bring you closer to piramide station. That can save your energy in hot Rome. To go home, do the opposite. For a good dinner, go to Trasvetere , it's a neighborhood close by the hotel, just across the river. There's a direct buss to go there (ask the hotel). Many restaurants there serve good food at good prices ,compares to other touristy areas. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. After a long day walking and touring Rome , it's always a joy to come home to a good-looking hotel with great room and jacuzzi :)", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "RAF Mildenhall, England", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "UK352", "ReviewID": "UR16520235", "Content": "It's been a while since we stayed there but we still talk about how much we loved it.

We arrived at Roma Termini from Florence around 1pm in the afternoon. We took the B line to Circo Massimo, crossed the street, and purchased a map from the magazine stand on Aventino. We ended taking an out-of-the-way route, but got to see the U.S. Consulate (as well as a few other foreign consulates) and the beautiful upscale residences, which reminded us of the homes in Beverly Hills and Larchmont Village in Los Angeles. Check-in at HVSP was quick and simple. We were escorted to our room by Agapito, an immigrant from the Philippines, who confirmed that Rome boasted a huge Pilipino population, something we'd noticed by the sheer amount of spoken Tagalog heard at Roma Termini. Our room was smaller than we expected and was, in fact, the smallest room on our trip (we stayed at five hotels in Italy) and the smallest room we've ever had in Europe. We did have a small terrace, which we never had the opportunity to enjoy because we didn't have the time and because I had already suffered numerous mosquito bites in Venice and Florence that gave me no desire to keep our terrace doors open. The bedroom decor lived up to the photographs featured online. I wonder now whether the size of our room was in direct relation to our \"great deal\" from venere.com. The bathroom featured a reasonably-sized shower. We thought that the towels on the rack directly adjacent to the toilet was a potential sanitary disaster. The stopper in the sink had to be manually inserted if you wished to use it. Amenities were a bit lacking as we had shampoo, shower gel, and lotion, but no conditioner or hotel slippers. We never had the opportunity to fully enjoy the included buffet breakfast as the first morning, we had an early tour pick-up, and on the second, an early train out of Roma Termini. However, we managed to grab croissants the first morning, and saw the delicious spread of standard breakfast fare. We did have dinner at the hotel restaurant on our first night. The ambience in the dining room was set by the glass walls looking out into the garden patio, as well as the beautiful glass chandelier hanging in the center. We were given complimentary glasses of champagne (or prosecco), as well as a plate of croquettes and bruschetta. I ordered a seafood risotto, which was amazing, but something I could have at eaten at home from Macaroni Grill. Previous guests have made note of chilly encounters with various members of the front desk staff, but we did not have that experience.

We booked this hotel solely on the strength of the Tripadvisor reports, and we can fully and wholeheartedly endorse every positive report that is on this site. But first - and don't let it put you off ! - be aware that Rome is a big, sprawling, noisy city, with a lot of traffic and a lot of tourists. There IS litter, there IS graffiti, there are a lot (too many!) itinerant street traders selling the usual fake designer gear, and there are beggars and vagrants. On both our stays at the Villa San Pio, we were in Room 269 and although this didn't have a balcony, it was a corner room with four sets of windows, some looking out over the garden, and was a delightful room. 'Though admittedly with a somewhat quirky jacuzzi and a rather underpowered hairdryer! The Aventine Hill is undoubtedly very charming and a very quiet and upmarket neighbourhood. You will read (or have read) other reports that say that the hotel is at the top of a hill. Well, from our point of view ( coming as we do from the Pennines in Yorkshire) this is just a gentle gradient! Certainly, we were able to walk everywhere, and on our last day we walked from the hotel, via the Circus Maximus and Collosseum, and then on to the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, before arriving - more by accident than design - at the Borghese Gardens which we then walked around and then into the Zoological Gardens. We then walked back to the hotel via the Piazza de Popolo and the Vittoria Emmanuelle. The point I would make is that for anyone who's reasonably fit and active, the major sights are all accessible; and the fact that the hotel is away from the hectic and frenetic hub of the city was, for us, a major advantage. We didn't make many demands on the concierge service as we knew what we were looking to do each day and part of the fun is finding your way around - and there's quite a bit to see in the immediate neighbourhood - Saint Sabina, the Orange Gardens, the Keyhole, etc. But the hotel did book us onto a Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel trip and although this might seem expensive, it's well worth the cost. We found one or two of the front desk staff to be a bit distant and slightly reserved. Certainly, when we were discussing something with one of these gentlemen and he broke off to take a 'phone call, we felt that it was a bit discourteous not to say \"excuse me a moment\" before he took the call, and not to apologise when he returned to us; and a smile wouild not have gone amiss!!! But apart from that, no complaints whatsoever. And the little guy who seems to have 10 jobs - from Porter through to troubleshooter - is always very friendly and smiling and a terrific asset to the hotel. The room was always immaculately clean. Food? We ate Roman one night, but I found the meat a bit too stringy for my tastes. We went to a local Pizzeria another night. The other evenings we dined under the stars in the beautiful hotel gardens. The food - we had the fillet steak on two nights - was first rate, and the service friendly and attentive! A couple of times for lunch, we went down the \"hill\" to the Barberini (lovely pastries, pizza slices, and espresso) where the prices are exceptionally reasonable. Would we go back to the San Pio?

We stayed at the villa for six nights arriving Monday 28th May 2007. Whilst it was a good choice we did, unlike some other reviewers, have some issues with it. The trip didn\u2019t get off to the best of starts and we arrived in a rather foul mood at the hotel. The taxi driver from Ciampino airport charged us a fare of 60 euro and said that, as a road was closed, he would have to drop us just around the corner from the hotel. \u2018Just round the corner\u2019 turned out to be over 2km from the hotel and we ended up having to lug our suitcases the entire distance across major roads and along uneven pavements. We weren\u2019t aware that the hotel has it\u2019s own Mercedes car. We booked this for the return journey at a cost of 40 euro. Alternatively the reception will book you a fixed price taxi for 30 euro. With hindsight we\u2019d have used the Mercedes on arrival, rather than line the pockets of rip-off airport taxi drivers, but unfortunately we weren\u2019t to know. The receptionist and the member of staff who took the luggage to our room were very cheery and friendly and our mood began to lift. The villa is located on the Aventine hill. It\u2019s a built up suburb but it has a nice to feel to it with leafy tree lined roads, little traffic, walled gardens and large villas. The hotel reception is located in the building next to the main entrance gate. A path leads through a small garden area to a second building containing a ground floor dining area and, above that, a number of rooms (four per floor) including our one (no. 267). Don\u2019t rely on the numbering system to find your room \u2013 267 is rather strangely located on the third floor. Forget that feeling you get when staying in a large chain hotel. The villa has oodles of character and, thankfully, you feel like an individual guest rather than part of a faceless crowd. The room was mid-sized with twin beds, wooden floors, a safe, and imitation frescos on the walls. All tastefully done. The bathroom had marble walls and floors, giving it a rather grand feeling, with somewhat unexpectedly a Jacuzzi bath. Apart from the occasional sound of footsteps from the room above there was no noise from the surrounding rooms. Soundproofing of the windows could have been a little better though and the sounds of people talking outside would occasionally intrude in the evening. I hate the sound of barking dogs and unfortunately one of the neighbouring properties has one such dog that would bark for ages each evening. Each day we were impressed by the thoroughness with which our room was cleaned. Unfortunately the cleaners had a habit of not looking carefully at which complementary shower gel and shampoo bottles we\u2019d used and we would end up with lots of replacement shampoo ones but nothing else! Breakfast is a buffet affair. No cooked option was available. In contrast to the way we were greeted upon arriving at the hotel, the staff at breakfast, although efficient, seemed humourless and distant. Although we\u2019ve had better breakfasts elsewhere it was perfectly adequate although on one occasion the bread seemed less than fresh. The breakfast area (which is used for dining in evening) consists of three parts: a glass conservatory area, an outside patio area and an inside dining room. All very pleasant. Take your pick. If there\u2019s one thing you need to weigh up then it\u2019s the location of the hotel. True, the hotel is located away from the hustle and bustle of the city but the downside is that the central attractions aren\u2019t right on your doorstep. The Aventine Hill is south of almost everything you\u2019ll want to see in the city (apart from attractions outside the city walls such as the Apian way and the catacombs). You\u2019ll always therefore invariably find yourself travelling North. We love walking and we found the distances no trouble at all (there are delightful ruins around almost every corner that you\u2019d easy miss when travelling by bus or taxi) but for some it may be too far to walk and you\u2019ll need to think about the practicalities of other forms of transport. The Circus Maximus (10-15 mins walk away) will begin to seem like an old friend as you\u2019ll find yourself passing it on every trip. Skirt its eastern end if you\u2019re heading for the Colosseum (about 25 mins walk from the hotel) or the palaces on the Palatine Hill. Skirt its western end if you\u2019re heading for the River Tiber, The lovely Forum Borium, The Roman Forum and the Monument to Vitto Emanuele II. On a couple of occasions we walked to the Vatican along the (very scenic) banks of the Tiber and this took around 75-85 mins. For us the tranquil location far outweighed any distance we had to walk.

We did not have the experiences other travelers cited such as taxi drivers who couldn\u2019t locate it. Nor did we find the walk up the hill from public transport to be daunting, although it did require tapping those last energy reserves after a day of walking around the city. We concur with other reviewers enchanted by the fragrance of orange, jasmine and lemon on the walk to breakfast and in the area as a whole. The staff all spoke English, were highly knowledgeable, and unfailingly gracious despite a full house. Common areas were tastefully decorated with antique furniture and provided a cozy feel. The room (525) was large but a bit Spartan, with upholstery beginning to show signs of wear. Could have done with a rug and a comfy chair for the limited time we spent in the room other than sleeping. Other reviewers bemoaned the small television set but we never turned it on and didn\u2019t feel we were missing anything. Bathroom was a good size by European standards although the ancient hair dryer leaked more hot air out the hose than ever got to the nozzle. After resolving our confusion over the controls, the air conditioning worked flawlessly and was essential, even in mid-May. The breakfast buffet featured a lavish assortment of fresh baked goods, cold cuts, cereals, and fresh fruits \u2013 different selections each day. At the bottom of the hill, just across the train tracks on via Marmorata is a marvelous pastry shop/coffee bar (Barberini) and a gourmet shop (Volpetto) that will prepare a picnic complete with bread, cheese, ham and wine plus a map of how to get to the Garden of the Orange Trees and other not-to-be-missed spots on the Aventine Hill.

I am a bit picky but also don't expect too much from hotels in Europe in general because most of the time they are small and just very expensive for what you get. Hotel Villa San Pio was worth every penny. I picked this hotel based on the reviews posted on Trip Advisor and the price. Here is a true and honest evaluation of the hotel and my familys experience in Rome. The hotel is approx. 1 mile from the collosseum and the ancient Roman Ruins. This is a nice walk but will take you 20 minutes to walk there. You will need a cab for the Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel. The hotel is in a residential area but believe me with the surrounding gardens and piece and quite you will be glad to be away just a little from the city. The hotel staff was very helpful and spoke english just fine. They even had a doorman. This hotel is rated as a 3 star but I think it should be a 4 star. Hotel rooms have a terrace in some if you ask. I did look at one with a terrace but we picked one without on the second floor. Our room was large and accomodated myself, my wife and my 21 year old daughter. The room had a tapistry on the wall that had to be 10 feet long by 5 foot worth thousands. The room had a king bed and a sleeper bed for our daughter, both firm but comfortable. Our room was number was 266. It had hardwood floors and the bathroom was all marble, very beautiful. The room also had a hair dryer and tv. This was a top notch room even for an american hotel. Each morning we got up to a complimentary breakfast that had coffee, tea, rolls, pastries, cereal, fresh fruit, juice and on and on. Very very nice and a great start to the day. This was better than many breakfasts I have had in American hotels. Rome Itself Tips: From the airport take a white cab (the true Italian cab company) to your hotel. It is 40 Euros plus a tip. Most sites you can do on your own but the Vatican Museums I would suggest a tour because there is so much to know and you will not know what you are looking at with out a guide plus it helps get you through the lines faster. We used Angel tours as recommended by other travelers but our guide \"Lorin\" was not very good. She spoke perfect english but it was so noisy most of the time you could not hear her. I think you can do better with some other company. Many other had listening devices as they went through and Angel tours did not have these. We took another tour of the collosseum with a different company who were just there and it was fine. We also went to a flea market on Sunday and beware of pick pockets. Three gypsy women came up to me asking the time. One grabbed one arm to look at my watch and one grabbed my other arm and one went for my pocket which I felt and I was on to them and ready so they did did not get anything but this was the only place I had this expereince. My family and I wondered all the streets around rome. Everone spoke some english and we had no trouble getting around or seeing all of the sites. I found the cab drivers to be friendly and did not try to take advantage of us. My recommendation is to stay at this hotel, go and see all of the sites and don't put it off. We cabbed it everywhere, bought everything under the sun and took evey tour and saw every site we could in 6 nights and spent less than $1,000 Euro's plus we ate at just about every pizza restraunt in Rome.

The Hotel lived up to my expectations in all aspects. Beautifully decorated with good service in a tranquil location in classy Rome, who needs more? We were given room 525 for the first night, but wanted a room with a balcony so we changed to 521 for the last 3 nights. The staff handled everything with no fuss. This room is a bit smaller with only a small wardrobe and a shower and not a bath/shower, but the balcony was superb to look out in the mornings or evenings over the rooftops facing south. Try to book room 522, this seemed as big as 525 and had a similar balcony to 521, the best of both worlds. Beds were hard as described, but the high quality bed linen was changed everyday and extra pillows were provided as requested. The Hotel is in a great location, away from the hectic centre but in a good residential area with good links to Circo Massimo and Pyramide metro stations. Breakfast was served in the conservatory with a good continental choice and good service. We had dinner there on the second night. The food was ok, but despite a few table candles the room was still a conservatory with little atmosphere. Eating out is to be recommended unless you are exhausted after a day's sightseeing. The Hotel recommended several restaurants in nearby Testaccio down the hill, but we ate in Trastevere and in the centre near Piazza Navona both easily reached by bus/taxi, again the hotel will provide transport details. The Navonna Notte restaurant behind Piazza Navona can be recommended, it's not much to look at, but the service and food were by far the best we had in 5 days. Ostia Antica is a must if you can get out of Rome for a day. 2 Euros return train ticket from Pyramide, these are fantastic ruins of the old Port of Rome. Hire a mP3 player to provide multi lingual guides to the ruins, this brings them to life and is a great day's excursion and compliments busy Rome. The Angel Tours guide (Anne Marie) was fantastic for the Vatican, St Peters and the Sistine Chapel well worth the 25 Euros guide fee. Another good tip, buy the combined Palentine Hill/ Colosseum tickets at either of the Palentine Hill entrances and walk straight through the ticket queue at the Colosseum, great feeling.

After reading the fantastic reviews on TripAdvisor, we booked 3 nights at the Hotel Villa San Pio from the 15th to the 18th of April through a great website called Secretplaces.com. This website offered great rates, even at high season, and including breakfast. Following the advice of a previous reviewer here on TripAdvisor, we booked a very nice Mercedes from Touringcar.it, who picked us up from the airport and dropped us at the hotel for the fixed price of 44euro, a great bargain. The hotel itself looks stunning from the outside, surrounded by trees and shrubs in full bloom in the Spring, and the street is wonderfully calm. The staff at reception were very friendly, and as we had arrived before noon, we were a little early for check-in so they offered to keep our bags in the office, while we went exploring for a little while. They also supplied us with a map of the city and some recommended restaurants. Only a few minutes walk from the hotel, you find yourself already in the heart of Ancient Rome, with the Circus Maximus, Colosseum and Roman forum right in front of you. Upon our return to the hotel, our room was ready with the porter waiting to bring our bags up. We were placed in room 522, an elegantly decorated room, which may have been a little small were it not for the balcony outside that we had requested when booking. The bathroom was clean and modern, with a jacuzzi bath which was very much appreciated at the end of a long days touring through the city. The huge bed was firm but very comfortable. The restaurant, conservatory and gardens were very pleasant and peaceful. Breakfast was delicious, a selection of fruits, breads, yoghurts, juices and coffee. The evening meal was also impressive, a full four course and my boyfriend adored the steak! The menu was mainly in Italian but the waiters were quite happy to translate and describe anything we were unsure of. If you prefer something a little cheaper for dinner, head down the hill to the local restaurants, of which the favourites are marked on the map supplied by the hotel reception. \"Perilli\" do a delicious fillet steak for only 12euro, a steal! Il Cantinore was another lovely little local place. I would advise able travellers to try the Metro for getting around the city, it was cheap and very efficient, but keep the hotel map with you so you know which direction you should be heading! Also, the Italian drivers are crazy so crossing the street is a bit of an adventure. Do as the Italians; find the pedestrian crossing and walk determinedly, but carefully, to the other side. Don't dither! Lastly, be aware at all times where your handbag/wallet is! Gentlemen, keep your wallet in a secure inside pocket where you can feel it at all times, and ladies, use a handbag that closes securely and keep your hand on it. Luckily we had no problems with thieves but there are many reports of unfortunate tourists having their wallets/purses stolen from right underneath their noses. One Italian man did try to trick us at the top of the Spanish steps, by asking us to place a finger inside a loop of string he had, his plan was to catch our finger tightly in the loop and refuse to let go until we gave him money or a colleague robbed us, a common swindle apparently. If you decide to walk back towards the hotel one day from the city, I would highly recommend following the banks of the Tiber, a peaceful stroll in the evening sunshine. The hotel organised a car to bring us to the airport on our last day, at a fixed price of 40euro, which was great but not as nice as the new Mercedes on our arrival(!) That was the end of our trip, but it was our faboulous experience at the Hotel Villa San Pio which made it so memorable.

The hotel occupies three small buildings surrounded by lush landscaping, with the excellent restaurant housed on the ground floor of one. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious, with particularly good crusty rolls. Dinner was also fine, but there are a number of good, less expensive places down the hill in Testaccio if you're in the mood for something less elaborate. We particularly liked Il Cantinone, which is billed as a pizzeria but offers much more, and Remo, which is bare bones with terrific pizza.

We waited 45mins for the 1st course and 30 mins for the second. We complained on several occasions, and my friend's steak arrived very undercooked (he asked for medium/well and got rare!). The poor service was complimented suitably by the extortionate prices (service charge, cover charge etc - \u20ac6 for a GLASS of wine), and topped off by the incorrectly cooked food. We eventually paid about half the bill in protest, and left in sheer disgust! Finally, we stumbled upon an excellent private car service which guaranteed a fixed price from Fiumicino to our hotel (any hotel in Rome) of \u20ac42. we searched the web and found several otions, and decided to try 'Touring Car'.

Our transport to the hotel from the airport was an adventure on its own. We attempted to take the train into the city centre and then hoped to sort ourselves out at Termini. Unfortunately we weren't well prepared, and couldn't wrap our brains around the metro, and how to get to the hotel. So... we took a taxi from Termini - the driver had no idea where to go, got lost several times, but eventually delivered us to our destination. The entrance way is impressive, and we were welcomed very warmly by the reception staff. We booked the standard double room, and were very happy with the room. It was clean, large, and comfy. Our little terrace looked out on the front street, and had the weather been nicer we would have spent more time sitting out on the chairs gazing over the rooftops of the charming neighborhood. But let's face it, you don't go to Rome to hang out in your hotel. My very favourite part of the hotel experience was the breakfast (which was included in the price). You actually leave the hotel and walk through a gorgeously landscaped fantasy - an enclosed and seemingly exotic pathway that leads to this fantastic solarium. The food selection was better than your average fare, and the quality was excellent. Plus sitting in that solarium (in our case with the rain hitting the panes of glass) surrounded by greenery and flowers, just made us feel cozy and inspired. By the end of our weekend, we had figured out the metro (two closest metro stops are Circo Massimo and Piramide on line B) and pretty much walked the entire city. If you are ambitious, walk it all. You'll see so much more of this amazing city. The best and the worst thing about this hotel for us was it's location. And by worst I mean that there really wasn't anything wrong with the hotel at all. The location is out of the way, so it is quaint and charming and quiet. It's also hard to find, and a bit of a hike to get to if you are walking like we did. We thought being a km away from the Colosseum would make this hotel ideal, but the truth is that the Colosseum is also a little out of the way, and that the hotel is up on one of the 7 hills.

Most major attractions are pretty far away and it could be a little tricky to get to the hotel by using public transport especially at night.

My partner and I spent his birthday weekend in Rome and stayed at the Villa San Pio. I had read the reviews before booking the hotel and I have to agree with all of the positve comments mentioned. The staff were really kind and friendly and incredibly helpful. The location of the hotel was perfect and Rome really is walkable as we found out. When I booked the hotel I mentioned it was my partners birthday and I'm not sure whether it was this or whether they noticed the birthday cards in our room but on returning after a busy days site seeing we were presented in the bar with a bottle of something cool and sparkly. The barman insisted on bringing it to our room and it was accompanied by nuts and chocolates and a card wishing my partner happy birthday. It was an incredibly thoughful and appreciated gesture. the room was huge and very clean and comfortable and the breakfast was fab! All in all a great place and I would definately stay here again when I revisit. The only blot on what was a fantastic weekend was the taxi driver that picked us up from the Termini and took us to the hotel. We were charged just over 30 Euros and the hotel told us that it should have costed 12-15. The journey did take along time but as it was our first visit we didn't really know how long it should take. When the driver dropped us off (up the road from the hotel!) it was quite dark and he managed to switch the notes my partner gave him from a 20 euro to a 5 euro. We actually ended up spending about 60 euros on this one ride without realising it until he had gone. He was very clever to say the least. We have since found out that this is quite common in Rome. I would recommend that if you take bus transfer from the airport to the termini don't use one of the taxi's that gather around the drop off point but walk to the main termini entrance and get one from there, no guarentee but propbably a better option. I would also recommend the public transport. the hotel can tell you which bus to catch and where it stops and also we used the metro to get back to the termini.....it cost us one euro each!", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cSanctuary in Rome\u201d", "Author": "speckster", "ReviewID": "UR6178971", "Content": "Take my advice if you are (or are travelling with) a princess such as myself. The San Pio was a lovely and quite neccessary retreat from the craziness of Rome. My husband and I spent 3 days there in April. Despite being a girl who loves a bustling city (New York and Paris are delightful to me) I found Rome to be a bit overwhelming at first. While it is one of the great cities in Europe and a neccessary stop if you want to do Italy justice, I was surprised to find that it was not the hospitable Italian experience I was expecting. It was, in fact like other major cities I have visited, fast-paced and no nonsence, noisy and a little dirty. Caught me off guard I guess, because everyone I talked to before my trip had me expecting all italians to be like those little old ladies in the Prego commercials. I am grateful for the reviews on trip advisor that lead us to stay at San Pio. The hotel is tucked away in a lovely residential neighborhood just out of range of the chaos of the city, but still walking distance from the forum and colluseum and wonderful restaurants (try buccatino, fabulous seafood risotto). The staff at the hotel were superb. Excellent service, and when the mouse on my computer wouldn't work and I was about to have a mini meltdown because I couldn't check my dog-sitters daily weblog (I told you I was a princess) my husband asked the concierge for help and he gave us the mouse from the front desk computer to use. After a lovely dinner at the hotel restaurant the next night, our laptop wouldn't work at all, so the gentleman behind the desk let us use his computer to check the blog as well. All with that famous italian hospitality that I had been told about. The room was lovely. Decorated traditionally, but not in that over the top tacky italian renaissance way that you run into if you're not careful. Impeccably clean, and spacious by european standards.

We even took the Rick Steves nighttime self guided walking tour of Rome, caught the metro back to the hotel with no problems. Walking to the Palintine hill, and the Collesium is easy. There are a lot great resturants within a 10 min walk, we ate at all of them and had a superiously wonderful time. We were so busy exploring other places to eat, we never had a chance to try the hotel dining room, too bad.

It's location (Aventine Hill, a short walk from the Pyramid Metro stop) was convenient to all of the tourist attractions, yet set in a very relaxed and lovely neighborhood. We never paid more than 15 euros for a taxi ride to any of the tourist locations, all the way up to the Stadio Olimpico. The value is also excellent. There are two buildings in the Villa san Pio compound, sharing a short, winding walkway through a pretty garden area. We had one room in the main building, and one in the building set back from the street. The 2nd building also houses the restaurant - where the complimentary and very nice breakfasts are served. Rooms are VERY spacious, with plenty of storage space and very nice, clean, and well-appointed bathrooms. We were shocked at the low rates we paid for the quality of the facility. The room in the 2nd building didn't have a balcony, and was a little smaller than our room in the main building. The room in the main building had a wonderful, large balcony overlooking the oak and sycamore lined street. There are terraces on both roofs, although the one on the main building is far nicer and affords excellent views of Rome. The rooms are clean and well appointed, but appear to have gone about 3 or 4 years without being refreshed. The rooms could probably use a fresh coat of paint and the beds and bed linens were not quite top quality. They were nice - just not four or five star material. Internet connections are easily accessible (ethernet cables in the room, wireless connection in the main lobby), but cost about 12 euros per day. The service received was outstanding. Our stay here was part of a 3 week Barcelona & Italy 25th anniversary vacation. Our two children were to come to Rome to surprise my wife and to stay with us for the remaining 10 days in Italy. The staff at the Villa san Pio went well beyond the call of duty in helping me to arrange the surprise. Luigi purchased four (outstanding!) tickets for the SS Lazio v. Empoli soccer match, arranged for my two children to arrive at the Villa san Pio one night before we did, and for them to meet us at the stadium. All while preserving the surprise for my wife. Luigi and the Villa san Pio staff carried this off beautifully, adding touches that I hadn't asked for that helped make the surprise better (and easier for the kids to carry-out). And the surprise was complete! Thanks Villa san Pio! The Aventine Hill is a very calm, residential area, consisting of large luxurious appearing homes. The neighborhood reminded me very much of homes in the wealthier sections of Pasadena, California (the climate too ...). Walks down the hill to the Metro station (or the ATM or a pizza joint ...) were very pleasant strolls - the hill is not steep at all. Traffic in the immediate area is a very relaxing break from the crazed traffic of the rest of Rome. One warning, the elevators may be the slowest we've ever experienced (and are quite small). Fortunately, there are only five floors in either building - you WILL beat the elevators by walking, even at a modest pace. The complimentary breakfasts have a larger than expected selection of breads, rolls/muffins, cereals, wonderful selections of fruits, breakfast meats & cheeses, and a normal array of items that may be purchased (omelets, waffles, etc.). The restaurant area is very nicely appointed with views of the lush garden areas of the compound. Get a room in the main building with a balcony. The balconies are HUGE, and are a great place to sit, sip a beverage, and talk about what you have done or plan to do. Assuming the weather is nice, you'll only have the sun in your face, hear the chirping of birds and the rustle of leaves, and the occasional barking of a neighborhood dog or the sound of children playing. This is a wonderful hotel, a surprising oasis in amid the history, chaos, and bustle of Rome. And it is a shocking value compared to the other hotels we've stayed in.

The hotel itself is rather grand for a three star establishment and the rooms have large comfortable beds, mini bars and clean, well-equipped bathrooms. Some have balconies and although ours didn\u2019t it was still light and airy. A final remark is that the breakfast is varied and plentiful which is most unusual for this part of the world.

They could not do enough for us. I am fortunate that I get to travel to Europe on a regular basis. Should you be visiting Rome, I would strongly recommend the Hotel San Pio. My one down comment about the San Pio is that they have a sister hotel (Anselmo?) about 100 yards away which has just opened after refurbishment. The hotel staff gave me a guided tour and although it may be a little more expensive than the San Pio, I would try to stay there to enjoy the luxuries that it has. It is classy. Regardless, they are both magnificent quaint hotels that I would not hesitate to use in the future.

I totally recommend them. The drivers were professional, courteous, english speaking, aided us with our cases, were early both on arrival and departing and had good executive cars. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the counter staff who were very friendly even though busy. We were taken to our room by the bell boy, who again was courteous and cheery. The hotel is set in its own lovely grounds and comprises of three seperate buildings ajoined by a covered walkway. Our room was 271 and was on the 4th floor of the 3rd building. The hotel has a lift(very new looking)thankfully. On opening the room the bell boy showed us how to work the airconditioner and the private safe. The room was tastefully decorated with stenciled fresco's and pastel colours. The wooden floors, antique style furniture and nice throws gave it a luxury feel. The robes were ample and lit inside. The bed was simply enormous!! The bathroom was marble and had power shower AND jacuzi bath big enough for two...... that was soooo nice after a long day on your feet. The location is brillaint. Its a 10 minute walk to the Circus Maximus and about 20 minutes to the Vittorio Emmanuel Monument. When you return after a hard days sight seeing and shopping its so quiet and tranquil. Its a very safe district and there are some nice restaurants within 10 minutes walk. We highly recommend Perrlli (very traditional Roman) and Il Bucatino (Fantastic menu, nice setting and great food). The hotel breakfast is as good as you'll get in any european hotel and the breakfast room is a lovely place to start the day. The hotel staff were really friendly and cheerful. We made a couple of requests of the concierge's that they need not have done, but they did it without question. I think in Britain or Paris you'd be charged or get a total look of disgust until you did it yourself! However, it was not 100% perfect. Our ONLY two gripes were that on arrival a patch of the bathroom floor was wet and on having our first jacuzi, the bath leaked quite badly, and that the bathroom window was broken. On reporting it, the maid was up within 5 minutes and left extra towels both days until it could be fixed. All in all this hotel was fantastic and we WILL stay here again.

I chose the hotel based on all the reviews on this site. Our room was on the 4th floor, on entering the room we were very happy, it more than met our expectations. The room had double doors opening onto a large private terrace, we had a king size bed, the room was a decent size and well apointed, the bathroom was clean, modern and had good water pressure from the shower. The staff at the hotel were very friendly, in particular the bellboy who stands at the front of the hotel each day greeting guests and also the little guy with a big smile who works from 3pm-10pm each day at the bar. The location of the hotel is out of the city centre, we actually liked this fact about the hotel. On our first morning we walked to the Coliseum (about 20 mins walk) then through the Forum and up to the Trevi Fountain, we then walked back across to the Pantheon, walked around the Piazza Navona and then Campo de Fiori and then we made our way back to the hotel along the River Tiber. Now it was some walking but we both really enjoyed it. The next day we went to the Vatican, we got a bus ticket from hotel reception for 1 euro each and walked down the hill from the hotel and caught the No 23 bus directly to the Vatican and then back again later in the day, the hotel staff will point you in the exact direction for the bus, its a 10 min walk from the hotel. The surrounding suburbs near the hotel Testaccio and Trastevere offer very cheap and tasty meals along with well priced wine and beer compared to the city centre area of Piazza Navona and Campo de Fiori. The hotel breakfast is typical of continental europe, breads,cereal,hams,cheese etc, not really my fancy, but their cuppachino's are fantastic! If/When we go back to Rome we will stay at the San Pio again. At 140 Euro per night we believe it to be the best value hotel we have stayed in Europe!

From the second we arrived, we felt pampered by the professional and fluent staff. We had requested a triple room with a terrace via email before we left, and the hotel promptly responded although they stated they could not guarantee a terrace. Well, the room they gave us was well beyond our expectation for a European hotel room. If you want the best room with a fabulous view of the neighbourhood and the basilica nearby, then request room 530. The terrace was wrap around, with tables and chairs to sit on outside to view the leafy street below. And we only paid $189EU / night when we booked online (this was the peak of tourist season) Even though it was technically a smoking room, we could not smell a thing. Why smoke inside there is such a nice terrace. The bathroom was spacious with marble and acuzzi tub. Unfortunately the jets weren't working during our 3 night stay. However they did sent someone to look at it and they didn't just dismiss our claim. We were so happy with the rest of the hotel that we didn't dream of kicking up a fuss. We had heard about Rome's famous heat, but we were treated to fabulous weather. It was warm, but not stifling, with only the odd shower that lasted for a few minutes. The air conditioning in the room worked extremely well, in fact it almost got cold when it was on. The A/C here was not just a fan, as we had discovered at other hotels. Also, a safe and a nice wardrobe. There was FREE internet access in the room! What a treat after being disconnected for the 2 weeks prior. Like many hotels the Villa San Pio offered a free breakfast along with our terrific rate. Wow, what a fantastic deal. The servers make your coffee/tea/cappuccino/hot chocolate to your taste, and it is just as good as that in any coffee shop. The food was a veritable bounty of croissants, buns, pastries, cakes, fruit, eggs, yogart, cereal, cheese, fresh meat, juice... We couldn't believe that they were able to offer such selection without charging the same inflated prices as the other hotels we stayed at in France and Italy. PLUS, one of the best parts about staying in this hotel was the dining area. You could eat inside or on the terrace under the umbrella to shield the sun. The garden was absolutely beautiful, and so calming. It felt like you were eating on your own patio at home, if your backyard if professionally landscaped. The resident cat, who we called \"Francesca\" because the server didn't know her name, was SO friendly and sociable. Who can resist a place that comes with a hotel cat? We dined at the hotel for 2 of our 3 evenings there, and there was a great selection of dishes (although no pizza, which we found at a nearby restaurant). Aside from the well-appointed rooms and lobby, the staff were unbelievably professional. All of them were fluent in English, which helped us with our minimal knowledge of Italian. They were able to reccommend the nicest little restaurant in the area that had terrific prices (especially compared to those in the tourist areas) and the treat of seeing how the true Italians dine. The concierge also helped us buy the $4 EU passes to take the bus/metro all day. Much better than spending individual fares. The bellhop was very friendly and jumped to attention the minute we were in sight of the hotel. You couldn't ask for better service here. If you want to stay in an oasis away from the noisy, crowded, overpriced tourist areas then book at Villa San Pio! The neighbourhood was gracious and very safe. We never felt scared even walking at night to visit the local restaurants and the bus stop a few blocks away. Walking along streets lined with lemon and palm trees is an experience unto itself.

Let me count the ways: 1. Location: The Aventine Hill is a quiet and beautiful part of Rome just south of the Circus Maximus and the Forum. No traffic noise, just peace and quiet. After a hard day's walking and sightseeing, it was a joy to wander back through the Aventine Hill and relax in peace at our hotel. The Testaccio, with its restaurants, bars and market is also 5 minutes down the hill. You can pick up your lunch from the Testaccio market or from Piu Volpettis and save money instead of lunching at tourist spots. We enjoyed eating at Da Bucatino and Augustarello's and also had a truly memorable (but pricy) meal at Checchino dal 1887. 2. The Hotel: Beautifully restored, spacious and well-appointed rooms, excellent AC and wonderfully clean bathrooms. Free Internet access too. The hotel has a restaurant which is a little pricy compared to places nearby in the Testaccio, but nevertheless an excellent place to eat, especially if you arrive tired and jet-lagged and can't be bothered to go out on your first night. The sister hotel, Villa San Anselmo, is currently being restored just round the corner, and if the end result is the same, will also be an excellent place to stay. 3. The staff: Without exception, everyone was friendly and helpful, from the front desk to the maids and the bar staff. English was generally spoken very well. Americans might find the staff more reserved than in the US, but this did not bother us at all - we found the staff a delight. 4. Access: OK, it isn't 2 minutes from the Spanish steps..... but we could get anywhere we wanted by cabs (the staff will call cabs from a nearby cab station for you) for about 10-15 Euros, or the Pyramide metro 10 minutes walk away. 5. Price: It is not a budget hotel. We paid 220 euros/night at the height of the tourist season, but for the location, rooms and service, we felt this was a real bargain. If you want to stay in a centrally located, noisy bargain basement flophouse with no AC, rude staff and crummy rooms, go ahead.

They were not aggressively rude, but we were glad we did not have to ask them for anything. The rest of the staff, however, from the bell-hops to the maids, were great.

Our room must have been located near the laundry room, because we heard noises very early in the morning that sounded like washing machines. Also, the shower leaked every day leaving the bathroom with a large puddle of water. This must have been common, as a towel was already laid next to the shower upon our arrival.
