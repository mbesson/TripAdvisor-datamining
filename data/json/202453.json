The hotel is in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin and has many good restaurants and cafes in the neighbourhood. If you turn right out of the hotel, you will be on one of Berlin's main streets (Kurf\u00fcrstendamm) in 10 minutes or less. The hotel is OK for one or two nights but it offers an essentially no frills experience and is not 4 star in my opinion; it reminded me of a Travelodge hotel in the UK. We had single beds (i.e. narrow/child style ones) and the flattest pillows I have ever had in a hotel. We had to ask for more pillows but this made little difference. The room temperature was also difficult to control but there was a window to open which made a difference. No tea/coffee in the rooms but there is a minibar. I would advise other people to take their own shower gel/shampoo as the soap attached to the wall of the shower was empty after two squeezes! Free Wifi is not available; fees apply and although Internet is available in reception, this is also another chargeable service. The hotel offers a basic product but the staff were great and it is a very clean place.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPoor\u201d", "Author": "Stewart268", "ReviewID": "UR126789071", "Content": "Small roomed hotel in remote residential neighborhood.

It offers the perfect blend of efficiency and friendliness. I arrive on a minus nine snowy Feb evening . The bespectacled senior receptionist sees me step out of my taxi and strides out to assist me with my luggage.Addresses me by name and welcomes me back ! Am I in Four Seasons or what ! I have stayed here 16 times since 2003 .Since 2004 have given me my favourite room with terrace overlooking the school yard EACH time . The rooms are spacious , have large windows through which natural light bathes the inside. Some of the rooms are decorated in a beautiful blue colour . The welcome amenities are classy . The bathrooms are spacious and stylish.The toiletries are better than you would expect in a European hotel of this rate.But above all the staff at the reception , the bar and the breakfast room are the best I have met in any hotel . They treat you like a family friend returned to visit. They pre-empt your needs.Like a taxi on the first morning of ITB !! The bar has a limited choice of wines but tell you what ! Each bottle is excellent . The breakfast room has the sun pouring in theough its beautiful large windows. And the cheese , the bread , the fruits , the cold cuts , the smorgasbord are all excellent. The small hot buffet is of the best quality .And the tea , coffee station with separate pots is perfect .After a good morning run on the stately Berlin streets this is the place you want to be ! But the biggest surprise is dinner! In a city like Berlin where you have a stunning variety of fantastic restaurants , we normally dont eat at the restaurant in the hotel . But last time I had an early morning flight and my guest could arrive only at 9 and I didnt want the Italian down the road . So we decided to eat in the restaurant.And I had arguably the best steak I have ever eaten ! With an excellent but not overpriced bottle of red wine. Excellent experience .Again a small menu but what I ate was delicious.

It took 5 mins walk from the U-bahn (metro), and 5 mins to Kurfunstendamn. There are some nice restaurants 2 mins walk away also. Reception provides essentials if you've forgotten anything like toothbrushes and razors, and the bathroom provides all in one shampoo/body wash. Negatives of hotel. We asked for a double room but as usually happens we got to single beds pushed together (I never understand why hotels do this?). Also pillow was very odd, it was like a sack, and then to make fuller you had to fold it. You had to pay for wifi and breakfast was 12 euros, so we decided to go to a cafe up the road which filled us up for about 4. But all of this was very minor and we were very happy with our stay :) WARNING ABOUT BERLIN TRAINS!!******** We didn't know about this, apparently its quite normal in some European countries. We got to the airport trainstation and there was no one about, but we managed to get a ticket (ABC single, cost 3 euros) and got on the right train. We noticed there was no date on it, thinking it was a bit odd, but there was a time, therefore we thought it'd be fine. WRONG. We got halfway, and were asked to leave the train by ticket inspectors, who told us that because we hadn't validated our tickets (aka used the stamp machines next to ticket machines which we hadn't even noticed to stamp todays date on) we had to pay a fine of 40 euros each!!! Thinking it was a scam, they took us to the information desk on the platform and confirmed their id was real. After protest they let us off with 40 between the two of us because we were tourists who didn't know. The experience really shook us up and we think it was incredibly unfair, and avoided using the trains apart from our journey back to the airport. I can't imagine how much money Berlin trains make from catching tourists out this way, so make sure the same doesn't happen to you!! I'll definitely be doing a lot more research on cities transports next time I travel!", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cValuer for money\u201d", "Author": "Svetlana P", "ReviewID": "UR122642955", "Content": "The hotel is in Kurfunstendamn area.

My wife and I had booked a long weekend during October, along with my brother and his partner. We'd booked well in advance, over 9 months previously, and were looking forward to the break. I'd chosen the Park Inn due to the good reviews and locality to the underground line. However, upon arriving we were told \"there is a problem\", and the lady walked off. She came back a short while later to explain, very matter-of-fact, that the hotel had been overbooked and we did not have a room. I found this hard to believe, firstly we had booked 9-months in advance and secondly it was only 11am in the morning so it was unlikely that all other people had checked in already. When I questioned this, I was given a very frank and honest answer. The hotel had received a block booking from a coach tour, and we had been gazumped. When I asked why they had chosen to do this, I was told it was more profitable for the hotel! Not exactly great customer service, but at least the receptionist (clearly this wasn't her choice) was honest. We were then told we had been booked into an alternative hotel, the Best Western a couple of kilometres away. After fruitless negotiation and a period of stunned surprise, we were eventually offered a taxi to the other hotel. I\u2019ve stopped in hotels all over the world, and NEVER before have I had my room cancelled knowingly by the hotel because they could make more money from someone else! The BW hotel was fine, but listed itself as a 3* rather than the 4* hotel that we'd booked. Now, I'm not a hotel snob, but I expect to get what I'd paid for! The real annoyance was not being told. The hotel had our contact details, why not contact us and at least give us a choice to find our own accommodation? Upon return to the UK, I wrote an emailed letter of complaint to the hotel. A week later, after no response, I sent the email onto the Central Reservations team, and another week later, still after no reply, I sent again to all emails I could find for Park Inn. Eventually, I got a response from the hotel and an offer of an upgrade if I choose to visit Park Inn Berlin West again - not likely!!! Berlin was fun, the Zoo and Berlin Wall being the highlights along with some amazing beer and atmospheric pubs. The BW hotel staff were great, and by the end of the break we\u2019d almost forgotten about the awful service from the Park Inn and the far from ideal start. My advice would be to give Park Inn Berlin West a wide berth and save yourself the stress. The service of the Park Inn group is awful, and they will never have my business again.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery good stay\u201d", "Author": "Jim K", "ReviewID": "UR120535887", "Content": "This hotel is well located, the rooms very clean tidy and spacious.

But the room was clean, quite big and had plenty of storage space. I usually sleep wearing earplugs, so I can't really say anything regarding soundproofing in the hotel - but I thought it was quiet, it's situated nicely on a sort of \"sidestreet\" in a sleepy neighbourhood.

The area surrounding the hotel is really nice, there's a really nice park within a walking distance.

In the immediate surroundings there are some restaurants, but nothing much else. As for the hotel, it has a pretty big parking garage, and a nice clean reception. The people in the reception where very nice and helpful regarding the few questions we had. The rooms where ok sized, and very comfy.

Berlin is a huge place and the transport system is excellent, the hotel is less than 5 minutes to an underground station. You do have a couple of lines to cross to get to a main line, but we managed fine, and it was nice to have the tranquility of the hotel on your return. The breakfast was good as others have said it was laid on four hours most days, we were surprised thought it would be continental but there was hot foot, scrambled egg, streaky bacon, boiled eggs, very nice. We had a great time, would recommend big fat bike tours, leave from the TV tower at Alexandra platz (think that's right) we had a fab time really enjoyed it.

The decor was a bit dated but the room was clean ... and a good size, which is often unusual in European hotels. There is no air conditioning so the rooms could be quite hot in the middle of summer. Good bathroom (nice bath). Basic toiletries. Mini bar okay. Excellent breakfast. Staff very helpful. Wifi was a bit expensive (Euro 46 for 4 days) although there is a free terminal in the lobby. My main quibble is that on two nights that I was there the restaurant was closed in the evening (because of a tour group or private party or something). There are lots of good restaurants in the area, but sometimes it's nice to be able to eat where one is staying, particularly for a solo woman traveller.
