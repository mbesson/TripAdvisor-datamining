After arriving in Madrid, my first hotel was terrible so I jumped on Priceline UK and found the Hotel Lusso Infantas. It was very reasonable (for Europe) 100 Euros avg per night for three nights. The front desk staff was very kind and efficient. The room was stylish and comfortable, with laminate floors, nice lighting, and flat screen TV. The bathroom was large and modern. A nice box of toiletries was supplied. View was only to an interior courtyard but allowed good light to come in.Very nice experience and great location.

It is expensive, but well located, clean, modern and friendly staff. I had however two major problems that would put me off staying here again:1 - The bedroom where we stayed had a wooden floor and it seems they never cleaned under the bed as it had a thick layer of dust.2 - The bed must have come from a second hand shop!! It is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever slept in, worse than anything from my college days. Even a belly full of beer at night didn't help!!! For such an expensive hotel to even be in possession of something so crap beggars belief..Of course I should have complained, but we had an itinerary planned before we even got there that saw us away early in the morning and back late at night so there wouldn't have really been a time to move. In hindsight though.....Anyway, based on the appalling bed, I wouldn't go back.

My best friend and I stayed in a twin room at Hotel Lusso Infantas last week. We were so impressed. We stayed for \u9227?0 per night (before 7% VAT), which for a genuine 4 star hotel is a bargain price. Aesthetically the hotel communal areas, rooms and bathrooms are lovely; everything was clean, well maintained and there were touches of luxury too. Service was also good with great maps provided.Location is perfect. It's away from the construction sites and noise of Puerta del Sol, but only a 10 minute walk away to the west. Also, it's just off Gran Via, which has some great shopping. To the east, the Retiro park is only about a 15 minute walk away. On weekends it can be a little noisy from the revellers partying away, though I've heard that about most Madrid hotels. FYI, Hotel Lusso Infantas is only a 5 minute walk from a brilliant restaurant, Finca de Susana, which feels like a fine dining experience but also at bargain prices! My friend and I ate and drank there for \u9227?0 per head for a three course meal. Ladies, for dessert, Zamboanga's Dessert is unmissable! : ) Get there when it opens at 2030 so you don't have to queue like the rest of the tourists and locals.Back to the hotel, my friend and I really would recommend this hotel to anyone, regardless of budget; it's fantastic!", "Date": "Aug 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR716897986", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MaxiBon"}, {"Content": "Great for the price Close to the action without the action being on top of you.

This hotel is definitely worth booking if you can get their rate of 85 Euro per night. We did pay 140 Euro per night for a couple of nights of our stay and it was still worth it (as the rest of Madrid was even more expensive!) but it would be a bargain for 85 Euros!Location was great if you want to be near the Prado/Thyssen museums, Retiro Park and the designer shops in Salamanca. The neighbourhood is cool too with lots of bars, restaurants and cafe's within a 10 minute walk.We walked to Puerto de Sol in about 10-15 minutes at a leisurely pace. We had a huge bathroom - very nicely done up with a great shower and lots of hot water! The room was a very good size too with ample cupboard space. The flat screen TV is a bit small and only has a couple of English speaking channels (both news channels!) but we weren't in the room too much in any case.The only downside is the wooden flooring and noisy doors! Wooden flooring means noise from people walking down the corridor and talking isn't cushioned - its actually amplified! And the room doors bang shut. This did disturb our sleep in the morning. We had room 201 which was next to the service lift...and really noisy service door! Also, they seem to have only 1 iron in the whole of the hotel so its probably worth taking a travel iron along if you don't want to wait for it!Breakfast was not included in our rate - but we managed on a coffee and croissant from the Starbucks which is opposite the hotel. There is a bakery just down the road from the hotel if you'd rather 'go native'!Beware - everything around the area is shut on a Sunday - except for some bars and cafes.

The service was generally unasuming but friendly and responsive. In a renovated building, the rooms are modern and nicely appointed. It was so lovely and tranquil that it was hard to drag ourselves away in the morning. In a quiet street, just off the Gran Villa it is close to all the old-world cites...and steps away from a very modern Starbucks.
