Booked a room jin a rush and just a couple of days before my arrival to Berlin so there were not many available hotels left. I will recommened to not to stay there unless you've no other option.Room was clean but looked very bad with poor quality bed and some shelves which looked like somebody would find some wooden elements and just put them together what looks very bad. I understand that you maybe can't expect a lot in that price but still I expected something of a better quality.Room was on a ground floor with the widow facing car park what made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe.If you don't need a lot for breakfast, it is ok.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "africa", "Title": "\u201cwell located moderately hotel\u201d", "Author": "solotraveller48", "ReviewID": "UR45580147", "Content": "This property is within walking distance of many Berlin attractions including Postdamer Platz and Checkpoint Charlie.

Nice. The hotel was located in the middle of nowhere. It wasn't easy to find. The area is quiet but... Our room was on the first floor. The view from the window was to a park. People walking by could see right in. Yes, we did have curtains, but they were transparent. All of the furniture was made of wooden blocks. The bed was made on blocks, the chairs were blocks, the shelf on the wall was made of blocks.

There is, however, little nightlife nearby and after dark this area is a little soulless although apparently safe to walk around. The reception staff were very cheerful and friendly and it was very apparent that a lot of effort was put into keeping the place clean. In contrast to other reviews I thought my room was very small and dark. There wasn't much competition for using the shared shower room which was routinely cleaned but was poorly ventilated and subsequently damp and mouldy.

The location was great - I walked everywhere. The place was very clean, I never had to compete with anyone for my shared bathroom, and the breakfast, while not spectacular, was certainly adequate.

This hotel was the very suprise of my whole trip. The location is simply perfect, just a block from subway station and Friedrichstrasse, the most elegant and commercial street in Berlin and no more than 3 from Gendarmenmarket (don't miss the Fassbender & Rauch chocolaterie) and almost 4 blocks from Postdamer Platz (Sony Center) and Brandeburg Gate. The Putin it's a new building in the very center (Mitte) of Berlin. We stayed at the Berlin room (non smoker floor), extremely BIG, sunny (3 wide windows that looks to an interior and greeny plaza), confortable and so quiet. There's a lavatory inside of every room and a nice bathroom only shared with 2 others rooms. Every floor has a living room with a balcony, a nice kitchen where they serve you a breakfast (coffee, tea, juice, toast, jam, cheese, granola, etc). There's another room with a wash machine and you don't have to pay anything for its use. The boys/girls from the reception are helpfull and wonderfull! So, if you dont need a concierge all the time on the other side of the telephone line, this is by far the best place to stay in this wonderful city.
