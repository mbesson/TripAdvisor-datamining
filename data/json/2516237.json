The El Bonita Motel is a reasonably priced choice if you can overlook a few things. It is on Highway 29, but the road noise is usually minimal at night. Our room, on the second floor, was unexceptional, however it did have a nice balcony. The TV was as vintage as the hotel, they need to upgrade to flat screen TVs. Interestingly, the walls were devoid of any decor - it would seem apropos to hang some Napa-related scenery/art - even a few pieces would have livened things up. Breakfast was a disappointment. Cold cereal, a few pastries, some fruit, coffee and Sunny D (!?) - not even real OJ. I recommend you drive/walk the quarter mile or so south to Dean & Deluca and get some real coffee, croissants, cheeses, etc. to start your day - you'll be glad you did. Is this a destination lodging? Not really. Would we stay here again? Yes, as it is a good value for the area, and besides, you don't go to Napa to sit in your hotel room and watch Wheel of Fortune.

Location because at the end of a day of tasting wine, you don't want to be driving very far to your hotel. Price because Napa Valley is a world class destination now, and it can get very pricey! Comfort because nothing is worse than shelling out a lot of bucks, only to find your room is not even close to worth it. El Bonita is located in the very heart of the valley, on the south edge of St. Helena, on Hwy 29. You can actually walk to several famous wineries and restaurants. Score 5 stars for location! During the \"season\", the price is not so good, but from fall to spring you can score $90 rates! This is the best time, as tourist traffic is down, but weather is still great, on average. The rooms have been refurbished, and are quite nice, though small. (For larger rooms, one can stay in the back area, but these cost more.) The deal is on the poolside, front rooms. Beds are only Queen size, but comfortable. Bathrooms are small, but nice.....and the tile floors are warmed somehow! The office, which is just a few steps away, offers coffee and continental breakfast. Pets are also allowed, though there is a fee. If you come to Napa for wine tasting and learning, this is the ideal place.

The bed was so high from the ground was actually uncomfortable getting in and out. The bathroom was probably the worst part of the room. The jetted tub was heavy with chipped and peeling paint; not to mention the yellow stain line around most of the tub. Getting in and out of the tub/shower also proved to be difficult as there was about a foot and a half edge....good thing there was a grab bar! Also, the area is pretty safe, however I feel the need to mention there were also sliding glass doors that opened to a shared grassy area.

It has become a destination for both domestic and international tourists. Consequently, room rates for hotels, inns, and B&Bs in this area are quite high. El Bonita motel offers a bit of relief from this never ending price escalation. My wife and I stayed here 5 nights at the end of December with an average room rate of $121 plus 14% tax. There are several different buildings in the motel. We chose a king bed Garden room. The room was fairly spacious, containing 2 big comfortable easy chairs as well as a small glass topped table and chair set that looked like it belonged on a patio. There was a microwave and refrigerator and some dishes. Decor is absolutely \"motel-standard\". It was quite cold during our visit and the management had no problem providing extra blankets. (Recently at several hotels, I have been told that \"there are no blankets available.\" The only negative would have to be the continental breakfast, available from 7:30 to 10:30. There are 4 kinds of cold cereal, instant oatmeal, bananas, apples, and oranges. (The oranges were sporadically available during the 5 days and starting on the 3rd day the bananas were bright green and not edible.) They provide apple juice boxes like you would give your elementary school child and bottles of orange drink. (Water plus sugar plus a little orange juice). Pastries are individually wrapped supermarket type. The clerk told me that the health department did not allow them to put out fresh pastries from the local bakery. On one day there was no milk available for coffee or cereal and the desk clerk said in so many words, \"I can't do anything about it, I just work here\".

The continental breakfast was a selection of cold cereal, pastries and donuts, fruit, coffee, juice. It all looked delicious. The location is so great because it's just south of the main street in St. Helena and just north of a ton of awesome wineries, which would make wine tasting and dining very easy to do.

After reading the previous reviews, we opted for a room in the back to avoid the street noise. This motel sits right on the busy street, so during rush hour it can be a bit noisy. We never had any problems with this. Our second-story, end unit room was SO quiet. We had a sliding patio door with a balcony that overlooked a beautiful meadow with oak trees. (I'll try to upload photos later.) As the sun set, it was really serene. We enjoyed the beautiful, yet empty pool area. There was one other couple at a nearby table enjoying a bottle of wine. The pool was exceptionally warm - say 90 degrees - and the staff told us that they heat it year round. Loved the pool area...there was also a spa and SAUNA which we did not use. The rooms around the pool area (motor court) were cute and if not for the noise, wouldn't hesitate to book one of these. Nightime lighting on site and on the trees added to the charm. Noticed that other guests had bicycles delivered to the resort by a local biking company. Neat option. Grounds were beautiful and manicured nicely. Many places around the resort to sit down with a good book. Breakfast area was a bit cramped, but we sat out on the patio by the fountain and that made it nice. Food was simple, but fresh. Fresh berries, cereal, and fresh pastries (as opposed to previously frozen.) My husband commented that he thinks the pastries were provided by a bakery...they were good. This was a perfect overnight stay for our little family. Not only would we stay here again, but we'd recommend it. Price was right at $109 for a larger room. While in the area, we took the kids to the Napa Valley Olive Oil \"Manufactory\" (a no-frills hidden gem my parents and I have been visiting for 30+ years) which is in downtown St. Helena, the Calistoga geyser (kids LOVED the animals), and \"Taylor's Refresher\" local drive-in for a simple supper.

It was clean, though, and the bed was comfortable without that annoying 'roll-into-the-middle' feature so common to hotel beds. The bathroom had been recently renovated and was immaculate - with a river rock shower floor and all glass shower wall/door. It passed the most critical test for me - good water pressure and lots of hot water. Being a MO-tel the rooms all border immediately upon the parking lot so people arriving after you're in bed trying to sleep are very much a problem. We always travel with earplugs, though, and that solved the difficulty very nicely. Without earplugs I would have had a lot of difficulty here because of that. People tend to forget that they need to talk quietly at 1am when they're right outside someone's window. All in all I would highly recommend the El Bonita.

I wasn't expecting grand accomodations as a budget traveler, but I should have believed the rave reviews on TA and the promise of a hotel close to the towns of St. Helena and Yountville! They were right... This is no roadside motel. The courtyards are beautifully charming with water fountains and landscaping. The kidney-shaped pool is surrounded by teak loungers and grass. The pool area also has a hot tub and sauna. There are more teak chaises and tables in other grassy areas of this verdant property. I didn't get to enjoy these ammenities much because it was unseasonably cool during my visit, but I imagine they would be incredibly tempting in the summer. As for the rooms, there are in three buildings. The main building is one story and the rooms face the road - that could be rather noisy at night, I imagine. This building also houses the office and breakfast area/lobby. The lobby has a couple tables for breakfast and a seating area as well as a desktop computer with free internet access (the entire property offers free wifi). Breakfast is a rather bland continental affair - no toast or hardboiled eggs. Just cold cereal, oatmeal packets, pillowy croissants, danish, coffee, juice, yogurt and whole fresh fruit. You can also take your breakfast back to your room or eat it outside on the patio. There is another one-story building set back further from the road and a two-story building where we stayed, on the second floor. The room had a spacious bathroom, sink outside of the bathroom, fridge and counter prep area which is convenient for assembling snacks and lunches. The two queen bedrooms are spacious. Our room had a quiet terrace with chairs that was nice for a glass of wine in the evening (glasses and corkscrew provided in each room). You are not going to get the luxury of a $500-per-night hotel, but for $155 per night off season we feel we did very well. The grounds are so clean and well-maintained. We saw someone actually cleaning the ceilings of the outdoor hallways... twice. There isn't a spot on the balconies or stairs that lacks fresh paint. This isn't a B&B where you'll get good recommendations for restaurants and help making your winery appointments for tastings and tours - the front desk is there to check you in and out and that's it.

I was sorry to see how it had really gone downhill since the last time I had been there. Yes the value, compared to other lodgings in St Helena, is very good. The location is great, close to shopping and wineries and restaurants. The landscaped pool area is very nice and so is the hot tub but the sprinklers came on with no notice at 3:30 in the afternoon. I was caught off guard and my book was drenched by the time I jumped up from my lounge chair, scooped up my wet things, and ran. Wouldn't it make more sense to water in the morning or late at night when no one is using the area? The service was pretty awful at the front desk but the housekeepers are friendly and helpful. I would suggest they switch the front desk help with the housekeepers if the housekeepers spoke better English. The breakfast was just rolls and fruit, half an hour wait when they run out of coffee. The peanut butter jar was empty and really, nobody cares if you are happy or unhappy with the service. They just want you to pay and then go away and not bother them. They apparently do a lot of business with laborers who get up at 6 in the morning and talk real loud as they are getting ready for work. You hear everyones toilet flush and shower run. The chairs in the room had the stuffing coming out of the holes in the cushions and the rug was threadbare and worn in spots with tape over it. Half of the electrical outlets didn't work. My husband had plugged his cell phone in to charge and it was still dead in the morning. So it isn't really a place to relax and sleep in or lay by the pool and read or enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning or do most things you would want to do while on vacation. I'm so sorry to see it change like this. I was told they had not changed hands like I had thought after visiting this time. Perhaps they are managed from a distance?

All me and my wife are looking for is a clean room with friendly staff. The location of El Bonita is good and the room was clean, but so are a lot of other budget places in Napa Valley. I made my reservation a couple of months in advance and whoever took it had totally messed it up. They had in the wrong month and for the wrong number of nights. How you can confuse four nights in March with one in Febuary I don't know. However, mistakes happen and the real problem was the hassel I got instead of the staff just fixing the problem. They charge the first night of the room when you make your reservation as a deposit and at first they told me that I was going to lose that deposit because they messed up my reservation! I had to tell them I would stop payment on my credit card and explain they had no legal right to do that before they let that one go. Then they tried to make my pay for a room at a much higher rate then the one I had booked. I understand that sometimes reservations get messed up but the hassel they gave me instead of just fixing the problem was ridiculus. Interestingly enough, the next day we were in the lobby for about ten minutes and during that time two other people came in in which they had \"lost\" there reservations. These people were given similar problems to what I had experienced. It's not worth the hassel when your trying to relax on vacation.
