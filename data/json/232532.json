I thought the decor was very nice, our room, on the 6th (top) floor was very nice and more roomy than I expected. It was a twin superior (or deluxe room, I can't recall) and it had plenty of room for the beds (which were close together). At the foot of the bed, there was an arm chair. There was also a breakfast bar type of table with two small seats, and then yet another arm chair in the corner. The bathroom was large and everthing was extremely clean and updated. There was a mini bar and also a coffee pot in the room. The hotel is air conditioned but the a/c was not working during our stary. Luckily, it was cool at night and we slept with the windows open. The hotel is located on a quiet side street just about a block from the Madelaine. The location is perfect if you want to stay on the Right Bank. You can walk to most of the main attractions quite easily. Also nice is the fact that on the same street as the hotel there are several cafe's and restaurants so that it is easy to grap a cup of coffee or a glass of wine. The hotel doesn't really have a bar, although I believe they serve some beverages in the lobby area. As a guest, you get 30 minutes of free internet, but after that you must pay for it. I see that as the only drawback to this hotel and I woud definitely either stay there again, or refer a friend. Note: if you are tall, you probably don't want a room on the top floor as those rooms on the street side are \"in the eaves\" and therefore one side of the ceiling is sloped.

The location is superb because it's in the center of Paris but on a relatively quiet side-street. One of the major shopping streets (Boulevard Haussman) is just a few minutes walk away and the area surrounding the hotel is full of various shops, cafes and restaurants. Champs-Elys\u00e9es and the Louvre are no more than 10 minutes walking distance. I shoul point out that Champs-Elys\u00e9es itself is a relatively long street and the busier part along with the Arc de Triomphe is at the further end. Most of the major sites are within walking distance (20-30 min) but if staying for only a few days like we did, I would recommend riding one way on the metro to Notre Dame Cathedral or the Eiffel Tower. As for the hotel itself, we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. Having looked at tens of hotels in Paris and reading A LOT of reviews, I understood that rooms in Parisian hotels are smaller than usual. We booked a regular room without any extras so we were prepared for a tiny room with just enough space to move around the bed but the room was spacious and even included a comfortable sitting area with a table and 2 chairs. There were also tea and coffe making facilites, a minibar, safe, satellite TV and air-conditioning in the room. Our room (no.51, 5th floor) was stylishly decorated with a modern style but also had a distinctly Parisian feel to it. There was a little bit of wear but the finishing materials were of good quality and it was a non-issue for us. The room was clean and housekeeping visited twice a day. When we arrived we noticed that one of the bedside lamps was not working but when we returned a few hours later it was already fixed (we didn't even mention it to the staff). The personell were very friendly and our room was already waiting for us when we arrived at 14 o'clock. We made our reservation through booking.com and everything was exactly as we requested. After we checked-out they were happy to watch our suitcase at the reception because we had an evening flight and wanted to roam around Paris for a few more hours. They even helped us print out our airplane tickets. All-in-all the staff was very nice and helpful. We didn't have any breakfast at the hotel so I can't comment on the restaurant. The only con that I could think of is the price of WiFi which cost 10\u20ac for 1h and 29\u20ac for 24h. On the plus side there was a desktop PC in the lobby which could be used for free. I should also mention that our room rate (classical room) was 140/160\u20ac per day but the list price is 250 to 300\u20ac.

The reviews of Le Vignon made it sound appealing, so we booked for just one night. It more than lives up to the praises heaped on it by other reviewers. The discreet entrance is tucked between shops in a little shopping street with all kinds of interesting small shops selling a wide range of things - honey, gloves, cashmere, charcuterie, a restaurant with a MIchelin bib, a brasserie, a perfumerie - and in late November it was festooned with Christmas lights. We were with friends - we had booked a 'superior' room and they had opted for a standard. Ours, on the second floor, overlooked an unexciting inner well, but was wonderfully quiet, a good size, especially for Paris, with seating for three and a cheerful contemporary decor. Our friends' room, on the sixth floor, was smaller but perfectly adequate and full of character, with sloping ceilings and a huge beam across the bath. Our room on the second floor merited a rating of five stars, but theirs was less peaceful and the constant intermittent noise of a generator or some other electrical equipment disturbed their sleep; otherwise the rooms would have got a five. The receptionist did offer them a free breakfast when they mentioned it (and at 15 euros for breakfast this is a more generous offer than it sounds. Breakfast at Paul just down the road is 4.10 euros). The price of breakfast, and charging for the use of the internet, is the reason for a four rating for value.

The buffet breakfast is served in a bright room with muesli, cereals, charcuterie, cheeses, breads, toast, fresh fruit and juices and ample hot beverages. The hotel is well served by the Metro and buses and its central position makes it ideal for exploring Paris on foot.

The rooms are wonderful, the reception staff is very kind, the room service (breakfast) is wonderful and the location of the hotel could not be more central. I wish some of the larger hotels would take this hotel as an example.

The price in not cheap, but ir is not expensive either (we paid 180 euros per day in a double room).

The hotel is in the 8\u00e9me arrondissement, very close to the Madeleine Church, to a metro station and to the big magazines (Printemps and Galleries Lafayettes).

We booked a few months in advance in order to celebrate our anniversary. When I told the hotel this they included a bottle of champagne in the quote which was a nice touch. None of the other hotels we were considering at the time offered so this was a nice touch! We booked a deluxe room rather than their standard rooms (they refer to them Superior rms) because they were slightly bigger and faced the back but to be honest while we were there we saw the superior rooms and there isn't much in it, infact they seemed lighter because they faced the street but I don't know whether they would be noisey. Our room had coffee/tea making facilities, sky tv and a little lounge area to sit and watch tv. On the few occasions we ordered room service they were very quick and very friendly. The staff on reception were extremely helpful and kind, as soon as we arrived they brought the champagne to our room and wished us well. Most nights we would ask them to recommend a restaurant which they did and booked us in with no problems. The first night they sent us to a restaurant called L'Envue on 39, rue Boissy (5 minutes from the hotel) which was really nice, lovely food and well presented, infact it's a shame we were so tired and couldn't appreciate it fully. The second night my boyfriend booked us into L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon on 7, rue de Montalembert which I would highly recommend, great food with a buzzy atmosphere and situated just off the chic Saint Germain. It's better suited to intimate dining rather than groups because the restaurant is designed so you are sitting at a bar essentially. The third and last night the hotel booked us into Le Moulin da la Galette on 83, rue Lepic which is in the area of the Moulin Rouge. Again lovely food not as good as the previous nights but very enjoyable. Lunch we grabbed as and when, we found a good cafe near the hotel called Fauchon Paris at 26-30 Place de la Madeleine which sold great french pastries amongst other things i.e. wine/cheese etc. Good place to get presents for home. Another if you are near the Notre Dame is (wait for it) Cafe Quasimodo!! As you can tell from the name it is geared at tourists but it's simple and does just the job for some food while on the move. With regards to the sightseeing, we saw the famour land marks mostly by going on the Les Cars Rouges tour bus, which cost \u20ac22 each (which we got from outside the Eiffel Tower) plus we paid a further \u20ac8 each for the Seine Cruise with Bateaux Parisiens. The tour bus tickets were valid for 2 days and the boat trip was valid for a month. If you need airport transfers then use the Roissy Bus which operates between the Airport and the Opera district which is perfect for staying at Hotel Le Vignon as the stop is 2 streets away. The cost was \u20ac8.50 per person (one way) and it took about 45mins, no need to pre book. I hope this all helps, you really wouldn't be disappointed with booking Hotel Le Vignon.

The breakfast in the hotel is more than you can expect from french breakfast. I have expected to have a usual croissant with caffee, but they serve some fruit, and eggs, and ham, and salmon. Of course, that's not a breakfast you get at Ritz, but still... The rooms are small, but cosy. Everything very clean. The staff is most helpful. They made all the restaurant bookings for us. After we have returned home, I have discovered that I've forgotten the key in a room safe. The hotel have sent the key to us without any charge. The only point of disconvinience was, that the hotel don't have any parking opportunities. But that is typical problem for hotels in Paris.
