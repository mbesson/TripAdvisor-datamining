On one occasion the doorman refused to get me a taxi when I asked him and instead poitned out the door and told me to get one myself. On another occasion the porter refused to move my luggage until it was zipped to his satisfaction and when we reached my room he yelled at me for not having the key. And on yet another occasion the sofa bed was not made up for the kids our first evening and there were no sheets or pillows available in the room. When I called down I was admonished for not telling them I need the bed made and had to go downstairs and wait at the front desk for someone to get me sheets so I could make the bed myself. The worst part of all of this was that when I spoke to the manager about all of this he was nice and then did absolutely nothing to correct the problems. Even worse, when I wrote a review on Yelp, he had it \"filtered\" for negative content. It was bad enough that I paid luxury prices for terrible service, but that my concerns went unacknowledged and then surpressed make me incredibly furious and even more determined to let everyone know that this is aboslutely the last place on earth they should stay unless they want to pay a lot of money for hostile service.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cOur Upper West Side home away from home\u201d", "Author": "sevencousins", "ReviewID": "UR83269547", "Content": "Manhattan is terrific, but very tough and can be daunting.

You almost feel like you have your own (rather elegant) apartment in New York. The building is in fact a mix of hotel and condo, I think. A lot of performers coming to Lincoln Center stay there, I hear. Why I'm giving it 4 stars, not 5: first, the neighborhood -- I was glad to be out of midtown or Times Square, but I wish there were some interesting shops or restaurants right nearby... maybe there is and I haven't found it yet.
