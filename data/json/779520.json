What a relief that in spite of the BA strike we were able to fly home on time! The rooms were grubby and the carpets and bathroom floor had ingrained dirt.

It was not a good start to the trip as the hotel decor is interesting, to say the least, with an excess of faded gold everywhere. The lifts are sometimes unresponsive; the rooms small and somewhat dirty; the bathroom has a shower unit that defies operation unless you have a guided tour; there were bare wires in the room; the cover to the main light fitting was missing; breakfast was adequate but uninspiring and petered out after 9.00. There was no information about anything in the faded folder left on the desk. The TV did not work. Given this was the start and finish of the holiday I think Titan took their eye off the ball and corporate greed took over which resultefd in masive corner cutting.

When we checked in, it is a bit like the Faulty Towers. The rooms are basic and bare. TV and fridge looks like from the 80'. The suite have one old double bed and a old uncomfortable sofa bed instead of 2 double beds. The hotel menu in the so called \"suite\" is empty. The only telephone in the suite with no directory of what number to dail for reception, housekeeping.................etc. The swimming pool in the basement looks a bit dark and not very clean. I have no intention to go in with my family after we saw the pool. It wil still cost us 5 euro each if we want to use the pool.

The security of in-house guest are not being guaranteed. Their room control system is totally messy. When their hotel is running full house, they will simply issue key card to guest who check in.

This time was worst. The new room that they assign, there are still guest inside the room taking shower. Another one round of hassle, we change the room.

Istanbul is a wonderful city, and the Golden Hill wasn't bad, but there were several problems. The hotel is on the main road (traffic all night) and as we had a road-facing room, a good night's sleep was not possible. The room was OK, but very shabby, the bathroom could have been nice if more attention had been paid to cleanliness! Breakfast was fine, with a wide selection of food, but the two evening meals we had were nothing to write home about. One evening there was rice and a type of stew. My husband and I are vegetarians, so we were offered just two heaps of rice with no accompaniment whatsoever! The waiters seemed to have a problem understanding that there are people who don't eat meat! Drinks taken at the horel are extremely expensive! Including one or two other little 'moans', these are the negative aspects of the hotel. On the positive side, the staff - especially the waiters in the dining room - were very friendly and helpful. The area around the hotel is not particularly attractive, but full of life; we found a good barber's shop round the corner and a nice bar. There is a down-the-steps bar city-wards on the same road as the hotel, but beware! the prices are exorbitant! OUR little bar (out of the hotel door to the left, then first road on the left) was great! All in all, I don't think I would really want to recommend this hotel, as I am sure there are others at the price that are more attractive to visitors to the city. However, it wasn't too far away from tjhe sights, and for three nights it was just about acceptable.", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pakistan", "Title": "\u201csadly disappointed\u201d", "Author": "noelkity", "ReviewID": "UR33788287", "Content": "quite surprised when informed that each of us (5) would have to pay TYL 10 every visit if we wanted to use the checkers board, the swimming pool, health club or watch the television in the leisure area.", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot as described\u201d", "Author": "eljoanda", "ReviewID": "UR20797478", "Content": "We had 2 different rooms here over 5 nights and neither had hair dryer,ironing board,safe as advertised.Fridge in one didnt work, nor air conditioner in other effective.Shower didnt drain properly,general room maintenance lacking and not really clean.No a la carte when we were there and didnt see TV room as mentioned,bar nearly alwasy seemed empty and closed.Service was indifferent .", "Date": "October 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely reasonable for the price!\u201d", "Author": "Nobodi", "ReviewID": "UR20469238", "Content": "It is a new hotel with very clean but small rooms.

There is no water boiler in room but you can order tea or coffee. There is no waste bin in the room (there is one in the toilet)! There wasn't any hotel telephone guide in the room and you must call \"0\" and the reception will arrange for everything!

I hoped they could also offer wifi in the rooms but they didn't. However, we (me and my wife) are satisfied stayed there and I hope they could also figure out the mentioned problems!

However, the heating system worked like a charm and the double-glazed windows shut out the noise relatively effectively. The hotel is located on a busy throughfare with a tram which brings you directly to the Old Town, which is super convenient. The immediate surroundings are ok, whilst no great shakes but plenty of kebab shops and pretty safe, even at night, although travelers should be warned that there is a bit of red light stuff going on -- but all pretty benign. Personnel was quite helpful but did not speak a lot of English. Breakfast was quite boring with the same thing every day. The swimming pool was out of commission when we came but that seemed to be the case with most other hotels which advertised pools. Maybe there is not enough water -- in fact, there was one occasion when the water seemed to be quite low but this is not the hotel's fault -- Istanbul is growing at a crazy pace and the infrastructure has a hard time keeping up. The hotel lobby is very pretty and bright )unlike many other hotels we saw which seemed to be more or less in the same class)-- kudos to the hotel for getting that right.
