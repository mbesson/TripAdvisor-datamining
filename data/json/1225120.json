{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Enjoyed a relaxing stay I kinda really liked Hotel Sorga. Its a little hidden from the main Poppies Lane 1, but I liked the fact that its a little further from the noise and crowd and motorcycles. The reception was friendly by the staff and it had such a nice sweet patio area for breakfast. :) Overlooking the pool, with views to the nice garden and a hotel pura...nice comfy patio furniture, and a great breakfast menu with multiple choices.A short walk will bring you to your rooms...Like the reviewer below, the hotel rooms are nothing to shout about. And a little bit shabby. My air cond even dripped! However, it had air conditioning, a bath tub, a nice big double bed, tv, and a balcony (to dry your clothes or sit outside), for about IDR 185,000. Thats pretty darned good for me, considering that other hotels just round the corner were trying to charge me IDR 300,000 for an air cond room!!The conditions of the room is not fantastic, I agree. But for the price and the relaxing garden and breakfast area....Id probably stay here again despite the many other choices I have on Poppies.", "Date": "Dec 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR162439078", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Lavy81"}, {"Content": "Relaxing haven in middle of busy Kuta We had a lovely stay in Hotel Sorga in October 2008 for a couple of nights. It was the second time that my partner had stayed there, so we knew what to expect. On arriving in Bali we were picked up at the airport by one of the hotel staff. This is part of the service and was really appreciated, especially considering that the plane was delayed by an hour, so the guy had to wait around.The hotel's location was great; right in the heart of Kuta, very near to many restaurants, bars and shops and a 20-minute walk to the beach. Service at the hotel was excellent with friendly staff and a delicious breakfast every morning: fresh fruit, smoothie, and a choice of eggs with toast or banana pancake. As for most hotels in Kuta, Sorga had a small pool, not ideal for swimming, but nice for a dip and relaxing around. The room was ok, nothing exceptional. We stayed in a deluxe room with an aircon unit and a cute balcony. The overall feel of the room and bathroom was a bit shabby though, and the towels did not seem very clean, but the shower was good. I would probably stay here again as the price was reasonable and the benefits outweighed the negative aspects.", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR962315147", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ElsBellesLondon"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d1225120-r22805027-Hotel_Sorga-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1225120", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
