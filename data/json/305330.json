We stayed there for seven days and NOT ONCE was the bathroom ever cleaned. It was so disgusting that the bathroom door had to remain closed at all times. The hotel staff said that they cleaned it every day but it was obviously not. Every morning when we stepped outside of our room there were towels folded beside our door. I can't say with 100% certainty but I'm pretty sure that they were the towels given to us for the night. The toilet paper was never replaced and it took 3 me three times going down to reception requesting it before receiving one roll. The hotel staff were quite rude and not helpful at all in terms of recommendations, except for a restaurant that a friend of theirs owned nearby (which I didn't go to). Breakfast was also quite bad there is only ceral, bread, ham and cheese. Also, they don't have wifi only a usb that has internet. I can't remember how much it was as it was not worth it. My advice is to go to McDonalds near Earls Court station and use their free wifi. The only reason I booked this hotel was because of its kitchenette, which was the only good thing about this hotel. I will never stay at this hotel ever again and to anyone who reads the more positive reviews about this hotel should seriously think again.

It was reasonably clean as was the bathroom, though the shower cubicle was a bit leaky. The curtains did not completely close and were held together with a clothespin, but since the window looked out over a dirty alley we kept them closed anyway. The people next to us kept their window open all the time which meant we could hear exactly what programmes they were watching on the telly.

The tap was hanging off so washing dishes was very difficult. Speaking of which you have to bring or buy your own mugs, tea, sugar and milk if you want to make tea, as all that was in the drawers was one spoon and one fork. Breakfast was rather basic, with toast and cornflakes. The receptionist's wife usually came in halfway through to start making eggs and sausages, but by that time the early risers were mostly finished.

The staff were quite friendly at check-in. We arrived a bit early, about 9:30 a.m., after travelling overnight on a trans-atlantic flight. We were happy that they allowed us to go into the room then since check-in time was 13:00 hours. We experienced some problems with the room though. The water was not running out of the face basin, the water was not running out of the shower, when we opened the pipe to get a shower, the shower head immediately fell off as water started to come out of it, almost falling onto my foot, then the fridge had a real moldy smell, the toilet seat cover came off at one end. Was a bit disappointed at first, since they knew we were coming and the room was not really in a ready state for guest. We reported the problems, the guy came and used a plunger in the shower area and that helped, the face basin problem did not get fixed neither the shower head problem, so the following day they offered us another room. That room had a problem with the kitchenette sink, couldnt get any water from the pipe. I immediately asked the guy at the desk to come and look at it, he said he would, but he forgot. We went out, I reminded him as we were leaving, but hours later nothing had been done about it. The next day, I reminded them and they came and turned the water on from underneath the sink, only to return an hour later to say that water was leaking into another room below us so it had to be turned off. They said the plumber would be in the next day. He didnt come until early evening after having to go back to them again. Anyway the problem finally got resolved. Overall apart from the problems, my stay turned out to be ok. The hotel is at a good location. Its just that I would expect them if they are expecting guests to have the rooms in a ready condition. For example, I am sure the last guest who stayed in the room, reported problems with the room both the shower head falling off and plumbing problems in the shower and face basin area and the lack of water in the kitchenette, in fact I believe that is why the water was turned off from underneath the sink, because of the problem. I find the staff from one shift to the next do not communicate your problems effectively to the other person who is taking over. I didnt find the breakfast appealing, went down the first day and didnt bother after that.

Having felt a little apprehensive after reading the hotel reviews there was no need to be. The apartment was bright and modern with a fully equipped kitchen area. An ideal base for touring London, minutes from the tube and within staggering distance after a great night out on the Earls Court Road. The fellow on Reception at Exhibition Court 4 was very helpful and another staff member quickly came to our aid the evening our key would not turn in the lock! New keys were issued and no further problems encountered. Hope to return if in London again.", "Date": "September 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montpelier, VT", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3512610", "Content": "We just came back from a week's stay at Longridge Apartments, owned and operated by the same people who run Exhibition Court Hotel 4. It is not made clear in their ads that the apartment is not on hotel premises but about 1/2 mile away. Makes the move to the apartment a bit of a challenge. We had Apartment 3. Accommodation was sparse; no decorations at all, no towel bars, toilet paper holders and such. However, we had 2 separate bedrooms with extremely comfortable beds, 2 complete bathrooms, a full kitchen, and a small balcony. The apartment was very clean. Only 5 minutes walk to Earl's Court Tube. Cost was only 100 pounds per night. A true find for London; would book again.", "Date": "May 31, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Exhibition Court Hotel 4", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d305330-Reviews-Exhibition_Court_Hotel_4-London_England.html", "Price": "$83 - $162*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">25 Collingham Place</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW5 OQF</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "305330", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7d/fb/7dfb3bdb319f2318b5a152ee00c5b36d1large.jpg"}}
