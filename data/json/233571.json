I travelled with my husband for a long weekend and we wanted something a bit better than a budget hotel but not to spend crazy amounts. I knew to expect high prices and small rooms so was delighted to find Cadran was not overpriced and that the Superior Room that we booked was a good size. We were fortunate to have a view of the Eiffel tower from our room and found lots of lovely restaurants and foodie heaven on Rue Cler, the bakery on the corner of Rue Champs de Mars has the best Pain au Raisin imaginable All of the staff we met were cheerful and friendly and on the second day when we returned to the hotel mid afternoon to find it was being cleaned we were treated to drinks and macaroons whilst we waited. All in all the hotel was a fantastic base in Paris, close enough to all the sights but not too busy or noisy.

Our rate included breakfast so it made our night's stay the exact same price as staying across the street at the Hotel du Champ de Mar. So we cancelled there and stayed here instead. The rooms are typically tiny and modernly furnished. I wonder why no reviews ever mentioned the window in the bathroom that looks out into the bedroom? It's a big window with frosted glass on the lower half. The bathroom door slides closed and doesn't latch or fit snugly like a typical door. So if you're worried about any sounds emanating from the bathroom - this may not be the hotel for you. Over all I liked it. The breakfast room downstairs was really hot and stuffy and rather chaotic. There are 2 machines that supply hot water/coffee/hot choc/ etc and attempting to figure them out can be rather complicated.

On top of being close to Rue Cler, it is just a 5-minute walk from the metro station so getting back to the hotel late at night is not a problem. The hotel room is kinda small but this is normal for any hotel in the centre of the city. It looks like the hotel has been newly renovated so the place is clean and the design is modern and cheerful. Although the hotel has free wi-fi, there are computers behind the lobby for guests to use. Thoughtful touches like this are definitely appreicated. I paid 142 euro for a single room.

My problem with all hotel bathrooms is that the mirror is over the washbasin and too far away for putting on make up if you are short-sighted! The hairdryer is the best I've used in any hotel. There is a tiny wardrobe with room for around 5 or 6 items of clothing and a couple of shelves but not really room to unpack, so be prepared to keep your clothes in your suitcase.

The lift broke down while we were there, and we were worried it would be an issue, as we were on the 5th floor, but the engineer was called out and it was sorted out very quickly, which was quite impressive. It was useful to be able to use the internet while we were there. Breakfast consists of cold ham, cheese, yoghurt, fruit juice, pain au chocolat and pain aux raisins and bread, with jams. The bread was my only problem, as it fell short of the soft and crispy french bread I was used to having in France, but we found that everywhere we went. Front desk staff were very friendly and spoke quite good English. One tip: the eggs next to the egg boiler are not cooked!

We got a fresh campagnette (crusty baguette) from the bakery every morning. Take advantage of the food shopping on Rue Cler and your mini fridge, and you'll have a great snack/picnic on hand at all times. You can even bring your picnic to the park at the Eiffel Tower, which we did.

Then get the metro to Ecole Militaire (Line 8) which is only three minutes walk from the Hotel du Cadran. Buy a book of 10 tickets for 12.50 euro for use on metro, buses and local trains (RER). The hotel is a 15 minutes stroll to the Eiffel Tower and the river (I timed it, and I'm not a quick walker)! Rue du Cler just excellent for eats & drinks for occasions when one might not want to venture further afield. Indeed, the whole district is a very pleasant suburb. The #69 bus from Rue de Cler seems to cover the entire city! If you're on a tight budget, use it for a tour instead of the Les Cars Rouge (hop on & off open-top bus). However, we thought the latter was well worth the 24 euro. There are four circuits, and we managed three of them in a day. Excellent commentary. One word of warning about the Hotel du Cadran. Although very clean, with comfortable beds and a good (but small) shower room, the bedrooms are VERY limited in size. We were glad we only had one holdall between the two of us.

There is however one negative for which I rate this hotel a '3' instead of a '4'. Whilst in Paris we had the misfortune that the weather was EXTREMELY humid. This in itself is not such a problem if one can go back to a nicely air conditioned hotel. The air conditioning in this hotel was weak if not almost utterly useless. This was not just an issue for our room, as the hotel lobby and hallways were also lacking that refreshing blast of cold air one normally experiences (and expects) from air conditioning!

My only complaint is the lack of storage--we had to stash suitcases wherever they would fit and there was not a single drawer. A very narrow closet had two shelves in it, so clothes ended up scattered pretty much everywhere. One of the nice things was the option to have two connecting rooms so our kids could be nearby without sharing a room with us. Their room had a tub in the bathroom; ours was shower only. The breakfasts were good, but they are an extra 13 euros, which isn't bad considering that you have coffee, tea, juices, bread, croissants, fruit salad, yogurt, cereal, eggs you can boil yourself, salami, cheese--much more than what you would get for the same amount at a cafe.

Have stayed in many, many Paris hotels, and would stay here again, but you need to know (as everyone else has mentioned) that the rooms are SMALL, the space is limitted, and you are paying a lot of euros for said small space. Having said that, I had excellent service from the gals during the day at the front desk. They spoke excellent english, and were very, very helpful in giving directions and suggesting places to eat nearby. The one restaurant (Le Florimond) was a serious gem and I enthusiastically recommend it, whether you stay at this hotel or not! The room itself was modern, clean, pleasing to the eye, and very well appointed with regards to storing your stuff, which was a good thing because there is next to no floor space. No problem for my friend and I, but you do need to be aware of. The bathroom was very modern too, glassed in walls, pretty decent lighting, and satisfying water pressure. Now the location is what you will want to book this hotel for! It is central to EVERYTHING! We were minutes from the Eiffel tower, minutes from Hotel Invalides, and minutes from the metro station. We walked everywhere along the Seine and saw all of the big sights along the river, Right bank and Left. If you like to walk it's totally possible, just bring comfy shoes. The hotel itself is surrounded by brasseries, bakeries, little supermarkets, and fun shops. We decided to skip the hotel breakfast (not included in our room rate, and goes for 13 euros per person) and managed to find yummy breakfast across the street for less. We paid 171 euros a night for a double bed standard room. I have almost always paid less in Paris for a room overnight, but quality is not always the same. Overall, hotels are expensive, and if you are looking for the comforts of home without paying an arm and a leg, well decide for yourself, but 171\u00e2\u201a\u00ac was a lot. I was overall happy, but the beautiful room that was just a touch too small hurt my wallet a little bit. I will book here again, but will watch for any deals that might come up. If I had my daughter and her playpen with me, it would not have been possible to stay in the room that my friend and I had booked. So there you have it.

We originally struggled to decide on a hotel - we wanted to stay as central as possible as we were only there for one night but couldn't afford to spend a lot of money. By chance, we received a marketing email from Trip Advisor mentioning this hotel and it was exactly what we were looking for - small, modern and close to the Eiffel Tower. As we booked a couple of months in advance, we got the room for around \u00c2\u00a3130 (instead of the 250e rate that was quoted on the back of the door in our room). The local area is what I would call typically Parisian - lovely old apartment buildings, fancy restaurants, cafes with terraces for wicker chairs and tables and lots of boulangeries and food shops. We arrived at the hotel before 10am to check in and they showed us to the (locked) luggage store and told us our room would be ready at 2pm. We had breakfast in Cafe Central on the corner of Rue Cler and Rue du Champ de Mars - It was slightly expensive but the interior was spectacular and it's a great spot to people watch. After a wander around, we returned to Rue Cler for lunch at Okiwa - a Japanese restaurant with a very reasonable set menu at 10e and went back to the hotel before heading back out. Our room was on the top (5th) floor and I had requested a view of the Eiffel Tower if it was possible and that's exactly what we got - I was so happy! The room itself was not especially big but made very good use of the space. The bathroom was very stylish but there were a couple of things I didn't like about it - the bathroom door slid along but didn't lock and would sometimes just open and the shower itself wasn't enclosed so the floor got very wet. The only issues we had were that the light in front of the mirror in the bathroom didn't work and we had to call down to reception for large towels so we could shower (we only received hand towels initially). We returned to the room again before 11pm and watched the Eiffel Tower's light show (again!) from our room. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet so we were able to have a good night sleep. Check out was at 10am and as we didn't catch our train until 6pm, we once again left our luggage with reception. When we returned to pick up the bags, I visited the chocolate shop on the ground floor and bought some macarons. They were delicious - especially the salted caramel ones! I would definately stay at this hotel again-the area was fantastic and it's close enough to all the main attractions. One place I would also visit again is the restaurant Le Relais de l'Entrecote. There are 3 in Paris and the closest one to the Hotel du Cadran is on Rue Marbeuf just off the Champs-\u00c3\u2030lys\u00c3\u00a9es. No reservations and just steak and chips on the menu.

The rooms are small which is typical for Paris. The hotel is very clean and both rooms were no exception. One room had two twins made up as a king and the other had two twins separated. Otherwise the rooms were exactly the same. The beds were comfortable but I was glad to get back to my bed at home! The bathroom is very small. The main criticism is the shower which is very small (think cruise ship shower) with no door or curtain. It is an odd design and resulted in a good bit of water getting on the floor. Other than that and the lack of room to spread out a suitcase (there was only a very small closet) the hotel was fine for the money. I did shop around and for the money compared to other places I think this was a bargain. The front desk staff were all great and all spoke English very well and were extremely helpful. I was able to buy museum passes from them, got directions on getting to Versailles, etc. They were great. The hotel's location is very good. It is located in the Rue Cler area near the Eiffel Tower.

Not an issue for us, but may be for some - No coffee- and tea-making facilities - again, not really an issue for us but surprising So...overall it was a nice stay but we will try another hotel on our next trip to Paris.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greensboro", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, great staff, we'll be back\u201d", "Author": "ProvenceParis", "ReviewID": "UR114500327", "Content": "We could not have asked for a better experience than our three night stay at Hotel due Cadran last week.

A business trip took my husband to Paris for 2 weeks prior to my arrival and the Hotel du Cadran was where we reunited. I got to the hotel a few hours before he did, (at about noontime, earlier than the posted check-in time), but the young woman at the desk said my room was ready. Unfortunately, neither my husband nor I speak French, but we had no problems as the hotel staff spoke very good English. There is an elevator (big, for a European hotel!) . One of the reasons I picked this hotel was it's advertised \"non smoking\" policy. I was disappointed that the first thing I noticed as I entered the room was that it reeked of ciggarette smoke! I'm not usually one to make a fuss, but this was unacceptable, so I went back down to the desk and told the same young woman who'd checked me in. Within less than 5 minutes I was back in the elevator, on my way to a different, clean-smelling room! (Amusing note: later in the evening, we opened the window and found an empty pack of Marlboros outside on the window ledge! I guess it's a hard rule to enforce, and it seems that EVERYONE in Paris smokes!!)) Although the rooms are small by American standards, we found it very adequate for the 2 of us. The style is very contemporary. We loved the shower with it's adjustable rain showerhead. (Getting out of the tub/shower might present a challenge to the less able-bodied...there is quite a noticable drop from the tub floor to the room floor, and no grab bars...just a safety note to be aware of) The was a small closet (could have used more hangers). We had a king-size bed, which was essentially 2 twins pushed together. The pillows were small and the bed was hard, but we were usually so exhausted from all the walking we'd done during the day, it didn't matter. There is a flat screen TV...(we were amused by the American shows, dubbed in French, and then, with FRENCH subtitles!) There are 2 computers and a printer for guest-use off the lobby. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning. The price was 13 euros...there was quite an assortment (breads, cheese, ham, cereals, yogurts, granola, fruit juice, good coffee) We are breakfast eaters, so this price was comparbale with what we paid in the cafes up the street for, say, an omelette etc. The best thing about the hotel is it's convenient location in a real Parisien neighborhood... I couldn't believe how close Rue Cler is...literally a 1 miute walk out the door and you have everything and anything! 2 sidewalk cafes and a bakery as soon as you reach the corner...numerous other restaurants, a crepe place, ice cream, fruit and vegetable markets, all kinds of shops...I felt like Belle in the opening scene from Beauty and the Beast!!

My only bit of advice concerns the TV. If you have a husband that is obsessive about channel surfing, take the channel changer AWAY from him. They have special channel changers that can easily screw up if you press the wrong button. My husband did it FIVE times.

It lends the perfect complement to anyone's Parisian adventure. Their rooms are small compared to anything you'll find in the states but clean and well put together. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9e and I were there for 8 days with 2 huge suitcases, a couple of backpacks, a carry-on suitcase, (and since it was still quite cold during our visit) several very heavy and large coats and we still managed to have enough room to move around easily. The hotel was also in the perfect spot for first time visitors or even returning lovers of Paris since everything you could want is right within walking distance. There's a post office, bank, grocery stores, bread and cheese shops, restaurants,the metro, the Eiffel Tower, and Les Invalides all right in the area! Seriously all within a 5 minute walk. The staff all spoke perfect English and were very helpful. True story: My fianc\u00c3\u00a9e and I had booked a shuttle service to pick us up from the hotel and drop us off at the airport and we tried on our own to get a hold of this shuttle service but we could neither figure out how to dial the number correctly and didn't understand what the lady on the phone was saying since she was speaking French so...in complete frustration we go down to the lobby and ask the woman at the front desk to please help us and she completely took care of everything! Even in the morning when the shuttle was late the man working the front desk also called the shuttle service for us to make sure they were on their way. I will put in though that the safe in our room didn't work but the front desk gave us an envelope that we put our passports in and sealed the envelope ourselves and they locked it in their safe downstairs which didn't bother us at all though may be a problem for others. There's also a small fridge in the room that they use as a mini bar and that we also kept stocked with a few things that we bought ourselves. The fridge is kept a tiny bit lower than room temperature which wasn't very pleasant if you wanted an ice cold drink but did keep my p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9 and cheese from spoiling so it worked for me! And since the hotel is on the corner of the Rue Cler which seems like a slightly posh hang out spot for 20 somethings the noise from the restaurants doesn't die down until about 1am. Then around 5-6am trucks start coming down the street. Dropping off goods at the many stores or picking up garbage (which we found out gets picked up everyday). The noise is quite tolerable if you've been to a big city before and if you're like me then you'll find the constant chatter and the sound of the Parisian's scooters coming and going's to be quite charming and part of Paris' allure. I only mention the few negative things I could find about this hotel because I know not everyone is like me and may not find these few flaws to be enchanting.

It was the \"Superior King\"; Superior to what...I am afraid to ask. I have been in cheap staterooms on cruises that were larger than this room. So the A/C didn't work in the room, only the heat. This made it very stuffy. We opened the window only to find that the cafe was busy until after midnight. It was extremely loud. Plus our window opened right above the cafe and even though we were 4 floors up, it sounded as if we were in the cafe. As patrons left, it was a little bit quieter, but then the employees left about an hour later. With all of their motor bikes and cars now making the noise, after their post work conversations and shouting matches. Then in a few hours the other businesses are opening for the hustle an bustle of the morning. Not much time to sleep in between that. Then the walls are so thin I could hear the conversations taking place in the hall and the buzzing of the small elevator. So there is a lot of noise for this small hotel. Now for the actual hotel and it's service. We arrived and was never offered anything such as extra services, tours, maps or anything. Here is your room key and au revoir, basically you are on your own. We made it to our room with their single creaky elevator. The room is tiny. A very small armoire to hang about 4 items. No place for suitcases. No seats, but the bed and the sheets and towels smelled like vinegar. The sheets were rough like sandpaper. I ended up with dermatitis because I have very sensitive skin. They only left 2 towels in the room so I requested 2 more, and the desk clerk brought up a tub mat. This was odd. The fridge was hidden in a small hole in the wall (literally), but didn't keep anything cold. I guess basically you get what you pay for in Paris. In fact the first night (while I was wide awake listening to the patrons of the cafe below...even once the windows were closed), I spent hours looking for a different hotel on my iPad. Basically if you are going to Paris, splurge a little and stay at one of the finer hotels. It would be well worth it.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pacific Grove, California", "Title": "\u201cRue Cler neighborhood chic Parisian\u201d", "Author": "Inanna12", "ReviewID": "UR100786564", "Content": "The perfect small hotel in the perfect semi-residential neighborhood; complete with open market pedestrian street and high value intimate restaurants.

If you want to open the window, you will not be able to walk around the bed on that side. There's just no space. Still, we were in Paris to see the city, not to hang out in the room. The rooms use minimalist decor, are impecable,and the hotel's location can't be better. The hotel is in a very quaint small side street nestled between Rue Cler and Ave Bosquet. Yes you do hear the mopeds, delivery trucks and garbage trucks (we were in the second floor), however, nothing really happnes between 10pm and 8am, so no major problems with street noise. The Ecole Militare Metro station is only a 5 min walk from the hotel, and you can walk everywhere. The hotel has great breakfast buffet. Although it is a bit overpriced at 13 euros, I think is a great way to get used to what a french breakfast is. I would suggest to have breakfast there the first morning and then head out to the many cafes surrounding the area from there on. (Yes, for us americans, breakfast is a \"different\" experience. My kids hated it. But hey! you are in France, so inmerse yourself in the french experience!!!) The hotel staff is exellent, friendly and corteus. Thay gave us suggestions and were available. However, on our last afternoon, we had an issue with a very strong chemical odor coming from the building next door (which was being stripped and painted). We told the front desk girl (wish I had gotten her name), and she just shrugged, said that she didn't smell anything and suggested we closed the windows (they were closed, it was 30 degrees outside). Of course I went to talk to her with the expectation of an offer to move us to rooms on the other side of the building, but her attitude was very dismissive...In all, this is a wonderful quiet \"boutique style\" hotel, that lets you experience Paris like a parisian, and why would we go to Paris, if not to do exactly that??", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "doha", "Title": "\u201cWe were happy to stay at Hotel du Cadran in Nov. 2010.\u201d", "Author": "familyDoha", "ReviewID": "UR87728898", "Content": "The hotel is small, nice and comfortable.

The style of the hotel has changed to very modern, but it is still very comfortable. What we love most is the location. It is not in a touristy area; rather, on a more \"local\" street with shops, cafes, and the nice Rue Cler market. You can easily get to the Ecole Militaire metro stop as well as a short walk to the Champ du Mars and Tour Eiffel. You can feel safe walking around this neighborhood. There are many very nice restaurants in the area too which is nice for a late evening dinner - no metros to figure out and very homey atmospheres. The staff is wonderful! They speak excellent English and are so helpful, whether on the telephone, on the email, or in person. They arranged and confirmed dinner reservations for us very graciously. One night, we were having troubles with the cable TV and the young man from the desk came up to check it out. He called someone else and voila! it was fixed in no time. We didn't even expect it to be fixed right away as we were going out to dinner, but prompt service is key for this staff. As a previous reviewer stated, our one complaint about the room was the heat. We, too, felt that the room was much too hot. Forget about sleeping with that lovely duvet. We usually kept the window open in the early a.m. and when we were getting ready to go out in the evening. We also had a couple of problems with the shower water coming in hot and staying at an even temperature, but mostly we attributed this to it be a hotel. It has happened in other hotels at prime times too. We had a superior king room and, while it was compact, it was perfectly comfortable. The closet was plenty big enough to hang up coats, slacks, and shirts as well as put in several pairs of shoes. You must remember that this is not a giant US hotel room. Our experience with European hotel rooms is that they are generally smaller than American rooms. The bath was always clean and fully stocked with toiletries and fresh shower caps and towels.

The hotel was largely very much as we expected from both its own website and from the reviews on Tripadvisor. Although the rooms are compact, they are comfortable and modern. We had interconnecting rooms on the 3rd floor that were ideal for a family in our position. The children's room had twin beds and the double room had a queensized bed. The main bedroom had a shower only, the children's bathroom had a bath with shower over. The closet space was more than sufficient for our 4 night stay. The free Wi-fi and the free use of 2 computers in the lobby was a bonus. The location is quiet but convenient - just over 5 mins walk from the nearest Metro, with plenty of restaurants nearby and a good variety of shops and small supermarkets. It is also within 10-15mins walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. Reception was efficient (and spoke good English) and both check-in and check-out were painless. We ate breakfast in the hotel every morning (13 Euros) - a largely cold buffet with juices, fruit salad, yoghurt, cold meats and cheeses, cereals, French bread, croissants, pain au chocolat and other pastries, a toaster for toast - and an egg boiler. A coffee machine and tea making facilities completed the offering. Supplies were topped up frequently, or readily on request. Our children were given free jars of sweets on 2 out of the 4 mornings which was a nice touch. Room cleaning was efficent and sheets seemed to be changed halfway through our stay.

Sadly, I was overall disappointed. Maybe we got the worst room(s). I chose a Superior King with hopes of a bigger/nicer bed and room, but were initially given 108, which is one of the interior rooms facing a wall on the ground floor. Perhaps in warmer weather it would be nice to be able to step through the french doors to our own \"patio\" area (no plants or funiture), but it was cold and dark when we arrived and it felt like a crowded cave, with a big bed you could barely walk around. After some complaining, we were moved up to 308, which had at least some more light and views of windows in neighboring buildings. First the positives. Location is great, Just around the corner from Rue Cler quaintness, blocks from the Eiffel Tower, close to Ecole Militaire metro. Staff overall was friendly and helpful, except the original clerk was not particularly cheery when I first returned to the desk after seeing the original room and asked if this was indeed a Superior King room and she said \"yes it is a King bed.\" I liked the modern decor, slightly confusing but modern lighting control in the rooms, the King bed (2 put together) was big and comfortable, free wifi was great, and the price overall for hotels in good areas of Paris was not unreasonable. But the negatives. Lighting in the hallways was just these footlevel LEDs that triggered when you entered, energy efficient yes, but it always seemed like you were sneaking home at midnight to your hotel and had to stumble through the halls to find your room. Our interior rooms had no real view to speak of (though it was quiet). The closet was basically a very small phone booth with room for 5-7 shirts or so, some tiny shelving, a safe that only fits small items like wallets and passports (not laptops) and nowhere to put your suitcase but on the floor, which left maybe 1 foot of walking space at the foot of the bed (but blocked the window). The far edge of the bed only had enough space to store a suitcase standing up (and no walking room). The \"desk\" was a triangle wedged into the corner of the room under the TV, where you basically had to sit on the corner of the bed to use. Also, noise from hallways and neighbors somewhat easily heard through thin walls. And then there was the bathroom. Maybe it's just too modern for me. Not decor, which I liked, but: the shower head needed to be tightened to stay up, the open stall was narrow (and I'm a thin person!), the temperature of the water would fluctuate from burning to ice cold and back, the shelf for soap and shampoo was placed outside of the shower across the entry platform, requiring constant reaching outside the shower and complete soaking of the floor with each use, and the walls were glass and metal (which normally I like), but there was really no privacy. The sliding bathroom \"door\" did little to block noise or odor, so it was almost as bad as having the toilet in the bedroom. So I suppose if you and your spouse are comfortable at home leaving the bathroom door open with one another around, you'd be OK with this. And there was even a window between the bathroom and bedroom! (granted, with bottom half frosted) So I suppose you could conveniently check on your companion in the shower as needed to make sure they're OK. Or it provided natural light into the bathroom. Either way, I could have done without it. Anyway, this has scared me a bit from centrally located hotels in Paris at this price level. Maybe all the rave reviews are with the outer rooms not facing the inside, that may have different configurations. I've had small rooms in NYC and London, but I guess the small size combined with the bathroom issues just made it too much to bear. Next time I may go back to apt rental from VIP (very satisfied before) just to get the space and actual private bathroom at a good price, or chance it with a higher-ranked hotel, but I do not plan to return here.

Cool cave style coffee house for breakfast or just a quick cup on the underground level. Great view of the Eiffel Tower from room 504. It's a corner room with views of Paris coming alive. Rue Clare has a great \"little village\" feel to it with shops, ATMs, cafes and groceries stores for that oh shoot moments.

The signal wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strong in my first room, but the Hotel agreed to move me to another room on my second day (but only after being a little defensive about whether or not there might some difficulties with reception in that room). The rooms were air-conditioned. The room and bed were nice and comfortable. The front desk was very nice about helping with directions. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lucky, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be there on a day when they give out samples of the wonderful macaroons that they sell. However, there were also several negatives. First, on two days, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive a requested wake-up call due to a phone malfunction. The hotel sent housekeeping to knock on my door, but on both days, they came up 30-45 minutes AFTER the wake-up time I requested. This could have caused significant problems, as I had reservations both days, including a flight at the airport to catch. Second, the hotel advertises that they work with a reliable transportation service that will bring you to the airport for a set fee (55 euro) (the signs say that they prefer this service because cabs in Paris can be unreliable in terms of availability). I requested this transportation service and confirmed the price the night before I was to leave. However, instead of calling their usual transportation service, the Hotel called inexplicably called a regular Paris taxi, which ended up costing me 11 euro more than the advertised flat fee I was counting on. Third, when checking in, I was told where and when the continental breakfast was served, and invited to join the other guests. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a recollection of any mention of a charge for breakfast at check-in, or at any other time before I was ready to check out, but at check-out, the Hotel added a 52 euro charge for 4 days of breakfast to my bill. I would have appreciated knowing about the charge for breakfast ahead of time. If I had known, I would have gone to the excellent bakeries or cafes within surrounding two blocks, rather than spending that amount of money on a continental breakfast that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that great (coffee/tea, juice, canned fruit, yogurt, cereals, sliced meat, packaged cheese, hard boiled eggs on 1 of 4 days, French bread, stale pastries and croissants). Fourth, there is no real desk or table in the room for working on a laptop. There is a counter space or shelf in one corner of the room that can be used for this purpose. Fifth, the Hotel has two computers for guest use on the ground floor. However, on one day when I needed to print out a ticket I had purchased, there was a program/interface on both computers that prevented printing. The two staff folks at reception said they were not familiar with how to use the guest computers and could not help me, which kind of defeated the purpose of having a public computer for printing. All in all, despite the great location, I had a mixed experience, and would not recommend this hotel to friends.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Biggleswade, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA* - perfect for a long romantic weekend\u201d", "Author": "me1987", "ReviewID": "UR73627250", "Content": "received excellent service from all the staff. luggage service for both before check in and after check out. room was immaculate. breakfash good. helpfull map and tourist info. well recommended.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cHotel du Cadran is a lovely hotel that was an integral part of our happy trip.\u201d", "Author": "MaryAnnClare", "ReviewID": "UR73589605", "Content": "Here are the reasons we really liked the Hotel du Cadran.

Note that the construction work and re-decorating mentioned in previous reviews has finished. We booked the holiday out of a brochure (Cresta Cities) and travelled on Eurostar. The taxi cost approx \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18 from Gare du Nord station and the journey took approx 30 minutes at 5:30pm on a Friday evening, but may take less at a quieter time. The hotel is in good quiet location, but near to plenty of restaurants and shops. Five minutes walk to the Ecole Militaire Metro station and only 15 minutes walk to the bottom of the Eiffel tower (although you can clearly see the tower within five minutes walk from the hotel). The Ecole Militaire Metro station is not on a main line, it was usually necessary to change lines at least once to get anywhere in Paris. We tended to change at Concorde Metro station, but note there was a five minute walk within the Metro station from one line to another. Staff in the hotel were friendly and extremely helpful, we had forgotten our travel plug adaptor and they lent us one while we were there. Breakfast was included in our package and was a buffet consisting of cereals, pastries, cheeses, cold meats, hot drinks and fruit juices. You could have as much as you wanted and it was good quality. The hotel has a luggage room where they will keep your bags either on arrival or before departure. We had some of the chocolate and macaroons from the chocolate bar in the hotel (note closed on Mondays). There are lots of different flavours of both chocolate and macaroons to choose from. We ate at a few different places in the locality. The best we found was Le Bosquet restaurant. We had both lunch and dinner here, lunch was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac14 (per person) for a Chicken Caesar salad and a drink, dinner was approx \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40 (per person) for a cocktail aperitif, starter, main and dessert. The next best was Tribecca which was good value for money \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 for main meal and drink (we recommend the Lasagne). At Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Central the meals were OK and so was the service, but it was more expensive than Tribecca and about the same price as Le Bosquet, but for smaller portions, cost approx \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22 for main meal plus drink. In the evenings we walked to the Champs de Mars (big park that leads to the Eiffel Tower) it was full of people having picnics and was very pleasant. Beds were comfortable, there was a free safe in the small wardrobe and a mini bar, but we never used it because there was a convenience store just across the road open from 7:00am until 9:00pm (closed on Sundays). Le Bosquet restaurant was shut on Sunday, but the Tribecca and Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Central remained open. One afternoon we had a drink in the little Bistro right outside the hotel entrance and the staff there were pleasant and the drinks were good value. The hotel was very good, the only thing I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like was the ensuite bathroom door was a sliding one and poorly fitting. The hotel staff explained that the hotel had recently been refurbished and the ensuite bathrooms were built this way to save space in the rooms.

We were a little disturbed to see the scaffolding around the building when we arrived, but were assured that it was only painting and we wouldn't be disturbed by construction noise. Since the sunlight still came through the windows of our room on the 4th floor, we gave it a try. Unfortunately, we were awakened at 8:30am by a painter outside our window. He didn't look into our room, but it was disconcerting enough for us to leave quickly. When we returned after a long day of sightseeing, he was still there. We went down to the reception area and asked to change our room. After being told that we could change if we'd do it quickly before the new guests arrived, we hustled back upstairs and swapped to room 407 on the side without scaffolding. Much better. Lots of light and no painters. Scaffolding aside, we liked the hotel. Specifically: * The neighborhood: You can't beat Rue Cler for restaurants, food shopping and local color. It was constantly buzzing from early morning to late night. And it was not easy to get into restaurants at night because they were so busy for dinner. * Well-designed rooms: The rooms are decorated in shades of gray and red, modern and great utilization of space. A red phone booth to hold your clothes, there's a pocket door to the bathroom and ledges around the walls for stuff. * Cool lighting: There were a number of settings for lights with even a night light setting. * Helpful reception area: They were knowledgeable and helpful - even offering to call a shop to track down a lost jacket. * Computers: There were 2 desktops in the lobby for guests to use. These are the things that we were not so fond of: * Storage: Loved the phone booth and ledges, but there was no other furniture to store anything including our suitcases. We made it work, but by the end of our stay, we were out of room to store any more purchases. * Americans: Most of the hotel guests were Americans; many of whom were clutching Rick Steve's Paris guidebooks. This is one of Rick's recommended hotels and we like a less \"American\" experience in Paris. * RER Access: You could get to an RER near the Seine (a short walk), but if you have luggage, be prepared to lug them down the stairs. We had heavy bags by the end of our 10 day journey and reluctantly arranged for a car to take us to the airport. * Airport Transfer Recommendation: When we couldn't take the RER, we asked the front desk for a recommendation on airport transport. We thought we were getting a cab or shuttle, but they arranged for a private car to pick us up - which was quite costly.

Location was great - it's in the middle of a quaint parisian market (pleasant) and literally a 3 min walk from Ecole Militaire metro (once you know your way around) with a supermaket round the corner. Attraction wise, a five min walk from the military museum/ Napoleon's tomb and seven min walk from the Eiffel tower - make sure you are there at 11pm to see it \"sparkle\". Not sure why some reveiwers think the Eiffel was 15 mins away. The hotel itself: staff were pleasant, fluent in english and we were given a complimentary map on arrival which we found very handy. The standard room was of a good size, clean and bed was very comfortable and spacious. Only point of caution is the loo. Nothing wrong with it - finished to a high standard - but lack of complete privacy as no lock on the door and there is a partially see through window into the loo within the room. Not an issue for us but could be awkward for others. There was scaffolding at the front of the building and painting work going on which obscured our view of the street market. As luck would have it - we went into the room to be confronted by a painter right outside our window. We didnt make a fuss but were disappointed the hotel did not mention the works at the time of booking or at the very least, offer to discount the room instead of charging full price of about \u00c2\u00a3150/ per night. We did mention the works when checking out and the receptionist very kindly offered the one breakfast and water from the mini bar as complementary. And finally the chocolate bar - we were dissapointed as opening hours were during the day (when we were out sightseeing) yet closed by the time we returned each evening - surely it should be open in the evenings when guests return?

Breakfast was continental in style, with an excellent range of cereals, breads, croissants, cold meats, yoghurts, juices, teas and coffees, all of which was of a good standard and constantly being refreshed. The dining room is situated in the vaulted basement, and is nice, bright and airy. We also liked the fact that the hotel served breakfast until 11am on weekends. We found the location of the hotel to be perfect for our needs, being less than five minutes from the Seine, Eiffel Tower and Metro station (Ecole Militare). Near by were a number of good restaurants and a good choice of shops on Rue Cler. We would not hesitate in returning to Hotel Cadran, and hope to do so later this year!

A special thanks to Emilie and Marta for the complimentary macaroons! I do not know the woman who cleaned our room, but she did a superb job also. Our room was clean, spacious and had a wonderful bathroom with plenty of hot water. We truly loved the people at this hotel and enjoyed our comfortable room immensely. The hotel is in a wonderful location and we walked everywhere including the Eiffel Tower, (10 minutes), The Arc de Triomphe, (20 minutes) and not sure but around 30-40 minutes to the Louvre. Paris is very pedestrian friendly and the people are lovely! I would be remiss not to mention how close the hotel was to the Rue de Cler. This street is one minute from the hotel and offers wonderful food, outdoor markets and great gelato.

The room is small, but very clean and the staff is friendly and English speaking. The bath tub was great, which for me is a major plus. The lighting system is a bit quirky..I had trouble turning on my bedside reading light without turning on other random lights as well. Another quirk is that with all of the hotel's obsession with clocks, there wasn't one in our room, and we never knew what time it was in the morning without squinting at our watches. So bring your travel alarm clock. The location of the hotel was ideal. Right on the Rue Cler, with its shops and cafes. And withing walking distance of The Eiffel Tower and L'Invalides.

We decided on this Hotel because it was close to the Eiffel Tower, the bus lines and the Metro. When we go back we will stay there again. It; is in the best neighborhood, Rue Cler. There are cafes, pastry shops, grocery store, etc. within easy walking distance. The front desk staff was so helpful getting us from here to there on numerous occssions.

A few blocks from the Eiffel Tower, Ecole Militaire, and Hotel Invalides, it is wonderfully situated in a fabulous neighborhood filled with bistros and anything else you'd ever want.. Step out the door and a few steps away you can treat yourself to an array of delightful cheese and wine shops, bakeries, fruit stands, specialty chocolate and ice cream shops, and outdoor cafes. In fact, every day, Rue Cler is bustling with wonderful activity from early morning to late at night, Despite all the nearby activity, noise is never a problem, however, and you'd never know so many wonderful things were going on right down the street. The neighborhood is very safe. A metro stop is around the corner, as well as a bus stop, but you can walk very easily to a lot of attractions. The Seine is right behind the Eiffel Tower, where you can take a day or night cruise along the river. The hotel staff gives great directions and recommendations to help you plan your day. The Cadran is a small hotel that was totally renovated in recent years, and it has a sparkling clean and fresh, contemporary feel. There's lots of glass, mirrors, and stainless steel to make the hotel seem bigger and pleasantly new, and the rooms are very tastefully decorated. The hotel owner/manager loves clocks, and you'll find interesting clocks all around to give some special fun to the decor. Space is used very efficiently. The marvelous air conditioning is a plus in the heat of summer. The beds are really comfortable. There's a safe in every room. Every bathroom has a hair dryer. There's free internet access off the lobby, and free newspapers are available daily.. For an extra cost, a very nice breakfast is available, with an assortment of breads and pastries, meats, cheeses, yogurt, fresh fruit, juices, and a fabulous coffeemaker that zips out great coffee, cafe au lait, cappuccino, or hot chocolate. Alternatives to the hotel breakfast are right outside the hotel at the bakeries and cafes that open very early. The hotel is amazingly clean, and the reception and cleaning staff are extremely friendly and accommodating, providing ice, extra towels, and anything else you might want. And don't worry if you can't speak a word of French, because the reception staff is fluent in English. To top it off, there's a specialty chocolate bar and macaroon shop right in the hotel.

I found it to be an incredible value and I would stay here again. My room was a corner room on the third floor (Room 313). There were three windows which opened to look out onto the street below through a wrought iron railing. One of the windows was located above the bath tub, which added an air of elegance. Just *having* a bath tub in Paris added an air of elegance. It was great to lie on the bed and feel the warm cross breeze carry through the room with a lot of natural light. The room was fairly small, but decorated in a modern style with an LCD TV on the wall and a safe. Wireless Internet was free, but didn't work particularly well. The front desk was staffed 24 hours per day. There was no room service nor any restaurant. The lobby of the hotel has a chocolate shop in it. I believe there was complimentary breakfast in the morning, but we didn't try it. One thing I found odd is that when leaving the hotel you had to leave your room key at the front desk. I could not figure out a reason for this. Surely the hotel has duplicate keys so it is not for their benefit, so to whose benefit is it? When we returned from our adventures they asked for our room number and gave us the key, but never asked for any ID. I can't say that I understand this policy nor did I much care for it. The hotel is on a quiet side street with a good cheese shop, a market, some cafes, two bakeries, and a bar all in spitting distance. The Metro is a little farther away, but the location is very convenient to the Eiffel Tower and we were able to easily walk from the hotel to the Seine and all the way to the Louvre without a lot of effort so we never needed to take the Metro. We took taxis to and from the airport (about 40 Euros) and the hotel was very helpful in making sure we had a cab in time to make our flight. One more note: I felt like an idiot for returning to the room and not being able to turn on the lights, for there is no switch. One must insert his room key into a slot for the lights to turn on. I assume this is some sort of attempt to save energy by forcing you to turn out the lights while you are away. I had never stayed in a hotel with this feature (even in Europe) and it took me some time to figure it out.

To the left of the hotel, there is Restaurant Du Marche that is extremely popular with the locals.

Our room was very clean, warm, quiet and comfortable. The beds are amazing - you'll be sure to have a solid sleep. Bathroom was small, but very clean and modern. The shower was great - although due to the design, water does tend to end up all over the floor. Towels are fluffy and plentiful. Our room was small, but had everything we needed. Flat screen TV included! The decor is simple, modern and funky and the lighting system for the hotel is unique and inviting. The free wifi in the rooms is also a great asset to this hotel. The breakfast is very good for Paris standards. The coffee machine is a dream in the mornings (hot chocolate is yum!) and there is a really good amount of choice - esp for a small hotel. The breakfast room itself has a lot of atmosphere - we loved it! We also absolutely loved the location of this hotel. It is easy to find and is so close to many great sights in the city. However, as I mentioned above, it is very quiet and private. We visited the market street of Rue Cler daily and had many a wonderful meal / snack there. Cafe Central, Cafe du Marche and Tribeca are all very good. The crepe place down the street is also def worth a try. Cheap and delicious! I have been to Paris 3 times before this trip and our stay at Cadran was FAR superior to anything else I have experienced. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, but especially young couples and singles (and anyone wanting a clean, comfortable, safe, modern and friendly stay in central Paris). We had a friend meeting us in Paris and she stayed at the same hotel and was also very impressed. She used to live in the city and agreed that it was an excellent standard of 3-star hotel. For the price, it was very good value for this city and I have the feeling that this hotel will be very popular for years to come. Book early! We would absolutely return to this hotel.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "bucharest", "Title": "\u201cnice place\u201d", "Author": "chirita47", "ReviewID": "UR22550799", "Content": "the hotel is ok (even if the rooms are very small),in a very nice part of paris and with very modern decoration .Unfortunatelly they were refurbishing the brekfastroom and it was too little space in the lobby.the personal is frendly and the sarroundings are marvellous", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Aus", "Title": "\u201cLoved du Cadran\u201d", "Author": "fussyaussie", "ReviewID": "UR22360755", "Content": "Hi, just wanted to tell you that we had a wonderful 5 nights at the du Cadran in Paris.

We had a lovely stay and agree with almost all of the comments in previous reviews. Our room was neat and clean and nicely tidied every day by the housekeeper. Room 505 has a view of the top of the Eiffel Tower which was especially nice at night when the lights make the whole tower twinkle for 5-10 minutes at the top of each hour. The street was quiet at night and we found the bed comfortable. The room is tiny and there isn't a closet (just a place to hang 4 hangers) but that is typical for Paris where space is a premium everywhere! The breakfast was included in our package and it included fresh juices, cereals, yougurt, canned fruit, delicious coffees (expresso/cappuchino machine) and teas, and wonderful baguettes with jam choices as well as a selection of pastries. It was tasty and very handy to have breakfast right at the hotel (served 7 - 10 am daily) but I'm not sure we would have paid 26 Euro (for two) each morning which is what is normally charged for the breakfast. The location of this hotel is superb! It is right in between the Eiffel Tower and the Hotel des Invalides (Napoleon's Tomb/Army museum) with a 2 or 3 block walk to the nearest metro station. There are lots of shops and restaurants right by the hotel and a small grocery store (closed Sunday) across the street from the hotel. We strolled to dinner each night and found Le Cafe Constant to be our favorite. We found the staff polite and helpful. Most speak English very well and they were quite helpful answering questions, making reservations, ordering a car to the airport etc. They happily loaned us an adapter (ours was outdated and didn't fit) and a cork screw which we appreciated. There are a couple of areas the hotel could work on but again these were minor for us and didn't spoil our stay. The showers are goofy (see previous reviews) - great water pressure but it goes all over the place. The lobby definitely needs updating - the sofas are quite worn and the ceiling is spotty - but our room was updated and modern. And it would have been nice to have a proper closet but again, not an essential.

The hairdryer in the bathroom has an outlet fit for U.S wattage that we used to plug our cell phones into but you will need a converter for anything else. We only had two issues, the closet in this room was more like a cabinet without a bottom in it. The cabinet took up most of the wall space on one side of the bed and if you weren't careful could hurt yourself (which we did a couple of times). The other issue was the shower, there isn't a shower curtain so by the time your done water was everywhere and there isn't a shelf to put soap, shampoo, etc. All in all minor things we could live with and we would definately stay here again. I went in a friends room, 404, and it was a corner room with two windows, also with a view of the Eiffel. This room was much larger, has a bathtub with a shower and full sized closet. If we go back I'd probably opt for this type of room if available. The hotel also arranged a shuttle service to pick us up from the airport and take us back.

We initially heard about the hotel from Rick Steves' \"Paris 2008\" guide and, based upon the preponderance of positive reviews from tripadvisor, decided to book our Paris stay here. Our experience matched those described by previous (recent) \"positive\" reviewers: the convenient location (close to major monuments, subways, restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores - without being in the middle of the overly crowded \"touristy\" areas); the welcoming, efficient, and helpful staff, the clean, modernized, (albeit \"small\"), and quiet rooms, with excellent Wifi access; the unusually complete breakfast (with cold-cuts in addition to the usual cheeses, croissants, yogurt, juices, coffee, cereal, etc... - (I believe no eggs, though). One thing that I didn't see previously mentioned is that there is a convenient self-service laundromat located within a block of the hotel that I would recomend to those that need to wash clothes during their trip. AN ASIDE: There is one thing that I'm somewhat hesitant to comment upon, but am doing so in the hope that it may be of benefit to other gay travelers in Paris. We found that almost everywhere we went (especially subways), that we were greeted with unwelcome, sometimes rude, (uneasy?) stares. Sensitivity to such behavior is, of course, individual, but we were a bit surpised that in a cosmopolitan city such as Paris that we (as a gay couple) would appear to be such 'freaks\" worthy of notice. Despite this annoyance (which, after all, can be experienced in other parts of the world), we fell in love with Paris ... can 30 million annual visitors to Paris - according to wikipedia - all be wrong? However, I thought I'd just mention this so that others in a similar position are forewarned to this possible reception and can be prepared ahead of time.

Many nights my wife and I would walk through the neighborhood looking at the Eiffel Tower. The room was clean and bright. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They were all fluent in English. They actually managed to book us on a van to the airport in the middle of a general transit strike! The lobby was charming and has large windows looking on to a charming side street. The breakfast room is an old cellar with arched ceilings. It was such a great and welcoming space. Breakfast itself was a nice little spread. There was cheese, bread, cereal, milk, juice, coffee, tea, etc. And the best part? When you sit down the attendant places a warm croissant in front of you. It is delicious and the wife and I have been thinking of those croissants ever since we left. I really only have one quibble with the hotel: I wish there were irons and ironing boards in the room. You can borrow one from the front desk, but that's a little annoying. But that's really a minor complaint. We cannot wait to get back to Paris.

The Eiffel tower is about 8 to 9 blocks. The nearest metro station is Ecole Militare which is only 3 blocks from the hotel. The staff always nice and helpful, and didn't have any problem communicating in English. Our standard double room was great (room 203), everything looked cleaned and in place. Most 2-3 star hotels in Paris offer really small rooms, so we were not expecting anything big, however the people here have manage to make the most of it. It has a flat screen tv with 20-25 channels (only 2 of them in english). It also has a small desk and night tables on both sides of the bed. All the linen provided was very clean, and our room was done and left spotless on a daily basis. The bathroom, even though is tight, is very clean and has very contemporary decor. Shower has a good pressure. One drawback is that we couldn't manage to keep the water from the shower inside, so every day we left the bathroom floor all wet, but every time on our return from sightseeing, we would find it again all dry and perfectly clean... spotless (literally!!!). The space usage in this hotel is so wise that they have also managed to fit in a mini-fridge through a wall. Our window was facing the street, but we were never bothered by any noise. Can't say anything about breakfast in the hotel as we never tried it. Fortunately, the hotel is just a step away from a couple of restaurants that are open all day, a boulangerie (for fresh bread and pastries), a right across the street there is a mini market where you can find everything (even fresh produce). If you want to eat something quick and cheap, I recommend going around the corner. It's a greek restaurant but they also sell great crepes for take away (2 to 5 euros), but beware, if you order to eat in, the price will double!!!

The Champs Elysees is the place to cram yourself into, althought we chose Disneyland Paris to see the fireworks and they were spectacular. Back to the hotel. The staff are excellent, most helpful with any question or request. We had a room on the 5th floor, which has been refurbed recently (the entire floor). I guess they are working their way throguh all the rooms and the public areas. Our room was compact but not to the point that it was an issue. Comfortable Bed, Stylish yet minimalist decor. Flat screen TV on wall at the end of the bed. Small Shower room but with wonderful fittings and whilst small did exactly what is should for a shower room. Toiletries and towels were all good quality. Little mini bar cleverly tucked behind the door. Very clever use of space in a smaller room. We had breakfast which was very pleasant and not bad value at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.

This group of friends has spent Thanksgiving in Paris every year for the last 8-9 years, but this was our first trip to Paris. We researched the Hotel du Cadran on-line, but made our final decision based on the reviews on TripAdvisor. This sight never steers us wrong. The hotel was in a perfect location...literally 20 steps from Rue Cler, a perfect little street filled with bakeries, bistros, cafes, pastry shops, grocery stores, flower/ fruit/ cheese vendors. It couldn't have been a better location. The metro station was only one block away, but we also happened to be there during the week the RER (metro/subway) transportation workers were on strike. It could have been a sticky situation, but we bought 3 day passes on the Open Tour busses (bus stop was only 2 blocks away from the du Cadran) and they took us every where we needed to go. We were able to hop on & off as we desired and we saw everything we wanted to see perched high atop an open air bus.... it was great! The weather was cool, bright & sunny. The hotel itself was clean and tidy. The clerks were gracious, pleasant and helpful.... and spoke English. The hotel lobby, although smallish, was probably very lovely at one time. However after years of being in a sunny window, the leather sofas & chairs need some TLC. The continental breakfast was more than adequate with cereal, yogurt, baguettes, a lovely latte machine, jams, nutelle, ham, cheese and delicious croissants. When booking your room, try to negotiate the cost of the breakfast in with your room. Otherwise, I think it is about 10-15eu per person. With us traveling during a slower time of year and that we had 6 couples, they were willing to bargain with us to get the business...and it worked. It was nice to not have to find a place to eat breakfast before you even start your day. The rooms were immaculate but very, very small. However, we understood that the rooms would be tight, so it had no negative impact on us. The tv was only about a 13\" with one or two news channels in English. But not to worry, you'll be so tired from walking and sightseeing... you'll be asleep before you have time to watch tv. The beds were comfortable enough, but low, low to the floor. The pillows were goosedown and very nice, plus the bed had a crisp, snow-white duvet cover that is changed with every guest. I loved that. I hate having blankets that someone else has slept under up near my face. The duvet system alleviates that problem. Just basic amenities in the room. The bathroom was standard size... all white marble and squeeky clean. The nicest part of our stay at the Hotel du Cadran was their hospitality. Since there were 12 of us, we totally filled their 'lobby'. So in the evening they graciously allowed us access to their 'breakfast' room ... providing we cleaned up our mess and put it back the way we found it. Each evening we would all convene there to drink wine, eat cheese, pate and bread and discuss where we went and what we did all day. It was a beautiful end to each day. It was one of my favorite memories of the trip. I would definitely stay at the Hotel du Cadran again.

The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best attribute is that it is located in the heart of Paris. It is approximately a five minute walk to the Eiffel Tower through a very safe and nice section of the city.

In fairness, we did have a low room, but I would doubt any room could see the tower...or maybe just a piece of it. It is very close walking distance, but several streets away so many buildings between. I wasn't expecting to see it, but just don't be fooled by the name. 2) LOTS of construction noise. They are apparently renovating the rooms which is a good thing, but we were awoken on Saturday morning around 8am to constant loud noise (definitely on our floor). 3) Public areas very dated. The English guidebooks in the lounge area definitely helped, but compared to other 3 star hotels we walked by, this lounge area was definitely in need of updating.

Yes, the rooms are a bit worn but then there is a renovation in the works t according to the photo in the lobby and the room we saw(courtesy of housekeeping) it will be ultra contemporary (alas paris seems to be going that way). however, that's the slightly downside. The location is perfect, the rooms are clean with nice amenties and our room had a view of the top half of the Eifel Tower. For pricey Paris, thought we got an ok deal with breakfast (which is very good) and a two day museum pass. It is a slight walk from the metro but then don't even consider Paris if you don't like to walk. There are at least four excellent restaurants within a two minute walk from the front door of the hotel (We heartedly recommend the La Petite Nicose) All in all, a nice stay.

I have to say I was very impressed. The location was excellent. The hotel is situated within a two minute walk to L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ecole Militaire metro station. You could walk to the Champ de Mars and get a great view of the Eiffel Tower within ten minutes. We would often walk to see it lit up at night. It was so good having this icon so close. In fact all the great sights were within about a 30 minute walk of the hotel. However my favourite and lasting memory was the Cadran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proximity to Rue Cler. The fresh food markets on Rue Cler were so fantastic. We sampled everything from crepes, to cheeses, wine and bread. I felt we had the ultimate Parisian experience right at our doorstep. There were also a number of nice bars and restaurants around the area. The staff at the Cadran were friendly (with one exception) and knowledgeable. The rooms were not enormous but I thought were good quality for the price. Unfortunately our bath plug was faulty so we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have baths but that is a minor complaint. Another minor problem was the air-conditioning. The room was quite hot at night and the air-conditioning didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to work. The stay was also somewhat marred by the arrogance of one staff member, a grumpy old man, who was on reception the night before we left. We had paid to use the internet for half an hour, however 5 minutes into our session the hotel computer crashed. When I went and told the grumpy old man what had happened his response was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So what do you want me to do about it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? I had never experienced such rudeness our entire stay and found his attitude very frustrating. We explained that we needed him to re-enter the password into the computer. However he was still too lazy to do his job, so he gave me the password, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CADRAN\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So if you do stay here give that password a try for some free internet time. Also on our final day, our stay was further marred by the airport pick up service that the hotel had arranged. Our car failed to turn up. This probably was not the fault of the hotel, but I remain slightly sceptical. But enough of the negatives. In all it was a very positive experience staying here.

It has a great crepe stand that is open late at night for when you get the munchies. I ate 3 crepes in one day! The subway is a 5 min walk away, not bad at all. The room itself was average size for Paris (small) and the furnishings were dated but functional. The comforter on the bed seemed like 20 years old. I once saw this 20/20 report on comforters in hotel rooms where they used a ultraviolet light to see all the ... well, I won't go into that here. The room was clean and the bathroom was fantastic -- it had a tub! That is rare in Paris hotels. And don't believe the stories about a tiny elevator, it was fine!

And you can order Louvre tickets and the Paris hop on/hop off bus tickets right there at the front desk and save a lot of time! Also, the location is great - only a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. My son even did laundry at the lav-o-matic around the corner - the washers cost but the dryers are free. The neighborhood has little markets, restaurants, etc. - VERY convenient. The hotel room was a decent size for a boutique hotel - In other words, we could unpack our suitcases and leave them sit out, not all scrunched up as in other boutique hotels. And the bathroom was just like being in an American hotel - very nice and roomy with lots of amenities, even shoe shine sponges. The air conditioning and everything worked great.

We felt like residents instead of tourists because we stayed in this area. The breakfast each morning was efficient, never overly crowded, and good. Basic bakery bread, croissants, juices, very light and quick for a long day of sight-seeing. The beds were hard, but that's our style. Again, the room was spotless, modern, and quiet. The air conditioning was not very powerful, but sufficed. We were never uncomfortable. The front desk staff responded to every e-mail, question, and arranged for taxis and supplied great advice. The lobby has maps, books for reading, tour offers, along with a nice cozy fireplace. This is not a typical hotel, but rather an inn. Its location is astounding.. we were right by everything. We took the double decker tour bus and used it as a taxi. It was mostly good other than one driver that would stop for no reason for 20-30 minutes. The Louvre has got to be seen to be believed. It was the best trip ever and staying in this small hotel really enhanced our enjoyment... from the friendly staff, to the quiet rooms, we loved the place.

Most people know what they want to do when they get there, but where to stay? If, like me, you plan to spend most of your time out of your hotel, sampling the delights of the city, then you will probably want a good value hotel, offering clean and comfortable rooms, in a good location. Perhaps additionally, you would like to be in an area well served by restaurants, cafes and bars, with good transport links via the Metro? If so, the Hotel Du Cadran will serve you well. From the moment we called to tag an extra night onto our stay, to the time we reluctantly left to catch the Eurostar to London, the staff of the Hotel Du Cadran were unfailingly polite and pleasant, many of them demonstrating their excellent command of English and making a mockery of my feeble attempts at French. The Hotel is on a quiet street in the 7th arrondisement, though with the bustling Rue Cler around the corner. It is 2 to 3 minutes walk to the Ecole Militaire Metro station and only a minute or so more to see the Eiffel Tower, especially worthwhile at night to see the illuminated tower and it's light show! Perhaps you could do this before wandering into one of the many, many restaurants in this area. One reviewer below left an excellent list of restaurants to visit, of which Chez Pierrot and Le Petit Nicois on Rue Amelie we visited. I can confirm these are very nice places with quality food and wines at high though not ridiculous cost. Also to add to the list would be Le 7eme Sud restaurant, which serves Mediterranean cuisine. When you are on a budget, or just want something a bit more casual, Le Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Marche, on the corner of Rue Cler and Rue du Champs de Pars, literally 45 seconds from the hotel, is an excellent choice.

Also, the immediate area had lots of nice cafes, as well as a supermarket and a nice bakery. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They all spoke excellent English and were great at recommending and booking a restaurant for us, and sorting out taxis and bus times that we needed. The reception area in the hotel was also a bonus. We were waiting there for a while after we checked out, before it was time to go to the airport. There are nice squashy couches and a variety of books to read (which you can also borrow for the duration of your stay). There is a room where the hotel will store your luggage for you after you check out. Our room was comfortable and the bathroom was sparklingly clean. Breakfast was fine - cereal, bread, croissants, juice and coffee. At least it was complimentary, which is not the case in all Paris hotels.

Both rooms were depressing, had stained carpeting and chairs with ripped/frayed upholstery. The closet was so small that it was basically unusable. The beds were miserably uncomfortable--the mattresses were so hard that it was like sleeping on the floor. The bathroom was clean, but the towels were shabby and worn thin, and the shower curtain was dingy. There was nothing charming about this hotel except the lobby and the staff. The Location: we found the neighborhood to be delightful. The location is near Rue de Cler with numerous markets--several small bistros and pastry shops, cheese shops, and wine shops. A metro station is close-by, and the Eiffel Tower is within walking distance. We would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in Paris.", "Date": "November 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Visalia, California", "Title": "\u201cFit the bill perfectly\u201d", "Author": "lawoffice", "ReviewID": "UR2604036", "Content": "My wife and I selected the Du Cadran because of location and other posts which were very complimentary. All of it is true. We were there 9-10-04 to 9-14-04. While the rooms are small, the staff is great, going out of their way to answer questions and provide services. It is literally down the street from the Rue Cler, the unique cobblestoned street of a variety of small shops. There were apparantly many Rick Steves readers around, as we heard his name mentioned by others, several times. The neighborhood is indeed fabulous and the village-type pace presents an inviting atmosphere. The lobby offers many different newspapers, tea, other drinks, and a nice offering of books. We were able to walk to the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, the D'Orsay, and other venues.

Our flight from the UK was 5 hours late so we didn't arrive at the hotel until 12.30am. The staff were very friendly and helpful but the hotel itself had obviously seen better days! Our friends were placed on the first floor whereas my husband and myself were on the fourth floor {why do hotels put people travelling together at opposite ends of the hotel??}. Our room was very small and cramped [as expected from information given here] but the carpet was stained and dirty and the bedspread was made of a nylon material - also with dirty marks and stains. The wardrobe had 5 hangers and enough space to hang a few items of clothes. So we did not unpack our cases for the duration of our stay as we had nowhere to hang them. Breakfast was typically French and adequate but the limited choices offered made each successive day less appealing. We have become accustomed in Spain, Germany and the UK to a large selection of cheeses, meats, yoghurts, fruit, bacon etc. and the lack of this choice made breakfast very predictable and - for me - unappetising! I loved the area. Shops, restaurants and cafes abound. I think though next time, we'd look for a slightly better hotel in the same area.", "Date": "September 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "RKMLosAngeles_CA", "ReviewID": "UR2590938", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights and loved the location.

The room was pretty spacious by European standards with a big bed. The bathroom was very clean. The staff was pretty helpful, though they failed to fix our room phone, which was out the whole time we were there. Also, the breakfast is pretty skimpy -- a bowl of cereal and a measly croissant, but there must be a dozen boulangeries within a block of the hotel, so you can always find a better selection.

We spent our first four nights in Paris at this Hotel. It was perfect for our family as we had two adjoining rooms which had separate bathrooms. I was concerned reading other posts about the small rooms, but we though they were charming. The bathrooms were very very nice. We had breakfast included which was a great way to start each morning. We read about this area being the ideal location (next to the Rue Claire) in Rick Steves book. He did mention this hotel, but did not give it a good value rating. I would disagree. The staff was very nice and very helpful. If we ever go back to Paris, we would stay here again without hesitation. Now that we know our kids can handle forgeign travel (and we can handle our kids handleing foreign travel) we can't wait to return to Europe.

Very helpful and understanding people. However, the building has deteriorated since I first visited this hotel 4 years ago. The two rooms I stayed in were extremely small, even for Paris' standard. The first one was even smaller and they moved me to a new one, with a bit larger bathroom. The matresses were VERY hard; the towels were old and stained; leaky windows (rain); and dirty shower curtains. 4 hangers in the room and no space to put clothes, that was tough. The A/c worked o.k. (Tip: keep curtains closed). The elavator was small with no ventilation and was always smelly. Of course, no A/C in elevator, which was VERY slow. Location: My wife loved the location; quiet neighborhood close to several good small bistros and many pastry shops, cheese shops and wine shops. A metro station is close-by, but be advised that this metro line goes to only a few places, so you always need to connect with other lines to get to most places. The Bus (69) stops very close to the hotel so this was good and the RER is also close-by the Eifell tower. All in all- we had a wonderful stay in paris, but I think there are better hotels within this price range.
