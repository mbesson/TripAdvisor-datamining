{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Would Definitely Go Back We stayed at the Royal for six nights from Dec. 14 to Dec. 30.This was our first time at an adults only resort. The peace from endless loud animation teams was heavenly. There was never a problem getting a chair at the beach or the pool.The room was well appointed and the bed was not too hard. We tipped the maid dailly and were rewarded with lovely towel designs. Food was excellent at the Thalassa. I reccommend the lobster.We also tried the Japanese and italian at the Bavaro as well as the buffet. I was impressed by the fresh grilled shrimp at the buffet and as others have said, the pizza at the pool is excellent. The royal bar has premium liquors and was never crowded. You can walk for miles on the beach.I would rate it as one of the tops in the caribbean. Would definitely return to the royal.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR509897695", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "calliesgrl"}, {"Content": "absolument merveilleux   showReview(22854575, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR349620545", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cayomuna"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147293-d1221722-r23258031-Royal_Catalonia_Bavaro_Resort_Hotel-Punta_Cana_Dominican_Republic.html", "HotelID": "1221722", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
