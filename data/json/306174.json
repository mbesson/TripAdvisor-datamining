I stayed here for my ex girlfriend (now my wife) cousin wedding reception at Marriott Hotel. Can u feel it? we stayed at Grand Central and then we went to Marriott hotel and have a hotel tour, we looked at the hotel decoration and stayed a while at my cousin's room, we have dinner at my cousin ceremony in Marriott Ballroom and then we have to go back to our little sad room..how cruel life can be? About the hotel, I must say the Grand Central is old hotel with great location. There are several store in the back of reception area (Back of the hotel area); cheap salon, cheap restaurant with unpleasant owner, and others cheap...cheap store..oh, I just remember, there is an Indian luggage and souvenir store in there..my friend bought luggage at that store.. I wont talk about the room, you all know from the reviewer below me... Yes, the room is not nice, yes, the room is like your grandma underwear, yes, they have problem with AC, yes, the bathroom is suck But look at the bright side...hmm..can't think any Ooo... oo...as I said before, Location I have interesting story about the diner behind the receptionist area, It was 8-9 AM in the morning, I were with my gf and crap...a couple with 2 naughty kids, we felt hungry and the mall beside the hotel hasn't opened yet, so the best thing we could find is a diner which is still in the hotel, the back of hotel exactly, anyway we had breakfast in there and then after we finished eating, we still sit at the chair and the owner..a 50 y.o lady is yelling at us...Hey, Pay first!!!! We felt insulted, do I look like a person who wont pay for my breakfast? and then my GF yelling back, We will pay, do we look like someone who wont pay for the food? and then she talking nice to us, treat us nice but we can tell she is a very fierce person by the way she treated her personnel (a 60 y.o woman) Moral of this story : Never have breakfast So, If you mind dealing with poor hotel in the great location, choose this hotel.

We stayed in their premium suite but it was as basic as the worst of backpackers. We knew it was going to be bad when we got into the elevator and tiles of the elevator were torn and dirty and we couldn't get the electronic pass to take us to our floor. Then it got worse. Everything about this place is dirty - quite unusual for the high standards of Singapore. In fact Singapore streets were cleaner than this place! Our first room was disgusting and the airconditioner rattled wheezed sounding like we were on the tarmac of an airport. There was hair all over the duve cover. There was nothing in the fridge not even a bottle of water, yet we were asked to put a $50 deposit! After complaining we were upgraded to the premium suits - and the carpet was soaked from the condensation of the airconditioner, which didn't work the entire time we were there eventhough we asked it to be fixed. The shower sprayed the entire bathroom when the water was turned on with little water directed to the person taking the shower. Subsequently the towels were continually soaked and had to be placed outside the bathroom before showering. The toilet didn't flush correctly and took one hour to refill the water in the cistern. We could not face eating breakfast as it was a large mess hall that was entered by exiting the hotel proper. It was unclean, with poor quality food and no staff to clean tables. Large school excursion groups were staying whilst we were there so you can imagine what the breakfast room looked and sounded like. That was the quality of the place - a level up from a school camp! Reception staff was all sour faced and unhelpful. I can imagine the number of complaints they must deal with daily no wonder they were complacent when we approached them about the standard of the room. Again, this should be rated as backpacker accommodation and poor one at that.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cStay away from this hotel from hell !\u201d", "Author": "Olivia T", "ReviewID": "UR126563596", "Content": "My boyfriend and I booked a deluxe room through Agoda at the last minute for \u00a365 instead of \u00a3145.

The shower nozzle threw water everywhere except where it was required. The bathroom floor flooded every time as water ran off the edges of the bathtub and across the floor. There was only one window which opens to some corridor.

I have been rather blessed that I have visited this city several times but there was this one unfullfilled wish - staying away from the Serangoon(little India) area which always made me feel I was in my home town when the whole idea of going abroad really, is to experience new vibes and cultures. Thus on one fine day, while still at Changi airport after disembarking from my flight, I decided to make a beeline for the Orchard road area and namely the Gand Central hotel. (Changi airport is arguably the world's best; now H.K.I.A, chek lap kok of Hong kong has been voted by SKYTRAX as the world's best for 2009 atleast, though Changi has been voted the world's best airport the maximum number of times for several years). The Gand Central Hotel is in a little lane just off the main Orchard road.Orchard road as many would know is the central nerve of the life of the Singaporeans.It is where all the shopping, nightlife and other economic activity is at its max.The hotel is just near this main road and thus offers tourists or business travellers a great mix of comfort and convenience. The hotel offers several facilities.These include a swimming pool, business centre, several restaurants, beauty saloon etc.Specifically, there is a chinese as well as a japanese restaurant that offers all the oriental delicacies. If the entertainment of nearby Orchard road isn't enough, the hotel has karaoke bars and internet cafe/coffee shop facilities to keep you enthralled or say send that all important e-mail.With all the other trappings of a classy hotel such as laundry, health centre etc, this hotel truly has it all. Whats more, SMRT (Singapore Mass Rapid Transport) stations are just a minute or two away on the main Orchard road - Dhoby Ghaut, Somerset and Orchard stations, if my memory serves me right.Thus, the guest is connected to the rest of the megacity just by venturing a little out of his hotel complex. All said and done, I would stay at this hotel once again.No ,not just once again, several times again.Why? Well, the room rates don't punch a hole in the all important wallet.Besides, with an unmatched blend of facilities, class and comforts as well being centrally located along the main shopping belt, this hotel will be my choice for many years to come.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chennai (Madras), India", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "Sagar S", "ReviewID": "UR67856280", "Content": "This is a budget hotel less then 25 meters from Orchard Road.

She was so accomodating and helpful. She even gave us tips on how to save for our money in going from one place to another. The prices of the tours being offered are fair enough for me. The daily breakfasts were almost the same everyday. Nevertheless it's really up to you if you like to eat everything (since it was buffet type) or you just want to taste little by little.

They were ok for me... =p IF you like to save some money then you can also try the fast food at the basement of Concorde hotel just across the mini-street of Hotel grand central.

She would chase those who entered without geting their cards endorsed and rudely asked for their cards. Those who left for the toilet and return were rudely told they cannot do it!

Seriously considering Singapore a tourist attraction, i don't really think that the hotel rate are cheap. They are very high priced and it is not worth for us to pay for even a night stay. My story will tell you why. I arrived from Malaysia on 18th July 2008 at the wee hours of the Friday by a coach that alighted at Goldenmile complex. I was greeted by a taxi driver which drove a Sports Mercedes Benz. I told him that I've just arrived from Malaysia and needed to go to a money changer. He greeted me warmly and told me that he would be more than pleased to sent me to Mustafa Center which is open 24/7. I got my money changed and he then drove me to the Grand Central Hotel. We chatted all along the way to the hotel. I have to admit that in Singapore, you will pay a bomb for taxi services but rest assured you will be pleased with their warm service and polite attitude. I arrived at Grand Central Hotel approximately around 5 a.m. Before i forget, i've made a reservation for a room by credit card and called them to inquire about early arrival arrangements. I was greeted by a front office officer which is half asleep. He merely greeted me with his eyes half open while adjusting his spectacles. I passed him my booking conformation print out and he looked at it. He told me that i was too early and needed to wait until 7 a.m to try again. I have no choice but to accept his explanations. He did not even offer me to safe keep my luggage when i leave the counter front. I was then approached by the concierge who offered me to place my bags in the safe room area. I am in Singapore for a 2 nights stay in this hotel with my wife. I've read a lot of bad reviews on this hotel but i did not thought that mine would also be a nightmare as their website has stated that they have done a full make over of the hotel. At around 9 a.m, after having my breakfast in Toa Payoh i arrive back at the hotel to try my luck to get an early check-in. I was then attended by a girl with the name of Siti Sarah. It was a quick check-in and finally i got a room. But she has informed me that the room is not fully ready and needed to be cleaned by the housekeeper and i agreed. I was given a room in the 9th floor number 919. Upon reaching my room, i was greeted by very old condition of wall paper, old wooden panel of doors, and smelly scent of a run down hotel. Upon opening my room door, i found it much worst. All the make-over or upgrading that has been bragged about is a pure big lie. And mind you that i pay $168 for a premium room and a 3 star hotel ( I would rate it as a budget hotel) if not for its room capacity and location. After a while, the house keeper arrived and cleaned up the room. I needed a drink, and i ask the chinese housekeeper was it a complementary drink, and he said \"Oh Yes, sir\" and i took it and drank it. For all i know that i've been charge $2.35 for a 500ml of mineral water (Unbranded). The bed was ok, with very dusty blanket and sheet that causes me to sneeze throughout my 2 night stay, a big mirror that face directly at the bed (Very bad Feng Sui), air-con is working fine, but all the lights were very old and rusty. I was joined by my wife after her work and after the 1st day shock, i finally lay my head to rest. On the 2nd day, i've gotten up early to prepare for my appointment. After my appointments, I made my way back to the hotel and then out again with my wife to enjoy the day in Bugis, orchard and the town. We then return to the hotl at around 9 p.m to be greeted with more nightmare. When we returned, we were shock to find out that our rooms had been cleaned up with all my wife's clothes folded (Even her P&C clothing were folded). This is the first time in my life after working more than 8 years in hotels and staying in many hotels around the world to have such a bad service. I double check with my wife that we did not put any \"Please make my room\" sign upon going out of the hotel room in the morning. As i know and learned in University where i graduated with a degree in Hospitality, it is not a wise think to access rooms with prior permission of the guest to make their rooms and more to fold female under garments (Bra and Panties). I then noticed that the ceiling access wall was lifted where there is none on the 1st day. i climb up to check for any hidden cameras as i have been told many times. To add things worse, the toilet is in a old condition with stained bath tub, and shower water that runs slower and me walking and temperature that is totally out of control. We then decided that it was a small issue and just to forget it without making any big fuss about it. But nightmare on the 3rd day morning made me wrote this review. We woke up at around 10 and we were having our bath before checking out. at approximately 11.30, i was greeted with the doorbell by a woman housekeeper (Supervisor) and before i could answer the door, she used the master key to push open the door. Lucky for me that i have latched the door with the latch. CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS SERVICE? RINGING THE DOORBELL AND LESS THAN 5 SECONDS SHE USED THE MASTER KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR? I then stormed my way to the door to keep it shut as my wife at that time was half naked. To amuse me more, she just hurriedly rushed away even though i shouted at her and ask her to stop for an explanation. When i ask for her name, She just snub at me and Said \"Lee JEN\". I then called in to the front desk and requested for the manager to be greeted only by his assistant. I told him what has happened and all he could say was \"I am very sorry\" WHAT THE HELL? (if it was in Malaysia, the staff would be fired and the guest would get a night of free stay). A brief investigation was done and all he could offer me was a SORRY. When i told him about the room was trespassed, he say that it was a normal procedure for his housekeeping staff to clean all the room daily. With full of anger i just proceed for my check out and get my refund of deposit to be charged for that stupid mineral water that i drank. Here you go, a real story of why should the Singapore Government should review its charge for hotel rates or at least improve its services. For paying $168 (RM 402.36) without breakfast a night in Singapore, i only pay RM220 ($105) for HILTON in Malaysia and get a 5 star service with breakfast and to get such a bad service. I spend RM900 to pay for a run down hotel with bad service which has bragged about their make over and much more. My wife have taken some photos for proof and i will upload it at another time.

I was to receive a very very urgent mail and was enquiring with them for 3 days as to whether they had received anything for me and despite having received the package 3 days back, they kept telling me \"NO\"! I had to finally contact UPS and get a confirmation from them as to whom they had given the package to! e) Coffee House and Cyber Cafe - They are paid and belong to some private party other than Grand Central! f) Swimming Pool - It is so tiny and so shallow that it should be called a 'Bath Tub' rather than a Swimming Pool.
