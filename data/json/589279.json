My husband and I took our first trip to Italy in June 2008 in celebration of our 35th anniversary. Finding a hotel with the right combination of luxury and value, considering the terrible dollar to euro exchange rate, took a lot of research. We visited some wonderful hotels in Rome, Venice and Chianti, but our stay in Florence at the Residenza del Moro was quite probably the best hotel we've ever stayed in. Friends often chide us for spending too much on hotel rooms, arguing that when touring a new place, the only thing you use the room for is sleep and shower. We disagree because we think each hotel reflects the unique qualities of places we visit. But I think it will be hard to find a hotel in our future trips that can top the Residenza del Moro! A small but luxurious palazzo in the middle of Florence, we were greeted warmly by staff, shown to a marvelous suite which was an extreme upgrade from the accommodation we had booked, and welcomed with fresh fruit and the Italian standard, prosecco. Our suite featured soaring handpainted ceilings, a sunroom, gorgeous green marble bath and french doors opening onto the rooftop garden, where breakfast was enjoyed each morning. The staff were among the kindest and friendliest imaginable, and we hated to leave when it was time to move on. The only negative I can think of was our difficulty in finding the hotel after arriving via train and walking from the station to the hotel, which almost caused an angry and premature end to the 35th anniversary trip! But within a day, the streets that seemed so confusing upon our arrival became familiar and charming. I can honestly say that this is one of the finest, most unique and special hotels we have stayed in, and we felt like honored guests in a family home rather than simply travellers sleeping at a local hotel. All in all, absolutely perfect.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR674705035", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "biglennie"}, {"Content": "Loved Residenza del Moro in Florence The Residenza del Moro in Florence is well located in the center of Florence two blocks from the Arno and a short distance from the Ponte Vecchio. It provides visitors with the experience of staying in a luxurious 17th century Palazzo in the heart of Florence. Its eleven rooms are sumptuously and uniquely decorated with antiques, brocades and lovely frescoes. A stunning contemporary art collection integrates with the traditional decor and furnishings. Rooms are large and comfortable with modern amenities and marble bathrooms. Their second floor roof garden is one of the only two remaining in Florence and provides a welcome respite to the frantic pace of Florence. Residenza del Moro is a discriminating choice for the savvy traveler.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR487234859", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Travelayers"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Experience, Beautiful Hotel My wife and I traveled to Italy for our honeymoon. One of the highlights of our trip was our stay at Residenza Del Moro. First, the property is centrally located to the restaurants, shopping, and nightlife in Florence. Second, it is one of the most beautiful hotels I've every stayed at. Although it wasnt particularly huge, each room had a theme and incredible amounts of character and beauty. Our room, for example, had wonderful italian mosaics on the walls and the ceiling. The walls had intricate, yet elegant, moldings. The bathrooms are large and the fixtures are modern and very comfortable. The staff is wonderful and they went out of their way to make our stay perfect. From restaurant reservations to car service, they were on point every day. After a long day cruising the streets of Florence, we really looked forward to relaxing in our room. I rarely write reviews, but I felt compelled to praise this hotel because of the wonderful service and its beauty. A perfect stay worthy of a review.", "Date": "May 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR737072308", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TravelXYX"}, {"Content": "Thanks to Tripadvisor members we chose this intimate hotel Let\u9225\u6a9a start with our thanks to Tripadvisor members who recommended this gem of a hotel in Florence. It was quite well down on the popularity list, but probably because it only has 11 breath-taking suites which means it won\u9225\u6a9b compete on quantity but sure wins on quality. We stayed six nights in the Del Moro suite, having enjoyed a free upgrade from a superior deluxe room. let\u9225\u6a9a start agreeing with previous members\u9225?experiences, superb rooms with superb personal service. The building is close to the river and about ten minutes from the Dome, perhaps a few minutes more to the Uffizi. But don\u9225\u6a9b measure time and distance in the usual way; the crowds almost everywhere and the very narrow almost non-existent pavements and heavy traffic means you\u9225\u6a92l never be able to move fast!Our large suite with very high stucco ceiling also had a sunken Jacuzzi, and everywhere were tasteful artefacts and modern paintings. The public rooms are well worth a visit to enjoy the art, both modern and much earlier. Look up and admire the ceilings with century old paintings and decorations.We were here late April, so there were a couple of days of rain. But half way through we were able to sit out on the extraordinary attractive and large roof garden to enjoy late afternoon drinks. How such large trees can grow on the roof is a marvel. There\u9225\u6a9a no restaurant, so while the staff will always suggest good restaurants, we found that the Cantinetta Antonori in nearby Plaza Antinori was excellent (you need to book) and in Via del Moro, in the same street as the hotel and moments away is the very good Giovanni\u9225\u6a9a. Il Latini is ever closer if you\u9225\u6a99e prepared to share long tables and battle with the crowds that come to this \u9225\u69a0nstitution\u9225? You\u9225\u6a92l probably not be offered a menu or the wine list unless you ask, so if you want this very communal experience go by all means. But get the hotel to book or be prepared to join a large crowd outside waiting for the opening each night! We went. It was exhausting! But if you just want to drop in, eat well and admire the petite waitress, Magda glide balletically at high speed from table to kitchen and return in moments fully loaded with dishes, go to the Tremerli, at the river-end of the road. Food good at a fair price with an non-advertised floor show! We noticed the Residenza is on some tourist tours. Save yourself the bother and stay in this hotel which is both historic and absolutely modern.", "Date": "Apr 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR104405963", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GulliverM"}, {"Content": "Terrific, unique, small luxury hotel The location could not be better--5 minutes from the train station right alongside the most upscale and charming shopping streets in Florence, a very short walk to the duomo and Palazzo Vecchio, but removed from that touristy hurlybury.The rooms are all spread along the piano nobile of the residence, and are each different--we happened to have one night of our stay mid-week and were the only ones in the hotel, so they gave us a tour of all the rooms.

This is in fact a former palazzo of a wealthy family. And that is exactly how you feel while you are tucked away in this Florence fantasy. You feel like a Medici !We stayed here Oct. 19-20th and this is our favorite place in Italy, after 3 trips in the last 18 months.We were able to stay in the Suite del Giardino (the Garden Suite). It was the epitome of understated Italian elegance! The suite consisted of a very large living/reception room complete with flat screen TV, a beautiful fireplace, inviting couches, bookcase and a small dining area (where they were happy to set up your breakfast) a lovely view of the garden and frescoed ceilings !!! I felt like I was in heaven ! Then we moved into a beautifully spacious bedroom furnished with a huge four poster bed with beautiful linens, an antique desk, chairs, flatscreen tv and another 14 foot high frescoed ceiling! There was also a dressing area with huge closets. The bathroom was fitted with a separte footed bath tub, and also a spacious shower done in marble and glass. I would have been happy to move in here and live for a month ! The staff is outstanding, always willing to help, but standing in the background to give you a strong feeling of privacy. Breakfast could easily be served in the garden, a salon, or in your own room. It was a wonderful combination of cereals, fruits, juices, hot drinks, cheeses, parma ham, and perfectly fresh pasteries ! It was the beginning to a perfect day ! I would highly reccommend this property. It would be espcially nice for a romatic weekend, anniversary, honeymoon or special retreat. Barbara Pardini, the general manager, is espcially helpful and should be complimented for managing this property to perfection !", "Date": "Nov 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR676200390", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "chocolatetravels"}, {"Content": "Deserves to be Discovered We stayed at the Residenza Del Moro from Sep 29 to October 2 as part of a trip to Venice, Florence and Rome.

My only note would be that the two cheaper rooms (one of which we were staying in) aren't a patch on the more expensive ones (my only criticism being that when we first arrived the guy on the front desk showed us all the other - unoccupied - rooms which we weren't able to afford which made us a tad dissatisfied with ours!!!
