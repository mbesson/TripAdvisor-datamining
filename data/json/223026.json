I was on business and came with a co-worker so we shared a room. We loved walking the marina and there were tons of great restaurants to enjoy. That's pretty much all the positive I have to say which isn't really about the hotel at all but the location. There are a lot of homeless camping out at night right outside the hotel. There was some San Diego police biking the area, so it was relatively safe, just didn't make for great ambiance. For a Hilton, I expected better. The rooms were nice with exception to two things that became annoying. The lack of electrical outlets in convenient locations in the room (next to a bed for your phone charger, or next to a mirror for your hair appliances for instance). The full length mirror was on a wall next to the bed. So technically it was not full length at all and therefore useless. My co-worker and I laughed that there were two perfectly suited locations for the mirror but they chose the wall next to the bed. To their credit, there is free cable internet in each room. But the cable is visibly strung in the hallways at the ceiling. It looks so haphazard and cheezy I forgot I was in a Hilton. It looks like some guy came in and drilled a hole in the hallway ceilings and ran cable, well, actually that's exactly what happened. My scary moment came when I arrived at my room before my co-worker and got ready for bed. I was asleep for about an hour when she came in. I sat up to greet her, and to my horror there was a stranger standing in my room. Once I sat up and got a handle on the situation, I was shocked to learn that our room key was given out in error for a bachelorette party. I had the girl call the front desk immediately to stop any more keys being given out to our room and to get the right information for the party. An apology was made but the damage was already done with my mistrust of the front desk staff being able to manage important security details of guests. When my REAL roommate arrive we bolted the door. Would I stay here again? NO.

I ended up paying $40 per night as other reviewer said but I think I was fooled by the valet company. When I arrived at the hotel, water did not drain from both sink and tub. Thus, the maintenance came and fixed them with plunger. Another frustrating part was the location of thermostat. Both my son and I could not locate it because it was completely hidden behind the shade of the desk lamp. I got the impression that the hotel doesn't want customers to touch it. I managed to find it after a maintenance guy came in and found the location for me. They don't have in-room Wi-Fi but Wired Internet.

The hotel check-in was slow and painful. At the time I was a Hilton HHonor Platinum member, but received no thank you or anything of that nature when checking in, nor my comp upgrades. The room was a basic suite, but nothing great, Small and fairly uncomfortable rooms. Also, they provide ear plugs due to the rail line that is right outside, we would have booked another location if we had known this fact. Thankfully no trains or anything came through as it was a Sunday Night/Monday Morning. The room also had an issue with the hot water. Not only in the sink but the tub as well. Upon complaining there were multiple issues with the bill. I was somehow charged for the 1 liter of water that is provided in each room automatically without knowing it until I reviewed the bill. The water was not touched by anyone. They also took the parking charge off due to the hot water issue, but it took several weeks with hotel management to resolve the complaints.

Review based on a five night stay in January\u00e2\u20ac\u212212 (background of spending 80+ nights per year in different hotels around the globe). (note: this is an edited version of my review, the original was malformed due to my copy/paste error\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) Location: Wonderful location right in the middle of Gaslamp area but one is still able to get a getaway from the hustle since the hotel is next to a rather large park, location is especially convenient for car since very quick access to the Harbor Drive (e.g. from the airport). Countless bars, restaurants and shops right in the immediate neighborhood, quite decent deli/supermarket across the K street. Room: I received a large room in the 10th floor, certainly more than big enough for a single traveller. Bathroom was a little bit on the small side, though. D\u00c3\u00a9cor was rather traditional but not too old fashioned. Room was in very good shape, no signs of usage, stains etc anywhere. Two LCD TVs, safe, good desk for working. Only minor problem was that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no Wi-Fi provided in the room and the LAN access had some issues too. Etc: Unlike some reviewers I did not have any issues with train/tram noise despite the room facing the ocean i.e. the railway. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether I just got lucky, room in 10th floor made the difference or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care that much for city noise but I had no use whatsoever for the earplugs provided. Breakfast was quite good, especially by American standards i.e. more than just doughnuts and muffins\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 No Executive Lounge here.

The man who brought us to our room told us about room service and how great the chicken wings were. He even reccommended a couple a great nearby places to eat. I accidently left my phone and a few other things in the car the valet guys were nice enough to bring my fiance down to the car to get my things and bring him back up. We loved the room service there and there breakfast. Our first day we had breakfast downstairs, my fiance absolutely loved their eggs benedict. Good breakfast buffet to. That night we had room service and I was surprised by how good all the food was. The pool is small but still amazing you can hear the music from nearby bars and its really romantic out there!!IOther couples were out there too relaxing and drinking while watching the night sky! I even got engaged out there. Perfect setting for it if you time it correctly. The next day the entire hotel seemed to know that we were engaged they gave us a really cute quiet spot in the breakfast area.

Otherwise, not much going for it and many problems that keep this hotel from meeting good Hilton standards. I stayed here during convention, and location between the convention center and Gaslamp Quarter was excellent. However, there are several problems that potential clients should keep in mind: - Internet access is free, but only wired, no wifi. The connection is fast. However, I could not connect to my email POP server and had to use an IMAP approach I don't like. I asked at the desk and they said this was a common problem at the hotel and no cure. -There is no shop in the hotel to get bottled drinks or other items- nothing. There is a nice deli across the street that serves this purpose. However, I wanted to get some OJ to bring to the meeting, and the desk said I could get some at the bar and they would put in a to-go cup. Not the option I wanted. If you forget toiletries or want a small item, no options available. - There is no mini-fridge in the room to keep drinks cold. In fact, you can see where this was removed. Why remove this, to make people get room service? - I have Hilton Honors that is supposed to note my preference of rooms higher floor and away from elevator. Instead, I was put on low floor near the elevator. There is a the street car that runs near by and other reviews have probably noted this can be noisy. I was not bothered, but any hotel that needs to give earplugs for sleep is questionable, especially at these prices. There are other issues not worth itemizing- the coffee maker in room is low quality, the free appetizers for Happy Hour were unlabeled and pretty inedible. Overall, seems best to try somewhere else.

If your room does not have one, you would need to request it at check in or request one once you go to your room. There is complimentary wired internet service in the room. There is no wireless services in the room, which was a surprise to me, since I assumed that a hotel name such as the Hilton would have wireless service in the rooms, especially since some of the budget hotels provides complimentary wireless internet services in the room. This was disheartening to me since I had recently bought an iPad, and one of the reasons I bought it was to be able to take my iPad to my conferences and not have to lug around my laptop, which is considerably heavier. There is free wireless internet service in the lobby area and on the second floor in the conference rooms. The signal was intermittent in the Pacific and Marina rooms, but strong in the other rooms. There is also a patio on the second floor, open to all guests, where you can access wireless service. The hotel is very close to the train and the trolley routes. Every day there is at least 1-2 freight trains that comes by and the trolley comes by every 15-30 minutes. The hotel does provide ear plugs, but if you are a light sleeper, I would recommend requesting a room on the other side of the hotel. I stayed on the side where the train tracks are located, and you can still hear it even with your windows closed, it didn't bother me since I'm used to the city noise. The hotel itself is located in a good area, with lots of places to eat within walking distances. Depending upon what you want to do, you may not need a car. There is a trolley stop (Orange Line) near the hotel and goes to a transit center where you can catch the other trolleys or transfer to other buses. I had rented a car to go to Sea World and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park (I was actually staying somewhere else when I went to these attractions), but caught the bus to go to Balboa Park. From the hotel, you can catch the Orange Line Trolley and transfer to the #7 Bus to get to Balboa Park (about an hour ride). Or if you don't mind the exercise, you can walk about 7 blocks north (the blocks in San Diego are relatively short) to Broadway St and catch the #7 bus directly to Balboa Park (a 10 minute ride). For the smokers, the hotel itself is 100% non smoking, but on the second floor, there is a patio area where smoking is allowed. So if you are a smoker, such as myself, please request a room close to the second floor. You can of course always go outside the hotel and ashtrays are provided near the hotel. If you need to print boarding passes, the front desk will complimentary print your boarding passes, although they will do it for you, in which case, you would need to provide the necessary information to them. I found this unusual, since in the past, I would be able to use the computers in their business room and print the boarding passes myself. When I had requested a boarding pass, their internet service was rather slow and it took about 15 minutes to print one boarding pass. Once receiving my boarding pass, I was quite astonished that they didn't ask me if I had any checked baggage, since one of the reasons to do online check in is so that you don't need to pay the additional fees of checking in at the airport. Luckily we flew on Hawaiian Airlines which does not have this distinction. So if you do utilize this service, and are flying on an airline carrier where there is a cost distinction, please ask them about the checked luggage. My preference would be to have at least one computer and printer available to guests where they can go through the entire check in process and print their boarding pass and pay for their check in luggage.

In room coffee is available but not fantastic. There is an issue with an evening train that passes virtually beside the hotel each night and the conductor of that train does love the whistle. However, it was early enough in the late evening/early night to not be much of a bother for me. If a once per day train is something that will ruin your stay, then best to reconsider. The restaurant in the lobby was a very decent breakfast place, although not cheap, and there may well be better cheaper fare in the outstanding surrounding neighbourhood. But, I went for it for convenience alone. For the first time in awhile I did not use gym or pool facilities so cannot comment. The best thing about this hotel is its location in the coveted Gaslamp district. It is an easy walk to everything. There are several really excellent restaurants virtually steps away and a pleasing and safe feeling night community to walk about in. The Hornby shopping mall is an easy walk away.

I don't know if some city ordinance was recently passed that didn't allow it to blow it's horn late at night or we just got lucky, but we were not awakened by anything at all.

Avoid the water park like area if you want to avoid the homeless people sleeping there. They didn't accost us but there were probably 8-10 of them sleeping there.

I'm in the Hilton Honors program and frequently stay at Hilton, Hilton Garden Inn, Homewood and the like, and I can say without reservation that the Gaslamp was the best Hilton I've ever stayed at. Reasons: - The front desk staff was friendly, helpful, and just generally professionally awesome. - Hotel lobby and public areas have been recently renovated and is very clean and well furnished with simple, fresh/modern stuff. - The room and its furnishings, decor, and amenities are in great condition. - Bed / mattress was very comfortable, no potholes. Linens were crisp and new and weren't 50%+ polyester. - My room had a sliding glass door out to a tiny balcony, which I recommend as the clean sea breeze was very nice. I think this might be an upgrade, but if it's just $10 - $20 a night, it's worth it. - Room service food was a cut above average Hilton fare. Pricey, but if you chose the healthy options, very tasty and well prepared. They always got every order right and delivered it in under 30 mins. - It was a two minute walk across the railroad tracks to the convention center. Couldn't be easier, conventioneers! - Plus, if you're at the conference and need to have a meeting but don't have space, you can walk back to the hotel restaurant \"New Leaf\" and meet there, and wine and dine your prey. Food is good here, too. - Right around the corner is the best restaurant district in downtown San Diego. You have dozens of great choices of all types of food and classes of service, and the places are lively and fun to spend time at in the evenings. You can also walk to the movie theater in just a few blocks, and there was lots of good shopping options for those who like that sort of thing. This downtown area vibes as super safe, vibrant, and economically healthy. - It was very easy to get a cab right outside the hotel, even during the convention. A few nits: - When I got to the room there was no mini-fridge. When I called they brought one up right away, but instead of putting it into the furniture that was intended to house it, they stuck it on the floor next to the TV. It worked fine but didn't exactly complement the decor. It was kinda noisy, too. - There is no wifi in the hotel - you have to use the cable at the desk. And it's only 3 feet long. So if you're working all day or want to surf at night, you can't do it on the bed unless you call and ask for a longer cable, which I did. The maintenance guy who brought did so quickly but was surly in the extreme, and it was 40 feet long. Bring your own. - Some folks will be bothered by the horn on the Amtrak train that runs alongside the hotel. You know who you are: you should probably stay elsewhere. Overall, I'm giving a super strong recommendation for this hotel, especially for business travelers.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, top class property, friendly service\u201d", "Author": "RobandVal066", "ReviewID": "UR115505491", "Content": "During our 5 night stay we found the Hilton Gaslamp Quarter a great location for our time in San Diego.

For example, we had asked for a room with a fridge when we booked on the Hilton general reservation line but when we checked in, we were told that was not the room they showed as having been reserved. However, Reception dealt with the problem and shortly after arriving at our room, a fridge was delivered. Reception will also print off your boarding pass if you ask.

The pictures on the hotel website accurately reflect the lobby, etc. so I didn't bother taking pictures of them. Both the room and bathroom were clean, the bed comfortable and toiletries were supplied as well as coffee. The only \"niggly\" for me was that the pillows and sheets, although clean, were not ironed/pressed or whatever it is they do in some hotels to make the bed linen look very smooth. Maybe it was a quiet time, but we were not bothered by any noise, either from trains or next door guests as mentioned in some reviews. The ear plugs provided remained unwrapped. We didn't go to the restaurant in the Hilton as there were too many choices elsewhere that we wanted to try. For example, I highly recommend the Hash House A Go Go - see the pictures of \"Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower\" attached. This restaurant is in Hillcrest and extremely popular.

The Hilton is literally right across the street from the convention center, and just a few blocks in the other direction are plenty of dining & shopping options. - My room was very nice - well decorated, comfortable bed, good size, and impeccably clean. The bad: - For the price, you don't get a whole lot. The in-room coffee is cheap (and the creamer in my room was sour - apparently it hadn't been changed in a very long time) and the bathroom amenities are nothing special. - This ties into location, but be careful where you book. The hotel is in the Gaslamp quarter, so there is a lot going on outside. I was on the second floor and could hear everything. Not good for a light sleeper. - The air conditioning unit in my room was either broken or not set properly- I had to knock it down to 64 degrees to feel comfortable. - The restaurant is awful. $15 for a personal pizza; $20 for salty eggs and soft fruit in the morning. Unfortunately I was tied in because I had to eat quick and then run to the exam in the morning, but if you have the option, get your food elsewhere. - The fitness center was also pretty bad. They only have two treadmills and one elliptical, and the elliptical is desperately in need of servicing. - Service was so-so. I requested a mini-fridge on my first day there (my plan was to pick up some breakfast food at the local supermarket) and was told they were out, but said one should open up in the next day or so (this was fine with me because I was there for 5 days). I never heard back from anyone on the situation. Similarly, I stopped by the front desk a couple of times to ask for directions or a specific restaurant, and the front desk staff did not seem particularly interested in helping out. Bottom line - for the price you are paying, there are several comparable hotels nearby. The Hilton gave me the feeling that it could be a nice place, but that it just wasn't trying very hard.

Even if you're not attending a convention, the location is pretty nice. Right at the entrance to the Gaslamp District, you are surrounded by fabulous restaurants, galleries, shopping, etc. There is no lack of things to do and places to see. Parking at the hotel is absolutely expensive. $35.00/night, valet only. Your only other option is to self-park at a nearby garage for close to the same price with no in/out option. This is just the way it is in the Gaslamp District. Internet access is free wifi in the lobby and free hi-speed (cabled) in the rooms. If there's one thing this hotel could do to make a marked improvement, it would be wifi in the rooms. The desk setup is not really that comfortable. I'm more of a 'prop myself up with pillows on the bed' type of surfer. There's even a really nice chair and ottoman in the room that I would have loved to have been able to get comfy in, but the cable isn't long enough. My stay included free breakfast buffet. I only took advantage of this once, as I'm not big on most buffets. The food was okay. Not horrible, that's for sure. But I'm a slow mover in the AM, so I much prefer room service with a big pot of coffee so I can slowly wake up and get ready at the same time. Speaking of room service. OMG! The Gaslamp Benedict was AMAZING. Poached eggs on a thick sourdough (I think) bread with spinach, tomato and turkey and an avocado hollandaise sauce. So delicious. About the train. Yes. If you are in a room that overlooks the tracks, you will hear the train whistle. The hotel provides ear plugs for those that are light sleepers. I must not be a light sleeper, because I heard the train before drifting off and again in the morning, but nothing during the night. I did, however, hear other guests wandering the halls. I think your level of disturbance will depend entirely on how rude the other guests are during your stay. The room was clean and comfortable. A/C worked fine. Bathroom had a door closer on it, which I found to be kinda odd. The bathroom also has a motion detection light switch, so you have no choice but to turn overhead lights on. Didn't really love that. Water pressure was adequate, but would kind of fluctuate up and down. Even at the lowest point, it was still decent, so no real complaints. Every single member of the staff was fantastic. Every one.

The hotel itself is just beautiful. The location, well, it is in the Gaslamp District. Staff were all very professional and really seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their job at every level.

A/C worked fabulous....internet connection was GREAT and I'm actually returning next week! The only reason I did not give this hotel a five star rating was the one area I believe they are below par. Their exercise facility is WAY too small for this hotel. They have one elliptical, 2 treadmills and one bike. By 5:15 a.m., the elliptical and treadmills were taken and there must have been 3 people (that I saw) that walked in and turned back. For this level of Hilton, the exercise facility receives a subpar mark because I've seen bigger gyms in Hilton Garden Inns. It was almost like it was an \"after thought,\" because it just doesn't fit with all the other fabulous things that this Hilton has to offer. They really need to find more room so more than 4 people (in the ENTIRE hotel) can do cardio in the a.m. or p.m., whatever their preference. Also, this is the first hotel in a very, very long time that did not have santi-wipes of some kind in the exercise facility. Wow...I was surprised!!!! That is a bare minimun these days. Everyone knows that staff do not clean hotel gyms--we get that. But at least have wipes so that people can sanitize the machine everytime someone dumps a pint of sweat on it. I can't imagine a place as nice as this not having those wipes--so someone probably swiped them or they ran out and forgot to replace the box/container. But this needs to be done ASAP.... But again, that isn't stopping me from returning--just a pet peeve. They do get an honorable mention for having it nice and cool in there though! If you really want to get a good leg work out, walk across the street to the convention center. The steps are fabulous for a good workout!!!!

We have stayed in all the other Hilton hotels in downtown San Diego, so we eager to give the Gaslamp Hilton a try. We were'nt disappointed!

We had a room in the 5th Ave. Lofts. This was a separate building - we had to take the elevator from the main lobby up one floor, walk through an attractive outside \"terrace\", into a separate building. This building looks like a converted warehouse or factory, but again, I'm pretty sure it's a newer building. The remote location of our room was well worth it - but if you value convenience more than a unique location, ask for a room in the main building. We were upgraded to a whirlpool suite, which was beautiful. It was really one huge room, with a sitting area, 42\" or so TV, and very comfortable king size bed. The ceilings were high and one wall was windows looking out over the activity on 5th Street, the main entrance to the Gaslamp District. The whirlpool tub was in the bathroom dressing area, but there was a shuttered \"window\" that opened to the main room. It was plenty big for two and very relaxing! There's a park-like walkway adjacent to the hotel. It's a relatively short walk to Seaport Village and the other waterfront attractions. This is a city hotel.

The rooms from the loft buildings are accessed through partially outdoor hallways which then lead to indoor hallways for the remainder of the long walk to the room.

The bathroom was larger than any other I have seen in a standard hotel room. This would appear to be the trend moving forward as clients are demanding larger and larger bathrooms than in the past. This place delivers to those who demand large washrooms. The floor, although tiled, was never cold. The lights and heating system are controlled by motion sensor. This means taht the heat/air conditioning will not work unless movement is sensed. The room may be a little warm upon entry, but will cool down quick once the system senses movement. The bathroom lights were the same, but if this is conserve energy, it was frustrating that the vanity lights could not be shut off manually. This seemed to waste more energy than it saves.

My wife booked a \"romance\" package, which consisted if the usual amenities (bottle of champagne, free breakfast, etc.) in one of their \"loft\" rooms, which was located in an adjacent building connected to the main hotel via outdoor terrace. This property is literally located in the heart of the Gaslamp District, and is within walking distance of just about anything \"tourist-y.\" The location would be great for a baseball fan, as it is within walking distance of Petco Park, or for a conventioneer, as it is also steps away from the monolithic San Diego Convention Center and feet away from the light rail/trolley line (and evidently a switching line for the Santa Fe Railroad as well). The physical property is very much the hip, modern, urban design that is popular in downtown redevelopment projects and is very tastefully done. The property sits in a sort of cul-de-sac, so it is fairly easy to find. Seeing the hotel as we drove up to it, I thought that we had found the ideal location. Unfortunately, this is also where our frustration with the level of guest service started. We arrived at the hotel about 1pm and were informed that our room was \"not ready.\" Ok, that is acceptable. We were also asked for our phone number and that we would be contacted when the room opened, which was to be in one hour...as check-in time was 3pm, I could see this as a plausible scenario..perhaps the hotel was sold out and they simply weren't ready, which is a relatively poor excuse but it could happen. One hour elapsed. Nothing. We had walked around the Gaslamp District and grabbed a bite to eat. We parked our rental car in a metered stall just outside the hotel, so we had to consider that our meter time was not unlimited and we were parked in a two-hour maximum stall. Having not been called yet, we stopped by at 2pm (the promised time), and were told by a differet front desk agent that the room still was not ready, but that housekeeping had been given a \"rush\" order to turn the room around. Ok, now what? As an aside, we overheard another guest next to us trying to check in also, and they were given the same lip service as we were..they were not as understanding as we were. Well, we decided to drive up and down Harbor Drive as we were pretty bored and getting more frustrated. So, we stall and stall and now 3pm comes...still nothing from the hotel. Finally, at 3:30pm, we get a call that the room is ready. We pulled our vehicle up to the valet stand and tell the attendant we only want to check in, which he was nice enough to hold our keys while we did this. (By the way, valet is the only option the hotel allows, and is $35/nt. There are a few public parking garages in the immediate area that are half that price (but with no in/out privileges), so we decided to stash the car in a public garage two blocks over for $18/night and just walk around the Gaslamp District...it worked for us. So we complete the check-in process and make our way to our \"loft\" room. As cool as these higher-priced rooms are. they're not easy to get to, and there are no automatic doors into the area where the rooms are that stay open to allow you to wheel your luggage in. After getting into the room, we wanted to walk around some more, but realized that our \"romance package\" amenities had not even been mentioned to us at check-in or delivered to our room. My wife called the front desk and asked about it, to which the front desk agent stated that they would send someone immediately...waited about one hour...nothing. I called and asked where our stuff was...15 minutes later it shows up. Finally, now we are set, but lost the Hilton \"mo-jo\" we experienced in the Hilton family properties we stayed at throughout coastal California. We certainy did not feel like valued overnight guests at a cost of $250. As a Hilton HHonors member, I chose nothing but Hilton family properties for our entire California honeymoon (Downtown San Francisco - Hilton, Monterey-Hilton Garden Inn, San Luis Obispo-Embassy Suites, Los Angeles-Hilton, San Diego-Hilton) because I am used to their normally great service...and the Hilton Gaslamp was the most expensive one out of all of them, and also the most disappointing in terms of service. Granted, nothing that happened was earth-shattering, but it was enough to make me publicly say that I would not stay here again. Even if I weren't an HHonors member, I would have the same commentary. There is another Hilton property, a beautiful new high-rise, just south of the Convention Center on the waterfront. Not as cool-looking, but certainly another (and possibly better) option.

As far as the hotel itself goes, I only have 3 minor complaints: 1) Parking is really expensive ($35/day), though cheaper parking exists for like $15 nearby. Still, you are getting almost no discount as a guest. Anyone can walk in off the street and get a rate of $12 per 8 hours for parking there. 2) The bathroom door auto-closes. What could possibly be the reason for installing a device to do this? 3) Would not recommend restaurant for breakfast. It was overpriced and the service was lousy. The room itself is nice. The property itself is also good, and the location is excellent. There's just one real \"gotcha\" that you have to watch out for: It's RIGHT NEXT TO a very noisy train! The train itself wouldn't be so bad, but the conductor blows the horn a ridiculous number of times on each pass. He has no consideration for the time of night, and it appears he doesn't blow the horn just to warn nearby cars or pedestrians. He just likes blowing it, and he does so often. If you are a light sleeper, you will DEFINITELY be woken up at all times of the night and morning by this train. If you are not a light sleeper, you will still probably wake up a few times from it. If you have sleep issues, you definitely should stay away from this hotel and any hotels close to it. I considered changing rooms, but I came to realize that the train's horn was so loud that it would not help. Something to think about if you're going to book here. The Gaslamp district is very nice. Lots of places to eat there, very safe, and 2 blocks from Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres. I took a very nice 2-hour tour there for $9, where they even gave me a free SD Padres cap.

We had faxed the hotel several weeks prior to our arrival and asked if we could have an early check in for the above reason. After a short $10 cab ride from the port, we arrived at the hotel around 9.15am. There were no bellmen outside, so we took our cases inside ourselves. The check in guy \"Ricky\" could not have been more friendly and helpful. We had booked our room on points and as we were Diamond Hilton Honors members, we were upgraded to a loft suite and were given comlimentary water and chocolate. Although again with no bellman, we got our own cases our room, perhaps the bellmen were on break. Our room was very nice, modern, big bathroom, plenty of pillows and a really soft and comfortable bed. There was also a writing desk with free internet access, although \"hi-speed\" would not have been a correct description, but it was free. In the lobby was an airline check in terminal. I used this to check in or uor flight the next day and although slow, it served it's purpose and eventually spat out our bording passes. Our room had a large flat pannel tv with plenty of channels to choose from. There was an easy chair and footstool. The footstool looked like it had coffee stains on it and also one of the \"Clean\" towels had brown stains, but I don't think that was coffee. We decided that as we had the day to ourselves, that we would visit the San Diego Zoo, again that was only a short $12 cab ride away. We spend a great couple of hours there. The animals, including the Giant Panda's all seem so well looked after. When we returned to the Hilton, bellmen were everywhere The hotel is very central and right on the edge of the Gasslamp quarter which is packed with bars, nightclubs and restaurants. On the weekend it can get a bit rowdy. We ventured out and ate at one of the many Indian restaurants in the area, we had a couple of beers in one of the Irish bars and listened to a live band. As Hilton Honors Diamond members, breakfast was free and we were given vouchers which even incuded gratuity, that was nice. The breakfast was a full buffet with hot and cold foods and an egg station were you could get eggs or an omelete to order. As much juice and coffee as you wanted, plenty of fruit, health drinks, etc. Full marks for the breakfast, the only minus was the serving staff talking and laughing at the tops of their voices whenever there were more that 2 of them together, I could not tell you what they were discussing as I do not speak Spannish, although they all found it very entertaining. This was very distracting when trying to enjoy a quiet breakfast and also made it difficult to get their attention for a coffee refil. Across the road from the Hilton is a deli, where you can stock up on supplies from soda and beer to breads and salads. We bought a large fresh and very tasty tuna salad for just $6 The next day we called down to have our luggage collected and within 10 mins there was a bellman who took our luggage right to the taxi, ceckout was a breeze.

The front desk staff & valet staffs were very nice and helpful. It was easy drives to the locations we wanted to visit. This Hilton was better located to explore the Gaslight District, so walking was not a problem. This was in contrast to the Hilton Bayfront, newer, that required traversing through the Convention Center at night with what seemed to be questionable people hanging out. The room was nice. It had a good flat panel TV but running in analogue. One TV movie costs $14 rental and could have been found for 99c at the Redbox rental. The view was very nice and I plan to post photos taken from our windows. The Commuter Trains ran directly outside and presented little more noise that the SF Cable Cars. The worst noise came when a Truck was blocking the tracks and one of the Red Cars repeatedly released the attack of his horn for what seemed to be a very long time. The bathroom was small, one sink, and not much light. It was a one person at a time room. The bath/shower was a little slippery and there was no rubber bath tub matt to be found.

We paid $200 plus taxes plus parking directly from the Hilton site and on reflection would of found somewhere with cheaper parking and not got the breakfast , still the location was superb and we parked the car and forgot about it .", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rohnert Park, CA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the location\u201d", "Author": "MzRKO", "ReviewID": "UR24800930", "Content": "This hotel has wonderful accomdations, the room and bathroom were adequate size and extremely clean.

So clearly the hotel does try to make accomodations for this inconvenience. The rooms were very nice and well appointed although the bathroom was a bit on the small side. Other than that no complaints. The bed was comfy and the furniture was in good shape. The lobby and restaurant however were another story. The restaurant has a unique configuration. It appears that the architect or designer tried to make it like living room furniture and that is just not comfortable for restaurant dining. Not to mention the poor service. The food was cold and when part of my mother's order did not arrive the server said \" Oh I just put it on her plate.\" That meant my plate. Ummm...eww.

First of all the other comments about trains and noise is correct, I was upgraded to the club floor which is right next to trail and trolley tracks. I could live with that but this property has some issues, all the refrigerators have been removed from the rooms, even the club floor rooms. During my one week stay they just out right refused to change my sheets even thought I called house keeping and the front desk on my first night and ask that this be done as I had a bad cold and was perspiring at night. Yes, I contacted the on duty Manager each time who sent the housekeeping staff up to change them after each complaint. Then the next neat trick was house keeping just rinsing out the glasses and coffee cups vs. putting out clean ones each day (nice since I had guest visiting and using the cups). When I checked in the glasses had fingerprints and lip marks on them. Also beware of the wake up call system at this hotel, I had two days when the wake up call did not occur, I called the front desk and was told that it showed I did not answer. One of the folks traveling with me figured out that their computer system says \"you have a wake up call at 6 a.m. set\" but you actually have to add one minute each day 6:01, 6:02 or you will NOT get a wake up call. I thought it was funny when I checked in and called for my first wake up call and it said \"you currently have a wake up call set for 4:15 a.m.\". Also brought the problem and the solution to the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention who said \"we have a lot of customer complaints about that\". Gee, ya think folks staying on business have to be anywhere? The bathrooms are equipped with motion sensors so you cannot leave a light on at night, and if you have to get up in the middle of the night for the bathroom you will really enjoy the blinding lights when the motion detector see you coming. The room temp cannot be set at one temp aka I like my room at 70 degrees, you have to choose AC or heat then try to get the room to your temp manually during my week long stay I was either roasting or cold. I'm sure they are implementing this measure to save money, but it also will drive off your Diamond Customers. Since I'm a Diamond Member they give you a free breakfast each morning. The food was mess hall quality and the same morning after morning. The staff in restaurant were very nice and the service was good each morning. Beware of the $32.00 valet only parking at this hotel - the valet's were quick to get your car but for $32.00 would you expect anything less. TV in the club floor rooms are old 19\" not flat screens. Then just to top off the week, I went down to drop off a Corporate FedEx box (pre-paid corporate account) and was handed a legal size form that they told me to fill out and they would charge me $10.00 for letting me leave the box for pickup -nice way to give that extra bit of service to your Diamond Members. My Co-worker also had billing problems when she went to check out; they were trying to overcharge her by $300.00 from her reservation price. The clerk on duty was just rude to her and would not make the corrections even after being shown the Hilton reservation confirmation. Only after getting the GM involved did they correct here charges. If you have to been in the Gas lamp areas near the convention center this property is walking distance, but I'd try another hotel. I'm starting to see Hilton fail the Diamond Members at most properties that I have stayed at since the chain was sold to \"Blackstone Group\".

The location was great. There are a ton of restaurants and bars in the Gaslamp Quarter and a ton of nightlife so if that's what you're looking for it's only steps away from a ton of action. It's also only a few miles away from Sea World, Coronado Island, and the Zoo. If you're there for a baseball game it's also very convenient being only a couple blocks from Petco Park. The room itself is just what you'd expect from a Hilton. The hotel is very modern and it has a smaller more boutique hotel type of feel to it than a lot of other Hiltons, though.

My only complaints were that the tv was a smaller tube tv, the remote control didn't work, and noise from the hallway was seemingly amplified into the room.

We got it for 60% off rack rate. Since I knew t hat downtown hotels are notorious for outrageous parking fee, I considered this when making my bid. First time using priceline and was happy that I got the hilton. We traveled with 2 young toddlers so convenience, pool, and nonsmoking are our priorities. After reading a bad review that the front desk treated guest who booked thru priceline badly, I was worried. However, my husband checked in and all went smoothly. I did call after I booked the hotel to request for 2 double and a mini fridge. But, there was no fridge when we got to our rooms. It took 2 phone calls and the finally sent the fridge (around 9pm). Keep in mind, that this is suppose to be a 4 star hotel. When we stayed at the Hyatt, they sent the fridge as soon as we stepped in our rooms. The good thing is that all rooms are nonsmoking. We got double bed with city view. The beds were very comfortable with 6 fluffy pillows. Queen beds would be better since it is a 4 star hotel. The decor were trendy with steel lamps and wood armoire. The bathroom had granite countertop and double sink. It was kind of small in my opinion There is a small outdoor pool on the roof of the second floor terrace as well as a fitness room. The nice touch was a bowl of granny smith apples at the front desk and complimentary sunday newspaper. The location of the hotel was convenient since it is around the corner to 5th avenue in gaslamp quarater. There is a starbuck on the corner, ralphs supermarket and albertsons on market st. Try pinkberry yogurt just around the corner. The hotel is also a short drive (5min) to balboa park and 10 minutes to seaworld and coronado island and in and out burger. La jolla beach was less than 20 minutes away. We did hear the train at night and it did get annoying. But on saturday night, there was no train noise. So, if you are a light sleeper, beware. The really negative is that this hotel is valet parking only: $32 for over night with in/out privileges.The sign says $8 for valet so even if you don't park overnight there still a fee? When we arrived, the valet fellow asked us if we plan to park overnight and it would be charged to your room. It can really add up if you are paying the rack rate. You can park in public parking a block away for $20. But, since we had young kids and a rental car that is not insured, we did not want the hassle. In summary, I would not pay full rate for this 4 star unless I was traveling withou kids and my priority was gaslamp area. The valet only parking fee is pricey compared to other locations. There was no special turndown service or any speical amenities to justify the price. I have stayed at hyatt in tampa for less and they had better service, shuttle, and optional valet.

Mike Denton was at all times up to date on EVERYTHING we asked from hotels to restaurants to attractions all the way up the coast to LA! This man booked rooms( all came with upgrades because of his networking skills), restaurants ( best tables in the house) ,advised what beaches to go to,what attractions to see in the city, where to have the best ice-cream in Coronado! there was no end to his advice. The crowning glory was when we arrived back in San Diego and checked into our accommodation ( not the Hilton having decided before we arrived to have a change) and were told on arrival that he had telephoned to make sure our booking was good and the dinner reservation he had made for the last evening was all in order!

Everything you need is within walking distance, so no need for a rental car or taxis, once you arrive. Despite being in an active area, we found our room to be quiet. Some previous reviewers have mentioned noise from the nearby train tracks, but we didn't have a problem - the light-rail trolley isn't noisy at all, and the Amtrak train only came by once a day during the daytime. The hotel has a stylish, modern, boutique feel. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The restaurant doubles as a sophisticated little bar in the evening (nothing loud or crazy). Our room was well maintained and very comfortable. The lighting was a bit quirky, with VERY tall bedside lamps that were difficult to turn off or on while lying in bed. The bathroom light operated by a motion sensor, so it came on as soon as I entered, even in the middle of the night, before I could close the door (so the light shone out into the bedroom itself, waking my wife).

I booked several months in advance for a King Terrace Loft Suite in the 5th avenue section, yet when I arrived, the hotel staff placed me in a downgraded King deluxe guest room (essentially with a bed, a TV, a bathroom, and a little chair in the corner). I called the front desk to figure out what happened, and the young lady stated that I was, in fact, staying in a King suite. I had to explain to her that this room was indeed NOT a suite and not the King Terrace Loft Suite that I specifically booked and paid for. Well, this was 11pm at this time, and of course, there was no King Terrace Loft Suite available in the hotel. However, the staff did anticipate that some guests would check out and \"free up\" one of those rooms tomorrow - that my \"chances were very good\" that I'd get transferred the following day. I'm a reasonable guy, but I had a tired wife an 18 month-old child. We slept in this small room and were transferred to the suite that we actually booked the following day. Overall, it seemed like the staff was doing this begrudgingly, and that I was getting some special favor despite me showing them a printout of my reservation stating what I had booked. There was a very helpful young lady the following day at the desk who apologized for the mishap and gave us a voucher for a free breakfast at the New Leaf (delicious). The King Terrace Loft Suite was a beautiful, spacious room with contemporary colors and a splendid bed. The view was not great - it overlooked the Hard Rock Hotel across the street that was being built & had pretty noise construction.. not the fault of the Hilton. The bathroom was gorgeous with plentiful, high quality toiletries, a jacuzzi tub, and a large glass shower. However, the next day, my laptop's CPU had this weird meltdown - frying the internal circuitry while it was plugged into the hotel's outlet. I have no idea if this was related to the outlets there, but Apple's repair department said they'd only seen this particular crash about 2-3 times before. I would've chalked this up as a coincidence without laying any blame on the Hilton.. but on the same day, my plug-in clock/ambient noise maker froze and would not turn back on - never happened before or since. A few hours later, we smelled a terrible burning coming from the bathroom, only to find one of the wall lamps smoking. The hotel staff sent up a repairman a few hours later to take care of it. I really didn't think the room was safe from an electrical standpoint.. imagine that? Location is very centrally located - parking deck right down the sidewalk which was inexpensive and next to Petco Park. There is no need to pay the exorbitant valet fees, which are approaching $40/night. The gorgeous convention center is literally 1 block away.. overall, this is a pretty nice hotel in a fabulous city. The stay, however, could've been better - but for the most part, it was enjoyable. My advice to hotel management would be to explain to the front desk workers about the definition of a suite, and to never change a guest's previously booked room unless it's an upgrade. These types of things are enough to make me think twice in my future trips to San Diego about whether to spend them at this particular Hilton.

Its also right at the start of blocks upon blocks of restaurants, shops, bars, etc. We couldn't have asked for a better location. The room was good. We stayed on the side overlooking the lofts. We looked down onto a cement courtyard. Not very interesting. Noise was never a problem for us, and we stayed through the weekend. We were also in the room right next to the elevator shaft, and we never heard that either. My only complaint is the shower. The first couple of days the drain was slow, but the water did go down. Then one day, the drain wasn't working, or it was very slow. I played with plug in the shower drain, but didn't really want to touch it because it was rusty around the edges. By the end of my shower, I was standing in 2 inches of water. The next day, the drain was back to what it had been. Never enough to complain, but annoying. And with how nice the rest of the hotel and room were, I wasn't impressed with the shower. Like I said, it was rusty around the drain, and the metal disk between the shower head and shower wall had fallen off so that it was hanging around the neck of the shower head. And it seems like a lot of hotel bathrooms, there wasn't a fan in there. So we dealt with steamy mirrors every morning. And the lighting wasn't great. Hard to put make up on in the morning.

My wife and I stayed here for four nights from Thursday to Monday. If you don't care about the lobby, then you can skip most of what I will say. The lobby is one of the most annoying that I have ever experienced, especially for breakfast. First, the seating area used breakfast has tables with regular chairs combined with a sofa that will sink to an uncomfortably low level once you sit on it. That means the person on the regular chair will be sitting at normal height relative to the table, but the one on the sofa will be eating their breakfast seemingly under the table. Not the best situation if you value eye contact with your conversation partner. This annoys both the customer and the waiter, who then is asked to rearrange tables and chairs to avoid the sofa altogether. That means chairs will now be repositioned between other tables. This is fine when no one else is around you, but looks ridiculous when the area is full. The perfectly good eating area does not open until later because, according to our waiter, it is assigned to a waiter who comes in later. So why not just switch waiter assignments so that the customer comes first? And then there is the chef, who was not present to cook our omelette when breakfast opened. Question: Why not have the breakfast chef come in when you say you are ready for breakfast? And do you want a TV where you can see the whole screen? No luck here. The TV in the lobby had a large black strip. This is the HIlton, for Conrad's sake--- can we not even get a TV with a full screen visible?

My husband slept through it, so I thought maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought. I defintley should have asked the next morning to be moved.

Also within walking distance of Seaport Village. Anytime we needed a taxi it was a short/cheap ride. Didn't need to rent a car. But... for a Hilton property it was small. The pool was small (one of my friend is a swimmer and she was so disappointed in the size). The gym was well equiped by small. They have a restaurant with a menu but not very big and sometime you'd end up being seated in the bar/lounge/lobby area. We had friends/co-workers staying at the Marriott and that was huge! and on the same side of the street as the convention center... but the Hilton is on the \"better\" side of the street - closer to the shopping/dinning areas :-) Housekeeping: Even though I requested that we be put on a list for early-morning cleaning, they would come around at 4pm daily - which for us is right around the time we start getting ready for our evenings, so we would have to vacate the room just so they could make it up. Upside: the location, they also have a firepit sitting area outside and all the staff members we encountered were very nice and professional.

The hotel is updated and very modern looking. The front desk was just wonderful. They were great from check in until we said our farewells on Friday. We had a beautiful room on the 9th floor on the corner (meaning we had a window on each wall) that overlooked the conv. center. The pool area may look small but it was perfect for the amount of people that used it. The fitness center was updated with all new equipment and was good for the amount you might need to do on vacation. The location was key for this hotel. Anyone that is attending a Padre game or wants a place that is close to shopping and restaurants this is the place to be. The tram picks up right in front of the hotel also. Some things I have read are very true like Parking cost and noise. Let me explain a few things. There is a parkade parking ramp on the corner of 6th and k (about a two block walk) that is much cheaper than the valet parking at the hotel (which is 30.00 a night) The cost at the parkade is either $8.00 overnight on a non event night and $12.00 on event nights. This option worked well for us as we would leave in the morning and come back later in the day. If you need to come and go many times you might want to do the valet parking as that is unlimited come and go options. The next thing is the noise. Yes the train and tram go past many times and you can hear the crossing things ding and the noise of the tram also. I got numb to it, and it really did not bother me. My husband is a lighter sleeper and it did wake him up during the night. My answer to this is, if you are staying at a downtown hotel you should expect noise in any city. Just be aware that it might be a factor if you are a light sleeper. I do not take these into account when I rate this hotel as like I said I expect to pay for parking and to have noise when staying downtown. The location is right next to the Gaslamp District. You easily can walk out your door and dine at the most casual to your nicest steak and seafood type place. With outside seating this area is beautiful. There is all types of food to choose from also. I booked this hotel thru priceline and I am so glad this is the one that met my match. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone that might be going on vacation or has a event at the convention center (right across the street). A big thank you to all the people who worked at the hotel from the front desk to the maids that brought us towels after we forgot to take our DND sign off the door and did not get maid service that day.

The only thing I would say otherwise is that this hotel is probably geared more towards the business traveler or the adult who is looking to stay in the midst of the vibrant downtown scene. Not too much for my niece & nephew who are both under 6. Pool is ok, but small and not much of a \"playzone.\" Lastly - the day spa that's attached to the hotel, Artesia Day Spa is absolutely awful. I booked a massage for my sis-in-law to surprise her for her birthday (which was the day we arrived). The first person who booked my appointment was friendly. However, when I called on the day of the appt to inquire about pushing back my sister's appt since we were delayed in our travel plans, the receptionist took that as me cancelling my appointment and didn't even call to confirm. So when my sister and I showed up (on time since we rushed to the hotel!) at the spa, we were met with the rudest employee who told her that her appointment was cancelled and there was nothing to do they could do about it. However, the masseus that was going to be assigned to my sister was standing right there (they were looking at her to see if she'd stay and the masseus walked out the front door). Then when we asked if there were any other appointments available during our brief stay, we were met with a stern no. When I left the spa and went back to call from my room to speak with a manager, the receptionist told me that she didn't know who the manager was and that managers had weird schedules - in other words, she knew it was me trying to speak with someone higher than her. I've worked in hotels before and service that we received at the spa is something that is just unacceptable! My sister was sorely disappointed and was a downpoint to our otherwise exquisite stay at the Hilton. Definitely recommend the hotel, definitely not the day spa.", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location for the Nightlife\u201d", "Author": "TaliaT", "ReviewID": "UR7753535", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed here complimentary of his work, so of course free is always nice.

While there was nothing significantly wrong with the suite, it certainly wasn't worth the amount we paid. Essentially all we got for the money was some extra (empty) square footage and a bedroom door. The suite's furnishings were very middle-of-the-road standard-issue Hilton stuff. Not awful, but not particularly comfortable, and certainly not luxurious. The bedroom, while fairly good-sized, was furnished with only a king sized bed, two nightstands and an armoire containing an old, rather small television. The bedroom had plenty of space for at least a chair, or possibly even a love seat, but there was nowhere to sit down except on the bed. The living room was furnished with a love seat (hard/uncomfortable), one upholstered chair, a small desk and another armoire containing an old, smallish TV. While both armoires had a space for a minibar, neither actually contained a minibar. At this price point, I would expect a minibar, as well as a reasonable-sized flatscreen tv. Positives: the hotel's location is convenient to the Gaslamp area. The bed met the new Hilton standards and was very comfortable, with nice quality sheets and a duvet. The lobby bar servers were pleasant (though if the hotel wants to be \"hip,\" as its literature claims it is, it needs to ditch the very unhip music in the bar!) The Hilton does have a \"hotel within a hotel\" called the Enclave, which sounds like it's trying to compete with W and similar hotels. We could have stayed there for only a little more money. Perhaps we should have. The problem is that the Enclave rooms, while large, are apparently all \"loft style\" (i.e. one continuous space) so that wouldn't have worked for our needs.

I have never stayed in The Gas Lamp District before as I thought it appeared to be too touristy. It probably is touristy but was alot of fun. The location of the hotel is right near a lively night life center catering to younger folks of college age but also has several very good restaurants that cater to middle aged folks. The restaurants in the area are pricey for what they are but not outrageous. If you have a car and want to eat at good more moderate restaurants where you are not paying so much for location drive up 5th avenue away from the hotel and the water until you come a few blocks to the end of 5th Avenue which would be University Avenue. There are many very good moderate restaurants over there. We stayed in the 5th Avenue Lofts part of the hotel which was different and fun. It had a modern feel and was not a typical hotel. The hotel is small and had the feel of a boutique hotel rather than a large Hilton which was great. Pool was very tasteful as were the seating areas and the gym was adequate. Room service was prompt and pretty good for a chain hotel. Staff was very polite and considerate. Our climate control was not working properly. They offered to move us which we declined as it was not a big deal but they did comp our breakfasts during our entire stay which was great of them. Also the room was not made up when we returned one day at 5pm. In response to our phone call they made it up immediately, apologized that the housekeepers were behind and sent us a complimentary cheese plate. Yes there is noise from the nearby trains. It did not bother us and did not seem to be a problem at night but one could request a quiet room. Hotel parking is very pricey and we parked at a garage a block away for half the price. Also from 6pm Sat through Mon morning you can park on the street without feeding the meter which we also did. The arm chair in the room was alittle worn but nothing major. The rest of the room was in very good shape. Coffee maker, free waters (not sure if this was because we are Hilton Club Members) and chocolates at night were a nice touch.

The Good: - Complimentary Internet with wired ethernet (and cable provided). This was quite a pleasant surprise. Other hotels I've stayed at offers wireless internet, but those lose connection periodically and it is frustrating to lose connection while trying to do work; not to mention you're playing crabshoot with signal strength depending on where you are. - Nice contemporary look. Very classy. Clean, spotless all around. And as odd as this sounds (i'm pretty meticious), I really like their heavy thick doors. It provides a sense of security. And you Feel the quality as you go and open the door to your room. - A nice lady always came by and gives me chocolates and Fiji Water. She tells me to take all I want and is complimentary. On days when I\"m not there, she comes in and leave them on my nightstand. I don't know if I get this only because I\"m a diamond hilton member, but this adds a dimension to the warm \"hospitality\" that eludes most other hotels. - Location!!!! It's downtown.

It is located across the street from the Convention Center and at the edge of the Gaslamp Quarter. We felt very safe and comfortable walking through the Quarter and on to Horton Plaza. The trolley, which takes you everywhere in San Diego, has a stop right outside the hotel. The cost is only $1.25 for two hours, round trip... cheaper than parking in this city. Be prepared to pay $26.00 for valet parking at the hotel. The hotel is clean and nice looking. The staff are very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge. The parking staff are young, but well mannered, enough said. We requested a high floor and were given a room on the tenth floor. It had an excellent view of the city and a nice partial view of the bay. The room was nice, but simple. Nothing fancy here like you might expect from a four star hotel. No in room refrigerator. The bathroom is simple. No extras here, but it was clean. Ok, I enjoy snacking when at a hotel, but this one only offered a soda machine on our floor. The only snack machine was near the pool. No microwave, so don't bring the popcorn. Trains. This hotel is next to the trolley tracks and a railroad track. During the day, the hum of the trolley is quaint. At night, about four freight trains came through with whistles blowing all the way. We had our windows open for part of the night, but once they were closed I no longer heard the trains. However, my husband didn't sleep as well and still heard the trains throughout the night. The room was very quiet otherwise. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and we have no regrets. The view from our room and the friendly staff are what made it most enjoyable. We were celebrating our anniversary and I would have like a little more luxury, but it was fine for the price we paid on priceline. I would say it is a very nice three star hotel rather than a four star though. Local attractions tips: Almost all the attractions in San Diego have a web site... including the Gaslamp Quarter, Seaport Village and the USS Midway. Use a search engine and get information before visiting. The Gaslamp Quarter site has restaurant descriptions, prices and menus... very helpful.

While there are certain design aspects that are somewhat notable, the hallways had an institutional/cold quality - with the added feature of the always annoying slamming door closures.

The room lacked many advertised amenities. No Robe, no Frette linens. The continental breakfast featured unripe and unedible fruit.

I called the front desk after the room service trouble, they said the manager would be in touch the next morning. He never called. No one answers the phones here. The morning paper never arrived. When I went to the Front Desk the next day to get change to tip the valet they had none! 11 a.m. on a workday and the Hotel cant even break a $20.00. This Hotel failed from check in to check out.
