The rooms are warm and inviting, and the decor is absolutely beautiful. The high ceilings and wooden beams in the room definitely cast a unique feel. The history behind the building is also very interesting. The staff is very accommodating, particularly the girl that works overnight. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely be staying again in the near future. Something else that is noteworthy is the pool. I've been to several hotels claiming to have a heated pools and it ended up not to be so, but theirs is perfect! Also, if you choose this hotel definitely go with the Valet!

Everything was great and we didn't have any issues during our stay. The only thing we did not like was that the Elevators were painfully slow.

There were only microwaves, but we called the front desk, and they sent someone up to get the sandwiches, heated them up, and then brought them back to our room. Impressive service. Another example, the only real option at this hotel is valet parking, one of our guests forgot his boots in his vehicle, and when he talked to concierge about where his car was to get them, they just went and got the boots for him, and delivered them to his room. Again, impressive level of service. And the excellent service is offered up, one does not even need to demand it, it is freely given to each guest on every visit we have made to this hotel.

We arrived before 8am from a red eye flight, however they checked in our bags right away so we could do some sightseeing without lugging them around. The desk clerks were all very nice and helpful and to our surprise our room was ready by 11am! That was a blessing because we were able to check in early, take a nap and get ready for our events that evening. This hotel used to be a distribution center and it was turned into a hotel and it is considered a landmark. You can still see the beams in the high ceilings. It looks like a decor to me but in fact these are reminders of what the place used to be. When we booked the room it said that it came with a continental breakfast. The truth is you get a full breakfast and there are lots of choices. This hotel is located in an area with a very active night life, which did not bother me because the location is great and convenient to everything. We were able to walk back and forth to Lucas Oil Stadium. If you're lucky to get a room away from the street you will get a good nights sleep. They also have a business center right next to the front desk. I did not use the pool or exercise room so I can not give any opinions on that.

After researching downtown hotels, I booked the room because of the queen beds (opposed to doubles) and because it also had a pull-out sectional sofa. When we travel once or twice a year for more than a night or two, we like to have our own beds, but just for one night in the city, it makes more sense to share one room to keep cost at a minimum. The total for the room was $155.57, but would sleep 6 comfortably and even sleep 7 (with the \"L\" of the sectional). There would even be PLENTY of room for a queen size blow up mattress, as well. I have 4 kids, and it has become difficult to find a room to accomodate 6 people. This hotel is definitely the place. Not only was there ample space, but the ceilings were extremely high, there was a full size kitchen with stainless dishwasher, sink, stove, and fridge, beautiful cabinets, large TV's, table & chairs to eat at and it was right in the heart of the city. I booked the room also for the proximity to our final destination, Howl At The Moon (dueling piano bar). It was literally out the door and around the corner. We ate dinner at the Old Spaghetti Factory (just across the street from the hotel) and went to HATM just before 7:00. We got a front row tables at center stage. Couldn't have asked for better seating. Homewood had a satisfactory breakfast. Better than most, not as good as some. As I mentioned, I have 4 children, so we always try to stay somewhere with free breakfast (so I've had my share). There were scrambled eggs, sausage patties, french toast sticks (hard as rocks), plenty of fruit, pastries, and cereals, and make your own waffles. Overall - good breakfast.

The good: Great valet service - rather expensive ($24 a day) - but, these guys (who I believe are subcontracted and not hotel employees) do a great job - and each day they offered me driving directions to my destination. Very prompt and courteous service. Great breakfast buffet in the AM (but rather early for me 6 to 9AM) (and see the \"ugly\" comment below re: unwashed fruit). Each day they have a different \"hot\" entree and then the usual, toast, bagels, rolls, cereal, yogurt, fruit, hot waffles (machine). Coffees, and juices. Mon - TH evening light dinner buffet - this was nice because my husband was going out and networking and my son and I could grab something quick and easy and not have to be bothered with going out by ourselves. Again, they have one featured item and there is a calendar menu on your fridge in your room to tell you in advance of what they are serviing. FREE beer and wine too! Nice size clean pool area - my son even learned to swim there!!! The elevators are (good) quite quite - we were right next to one and i never heard it in my room: however (bad) they are very SLOW. Two in the hotel. Decor and loft warehouse feel - nicely decorated. Great open kitchen w/ small table w/ 2 chairs; sectional pull sofa - flat screen TV. Large entryway. Adequate size bathroom. The 1 bedroom in sq footage is quite large - we had plenty of room. The Bad (or not so good): We checked in ~5 PM on Sun eve- I asked for a quite room since i have a napper and we all are light sleepers - only 5 floors in this hotel - so something off the main street would have been desirable. The clerk had us originally on 3 rd floor - facing noisy front street and right beside elevator - NOT GOOD. He informed us they were full due to the convention (which my husband was attending). He said he could move us up one floor - so we said - ok, fine; well, this was NOT a 1 bedroom -but, rather the suite room - with everything grouped together and smaller - so I called and said - we need the 1 bedroom; well, he only offered us rthe original room - so ok fine. But, really - i understand they are full - but, not everyone had checked in yet - and he reallly didn't try to relocate us - he seemed rather apathic about my concern for need for a quite room. This may be a good for some -but, for us it wasn't good - the location. You are smack dap in restaurant/bar area - Wholesale district - bars across the street and beside you and down the alley... VERY vERY noicy from 11 pm to 2:30 AM. The police station is just down the block - but, you would never know it. Garbage trucks - from 3:30 to 5 AM every night?! BEEP BEEP BEEP - backing up - than CRASH DUMP - garbage collecting!! uugghhh - not much the hotel can do about these I know - but, sleepers beware!! (This goes to my request for a quite room) No bedroom door - it's all open - i guess to make it more of a loft warehouse feel - but, that is the reason I want a separate bedroom - I want a door! May not be an issue for most - but, for us w/ a small son it was. IN room movie rental: they have a special section for $4.99 (and up*) - well, you have to read the small print - I ended up buying a movie (Shrek) for 9.99 - thinking it was $4.99 and then we could only watch it once? Bed - mattress or bed needed replaced. NO dish soap provided - you had to run the dishwasher to clean a few dishes. The Ugly: Our confirmed AAA rate was $151 a night for 4 nights. When my husband checked out and brought me the bill on Thur AM - I was shocked to see we only rec'd that rate on our 1st night and M and Tu night we were charged more than double and on Wed $171 a night; so, i took my confirmation down to the front desk and asked for a mangaer - I ended up speaking to the Dir of Sales and she was polite and got everything changed but really didn't offer up much explanation for the mishap!? Breakfast buffet - I noticed by the 2nd day that the fruit all had stickers on them still -and upon further inspection yes, they NOT been washed at all. I asked the food service lady and she confirmed that \"no, she didn't wash them - they come in a box .... already washed\"... ummm NO -they are not washed - and there is no where in the breakfast area to wash them!? She did offer to go wash my apple for me. But, ppl - it's a breakfast buffet - ppl are grabbling apples, pears, etc to sit down and eat or run out the door to eat for a snack later - shouldn't this food all be washed? Isn't that Food service 101? I realized after all this that we had served my son the blueberries the previous day and I am quite certain it wasn't washed either!! GRRRR!! I infomed the Dir of Sales of this on my check out, along w/ the bill mishap and also the lack of concern for my request of a quite room. She did follow up in a few hours with a phone call; but, with basically just another apology and to notify me she had followed up on these items... so, PLEASE - let me know if you readers stay there and see the stickers still on the fruit!!

With my AAA membership, I was able to book an excellent rate, and for under $200 a night, me and my four friends shared a suite with enough room for all of us to have our own beds (there was a couple involved) and be comfortable, plus a lovely bathroom, great kitchenette with a full-size fridge, sink, and more, and breakfast included! Not only that, but the hotel was very easy to get to by public transit from the airport (my friends who drove had to put their car in the valet, which was $25 per day). The staff were very helpful and supportive, including as regarded a noise incident in the hallway during my stay. The breakfast had a nice range of selections, and if none of it was great, well, it was tasty and free - and I have trouble turning down waffles. :) I also made use of both the pool facility - which was very pleasant and seemed incredibly under utilized, nothing like a pool to oneself! - and the exercise room, which seemed to get crowded in the mid morning but always had room first thing (it included two treadmills, a stationary bike, an elliptical and some free weights). My friends all indicated to me that they were very satisfied, too. When, a few days afterwards, I was notified by the staff that they had opened up booking for the same dates next year?

All of us, including the preschoolers, were wowed by the classy suite and lobby area. It was pretty much everything we look for in a good hotel: nice decor, very friendly and helpful staff, exceptionally clean, and a great location -- all for about $150/night. Now for some details: The hotel is pretty new, which meant the decor was very nice: Cherry-finish cabinets in the kitchen&bath, dark quartz countertops, stainless appliances, very nice BR furniture. It was all very clean, which is important to us. My one complaint about the room is that it was a 1BR Suite, but the BR and LR were only separated by a short hallway past the bath. No door=no \"private time\". The lobby and common areas were well-decorated and clean, and the pool room was pretty neat, with an arched roof. The pool itself was clean and didn't burn your nose with chlorine smell, but I thought it was a little too warm -- it still felt warm even after you'd been in for a few minutes. The manager's reception was pretty good the one night we ate there -- BBQ pork & chicken, potatoes, green beans, cans of beer or Sam Adams on tap. The kids and I ate well and skipped an expensive dinner downtown. Breakfast was a little disappointing, but only because the breakfast at the Chicago Homewood was extraordinarily good. The Indy breakfast was still better than most. The location is very good, being a couple of blocks from Circle Center Mall and Lucas Oil Stadium. We were even able to walk to the zoo, which saved on parking, but if it had been any hotter I'd have probably payed for the parking. Also, it's located on the same block as several bars; once the kids were ready for bed my wife and I were able to go across the street to the Claddaugh Irish bar for some time alone.", "Date": "August 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evansville, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "IndianaKris", "ReviewID": "UR18479676", "Content": "The young man at the front desk when we checked in was not friendly at all and looked at the clock and then seemed to reluctantly look to see if our room was ready. It was two and check-in is listed at four, but most hotels will let you check in a little early. And being in downtown Indy we were really wanting to just park our car and do a little shopping. He said our room was not available and was not very helpful in explaining parking, etc. Fortunately a great lady from the back came running forward and told him he could switch us with another room and we could check in right away. He might have been new. But he did not seem happy at all with our being there at two. The room was gorgeous. The beds are amazing. The suite is huge with a full kitchen, a living area with a flat screen tv. This is a building renovated from two old warehouses and still has much of the charm from the old building with huge ceilings. We were going to a concert to see Neil Diamond at Conseco and this hotel was just a very short walk to Conseco. It is also a very short walk to the downtown Center City Mall. There are many restaurants near the hotel but also many bars. There are homeless people around this area often. But you feel very safe inside the hotel. They have an amazing evening reception during the week. This is really a full meal with salad, and entree, a vegetable, hot cookies, etc. They serve wine and beer with this or lemonade. Victor was amazing. He brought cookies to us right from the oven. We had sweet-n-sour chicken that night. Some nights they even have beef wellington. They also have a very nice hot breakfast in the morning. Victor was so nice and truly seemed to love his job. Parking is either valet or self-park at the Union Station parking garage just about a block from the hotel. It is not included with the room rate. If you self park it is 18.00. I think the valet service is 22.00. This location was perfect for our concert. And the staff, except for the first young man were all so great. The valets, housekeeping, etc, were all very, very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel. They also have a nice heated indoor pool.

The hotel is easy to get to from the interstate and we used the painless $22 in/out valet parking. The location was a couple of blocks from our marathon starting corral.

Two 16x9 TVs, a full kitchen, dining area, comfy beds, free internet, 2 phones, hide-a-bed, and a huge bathroom with quality fixtures. Every part of this room was fresh, clean and in great shape. The complimentary breakfast was great - they even opened it earlier than usual Saturday to accomodate the pre-dawn marathon participant guests! They were short on silverware and glassware due to the high number of hungry runners that descended on them, but they were washing and restocking as fast as humanly possible. The Old Spaghetti Factory is directly across the street - a solid, inexpensive family Italian restaurant chain. Try the Mizithra Cheese with Browned Butter pasta for a delicious carbo load the night before a long run. The only negative thing I can say about this property is that the wait for the elevator was long during check in and check out. This would not be any problem at all when their typical long term customers are in the majority, but when the rooms are full of weekend event goers, there can be a wait.
