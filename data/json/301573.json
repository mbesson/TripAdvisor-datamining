Room was smaller than other ones we have stayed in on previous visits, and had twin beds, not a double. Bathroom was a bit tired. Internet was included in the room rate, but only by buying it and then having this taken off the bill - strange system! At least it was a fast connection. Otherwise all the usual room facilities, including iron (useful) and Nespresso machine. Club lounge is good as the reception downstairs was very crowded with a convention underway.

However the Reception staff were very obliging and we were able to get into our room early and refresh ourselves before taking a trip out to the Zoo. The hotel is in a great position overlooking the Harbour and is placed next to a shopping centre which incorporates lots of restaurants, food halls, bars and of course shops. The centre can be reached via a walkway on the second floor of the hotel. We found Singapore extremely expensive, for everything. Eating out was very pricey, but having said that we had a lovely meal at a restaurant belonging to the adjacent Fairmont. The dinner was a buffet affair with foods from around the world. However the cost was approximately AUD80 per head and although the food was good, you would be very pushed to eat enough food to justify that cost. Drinks in our hotel bar were also very expensive, AUD14.00 for a weak Gin and Tonic. My husband was able to take advantage of a two for one offer on a beer, the beer was about AUD11.00 so as you can imagine eating or drinking out in Singapore is not for the faint hearted or for those on a strict budget. Our breakfasts which again were excellent but not included in our tariff cost AUD45.00 per head (expensive by anyone's standards) and because the cafes in the shopping centre did not open until about 11.00am each morning there really was not much choice but to eat in the hotel. Our room was spotlessly clean and was very comfortable, we also had a spectacular view. However, as other reviewers have commented, the bathroom and certain aspects of the room were very tired. The bathroom really needs updating when compared with hotels rooms of similar cost around the World. It was very clean, but the shower/bath tap configuration was difficult to work out and quite old fashioned. Overall we did enjoy our brief stay in Singapore very much and could not praise the hotel's staff enough, they were very attentive and it is the staff that make this hotel.

To be fair, the hotel is priced accordingly for what you get and it is part of a complex including the Fairmount Hotel and a large shopping center. It is also fairly close to Changi, so used by overnight connecting travelers plus huge numbers of Qantas crews. When I was there I noted at least 40 Qantas crews trying to check into the \"crews only\" area. They were clogging the lobby making the lobby resemble a airport check in hall or a busy train or bus station. It was really uncomfortable. All this makes for a really busy place. The lobby is loud, disorganized, baggage stacked everywhere to a point I thought it was part of the airport baggage operation. There were several staff members doing their best to help guests, but the noise level is so loud that it was hard to hear the staff member to check me in. The room I was given was OK, close to the elevation and normal size. All include an iron and board and the internet connection was acceptable.

I spit it out immediately but the horrible taste was not gone until 2 hours later. They sent a replacement but DID NOT APOLOGIZE. 3) The spa was free. But the treatments were seriously overpriced. So if you want a proper spa treatment , i.e facial or message., go somewhere else. There was a naked woman walking around in the spa, which makes people really uncomfortable. I am not sure if she was a hotel guest. She may be the member of the spa? 4) The housekeeping staffs are really friendly and polite. But the receptionists at the front desks and the staffs answering the phones are not as friendly. A bit smile will make a big difference! I will stay in this hotel again end April and early May.

The pool area was surprisingly nice, there were always plenty of chairs available and the staff there were very attentive and came around with cold towels and a complimentary glass of juice every now and then. The gym was well equipped and had a nice atmosphere with quality exercise equipment. We didn't dine at the hotel but instead used the food court in the mall attached to the hotel which catered perfectly to our needs.

There was nowhere to place a handtowel for example.

I was amazed to return to find that it was exactly how I left it....still stuck in a time warp. The lobby is large and well lit with natural light but incredibly busy all day long and the bell staff seem to enjoy cordoning off areas to dump huge amounts of luggage visible for all to see. I know I personally would not want my suitcases on display in such a manner where someone could rather easily snatch it. The front desk staff were efficient however not especially helpful or friendly however they did get the job done. The rooms I found to be very old. I unfortunately did not get a particularly high up floor (I was on level 21) and I was overlooking the Fairmont and pool area. But there was a large balcony which was pleasant enough to stand out in (but alas no seats out here to enjoy the views). The furniture was ancient with marks and scratches all over. The beds were comfortable however but my white bed sheets had really seen better days with stains all over them. The bathroom is in need of serious upgrading however and both my shower and sink took a long time to drain. I also found it incredibly irritating that there were no easily accessible power plugs near the beds to plug in my laptop. I did not use the Wifi as it was rather expensive and I could have received free wifi in the lobby. The thing that really irked me about this hotel was the lift waiting times. With 6 lifts serving my half of the building I would have expected a maximum wait of 60 seconds but so many times I found myself standing for up to 3 or 4 minutes waiting for a lift, even from the lobby up. At one point I arrived in the lift area of the lobby to see a line spilling out around the corner just to get into a lift. The pool area however was a lovely area. Shared with the Fairmont it was large with plenty of options for food. Also the spa underneath the pool area was perfect (although pretty pricey). Also the gym contained all the equippment you may need. I decided not to attempt room service or eating in the hotel facilities as the hotel is directly atop a fantastic food hall in the mall. I found a wonderful Dim Sum restaurant underneath which I ate in most days for lunch and ventured out for dinner most evenings. All in all there is a lot of potential in this hotel however I feel it is just too big. Great if you have a room with a view but if you dont, then there is not much to write home about.

Its quite an experience to stand in the balcony- every room has one- and soak up the night view of the city and harbor .Hotel shares its healthclub ( Willow spa) with another hotel situated on the adjacent building. The view from the restaurants on 70th floor is quite stunning. Raffles city mall, which is right next to the Hotel, has quite an excellent food court ,as well as a 24 hour Mc Donalds. Found the breakfast/lunch options in the mall to be far more attractive than restaurants in hotel. Really a boon if you want to have a late night bite after serious bar hopping. However i found the room size and the interiors to be quite mediocre. Also in-spite of staying for 8 days at a stretch , there were no complimentary drinks or customer service status calls- something they could learn from premium Indian Hotels.

And one from a lot of reasons of it was Swissotel Stamford where we spent 4 beautiful days and nights. 1. Hotel generally The hotel is located in the heart of the Singapore city, nearby from Marina Bay (10 minutes on foot), Singapore Flier, Singapore river, etc. It's really tall 70 floor building, wich you will see from different city places. Hotel has few bars and restautans, 2 pools, tennis courts. In the underground floors there are plenty of shops, fastfoods, and food supermarket. 2. Check-in and room We checked-in about 19-20p.m. and there wasnt any problem with it. We get standard room on the 61th floor with view opposite to Marina Bay (it's view to pools and Carlton hotel). Room with view to Bay was extra $50 per night, we refused it. If you will get the same side room I'd like advice asking floor as high as possible. Higher floor is better because building next to hotel (you can see on photo) about 50 floor and it worsen city view. Besides that building has powerful, huge fans on the roof, wich we heard even on 61th floor balcony (not inside room). The room was very comfortable, but standard, with no luxury. AC, TV, big balcony, bath, big wardrobe, etc. Internet in the room was too expensive, as usually. 3. Food and restaurants We liked breakfast in hotel, it was delicious, varied, always fresh and abundant. There was always fresh fruits, hot backery, egg station, different types of national cousine. Also we've been in Equinox restaurant on the 70th floor, and it was amazing! Fantastic view to the city, exquisite dishes, attentive staff, it was adorably! 4. Pools and amenities In this hotel there are tennis courts and two round pools (you can see them on photo). Pools belong not only to Swissotel but also to hotel in the next building. I've been there in the morning and I think it was enough spaciously. So we have no bad things in Swissotel and would be glad to come back in this city and this hotel.

The carpet was a little old and tired - clean, but old. The hotel pools are great - a shallow one for kids and a deep one for those who like to swim, the water was cool and the pool surrounds were clean with new furniture. I find the hotel a little expensive but perhaps that is just how things are in Singapore. We were charged for an extra bed in each room plus access to the internet was extra. For me internet access charges are very irritating as access to the internet is not really an extra it is a necessity.

We encountered a minor medical issue on one stay and had to stay an extra night - the hotel helped with changing our flights, extending our room, etc. while we dealt with that. When we got back to the same room, our bags had been brought back up already and we had a message on the phone informing of the new flight details. There is also a hospitality suite which you can use while awaiting your room, or having already checked out due to night time flights so you can grab a cuppa, shower and freshen up before heading to the airport.

The Executive Lounge which we had access to was relatively pleasant to have afternoon tea/coffee in, and had a nearly 360-degree view of the city. Our room on the 57th floor offered a magnificent harbour view, which any guest staying here must insist on. The room was clean and made our sleep quite comfortable.

We hope it was not a long-term cost saving initiative. Some of the room fittings, especially the bathroom had signs of aging, and needed some sprucing up in order to command such premium prices, if we were paying for it. Some of the towels were also stained. WiFi needed additional charges to our disappointment, considering that it should have been part of the premium room rate. Breakfast selection at the Executive Lounge was rather average, and the place felt relatively packed, giving it that non-exclusive atmosphere no different from having breakfast at the coffeehouse downstairs.

As I am not new to this hotel, there were no surprises to me. This is not so good at all. The fact that very little, if anything, changed since my first stay is not really an achievement. This is in terms of hardware, if I may. Rooms are still furnished with old and outdated furniture, bathrooms still relatively small and very average in appearance. I'd really appreciiate a serious renovation. Better sound proof windows and balcony doors would be needed,too. The problem is also with the mobile phone signal quality,both Singtel and M1. Previously I used to stay on higher floors and I blame that fact for the very poor reception and frequent loss of the signal. This time I stayed on the 34th floor and the same thing happened. Although hotel can not be blamed for this, maybe something can be done to enhance signal levels. On the other hand, hotel's staff is fantastic, given the size of the venue. Although front desk personnel sometimes looks inexpirienced and frightened, maybe tired, they manage to give you a cordial smile. Check in and out is ussually smooth. This time I was offered an upgrade to the executive room, but declined due to the fact that offered room is significantly smaller. It is not clear to me what was the advantage of the offered upgrade and after asking the receptionist it was not any clearer. The major problem of this venue is it's size but this obviously will not go. This fact reflects on queues for breakfast, super busy front desk during \"rush hours\", slow wired internet (no wireless yet) difficulties to get the taxi but I am of the impression that personnel is doing well to cope with all this and help patrons feel better. As mentioned in most of the reviews, hotel's location is superb in terms of the access to the underground (MRT) transportation as well as pedestrian, unnderground link to the Suntec Mall, Marina Square Mall with endless shops along the way. Under the hotel is anoother fine but modest mall where one can find all sort of restaurants, eateries, caffes... Very convenient.

Starting with the positives, the hotel is in a top notch location in Singapore, very close to City Hall MTR station and connected to a really good shopping centre. The world famous Raffles Hotel is pretty much across the road. The hotel rooms are very big, the balcony is not worth having as it is so small but the views from our floor were fabulous. During my brief stay there, while I appreciated many aspects of this accommodation, I still felt that some areas were lacking especially in light of the price paid to stay and the five star rating. The first thing I noticed on my way to the room were marks on the corridor walls, the floor looked like it needed to be repainted, the second thing and much more disappointing was the complete lack of tea bags available in the tea/coffee box. It was evident that housekeeping had not bothered to check if there were sufficient supplies remaining after the previous guest and so we had to ring to get some sent up. Little things like this alarm me because it means a routine is not followed when a room is cleaned...I have worked in housekeeping before during college summers!! The following day no hand towels were left for us in the bathroom when I returned after breakfast, again another slip in housekeeping and one requiring another phone call! On one of the nights there we came in late and decided to order room service. We phoned downstairs and the person who took our call was only too pleased to tell us that the room service menu was limited due to kitchen renovations and asked did we not see the letter in our room telling us so? Now we did have a letter from the manager advising us of the limitations in service but we had forgotten about it. To have a member of staff so blatantly happy to point out the error of our ways was disappointing, when our revised choice finally appeared (close to an hour later) the fries were cold! And this is a 5 star... I do have to say that the food at breakfast however was lovely. A final niggle relates to the information book that one finds in every hotel. I was delighted to see a listing of the various international telephone codes one needed to know when phoning outside of Singapore. But to my dismay I could not find Ireland on the list!! I checked under Ireland and checked under Republic of Ireland but could not see it! Am I blind, did I miss it or is it just not included...? I'm still wondering as the letter we received from the manager re the limited food menu had an Irish name on it!! I'm happy to be corrected on this point...!!

And the last disappointment was the fact that none of the rooms have a wifi (how can this be, in a 5-star business hotel?). Pool area is nothing special: one pool for children and one for adults and one pool bar (not in the pool). But the view and the location of the hotel are great! I do recommend this hotel to people who can find a good deal on this hotel, who don't need internet, who want to enjoy the great view and want to stay in the city centre.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLocation Location\u201d", "Author": "AussieFamilyFunHols", "ReviewID": "UR120942787", "Content": "Had stayed at the Stamford when I was younger and wanted to bring my own family back here to stay.

The plus side, is unlimited access to the club lounge for free drinks and snacks all day long and complimentary breakfast too. As it was a leisure weekend, i spend time lazing around the pool, which is packed all the time. Thankfully there are 2 swimming pools here as Swissotel share a common recretional facilities with its sister hotel, Fairmont hotel which is just next door. In fact the gym is located in fairmont hotel, and there is a nice spa here too. Great sauna after a workout in the gym. I had lunch once at the hotel Kopitiam and the singapore chicken rice that i ordered was a big letdown. I also had a Swiss Burger at the hotel lobby lounge, and this was okay. Ordered room service once, beef fried with kuayteow and this is okay too. So, foodwise, it is just okay, nothing to shout about. However, the complimentary food served at the Club floor is much better. I enjoyed the evening snacks during cocktail hours and also the nice breakfast spread. In conclusion, this is a fine hotel to stay during normal times, the location is great, inside a shopping mall, MRT at doorstep. But be prepare to pay more if you come during F1 weekend. But then again, all hotels in Singapore charged a premium price for their rooms too during this week, so if you want to be near the F1 circuit, (Gate 3 entrance is just in front of hotel), and want to have the luxury of watching the race from your room balcony, then Swissotel Stamford is an excellent choice !!", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMiddle of the Road\u201d", "Author": "Peponi", "ReviewID": "UR120604530", "Content": "We visit Singapore once a year and for the past few years have stayed here on the executive floor (60).

Vegetarians have to pretty much make do with an overcooked pasta dish and a salad of leaves. Breakfast bread and pastries come in different shapes but all taste the same and there is nothing to be had that offers the palate a taste or texture sensation of any kind.

This is a nice touch - there are plenty of staff floating around the lobby helping people who are either arriving or go out somewhere and need assistance. The check in very quick and friendly - up to our room in a few minutes. Why do other hotels take so long to check you in? Especially when they have most of your details? Asked for a room on a high floor - great views of the Marina area from the 58th floor! The room was clean, light and comfortable. The only problem we had was with the bathroom. The shower (over the bath) has a small glass door which does nothing much to stop water going all over the bathroom floor. This must be a problem in all rooms, as we came back for one more night after staying a few days on Sentosa. One good feature in the rooms (which other hotels could learn from) was the electrical sockets. By the desk the sockets accept all plugs from around the world. No need for adaptors. They also have a couple of 120w plugs for American tourists. The hotel is in a great central location with malls and MRT underground. We didn't book breakfasts at the hotel as there are plenty of cheap choices downstairs in the mall.

Having read the previous comments I was already alerted to potentially not getting the best room.

The furniture and carpet are very old and there is virtually no sign of being a 5 star hotel in Singapore; there is no charm or \u2018soul\u2019 in the room. Although you I was not staying in the room often I wish to return to a comfortable environment at the end of the day. The size for a Junior Suite is acceptable however considering the old d\u00e9cor I would have preferred a smaller room but refurbished. Bathroom is extremely small and the shower has no hand held shower head. Wifi is not available in the room and the wired connection is chargeable. Minibar was not refilled during my entire stay, in fact when I arrived I found half a bottle of whiskey in it. View is great and with two balconies it offer great views on major landmarks. Check in was very impersonalized and slow. I had to queue for about 5 minutes until it was my turn. Early check in was requested and granted. Thank you. Lobby is extremely busy and the tour busses and massive amount of people do not make you feel welcome. All in all a good hotel to stay in if you are on business and expect a four star service and accommodation. The worst experience however was Room Service. The quality of food is very poor and the presentation is not appealing at all and for that the value is not there. I did not bother to go to one of the many restaurants. For a single business traveler Room Service is very important; a bite at the end of the day while doing some more work until late night from the room does not allow many people to go out and therefore Room Service becomes the only option.

There doesn't seem to be a direct way to get a hold of the concierge to get advice or service and the telephone never gets picked up when calling the operator. The two biggest issues I had were the ridiculous prices for internet service ($180 per week) and they still use the old card in door system which doesn't work. So every day I had to stand on line for 15 minutes to get a card replaced and be told I carried the card in the wrong place (obviously, blame the guests!).

Two separate lift shafts (one for Levels 1-39, and a separate lift for levels 40-70) ensures you are never waiting too long for a lift. In fact, the longest wait I had was only about a minute.

I never saw another sole whilst walking to my room from the lift. Rooms are very large and offer large flat screen TV, good work desk and ergonomic chair.

There is a pool, gym, tennis courts and several bars/restaurants but I unfortunately didn't get time to sample any of these. I had room service breakfast each morning due to time constraints, but would praise the promptness and quality of food. Only problem is you have to choose between fruit or fruit juice.

On arrival at the hotel by coach early in the morning after our long flight our room was ready which was a real bonus. First impressions were great especially when we saw the amazing view from our balcony and the well-appointed, smart room. We ventured down to the fantastic shopping centre under the hotel and popped over to Raffles for a Singapore Sling. That afternoon there was a thrilling lightning storm that went on for hours which added to the exciting tropical atmosphere. The following morning we received a friendly greeting from the girl at the hotel's SwissCaf\u00e9 where we had a tasty breakfast with lots of choice and good quality food. The hotel is ideally located for sightseeing and that morning we headed first to the Botanic Gardens where we walked through the beautiful orchid garden and then past Little India to the Merlion, Singapore's symbol. From here we could see some of the city's newest developments in Marina Bay. We then went to the Thian Hock Keng temple in Chinatown before heading back to Raffles for the afternoon tea which was great. Back at the Swissotel Stamford we had a drink at the New Asia bar on the 71st floor which was a bit pricey but well worth it for the views of the amazing city as the lights came on.

Pros - Check in was quick despite the sea of people swarming the lobby area. The rooms were large and still had ample space even after fitting in a baby cot. There is a balcony for you to enjoy the view. The children's pool area was large enough which brought my kid immense joy. Gym, although not state of the art, was complete and provided towels. Hotel was right next to an MRT (rail transit) station and malls aplenty. Apparently there are some really nice restaurants and bars in the hotel but we didn't get the chance to give it a try as we were out most of the time. Perhaps the one most worthy of mention would be the hotel having really friendly staff. Always smiling, helpful and ready to strike up a conversation with you. Cons - Despite the size of the room, at this price, you would have expected a much \"newer\" looking room. The furniture, the finishing, the deco were all still very much trapped in the 80's. The lobby was almost always packed with people. If you were planning to just chill by the cafe hoping for some peace and quiet, don't bother. Lastly, and possibly also the most frustrating part of this experience was NO COMPLIMENTARY PARKING. We either choose to park the car below the mall at an hourly rate (chargeable 24 hrs) or pay SGD25 (multiple entry per day) for valet services. I think that is very unfair to your driving guest. I was informed that an agreement has not been reached between the parking operators and the hotel management. Fair enough, but get your valet to charge your in-house guest at a cheaper rate. I paid SGD50 to park my car in a hotel I was paying to stay in. That's absurd. So, will I come back again? If I was driving, a BIG NO.

However, Equinox confirms the old adage: the higher the restaurant, the worse the food. I was there with a party of colleagues and customers and not one of us truly enjoyed our meals. The menu is full of all the current chef cliches (avoid any restaurant that used the words \"jus\" or \"foam\") and almost seems deliberately designed to be off-putting. The main courses always have dubious sounding ideas and ingredients alongside the protein. The truth is that Equinox is an over-priced pretentious restaurant where the chef clearly has no self-control and no-one dares to give him production or guidelines. Chewy duck, soggy potatoes and snooty service. I took the same group to the Newton Food Centre the next evening and for a tiny fraction of the cost we had unpretentious, beautifully cooked food served friendly and fast. The other issue with Equinox is that the restaurant is part of the \"Equinox Complex\" which also includes a nightclub. If you don't get to the restaurant before the nightclub opens, you may accidentally find yourself in a line of young adults waiting to get into the nightclub, not the restaurant. NOT a very friendly or easy-to-navigate system. All of which is a great shame, because the rest of the hotel is first class. From the very friendy greetings by lobby staff, to well-furnished and comfortable rooms, the Stamford is a worthwhile option. The Cafe Swiss provides a copious breakfast buffet with very friendly and efficient service.

I was disappointed. I consider myself pretty easy going when it comes to hotels, provided they are clean and safe I'm usually ok, but for some reason I was just unsatisfied with the Swissotel The Stamford. Perhaps it was because prior to Singapore I had been in Thailand where I had experienced twice the quality (and service) at half the price, but in this instance, Swissotel The Stamford fell short. Don't get me wrong, there were good points - a wonderfully comfortable bed with silky, soft linen and lush pillows, there's an incredible view of Singapore from the balcony and the hotel is located centrally above the City Hall MRT station, but the decor was very worn, and I would say that they are well overdue for a refurbishment. My main issue was with the bathroom - whilst having a shower, the water would not drain properly so that you would be standing ankle-deep in water - not ideal. To flush the toilet, I would have to lean my full body weight on the button in order to get the strength required for the button to be pressed - completely unacceptable. You could also hear the people upstairs when they flushed their toilet or ran their water. On one evening we asked downstairs at the bar if we could have a cup of milk to go with the coffee upstairs and we were advised that they 'didn't do that' - I would have expected this to be a very small ask. Whilst there were the standard amenities in the room (coffee and tea, iron, ironing board, slippers and robes, in-room safe etc), and everything was presented nicely, I found the rooms to be very worn and in desperate need of an update, and for the price paid and the advertised standard of property, the issues experienced should not have occurred - I would have expected issues such as these in a three star property but not a property ranked as five star.

Located in the heart of Singapore with a subway station (MRT), shopping mall / foodcourts and a supermarket below, we couldn't be happier. Taxi from Changi Airport cost around $14. But getting around on the MRT was easy and saved us time and money once we got our 3 day MRT pass. We took a taxi a few times, but the traffic was proving to be a hassle since we only had a few days and wanted to see as much as possible. Thank goodness the signs are in english, after a wk in Vietnam we were happy to travel alone with confidence. Chinatown, National Museum, Vivo City, Suntec Plaza and Orchard Rd all via MRT. Check-in was quick and we found ourselves looking at the best view on the 44th flr. We have visited/compared other hotels when we arrived and agreed our harbour view is a must if you want to see the old and new contrast of the Singapore skyline and it's river. The magic happens when you return in the evening after shopping or sightseeing and see all the lights displayed outside your balcony....WOW! The laser/light show from Marina Bay Sands, the colours from the Flyer and the Fullerton hotel bridge by the river was unbelievable. The famous Raffles hotel was just next door and we walked over to visit it's museum and meet their celebrity doorman before trying the sling too. Our room decor is dated and needs serious upgrades, free wi-fi in the lobby area, the bathroom can use a makeover too, however we were in Singapore to explore and found our room suitable for the short visit. The breakfast buffet was amazing, a good selection of local and western fares provided enough choices for everyone along with their exotic fruits to sample. Each staff member we encountered during our 4 days were ready to help us with any questions we had. The bar/lounge on the 70th flr was amazing during thier happy hours, great views again!!! If you want convienence and don't mind the dated room, you found the right hotel while in Singapore.

Perhaps being spoilt rotten for the last week on the executive floors next door at the fairmont, I am a little dissapointed with our move to the Stamford for the final two nights of our stay in Singapore. It is not all bad though, our checkin was super smooth, concierge transferred our bags from the fairmont and even though we had only booked a 'harbour view room' I think the fairmont may have had a word to them prior and was pleasantly suprised to recieve an upgrade to the executive floors 57-60 - great view, although a little uneasy at times when looking out on the balcony at the sheer height. On arrival to our room, one could not help notice the heat in the corridors - very uncomfortable (perhaps the aircon is broken). I am trying hard not to compare the two hotels but the decor in the stamford is inferior to next door and has a 'upmarket 70's porn set' feel to it, a lot of carpet everywhere capped off with wallpaper. The beds are super firm and the bathroom is very small - couldn't swing a cat !! There is a combined shower in the bathtub with a steep step up into it (not good if you have mobility problems) and more so getting out - no hand rail for support. Free wifi in the room and great coffee machine. The club lounge on level 60 had some outstanding desserts (hubby smashed the waffle cones). the hot canapes were average and the cold selection was so-so. The lounge was ok, once again trying not to compare with the Fairmont but was not a patch on theirs - even though they are sister properties. The staff in the lounge were very friendly, professional and not intrusive. All staff I have encountered so far have also been very professional - so kudos to management for good staff training and selection. We had room service last night, and was impressed with the timely delivery along with the quality and portion size for the price. Went to breakfast on level 2 half hour after they opened and few items were still not out. A manager asked me if everything was ok and I said no, I asked when the buffet would be fully set and he said what is missing - I said there are no waffles, pancakes along with missing indian bread - he replied that someone will be there soon. As there was ample of other goodies to choose from it didn't bother me too much, but would like to note that by the time we had finished, the waffles and pancake chef was still not there - some 45min into breakfast service. Perhaps they do not think 'the early birds' want that so early in the morning ! At the end of the day, whilst this is a 5* property, I feel that the main selling point of the property is the location, being right above a great shopping mall and MRT station it doesn't get any better for getting around Singapore.

Basically, if you don't have enough choices you are the type of person who will never be satisfied! - A gentle Singaporean walking speed will have you at the boat quay in 10 minutes or less, an extra 5 minutes will see you in the redeveloped Clarke Quay area with its many drinking, eating and retail options.

We had high expectations given the positive reviews on this site and the fact the this hotel cannot be missed in singapore. The pros and cons below : Pros : 1) Excellent location right at the metro 2) Amazing view from the top floor resturant 3) Shopping mall next door Cons : 1) After a long flight we arrived at 7 in the evening and were told that the rooms are not ready. Infact, the people at the reception started to argue despite knowing its a mistake on their part 2) We had specifically requested for a non-smoking and high floor and again it was not alloted. Again the lady at the reception did not even acknowledge our mail and in a way hinted that we were lying 3) The layout of the room is quite outdated. I know its an old hotel but its just not maintained. The rooms just do not have a refreshing feel. Definately not 5 star 4) The lifts had smelling and dirty mats all the time 5) There was always too much rush/luggage at the reception 6) Also I thought there was preference given the guests staying at an higher category rooms. They do not bother if you are in the base category (There was racial discrimination to an certain extent also) 7) Quality of house keeping/room service not up to the mark 8) Much more expensive in comparison to its peers After coming back to India we filled in a feedback form and to our surprise the manager from the hotel called us up to get more details. There are so many better options in Singapore (Pan pacific, marina mandarin etc). No reason to choose this one. OLD IS NOT GOLD !

All three trips have been for a different purpose. First was for our company conference, the second last year was for a holiday with my family and this time was for a 3-day business trip enroute to our annual conference in Bintan, Indonesia. On my holiday last year, my wife and i were accompanied by our 2 young kids, both under 5, and my father who is in his 70s. We were overwhelmed by the warmth and the thoughtful service that the folks at the hotel extended us. Help was always at hand and the smiles all seemed genuine. For the current trip, although our travel agent had got me better deals from other 4/5 star hotels like Hilton etc, my experience from the previous ocassions swung the decision in favour of Swissotel Stamford. I did not regret the decision. Amongst the host of other reasons, the two reasons i recommend the Swissotel Stamford to my friends and colleagues is the outstanding Service and the excellent Location. The hotel sits bang in the middle of the shopping, leisure and Business districts. with kids we did not realise how good the location was as i we did not walk much and took a taxi for most excursions. However, this time since it wasn't a particularly busy schedule and we walked for a lot of the meetings and for leisure visits. We walked to Marina bay Sands, Suntec, Clarke Quay, Orchard road with breaking into a sweat. These places are a comfortable 5-15 mins walk from the hotel. On the other hand the lobby and the entrance aren't quite as grand as some of the other Hotels in this same range and the breafast buffet spread isn't as generous as some others offer. but then on working visits neither of these are deciding factors for me. Although as a return guest, i would have liked some feel-good personalised gesture from the hotel. Also, another reviewer had mentioned that guests are charged for using of health club facilities. This is not true. My colleagues and i used the gym and the Sauna/Steam rooms daily with no extra charge. The Spa Willow Streams was quite good with polite and friendly staff. The Pool and Spa are shared with the Fairmont hotel next door.

The view from our Grand room was spectacular. We had two balconies, one overlooking Marina Bay and the other, east across the city outskirts, toward Changi Airport. The hotel is located above a shopping centre and MRT station, so everything you need is at your fingertips. It was a short walk to Boat Quay, Marina Bay and to the bottom end of Orchard Road. The Singapore Attrcations Express will pick you up and drop you off at the hotel door for the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. We spent a few early evenings at Introbar, enjoying \"happy hour\" (which is from 3pm to 9pm) half price drinks befor heading out to dinner. We had room service on our last night while we packed and it was delicious, hot and delivered quickly. There is a great selection of restaurants to choose room service from, catering to all tastes. We also went to the night club on the 70th floor, New Asia. The view up there is amazing, music is great, drinks are a bit expensive (even for Singapore), but its worth it! The only problem we had was with the hot water in our room. We generally had to run it for 3-5 minutes to get it hot. We complained twice, the first time they sent someone up, who just ran the water until it was hot. The second time we waited to be called back, then ran the water ourselves, showered and went to bed - turning on the \"privacy please\" light. When we woke the next morning there was a note under the door saying they had called to fix it but had observed our request for privacy. We mentioned all of this at check out and the staff member (who turned out the be the manager) was not impressed and was very apologetic, offering her card for us to contact her should we want to stay again.

It is right above Raffles City shopping centre and a nice food court, and just a very short walk away from Marina Bay, the Singapore Flyer, Chinatown, Hawker centers, plenty of restaurants and other amenities. It is right above two intersecting train lines, with most attractions (eg Orchard Rd) being just a few stops away. We stayed 6 nights. We checked in around 10pm the first night and were told there were no renovated rooms left. Tip: email them in advance to request a renovated room. They said we could ask for a renovated room the next day when other guests had checked out. We did and were transferred into a better, renovated room. The level 13 unrenovated room we had on the first night was quite good. Plenty of space and mostly clean. I had a bath, however, and when I lowered my head I was disappointed to see a lot of black mould on the underside of the soap dish and a lot of black stains in the tile grout. The level 44 renovated room was much better. Very roomy, even better view and the tile grout was clean in the bathroom. There were some nice touches, such as scales in the bathroom and a mini bath fizz tablet. The beds in both rooms were comfortable but a little too firm for my liking. Apparently it is customary in Singapore not to use top sheets. Instead there was an all-in-one duvet. Housekeeping promptly supplied an extra blanket when I requested one. The service was good. We needed an overseas electrical adaptor which the hotel lent us with no dramas. The front counter staff were courteous. The concierge gave us concise and accurate directions. It was great having the asia bar on the 71st floor at our disposal. We discovered they sell most cocktails for sg$12 until 9pm nightly.

Bed and little couch were very comfortable. Disappointed no wireless internet and the leads for the internet were a bit temperamental, sellotaped to wall with masking tape. Room smelt a bit stale and must have been a smoking room at some stage as can still smell it a bit, but they do come and spray your room every day. Room also very cold which you cannot adjust if you are out all day as you need the room card in to adjust temperature. And carpet dated and stained. Also the shower door allows water all over the bathroom floor, we often had a facecloth to try and block some of the water otherwise your bathmat always ended up saturated. Executive Lounge was fantastic, food was excellent - both breakfast and evening drinks and nibbles- although disappointed once again with the overpowering smell of cigarettes, which is not always the nicest smell first thing in the morning. Staff in Executive Lounge always very friendly and helpful. We only discovered Cafe Swiss only in the last few days of our stay and once again the food and service was fantastic, disappointed we were not aware of this earlier in our stay. When we checked in the Front desk very quickly went over breakfast and the hours and Executive Lounge, this needs to be more explicit - have something in the room detailing the hours and usage of staying in Executive Lounge. We didn't realise we also had use of Cafe Swiss - we had to ask! Cleaners were excellent, very friendly and often gave us extra water which was fantastic. Pool area was nice but often very crowded with people leaving towels on the loungers but not returning, so we didn't often have a chance to use the loungers. I think there should be some sort of rule to not be able to reserve loungers if you are not going to be there for more than 20 minutes. Spa was fantastic, very relaxing - the steam room was very hot! Gym was great, well equipped although disappointed the yoga was so expensive - so didn't try it out. Went up to Equinox floor on last evening, but bars air conditioning was very cold and music very loud, disappointed we couldn't have a drink in the restaurant next to it without having food, as much more pleasant to have a relaxing drink - we ended up heading next door for a drink at Long Bar in Raffels - which was fantastic.

This is a very busy hotel. The operator is clueless when I requested their help to retrieve my voicemail as the password wasn't working. I gave up after they failed to help me the fourth time I rang them in 12 hours! And some front office staff are also misinformed or clueless about how to retrieve my voicemail. They gave me the wrong info but eventually I figured it out. Also room service is terribly slow and moves at a glacial pace. Our bags took 20 minutes to come up to our room. Our wine took 30 mins and they forgot to provide a corkscrew to open the wine. It took them another 30 mins to deliver a bottle opener to the room. Very frustrating. City space bar on the 70th level has lovely night views but cocktails are pricey and are weak. Staff are friendly and accomodating. Even towards an obnoxious Jewish American guy with his Asian girlfriend. He was loud and rude to staff. Constantly complained about the lack of alcohol in his girlfriend's drink. Overall I would stay in that location again but might try the Fairmont. Tip- DO NOT try the Singapore Sling at the long bar at Raffles.

This was a stopover for us on the way to London, 2 nights was just not enough! We had a wonderful stay at the Swissotel. I did plenty of research before booking to ensure that we had the best location, so we could just take the kids and walk to the sites. We certainly saw a lot in our two days! It was perfect and so handy to everything. On arrival we discovered that our crew from our Qantas flight were staying there also which confirmed we had made the right decision. As we were travelling with two children 7 and 11, to cut accommodation costs we booked a room with two beds, which in turn ended up being two double beds and a fold out sofa. This was slightly disappointing as I thought we would have two queen sized beds so the boys could share one and we would have the other. We were up-graded to a balcony room though, so that made up for it as we were on the 36th floor, so the view was awesome. The room was pleasant and clean. Not overly flash but we were in Singapore to see as much as we could, not hang out in the hotel room!! One thing I definitely wanted included on our stay was breakfast. WOW was this worth it! We all found the Cafe Swiss fantastic, with the most amazing selection of standard breakfast items and included Japanese, Italian and just about anything else you could think of......as well as fruit we had never seen before and enjoyed tasting!!! The kids were in heaven...and well so were we!!! I found the staff very helpful and with children, who are very gorgeous, I found we got treated very well, if not spoilt, everywhere we went! They went out of there way to make sure we enjoyed our stay. We woke up the next morning a went to the information desk, bought tickets to Universal Studios and we were off!!! What a totally thrilling, exhausting day that was! All in all we loved Singapore and the Swissotel. The only comment I could make is to ask for extra bottles of water if there are more than two staying in a room.

The obnoxious aroma was further enhanced by what appeared to be rather poor drainage in the bathroom. Another curiosity was the desk and computer support in the room.

No doubt about that but for a chain that want to be five star they have a fair bit to go. I would say a 4 star hotel low 4 star. Some rooms need renovation and they desperately need to do something about their overcrowded and chaotic reception area. Separate normal shoppers using their entrance is a good idea to. However Swissotels shortcomings is good for those looking for a special price, since Swissotel frequently have rooms selling for under 200 dollars. Arriving at Swissotel is a scene of chaos. Cars and minibuses parking wildly and disorganised in up to three lanes while dropping off and picking up passengers. No german has organised this we can rest assured of that. Two poor men in nice uniforms dont stand a chance to keep track of 20 cars despite really trying their utmost. This is the same at virtually any time outside the entrance and almost comical at times. I would suggest anyone thats looking for a taxi to walk to the right from the hotel entrance. 20 meter down that road is a regular Taxi stand. If you ask for help from the poor men working for Swissotel they tend to be busy serving the crowds and you are made to wait. The crowd isn't usually hotelguests but instead customers that's visited Raffles shopping mall and using Swissotels entrance. (Something the hotel seriously need to fix I dont like seeing 8 shoppers get service while me, a paying customer has to wait. And thats not the error from the men working the entrance thats management. Checking in is also rather chaotic. Always busy and they have one or two ladies with mics trying to make it smoother and form a queue from the sea of people otherwise waiting adhoc. Thats good, without them frustration would be tenfold. people always try to pass this queue and form their own line but the ladies are fast onto these queue-jumpers. One might ask if this couldn't be done better though? I mean its solvable at other hotels so why not at Swissotel? Separate line for check in and check out. separate places even better, many solutions to this definately and management needs to wake up and fix it. The rooms in themselves are ok. After 22 i think you need a card to get into the elevator room. good because crowds going to the roofbar are big and they dont stay in the hotel. Some more security on this would be appreciated I had a group of harmless drunk Asian women laughing outside my hotel going up in the elevator trying to get up to the bar using those elevators only to realise that didnt work... Flat screen TV, decent bathrooms. however my bathroom and I have stayed there twice the last month have shown some brown where the sink in the bathtub is and the wooden door has been rather old. Also they do lack some TV channels their competitor have. Football channel for instance for us premier league fans. Dont remember if they had a childrens channel. (their offering is the usual Murdoch Hotel deal, not good, not bad. Apart from that things are fine and hosuekepping is done properly. But WHY oh why do they have a special rule asking us to throw the towels thatw e want changed into the bathtub? All other hotels asks us to put them on the floor. the cleaning lady saw mine on the floor and asked me if i wanted them changed, of course thats why I put them on the floor. Ah Swissotel asks you to put it in the bathtub as shown on a note but i understood you wanted them changed and just double-checked with you. Good housekeeping, very professional, but towels in the bathtub is plain stupid. Can even end up being smelly and extra damp and this for a change! Makes no sense at all. Concierge and the assistance there is excellent. I have spoken to a larger Chinese lady a few times and she is a miracle. Nothing she cant arrange or find info on. A great help even for businessmen and tourists alike. She knows Singapore. The food at the venue is surprisingly poor. ordered roomservice, had dinner at floor 70? and tried the cafe next to the reception. nothing stands out and to be honest, I wouldn't eat at any place in the hotel unless I really have to. prices are high and food rather poor. the view from the bar at floor 71 is great though. have a drink enjoy the view. the cafe next door is rather special. they have promo-signs outside for tiger crystal and same in the elevator. When I ordered one they said that promotion ended 2 weeks ago??? i was about to say your problem dont display a sign but thought that the poor girls working in the cafe wont have a clue so I didn't. but come on two week old promo and still signs. Give me a break that's youth hostel class. Check out went smooth, had an issue with an extra payment that the first lady asked for but she immediately went to the supervisor that corrected her mistake. no malicious just an honest mistake and she apologised a 100 times. Thats good. All in all, good location, busy hotel good service but the lobby and food is plain bad. However good sleep and if you get a decent deal by all means stay if not choose another hotel in the same price class. And for business, nah dont even think of it hehe so many places where quality is far superior. Overall if a decent rate ill stay there or i want to walk to raffles, Suntec or just enjoy the cricket club. Apart from that i would probably choose a better venue.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "Loulabell_10", "ReviewID": "UR101833154", "Content": "Swissotel The Stamford, Singapore hotel is a standard five star hotel, what makes this hotel exceptional is the location.

But the killer for me was the 1) cost of the internet ($20+ USD) for 24 hours, 2) it's ridiculous low speed, and 3) it being an ethernet connection and not a wireless connection (although fwiw - if I could have gotten my computer to properly share this connection over the airport, I would have preferred this).

The staff really are wonderful, from the reception clerk who was still cheerful when checking us in at 1am, to the chatty room service staff, the chirpy doorman, and so on.

The only slightly negative note was that we found the beds a little firmer than we are used to, but it wasn't a \"show-stopper\" by any means, we still slept OK.

This meant we had a chance to properly pack our last-minute shopping and to freshen up before going to the airport. Take a bow, Swissotel Stamford staff, you have all done very well.

It could have been a different hotel even though the same rate was paid. My room was some kind of a corner room, much smaller and no chair other than the desk chair which made room service impractical. The carpet was covered in various different stains, two of the speeds were not working on the air conditioning and the shower pressure was dreadful. This hotel has over a thousand rooms and although the rooms are decorated the same in neutral colours and similar furnishings it is a bit of lottery as to the size and servicability of the room. There are lots of bars and restaurant outlets in the hotel and the service in these is excellent as is the overall quality. Not cheap though especially with the rate of exchange at the moment. I love Prego, the Italian on the ground floor and Cafe Swiss on the first floor. The Equinox complex on the 70th floor is sublime but the restaurant in there is EXTREMELY expensive and the portions are ridiculously small. Someone should explain to them that nouvelle cuisine went out a long time ago. Reception staff are very efficient but not always friendly. The swimming pool area is very pleasant and clean and the gym and spa are excellent though spa prices are very high and sometimes you are left waiting for an unsatisfactory length of time as you wait for your treatment.

I found myself in the Lobby Coffee shop a number of times quite simply because the staff were so attentive that I was only too pleased to sit down and relax there. I never tried the other restaurants, though I did venture up to the bar/night club on the 70th floor, and whilst it was less than half full, I enjoyed my couple of beers. The rooms were very comfortable, everything worked, and for a hotel with 70 floors, the elevators seemed to work very well. One tip to share with viewers: the mini bar prices are as high as the bar/night club I visitied in the hotel.

Walking into our spacious twin bedroom facing the amazing view of the Singapore skyline overlooking Clarke Quay and Boat Quay as dusk descended, was quite exhilarating. The room was quite large and even with laptops, working paper and other paraphernalia strewn around by us, it did not look cluttered. The toilet was spotlessly clean but could do with a face lift. The balcony facing the The World was the most impressive (and well used by us) feature. The bed linen was also extremely comfortable. We had no idea that this well appointed hotel stands above the bustling City Hall mall and MRT interchange and it was a quick MRT ride to our business destinations. We also did a bit of sight seeing around the hotel with the wonderfully restored Chijmes complex which is an old orphanage converted into a trendy shopping destination with delightful bistro cafes. The Merlion park and Theatres on the bay are walking distance away (if you are brave enough to face the humidity and sudden torrential rain) as are the magnificent Raffles Hotel. A short MRT ride will take you to the other must see destinations close by - Clarke Quay, Boat Quay and Arab street. The Holy Grail for shopaholics, Orchard road is also 5 mins by MRT. The hotel has an impressive buffet breakfast. We did not have much time for a dip in the pool but it looked welcoming. There is a nice lounge bar where we had a relaxing sun-downer on a couple of occasions. We did not try the lunch or dinner at the restaurant because there were so many alternatives very close by. Service is very professional without being intrusive. We did not order room service but going by the standards of the other services am quite sure this will be upto scratch.

We had a 4 night stay here on this occasion and I have never been disappointed with this hotel as the rooms are spacious, the beds are comfy, the view is amazing and the location is just perfect. I am a smoker but I will not smoke indoors or in an enclosed space, so the small balcony was great as I was able to indulge my bad habit without contaminating the room,and I never tired of watching life going on 40 plus stories below. In an ideal world the balcony would be a litle bit wider with a comfy chair to lounge in. In a hotel as large as this I don't expect the sort of personal attention you would receive at smaller capacity hotels such as The Raffles or The St Regis. However on this occasion I was pleasantly surprised and very much appreciated the lovely birthday cake that was delivered to our room by the delightful Christine (Concierge/Guest Services). I found all the staff helpful and friendly especially the reception staff but also the cleaning and Room Service staff. I find if you are kind and friendly to people.....more often than not, they respond in kind - a smile and a polite and friendly greeting costs nothing. I have seen some negative comments on here regarding the breakfast. Sure its a lot of money; as is any breakfast in any hotel if it is not included in the room rate. Personally i loved the breakfasts. There is a huge variety to suit all cultures. I thought the bacon was tasty if a little overcooked at times. I would love to get bacon like that here. A couple of the memorable little details I liked: the whole honeycomb - and the Duchy of Cornwall Lemon curd (unavailable here), French butter and the very friendly (they remembered you even after only one day - in a hotel this large that is impressive) and efficient staff performing breakfast service. I cannot comment on other floors or on any of the unrenovated rooms as I always book a harbour view room on a high floor. On this occasion our room was on level 45 room 57. Room 57 on any floor looks directly across to the CBD and Boat Quay. You can see the Marina Bay Sands, the Flyer, Padang etc. This to me was probably the best of views available. This room had the striped carpet that you see in the hotel photographs, all other times I have sayed here the carpet was a plain pastel (I am guessing unrenovated but just as comfortable). I cannot be certain but going by previous stays - If you have a single King bed size room you get a nice armchair to relax in but in twin bed rooms there is no comfy chair as the beds seem to take up most of the room. This hotel is where many airline crews stay on layovers so it is naturally busy all the time. It was especially busy at the time of our stay which coincided with the Qantas A380 engine incident. I do love this hotel and it has become familiar. The routine is to check in to the hotel/room and then go down to the little supermarket in the basement of Raffles City to buy drinks, snacks and milk. If there is one thing (well maybe two) that surprises me is this: There is no milk provided for tea and coffee, only creamer which I don't like. The tea is a very nice TWG brand, however if two people happen to like breakfast tea, someone will be disappointed as only one of each type of tea (4 different) is provided - the other will have to have Earl Grey or one of the green teas. The little mini bar fridge is not as cold as I like, but then I am sure the purpose of the fridge isn't to fill it with my own drink preferences. To chill our wine I just requested a bucket of ice each afternoon.

To start with the positive things: greatest location: right there where one wants to be in Singapore, walking distance to many sites, and literally atop a subway-junction, easy-to-reach to and from everywhere, including direct line from airport. Moreover, the basement just doens`t have a few shops (like most hoteld do) - it is a veritable shopping center in itself. But thats Singapore: a huge mega-mall, with a built-in landing facility called Changi. Not to forget the (truely) stunning views from every room. I got `harbour-side` (apparently there is city side and harbor side, but whatever - every view is stunning. If you got a low-level room (less than 30-something) go and visit the the \"Equinox\" club on the top floor (free access for hotel residents!) - views reach from Malaysia to Indonesia. Now the bad sides: too big, lobby feels like a train station, very impersonal, effiicient but without any charm. The rooms are big too (a great plus) but have a little `character` just as the entire place has none. This is not Singapore (or perhaps: IT IS?) but could be everywhere. The pool for this 1000-plus room hotel is surprizinlgly small, and on top of ot it is shared with the neighboring Fairmont Hotel! To be fair: the `Willow-stream` spa is very perfect again: big (what-else?), but the gym is clean, effecient and even `cozy`.

But after an hour or so waiting, we finally got a room. Their manager(i cant remember his name) was kind enough to apologize whereas the lady didn't even bother apologizing. When i went up the room, i find it really amusing they got my preferred room choice wrong. And so i had to make my way down again and told them i had booked a Grand Room. Took them some time longer to process it. And finally, at 4.40pm, i manage to get in the room. Tired and pissed off, the anniversary dinner that me & my partner had planned was totally ruined.

The service is nearly perfect: - check-in was fast and flawless - the room was even better that what we expected - the house keeping made us welcome, she was friendly, helping and, very honest. We inadvertently forgot some cash on the desk. When the housekeeping lady realized that, she called the supervisor (I guess it is their standard procedure) to inform about this and to count the cash so that if, when we come back something is missing, the security can testify. Interesting, no ? - Check-out was fast and efficient - we used the concierge service to help us to find the address of a restaurant we had booked. She was more than helpful since she not only provided us with the address, the direction and even the floor - we used some other services and it was near perfection Location wise, the hotel is really well situated, just on top of the MRT. It is walking distance from China town, Singapore flyer, Funan electronic mall, Bugis street, Orchard road and even Little India. Nevertheless, I have few comments: - we were at the 63rd floor and we had to wait a quite long time to get hot water in the shower. - Internet was painfully slow. I call the internet hotline. They were quite good and helpful. I have appreciated that they said they will call me back and they really did it!. But they did not succeed in increasing the speed. Therefore I have cancelled my purchase. They have provided me with a cancellation number but I have been charged anyway. Now if we talk about the other facilities, I would recommend the Equinox bar, situated on the top floor. The atmosphere there is nice and friendly and they have good Champagne. And, the view is, for city lovers as us, wonderful. For the restaurant, we have only been to the Jaan and you can read my specific review about it. The Introbar, situated at the ground floor is welcoming, the service is good. But it is on the expensive side so I recommend to go there only during the happy hours (1500-2100 if I am not mistaken). We did not test their breakfast so I cannot comment on that part. My wife has loved their fitness center. She thinks it is one of the best she has ever used, definitely better than the Intercontinental's one. We did not try the swimming pool, but it seems quite nice. Last I want to mention the accessible balcony, which add to your enjoyment of the view Erick", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel & location\u201d", "Author": "iancc", "ReviewID": "UR83669257", "Content": "I stayed 3 nights here and 2 nights at Marina Bay Sands (MBS), as I was attending a conference at the MBS convention centre.

I also noticed previous reviews suggesting a request for a renovated room. Alas, we were told none were available, but were offered an upgrade to a harbour view room on the 62nd floor -spectacular (and even higher than the 49th floor we had at MBS). Yes, the unrenovated rooms are slightly tired, but the old carpet was surprisingly non-sticky or grubby to walk on in bare feet - so I presume they regularly shampoo the carpet (not like many hotels I've stayed at), the bathroom still clean and functional and there is a big flatscreen TV. Free (slowish) cable internet was part of the corporate package, otherwise one can go to Starbucks or McDonalds around the corner. If you don't have to be near orchard Rd then this is a great location; Robinsons dept store downstairs, Funan mall (for IT gear), Raffles Hotel & Bugis St nearby.

There were some flaws with my rooms and stay, so I'll get them out of the way: * Lack of wireless internet in the guestrooms, and similarly insufficient connectivity in the public spaces. This seems terribly backwards in this day and age. * An iPod/iPhone dock for recharging would also have been nice. * Some carpet stains showing sign of premature aging. * All things considered, it was a comfortable, no-frills room without 21st century gadgetry. Any of these issues would have been par for the course in many other cities. But in Singapore, home to some of the best hotels in the world, and standards-setting expectations in all hotel classes, they stand out as being glaring omissions. That all said, this was a *fantastic* hotel for my stay during the 2010 F1 Grand Prix: * Outstanding view of the track: I had an overhead view of the track between Turn 9 and Turn 14, from room 5359, as well as the Padang Stage where the headliner musicians performed. As if that wasn't enough, all of the rooms have balconies from which you can watch the action, hear the sounds, and enjoy the breeze. I believe all of the rooms classifed as \"Marina View\" will provide this, with the optimal angles being from rooms ending in -53 through -59. (See photos) * Absolutely perfect location: Adjacent to Gate 3, and also connected to the MRT stations City Hall and Esplanade, which allowed for easy 2-station transit to the other side of the racetrack. (My seats were in the Pit Grandstand area, at the eastern end.) * More love for the location: The attached shopping center basically puts all the necessary amenities right at the hotel -- Money changer, vendors for prepaid SIM cards, a supermarket, electronics (for the aforementioned iPhone cable), destination-worthy restaurants (Din Tai Fung, for one), and an array of stores for shopping. * Combine the above and you have a room far superior to any hospitality suite at the track: A private space in which to enjoy the race, with your choice of foods and beverages, supported by a capable Room Service team for anything you might need. (In our case, many buckets of ice for champagne.) Service is gracious and outstanding, as expected of such a hotel in Singapore, with the staff in smiles despite the obvious pressure they were under.

We started staying at the Swissotel for its great location and fantastic views. After several dissapointing stays we decided to try the Fairmont (right next door). We thought that we would give it a try again as we were only staying one night this time. We had stayed at the fairmont the week before. We booked a grand room and was allocated a room on the 53rd Floor. Checkin was quite efficient - a big improvement from other times we have stayed. Room was quite large but smelt musty and old. The decor is tired and bathroom small and outdated. The porcelin in the bath/shower was chipped and unattractive. Whilst the views are spectacular the rooms need a thorough update. I know they do have some newer rooms but its really a jackpot as to whether you are allocated one of these. My main complaint was about breakfast. On check - in, I enquired about the start time of breakfast as we had an early flight. We were told they opened at 6am. I was not informed that breakfast was not included in the room rate. It was my mistake, but I thought that I had booked a room with breakfast... When we arrived at breakfast at 6.45am we gave them our room number and we were again not told that breakfast was not included. Whilst we were eating a member of staff arrived with a bill to sign for $90SGD. Now the buffet is quite nice but we were only having muesli and toast as we had an early flight and had to rush. We left the breakfast at 6.55am. So the 10 minute breakfast equated to $9SGD per minute. On check out I queried the breakfast charge and explained that it was not really appropriate to charge such a large amount when we had only had toast and muesli and only stayed 10 minutes. We also were not informed about the charge before we started eating as we would never have eaten there and gone straight to the airport instead. The receptionist who checked us out just stared blankly at me when I informed her of my complaint. She really didnt seem to care, just wanted us out of the hotel. Overall the service has improved in this hotel but some of the rooms are still not worth the money and breakfast is definately not worth the money. We probably wouldnt bother staying in this hotel again and just go back to staying at the Fairmont which has much better service and quality of rooms even if they dont have the same views.

We had several requests for our group, each time the staff seemed disinterested and unfriendly. The room service was incredibly over-priced. You had to pay for internet (it's 2010 !!) again, very expensive. I would not recommend it to other travellers, it is a very expensive hotel, and the staff there seem to see you as a bother, rather than a guest of their establishment. As a regular business traveller to Singapore, I can say there are a lot friendlier and more reasonably priced hotels both in Singapore.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cI will be back\u201d", "Author": "MonsieurHomard", "ReviewID": "UR74466254", "Content": "I only usually stay in this standard of hotel for business trips, as while on holiday the room is just a place to sleep.

The greeter was apologetic, but it was embarrassing for us and the guest who was behind us, and I think entirely unnecessary since there was only a \"queue\" of 1 (us). The experience when we did check in was fantastic: the fellow who served us was aware of our request for a new room (the hotel was undergoing a refurbishment). We were given our room keys and directed to a wonderful room on the 47th floor, which although not new (it was a bit tired) was very spacious. We were more than happy with the outcome. The stay itself was brief (a 2 day stopover on the way home) and would have been otherwise enjoyable if not for an appalling experience trying to print an airline boarding pass. A supervisor (or manager) in the business center wanted us to pay to print out our boarding passes, a very small amount but annoying considering we had already paid for internet access (not cheap at nearly $SG30 per day). Her unwillingness to be helpful AND directing her juniors there not to be helpful lead to an escalation to the duty manager: he solved the issue in 2 minutes flat, but as it was the last contact point we had with the property, it left a poor impression and spoiled what would otherwise be a positive experience. The petty attitude was delivered with the comment \"I am only doing my job\", an outrageous way to defend an incredibly poor attitude as her staff knew what needed to be done and were willing to do it.

We've paid SGD300+++ for a standard room per night but a 3-star rating room & services in return. The frontdesk was always in a mess. No proper queue was advised and the frontdesk staffs were not helpful and friendly indeed. They were not professional, with NO smile and acting SLOWLY! They should not be served as a frontdesk staff in a so-called 5-star hotel ! One of the male frontdesk staff even did not know what a hotel voucher is! He was holding my hotel voucher but he thought it is an air ticket! This is totally ridiculous! We were first being arranged with a room at the 48th floor. The room smells sting, like a smoking room without air-freshing. The furnishings are old and the bathroom shower was dripping. A/C is not working properly! The view is not good (city view) facing a tall building. I can't accept I paid SGD300+ for such a room so I requested to have a room changed. I have also asked if I can upgrade to the Executive room (I don't mind to pay an extra of course) however, the frontdesk manager showed a very annoying face to me and asked another staff to serve me. That staff just leaves me to another staff. Finally she said, she can only transferred me to another room in the same floor and no Executive rooms are available for the whole week! (PS : this is really unbelievable!) Anyway, I was so tired and hungry and I accepted the room changed. But then she asked me to wait for an hour for the room changed. When I came back after 1.5 hours, she asked me to wait for another 15 mins! Luckily, the room after changed got a nice view (facing Singapore flyer and the Esplanade). However, the air con is still not working properly. I turned the air con to HIGH and the lowest degrees, I was still sweating! Furthermore, the hotel staffs (room cleaning/services area) were frequently disturbing while I was in the room. I don't expect they will ring the bell and come in to check the mini-bar! and after 30 mins, another staff rang the bell to ask if you are satisfied with the room. So that means I need to have the \"privacy\" button switched on for 24 hours??? Actually I think the \"mini-bar\" is really important to the hotel otherwise they won't keep on asking you if you have ever used the mini-bar !!!!! Besides, the elevator area (also inside the elevator) is hot. Breakfast was average. At last, the most unacceptable thing is that the hotel charged SGD28 per day for the internet access!

With regret, I must mention that I could not believe how we at our company ended up talking a lot about our different concerns about our stay in this hotel. All 42 of our employees were disappointed. They all had complaints ranging from showers that are leaking at night, employees not knowing basic information about the hotel, about giving out proper directions, dirty carpets, soiled linens on restaurant tables and generally the poor service and lack of effective leadership resulting to disorganization, two of my colleagues even told me they had dinner on a particular restaurant at the hotel where the manager looked as if they weren\u2019t welcome there. After hearing this, I was shocked and was quite thankful nothing bad happened to me so far. But I guess I wasn\u2019t spared because I had an interesting experience of my own. I went for dinner at one of the restaurants inside the hotel. After reading a lot of good reviews about the restaurant, I opted to give it a try. But sadly, my dinner was spoiled because of what happened that night. Never in my life, as a person who works for a Human Resource Management advisory company, have I seen such bad behaviour from a female leader. I\u2019ve observed it myself where the manager \u2013 she just chooses the people she wants to talk to and to my surprise, she even talks badly to one of the employees there. I wanted to intervene the fight she was having with one of the staff but chose not to anyway. I guess it\u2019s just my emphatic nature to help those who are treated badly by others. Unfortunately, with all these complaints, I don\u2019t think we would like to make use of this hotel anymore especially when one of the reasons why me and my colleagues are here is to attend a meeting about human rights of employees with other Human Resource Management advisory companies around the world. Before signing up for this trip to Asia, I didn\u2019t know it was a big issue until I sat on my table and watch a lady manager, and the other staff of the restaurant spoke really roughly to this little girl. I didn\u2019t know why she was treated that way but still, it breaks my heart. I saw how the people at the other table also reacted to the scene. And they were smiling in awe, like all of a sudden the focus was drawn to what was happening around the table. I suddenly realized I am in a five star hotel...just wondering if this is a noble way to act and represent such high-ranking company. After my dinner, I went back to the hotel room and met up with my colleagues. We all agreed that this hotel may not be suitable for our next trips in Singapore. It\u2019s a shame because I thought the food at that restaurant was decent but actually forgot how good my pasta was after the \u201cfight scene\u201d which helped me conclude how degrading the female manager was to her employees. The little girl didn\u2019t say anything back. Maybe she\u2019s afraid of getting fired; I don\u2019t know, but my sympathy goes out to you.

Again the variety and quality of the food is excellent (and I'm a fussy foodie!) The cleaning staff is most doting, as is the Executive lounge staff. I did find the concierge service to be a bit useless for basic living things such as where can I do laundry without paying hotel prices. The room is comfortable and of a good size, well appointed, and with adequate places to store all the luggage we have in tow due to the fact we are moving. The view is spectacular! I didn't think I'd be comfortable so high up, but is was a great spot to watch the National Day show of military force, with fighter jets screaming overhead, tanks and other military vehicles filling the streets below, and Chinook helicopters flying by at eye level towing an immense Singapore flag. I enjoy the sunrise over the Singapore Strait, and the city lights at my feet at night. I was very disappointed in the last hotel we stayed at, and am very pleased with this one. I would recommend it for business or leisure travel.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cFresh Room, Great Service\u201d", "Author": "zags", "ReviewID": "UR68267754", "Content": "Since we booked our rooms back home we had informed the hotel staff that we would be coming with a baby and an elderly; we asked in advance if the hotel could provide a baby stroller and a wheelchair.

Actually we payed out of pocket unlike many of the guests on business trips but I feel like we got every penny's worth and that's more than I can say for some of the budget hotels we have stayed at that were one-tenth the price. Down to the last detail the hotel does a wonderful job catering to and expecting guest needs. Check-in was smooth, we requested a room with a great view and got it--56th floor overlooking the flyer and marina centre area. Front desk clerk named Jon was great BTW. I suppose we got somewhat lucky, based on the reviews of the lower rooms. I would have hated to have payed the same price and gotten stuck in a room that was not as nice as ours was. Balcony in every room was one of the things that cinched the deal for us, as there is just something really special about being able to step outside onto a private deck and have the whole world to yourself. Rooms are exquisitely appointed with no stone left unturned as far as I'm concerned. Really set up for a 5* experience from the killer power shower to the mattress, to the thoughtfully designed room layout that makes it feel more like a suite than a standard room. The room has nice little touches too such as National Geographic and some other fun magazines and a book on Buddhism to leaf through. Breakfast was included in our rate, which was convenient because there is really nothing that interesting to eat in the immediate neighborhood. However, the location of the hotel is one of its main strengths as it's right on the City Hall metro line and no need even to go outside to get on a subway. Hotel is across street from Raffles, which is a must visit for architecture and ambiance. But even the Stamford has good architecture--breakfast is in a classic IM Pei atrium room, with great atmosphere that wipes away any grogginess or grumpiness in the morning :) If I could make one suggestion to the hotel it would be related to the breakfast buffet, which does have a mass-produced food feel to it and undrinkable coffee that tastes like they scraped the bottom of a grill and poured hot water over it. However, the variety of food choices is decent (especially the nasi lemak and other Asian center) and so is the service. If I could make another suggestion to the hotel it would be to include free internet into the price of the room--charging for internet in this day and age is an outmoded business practice. Even Starbucks has recently relaxed its internet policy because they were losing money to other coffee shops. Besides that, though, the professionalism at Swissotel Stanford was superlative. They even thought so far as to have a freshen-up room for guests whose flight is later in the day. This way, even if you check out you can leave your bags, walk around and still have a place to shower and freshen up before a flight. Very cool! We didn't visit the pool area, we didn't even use the gym--too bad about that but we were very busy. If I can afford it I would stay here again for sure. In fact, our room was so nice I could live there!

Staff are very friendly. I was just waiting in front of the reception for 30 seconds for making an enquiry and a staff in the lobby approached me for assistance.

We also used the hotels service for booking the Night Safari. I need to preface this by saying the Night Safari has been one of my most treasured memories from visiting Singapore some 15 years ago.

In terms of the room condition, i would say that much can be done to improve on the overall impression. Parts that can be improved: 1) Bed seems to be based on the \"hard and durable\" type, and in all my stay at the various hotels in Singapore or even Japan, this one has got to be the \"toughest and hardest bed\" that we have slept in. 2) The toilet flush seems to come out of a kung fu movie (the type where you have to deliver a \"killer\" punch in order to activate the flush system) and it would actually help to have a normal \"push\" button for flushing. 3) There was no \"flexible\" shower head (the type where you can unhook from the holder and maneouvre to shower different parts of your body). For the one present in the shower room, either you hope you are not too tall (as shower head is fixed quite low and my 1.8m frame almost knocked the shower head) or you are small enough to move around the bathtub for water jet to spray to your body. Keep in mind that there is no pressure system as well (just a knob to turn water off and on / adjust temperature) so you pretty much have to make do with the \"default\" water pressure. 4) The drainage plug seems to be damaged as well (you have to remove the whole plug to drain the water or let it \"sit\" sideways to create a partial drainage flow\"). 5) The cupboard for hanging your clothes / safebox etc are located just beside the main door (i find it quite irritating to have to walk all the way to the front door area to keep items / hang my clothes when normally, it should just be a couple of steps away in the bedroom). 6) No free internet access is available and no WIFI connection as well (even if you want to pay for one). Other than the grouches i have mentioned earlier, room seems fine overall and is quite spacious. There is a mini sofa which is quite comfy for watching the night sky, and they do pack some rather nice TWG tea packs for refreshment (as well as complimentary bottle of water). We requested for late check out at 2 pm (usual is 12 noon check out) and our request was acceded. The hotel is also located at City Hall MRT (which is the interchange station) which makes it very accessible to Orchard Road (Orchard MRT or Somerset MRT) or if you are looking to go to more other areas (east side to East Coast Park (Bedok MRT nearest) or Changi Village (Paris Ris MRT nearest) or south side to Resorts World Sentosa / Universal Studios (alight at Harbourfront MRT and take a direct monorail system into Sentosa at Vivocity Mall)). Overall, i would go back for the view only (i.e. fireworks season).", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cThoroughly disappointing!\u201d", "Author": "EvaPerth", "ReviewID": "UR61402269", "Content": "We had a one night stay at this hotel and at the The Fullerton.

I think for anyone to call this 5 star and ask for S$300 (without tax) and hope and pray you get one of the newer rooms is really a pity. The pros of Swissotel are that the MRT is right downstairs, plentiful foodcourts, nice and friendly staff, GREAT breakfast buffet with Western,Singapore, Japanese, (one of the best buffets I have been to).

The only wireless access is in the hotel lobby cafe, which is very dimly lit with small little tables (great for lounging but not for working!), and the network speed is only slightly better than what I had in my room. Four of my colleagues stayed at the hotel, and we all had rooms of varying quality. As other reviewers have noted, some of the rooms are in need of refurbishing. My first room had very dated furniture (reminded me more of a Howard Johnson, complete with teal-colored vinyl headboard) and a slightly mildewy bathroom -- not what you would expect at an \"upscale\" business hotel. My toilet had some issues (dirty water would drain into it over the course of a few hours, while I was away at work or overnight), so I requested to switch rooms. They were fairly accomodating about this, and my new room was renovated, and quite a bit nicer and more comfortable. However, the desk was cramped into a corner, all the more noticeable as I had to sit there much longer than I would like due to the slow network speed and reliability issues noted above. Positive aspects of the hotel -- the location is great, right next to the City Hall MRT stop, and attached to the Raffles City mall. The mall has fantastic restaurants in the basement along with a decent food court upstairs, and plenty of stores for necessary and uncessary shopping ;-). The rooftop bar is also worth checking out -- the views are really amazing, even as someone who's lived in Singapore for months it was still a treat.

We were travelling with a 5 year old so wanted somewhere with a little luxury, that would hopefully make our stay easy. We arrived off an overnight flight, and the staff were welcoming on arrival. We were informed we could take a 17th floor room, and when we asked if there were any higher, we were told we could wait for a 55th floor room to become available, so we agreed. On completing check-in formalities, it was necessary to remind the staff that we had a late check out (as printed on the reservation voucher), and we were asked for a $200 'amenities' deposit. Having lost a credit card in an ATM outside the Taj Mahal, not having changed money when arriving as we were heading to a fully booked and paid luxury hotel and having one emergency debit card left that I was unsure of the balance of, it would've been nice to have some warning of this requirement for check in. Of course, the hotel would gladly hold on to $200 cash until I checked out... After this was sorted out, I gently reminded the check in staff about the extra bed we had paid for through our travel agent and was advised to call the concierge to organise it myself. I know I sound like I must be carrying on about the smallest things here, but don't you pay this much so these things are dealt with and your experience is relatively hassle free? The room was newly refurbished and was fantastic. The view was an outstanding panoramic view of Singapore. However it took two phone calls to the concierge to get a rollaway bed. The luggage that was brought to our room wasn't ours. Again, more small things that you wouldn't expect to happen in this price bracket. They didn't in most of the hotels we stayed in while in India - and they were a fraction of the price. The complimentary breakfast in Cafe Swiss was quite honestly awful. You are better off heading to one of the food courts in a mall for decent food! To the hotel's credit, I did advise them of these issues in an online survey that they asked me to complete after our stay and they returned an email apologising and promising they would look in to it.

As a business traveller I stopped staying at the Swissotel a while ago because I felt the rooms were no longer up to scratch. But after seeing the refurbished rooms on the internet I though I would give the hotel another go. But was dissappointed to find myself in a room which I think is well below requirements for a hotel like this. I didnt accept the room and asked to be moved into a refurbished room as appears on the website. After a long delay I was sent off to another room, only to find myself again in a room that hasn't seen an upgrade in 10 years. The view was great, but the room wasnt. So if your not staying in a refurbished room then be prepared to put up with an extremely tired room that leaves a lot to be desired. From my experience this means stained carpets, old damaged furniture and a 1970' s bathroom. Not the end of the world I guess as the room is still clean and functional and given the location this may be of little importance to many. But dont expect quality. For me, the dissappointed is that I expect to get what's advertised and what I was given was far from that.

Internet access is, these days, becoming a necessity for business travellers and a definite deal-breaker with leisure travellers, too, who make use of internet communications to keep in touch while away - so access should not be so expensive, (if there is any charge at all!) Guests who don't wish to fork out for room service or meals in the restaurant should remember the food court in the basement of the adjacent mall, where there is a wide selection of eateries along with a very handy supermarket where you can purchase snacks and beverages which can be stored in the minibar in the room. The food court seems to stay open quite late, (though I've no idea of the exact times), and should you hit Singapore during the monsoons, you don't even need to go outside - fantastic! Accommodations at the hotel are large and airy, with nice high ceilings and plenty of space, (I can't recall ever being allocated a twin-bedded room, but presume some of this sense of space may be lost in order to accommodate two beds). There is a generously-sized wardrobe, (with plenty of hangers!), which also houses the in-room safe and iron and ironing board, and is where you'll find your bathrobes and slippers, (always a nice touch!) A small minibar contains all the usual sundries; I can't comment on the pricing as I never go near the things, (except to empty them out and restock with my own purchases - something which you can do here as it is not one of those hideous electronic things!), but previous reviews seem to think it is expensive - so head to the supermarket downstairs for supplies. The generously-sized king bed is flanked by two nightstands with individual lamps. On one of the nightstands is a secondary telephone and an electronic panel which controls the lighting and a/c in the room, and also acts as an alarm clock. There is the ubiqutous, oversized, flatscreen TV opposite the bed which dominates the room somewhat and seems incongruous within a d\u00e9cor which is very dated and stuck in a late eighties-early nineties timewarp! There is a preponderance of wood (effect) furniture that does nothing to lighten the room, which is otherwise done-out in very safe and sedate shades of browns, beiges and greens, (including a distinctly utilitarian looking carpet which I cannot help but feel needs a jolly good deep clean!) Looking at some of the Swissotel's own publicity material, my room looks nothing like that featured, (do they ever?!) The balcony is appreciated; though the humidity levels might prevent you from lingering too long, it is good to be able to get some 'fresh' air from time to time and appreciate some fine city views, especially at night. This hotel is large - both in terms of size and capacity - so guests have to expect the usual pluses and minuses that this brings. It functions around-the-clock and is well-equipped for dealing with conference guests and large groups. However, this does mean that it gets busy in public areas and, personally, I find it hard to ever feel 'at home' - it's a relief to get in my room sometimes! Service from staff can be very hit-and-miss, I'm afraid; I have had far more 'sour faces' behind the front desk than I am used to in hotels and while the service itself is usually fine - what needs doing gets done - it is hard to feel valued as a guest, and a customer, when there is little warmth displayed. The Stamford is not inherently bad, and indeed, many visitors will love it, I am sure. I just can't help feeling that it is resting on its laurels a little, (as a lot of hotels of this size and standing do), sure and certain in the knowledge that they will consistently achieve secure occupancy rates without offering the extras, and standards, which their competitors are providing. Rooms need an overhaul, but I can't see this happening anytime soon unfortunately. I don't know what the rates are like at this place but I would suggest that anyone considering the hotel have a good look around and see what is being offered at comparative properties elsewhere in Singapore.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle,Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, disappointed no free internet access.\u201d", "Author": "Cleo002", "ReviewID": "UR48538308", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights on the way back from Japan.

We stayed in a Grand Room at the 28th floor, a corner room that was almost 2 times the size of a standard/deluxe room. It had a king-sized bed and a separate area for the living room which had a big LCD TV, and still a separate area for the workdesk. It also had two balconies...with windows that spanned from ceiling to floor...giving us a great view of Singapore 24/7 One balcony particularly faced the Singapore Flyer and Espalanade! Best of all, our room was renovated, so it had a simple, neat, stylish, modern feel that was perfect. The kids just loved running around the big space we had, which they called \"our small home\". The room and bathroom were kept satisfyingly clean by the staff. Just some minor issues with the bathroom: (1) The toilet bowl had some bits of stain that stayed there despite the everyday cleaning. (2) The glass enclosure of the combined shower/bathtub was just halfway through the bathtub so if you turned on the shower strong enough, the water would sprinkle outside the tub, leaving the bathroom floor wet. Beyond that, we really appreciated the fact that the toilet supplies were religiously replenished everyday, with the staff giving us 4 sets of hand towels, face towels and bath towels everyday, enough for the entire family. Daily Buffet Breakfast (which was included in our rate) at the Cafe Swiss was good too, with a wide selection of food from Continental, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and kid-friendly dishes. Our young kids ate for free too, so that was one extra that I also loved. Only one improvement area is that they should try changing more dishes from day-to-day so that there could be more variety if you eat there daily. Staff was always courteous and accomodating everywhere..be it at the reception, restaurant or housekeeping. In fact, if you wandered around the reception area, someone was sure to approach you with a smile and ask you if you need anything that they can help you with. Customer Service is surely another thing that this hotel can be proud of! Finally, location is a plus, being attached to the City Hall MRT Station and to the Raffles City Shopping Center. The latter though is a high-end mall, so don't expect to do most of your shopping here if you are looking for a lot of bargain items. The mall has many decent eating areas too, a well-stocked supermarket and a couple of pharmacy shops...so pretty much everything you need is right at your doorstep.

Raffles City Shopping Centre is also underneath the hotel and has a food court on the 3rd floor for good, cheap local food. Our room was a harbour view room on the 31st floor which had fantastic views over Marina Bay, the Padang, Colonial District, CBD and Merlion Park from the balcony. The room itself was large by Asian standards and most importantly it was quiet at night with no noise from neighbouring rooms heard at all. The bed was very hard, but that is normal for Asia. Breakfast, which was included in our rate, was excellent with two restaurants offering breakfast in the mornings from 6-11am meaning you never had to wait for a table. On the last morning the breakfast was moved to the restaurant on the 70th floor which had amazing views around to Clarke Quay and Fort Canning Hill. The pool was probably just ok, the pool closest to the Swissotel was really shallow and used by children with the other pool near the Fairmont Hotel being a bit deeper and more useful for adults. There was a poolside bar with drinks and snacks but we didn't use it.

The location is very convenient to quite a bit, like the Merlion, the Chjimes, and many other areas of interest, including shopping. This town is a shoppers paradise, and the hotel is situated over an underground mall that is connected via tunnels to other malls. There is an entire network of malls and shopping that are all underground, and if you don't like the humidity, you can spend most of your time underground. However, I wouldn't recommend staying underground, because the sites and scenes are too interesting to pass up. There is the Singapore Flyer, which gives you a good view and historical context of the city. Don't rent a car, though, because the amount you will spend in one week in cabs won't even come close to renting a car! The hotel always has taxis waiting (no matter the time of day), but make sure that if you need to use a credit card, you ask ahead of time. Also, DON\"T tip the cabby! If they give you more than just a pick up and drop off, a tip isn't expected. If you do tip, you shouldn't give them more than one Singapore dollar. I would recommend this city and this hotel to anyone that is looking to stay in a convenient location with high attention to customer service.

Great location for a tourist: - 2 MRT lines are stopping at City Hall station. So it is easy to reach most of the sightseeing sites. - food court and restaurants are available in the Raffles City mall. - The Raffles is at door step for the famous Singapore sling, also Chijmes is at 5 min walk. The hotel is linked to the Raffles City mall, the MRT and the Fairmont. The hotel lobby looks more like a train hall than a hotel lobby: busy and noisy not peaceful at all. === The room === Got room #3924 on the 39th, a room with view over marina bay. The room was far from perfection. The room shows its age: old wallpaper with some stains on the wall over the head of the bed and on the sofa, numerous scratches on wooden parts of the furnitures and metal parts of the lights. The wooden doors of the wardrobe were dusty. Dust on the carpet below the refrigerator. Still some dust on the TV remote and phone sets: at this time of H1N1 flu these kind of devices should be better cleaned. The wardrobe contains a iron, ironing board and a safe. The safe is really big, it can easily fit two 15\" laptops and there is still place in it. The issue is that 1/3rd of the keys on the keypad were inoperative: 5, 6 and 7 keys didn't work. The bathroom was also old: many stains on the marble around the sink. There is no shower cabin, shower is taken in the bathtub. The room is not soundproof: could hear doors banging somewhere the hotel, someone walking heavily on the floor above till late. Additionally there was a continuous annoying noise coming from an electric device located on the roof in the wardrobe. Not restful at all. The king-size bed that was clean and comfortable. The A/C was not too noisy. While during daytime the view over the marina is not astonishing, it becomes great at night when all the buildings are lighten: the Singapore Flyer, the Esplanade aka the durians, the Merlion, the CDB. Even the casino under construction is great. Internet is chargeable: S$28 for 24h. Can't understand why luxury hotels still charge internet connection... === Pool === There are 2 round pools on the 8th floor. They common pools shared by both the Stamford and the Fairmont so it can be hard to find an available longchair. === Service & Staff ==== On their website the Stamford claims to be a 5 star hotel but I am sceptic about this statement. I found the staff not warmful nor helpful and providing low quality of service. In the first morning at about 9:30am the male housemaid rang at the door to ask me if he could clean the room: could'nt he wait me to leave the room? What if I was still sleeping? The following days I had to remind to turn on the \"Do not disturb\" light. In the room I didn't have any complementary bottle of water until I request it. Noticed no turn down service. During the 3 days I stayed at the Stamford, I had no greetings from any of the staff member: not even a simple \"hello, sir\". Had the feeling of being completely ignored. At the lobby, the bell boys seems more interested to chat to each other. At the desks, the staff looked deeply concentrated on their work to notice the guests. At the swimming pool, I stayed a few minutes standing by the pool looking for the changing room. A staff member walk by, stared at me then returned to his work: no \"hello, sir\", no \"can I help you, sir?\". Same things with other staff members I encountered in corridors and elevators: they seemed just too busy to greet me. Overall I was really disappointed by my stay at the Stamford. Old room, not warmful nor helpful staff. Considering the rates at the Stamford, I won't recommed the Stamford.

Club Level was a massive disappointment. The views were nice, but the room was very small and mostly tables/chairs rather than comfy seating. The staffing was a bit hit and miss, one morning I missed out on a hot drink because I could not get anyone's attention before I had to rush off to an appointment.

The hot selctions for breakfast seemed particularly unappealing - some dreadful chicken and bacon processed thing sliced like meatloaf didn't even look like real food, so other mornings I tried a croissant which was rather stale and a chicken bau which despite coming straight out the steamer was stone cold. Canapes at happy hour were rather better but there was nothing but soft drinks, coffee and rather uninspiring biscuits during the day.

This hotel boasts rooms with the best views in Singapore. After a day spent inside in air-con meetings it was a reall joy to be able to open my room windows for some fresh, albeit humid air. The location is very convenient to the subway and is a brief walk to the river and historical district. The rooms themselves are fine, relatively spacious and the cleaning staff very accomodating. Oddly however, the hotel does not have wifi in the rooms unlike many other asian hotels. I cannot say enough good things about the executive floor staff who were the epitomy of professionalism. I do have a few issues with the hotel though. 1. The elevators were quite slow. It was not uncommon to wait up to 5 minutes for an elevator in the morning. I quickly learned to allow myself extra time if I wanted to get to my meetings on time! 2. After a busy day it was quite nice to decompress and relax in the executive lounge. Relax that is UNTIL the children arrive! Unlike most other hotels I've stayed in, the Stamford allows children into their executive lounge area rendering it less 'executive' and more 'kindergarden'! How relaxing is it to watch a 10 yr old sneeze all over the canapes or a toddler careen into hapless staff or listen to a nearby temper tantrum???? 3. Not enough tables/chairs in the executive lounge. In the mornings and evenings there was a real shortage of tables and chairs. The problem could have been rectified by converting the meeting room into an expension of the lounge by opening the glass door and breaking the large table into smaller tables. Management should consider looking into this during peak periods. 4. Executive lounge implies executive work which these days requires wifi. No wifi. In summary, I recommend the hotel highly but if you are expecting the executive lounge to be an oasis of calm you should look elsewhere.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "michelle002", "ReviewID": "UR38335838", "Content": "My husband and I spent a week at the Swissotel The Stamford and couldn't have been happier with our experience.

This was the start to 4 of the best hotel days we have ever spent (we have traveled widely around the world). The suite was huge, living room, bedroom, powder room, bathroom ( nice deep bath) seperate shower, dressing room etc. It was on the 65th floor. Bose sound system. Just up the corridor was our Crest lounge where we had free drinks from 5-8 each night. Food was supplied by the top restaurants - Jaan, Equinox etc and was limitless, beautifully presented and very tasty. Only on one other evening did another guest drop in so we had the lot to ourselves - we even were able to watch live an AFL match ( which our team the Bulldogs won) on the large TV while helping ourselves to the hotel hospitality - perfect after a time away from home! The staff were superb, the Crest level staff spoke very good English, were very knowledgeable and so polite and caring. One afternoon we wanted to have some dumplings at a restaurant located in the basement shopping centre (Din Tai Fung) and one of the staff walked us to the restaurant and helped us pick our courses and get a table! Another lunch at the Lei Gardens nearby was recommended and booked by the staff and they even booked the restaurant specialty (roasted pork) for us. Both restaurants were excellent and we were the only non Singaoreans present ( if the locals eat there its got to be good). Our transport needs were immediately dealt with and frequently while we were in the lobby staff asked us if we needed any assistance.

Also free cocktails and snacks each evening from 5 - 7 pm. You can also check out at the business lounge, bypassing the front desk. 3) Gym - about 8 treadmills, 8 TV channels that you can select; extensive weights and stretching area 4) Health Spa - excellent massages - expensive but worthwhile 5) Pool area 6) Next to City Hall MRT (subway). You can get to Orchard Road in under 10 minutes for I think S$1.90 very convenient 7) Raffles City shopping mall is adjacent - there is a supermarket in the basement level where you can buy food or snacks to bring back to the room (recommend the prepackages sushi!); drug stores, a number of inexpensive places to eat, shopping, clothing -- all in all if you have forgotten to pack something on your trip you can find it here. 8) Room Service - consistently quick, never any problem with an order; fairly extensive menu. Everything in Singapore is expensive and this hotel is no exception. All the hotels will increase the rates to take advantage of spot market opportunities - a major convention, the Singapore Grand Prix - so buyer beware. The hotel is run by the Fairmont Group which operates the adjacent Fairmont Hotel. The Fairmont is more upscale, but they both share the same spa, gym, pool area. On the 70th floor there is a bar and restaurant with fantastic city views..if you can request a room in advance I would ask for something facing Clark Quay and Boat Quay (both South of the hotel) - I think that give the best view of central Singapore. Taxi's can be hard to come by at certain times, there is a place to queue up in front. If you are in a hurry, you can discretely ask the guy directing traffic out front for help in getting a cab and slip him S$5 when he delivers. Over the years they have been upgrading the rooms.

Is the hotel oblivious to competition? Or because it has certain advantages over others, management thinks they can continue selling rooms at prices sometimes even higher than swanky competitors? Nobody knows, but it's certainly not operating in an oligopoly. Of course tourists are often awed by the views on the higher floors, because if you stay here there's no need to go the Flyer. But if the hotel is serious about attracting and retaining guests then surely it would spend big money on refufurbishing the whole place? Obviously not. The deluxe rooms are currently being redone (and they still come with CRT monitors) I was told, but these are on the lower floors. And what about the used-to-be expensive Crest suites? They still look exactly the same, nothing has changed since it was last maintained by Westin. No more colourful bed-covers, but that's just about it. SGD500 is reasonable, considering they're just charging you for the views and exclusiveness of sleeping on the 66th storey, and the use of a dated Bose system. I was told the management (old) was very concerned with revenue, so when times were good, they couldn't be bothered with major upgrading as occupancy was always very high. (Though there were reports quoting former Raffles CEO Jennie Chua that they were planning to transform the top 6 six floors into exclusive club rooms but sadly nothing materialised). So whilst everyone was busy renovating and installing wifi, STS simply enjoyed the good times while it lasted.

I\u2019m a frequent traveler to Singapore for both business and leisure - I've stayed at most of the hotels around Marina Bay (where the Swissotel is located) all within this year. This website has always been invaluable for helping me choose hotels as well as restaurants, so I felt that it was my responsibility to inform the Trip Advisor community of the poor management, the extremely old and dated rooms, and the lack of accountability one would respect from a hotel in this price bracket. Firstly, the decor in the rooms is ridiculously old. The furniture and rugs look like they haven\u2019t been replaced in the last 20 years. The tube TV is reminiscent of something from a cheap motel in the 70s. There is no shower cubicle, no hair dryer (in my first room), and the rooms are poorly lit. As another guest mentioned below, the air conditioning is definitely not strong enough and gave my girlfriend an allergic reaction. There seemed to structural work on the building in the morning which woke me up. For the same price, the best rate rooms at the Pan Pacific or Marina Mandarin are much more luxurious. Yes, the view from the balcony can be nice, but so is the one at the Fairmont next door or the Pan Pacific down the street. Other reviews speak of the great location, but hotels such as the Intercontinental/Meritus Mandarin are a stone\u2019s throw away. Upon my arrival I was informed by a tiny piece of paper on the bedside drawer that there would be no electricity, lighting, air-conditioning or running water on my floor from 1-5am. Some elevators would also cease to function. The reception downstairs failed to mention this at check in and the online website had no mention of this \"minor inconvenience,\" either. If I would have known of this in advance, then I would have cancelled my room and booked one at one of the other hotels nearby. I had the strong impression that guests were expected to tolerate this without prior warning. As many of you know, Singapore can be hot and humid and sleeping without aircon is unbearable. When I returned home on Saturday night I was greeted by a dark and stuffy room. I immediately requested a room change to a higher floor which was not affected by this. While I must admit that the staff was quick and courteous in arranging another room, it also made me wonder why I was assigned this room in the first place since they already knew I would be staying for 2 nights. My new room was obviously unoccupied, and was pretty much the same size and had a similar view. If they had told me when I checked in, then I would have easily paid the extra SGD 20 or so to upgrade to a different room. I informed the staff about my displeasure in person downstairs, and a few of the staff seemed to be annoyed that I was disturbing them from whatever they were doing at 3 am in the morning. The manager meekly explained that this was an oversight but offered no other explanation. Imagine how irritated you would be if you had to pack your entire luggage at 3 AM with only the aid of a small flashlight. The next morning hotel staff also barged into my room even though I had the privacy sign up. Apparently the reception had failed to record that I had switched rooms and I was rudely awoken by two staff. I do understand that it customary for hotels to conduct electrical maintenance a few times a year. Believe me when I say that I'm not angry about the actual lack of electricity, but instead I'm irate about the lack of attention, preparation, and general indifference the staff at Swissotel offer. It might sound like I\u2019m privately ranting, but I did inform the staff if all of my concerns and I was never once met with a satisfactory response. For casual tourists in Singapore who want to stay in the Marina Bay area, you would be better served by choosing another hotel. Other reviews might indicate a wonderful experience, or an amazing view, but these opinions are coming from people who have not had the luxury of staying at other hotels in the same area. Newer, nicer, and more spacious rooms are plentiful in the Marina area; why settle for a substandard room? It goes without saying that all the rooms in the area are clean - it's simply not enough to distinguish this hotel as amazing. For frequent business travelers, I probably don\u2019t need to warn you, you know well enough to stay clear of this hotel.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt, Germany", "Title": "\u201cLoved the view from the Balcony\u201d", "Author": "Rohit_CG", "ReviewID": "UR29268122", "Content": "I went to spend my 27th birthday at Singapore.

I've got over 20 nights there in the last 9 months. On this last trip, I was there for a week. I like the Swissotel. The location is fantastic with a mall underneath along with the City Hall MRT stop. Furthermore, there's the Citylink mall which connects to Suntec City, the Esplanade, or Marina Mall, so you don't even have to go above ground to explore the nearby area. There's a good selection of restaurants nearby, and Clark Quay is within walking distance. So, for tourist sites, the hotel is well situated. The service is good - just friendly enough and efficient. I found the wait staff in the Swiss Cafe to have a bit of trouble finding the balance between hovering and attentive service, but it's better than being ignored. Housekeeping kept the room clean, towels replaced, and bed made. No problems there. Though, it should be noted that I was in Singapore on business and made very little use of the hotel staff, but I also had no problems that would require that I contact them. if it's raining outside, stop by the bell desk and they'll loan you an umbrella. My room was on the 30th floor, and had a nice view of St. Andrew's Cathedral. I find the bed rather firm - a bit too firm for my taste. Otherwise, the sheets and pillows were fine. They use a lightweight comforter, which is hardly necessary. The room had the standard amenities - safe, iron, ironing board, hair dryer, tv, alarm clock, etc. The desk was good for working with plenty of electric outlets nearby. The outlets have universal receptacles, so no need for a plug adapter. Ethernet cable was a bit short for using their in-room internet. $S28 per 24 hours for the internet, which was fast enough. There's a very slight discount for multi-day internet plans. Like all the rooms, there's a sliding glass door and a balcony. Air conditioning worked fine for me. Bathroom was roomy enough with a combo bath/shower. There's a grate that gurgles a bit when the water is draining, but it's not a bother. I'm not wild about the complementary shampoo, but it does the job. Housekeeping kept the bathroom very clean. I've done the breakfast buffet and lunch semi-buffet at the Swiss Cafe, and it's fine with a good selection of different cuisines. I do find breakfast overpriced at $S40 (inc taxes). This is really the only alternative for early morning breakfast in the hotel, though if you go around the corner to the entrance to the City Hall MRT station, you'll find a Starbucks and a 24-hour McDonald's. I've also had lunch at Kopi Tiam, which was fair. They use this space as overflow for the breakfast buffet at the Swiss Cafe. I popped up to the New Asia Bar on the 70th floor for a quick drink and to admire the view which is fantastic. It's certainly cheaper than doing the Singapore Flyer. I'm afraid that despite all my nights at this hotel, I have never visited the gym nor the pool, but my colleagues tell me the gym is nice. One note - on this last trip there was a rumbling of some sorts that would occur on occasion - I don't know what it was, though I'll chalk it up to nearby construction or something. Not loud enough to bother me, but I thought I'd mention it.

In a previous review someone complained that they couldnt check in at 7.30 am. You gotta be kidding me, you cannot normally check in to any hotel before 2.00pm. Why not drop the bags and go for a shop. Some people are just never happy. This hotel is in the best location. Its located to the side of the Raffles Plaza shopping Centre so if its stinking hot you don't even need to go outside. Plus from this shopping centre you can get to the MRT (Rail) which is just the best experience and cheap, just buy a card with $20 credit it will last a week. Across the road from the Centre is the Raffles Hotel and Chimes, Chimes is a great eating place, an old monastery I think. We stayed on the 52nd floor facing Clarke Quay. Just magnificent views, the glass wall on the balcony was a bit scary but this meant you could lie in bed and see the sea and river rather than the balcony wall very clever. The room was perfect nothing out of place as you would expect for a 5 star which it is. This was a special trip for us so we paid a little more and it was worth every $. We have stayed at the Peninsular Excelsior which is nearby, its much cheaper and if you are on a budget stay there, but the Swiss is worth every penny. We had breakfast included and it was just the best. The breakfast dining room was alway nearly full but we never had to wait. I like busy breakfasts as it means the food is turning over. Breakfast here is a must and the best I have ever experienced. If you want cheap meals go to the basement in the shopping centre, there are some top spots there, but Chimes is more up market.

Was given a room on the 34th floor with Marina view. The second occasion was a late arrival at 10:30 pm and was given a 50th floor room with city view panning from Boat Quay to Chinatown to Clarke Quay and across to Orchard Road. The rooms themselves were good with the city view room much bigger than the Marina view room, both had balconies, beware those without a head for heights!! Beds were comfy, bathroom well stocked with towels, TV had plenty of choice particularly news channels like CNN, BBC, Channel News Asia, but only 2 sports channels, maybe time to get another one!! The staff I encountered were excellent, bags were promptly bought up to the room, the Conceirge booked restaurants and even provided a set of bathroom scales to weigh luggage. The lobby was extremely busy which is expected of such a big hotel especially as it was the Chinese New Year period, even had a Lion dance to celebrate the New Year, but was not made to feel unimportant and was addressed several times by lobby staff, the hotel is popular with business travellers and aircrew from BA and Qantas. Did not use the restaurants at the hotel as there was plenty of choice nearby for breakfast, lunch and dinner, special mention for the revamped food court at Raffles City and the excellent Lei Garden across the road at the Chimjes complex. One other thing is tour desk is next to conceirge, handy for booking trips to Night Zoo and reconfirming coach rides to the airport. Other facilities such as pool and gym are excellent as they are shared with The Fairmont next door, never seemed to be too crowded. The location of the hotel is excellent, super transport links with MRT station below for Orchard Road, Vivo City and further beyond locations, but the major attractions like Merlion, Singapore Eye, Chinatown, Boat Quay very easily reach by foot. All major shopping can be done at Raffles City, Marina Square, Suntec Mall, Link Mall underground.

The bath amenities were there except for the hair conditioner, we alerted House-Keeping and our request was promptly met though. The plumbling was a terror- the shower tap couldn't stop leaking and the sink couldn't be stopped-imagine the difficulty when I tried soaking some laundry.

The bed linens were freshly-laundered and changed daily, but they looked old and frayed with tears and holes, albeit small ones. While flat screen TVs are part of the modern room decor nowadays, this room still keeps a 25\" old TV. The bedside clock is 15 minutes late and there was no way to adjust it. It seems like the hotel stripped the electronic control to the clock and the window curtains.

The Mandarin is well located near the water, but the Stamford has the advantage of being on top of an MRT station.

LOL) - we were right over the road from St Marks church so on Xmas day we could hear them ringing out carols on the bells :-) :-) Service by valets, concierge, staff was all excellent and friendly - check in and check out was swift, the buffet breakfast rocked with all the different selections - esp the waffles!!!

And seeing as our room at the Stamford would cost more than triple what we paid for an entire three-bedroom condo in Kota Kinabalu, we were expecting great things. There are, to be fair, some wonderful things about the Stamford. We stayed in the executive floors (57-60) and as such had our pick of several locations for a very nice free breakfast; among these we liked the variety and authenticity of the spread in the hotel's \"Kopi Tiam\" the best. Also, the spa (gym/spa/pool) was fantastic with a men's spa that was pure luxury. The location was tremendous, right above City Hall MRT and steps from too many dining options, high and low end, to count. And the staff was generally very nice and accommodating. The problem was with the rooms, and no matter how nice location and amenities are, if the room isn't good then neither is the experience. The trouble started when we were first booked into a smoking room on 57 despite adamantly pointing out that this was unviable for us. The room reeked of smoke, especially the mattress, and on first complaint the hotel operator asked if we wanted it SPRAYED. Amazing. We said we wanted a new room and after waiting something like 90 minutes in this smelly room waiting for a \"porter\" (why, exactly?) we finally got into a nonsmoking room on 58. First problem: 58 smells like smoke too, a problem that we eventually got used to but really why in the 21st century are hotels even allowing smoking? Bigger, MUCH bigger problem: The AC is woefully insufficient. This is SINGAPORE. It is HOT and unspeakably HUMID and without adequate AC your towels (you know, the ones you want to re-use to help the environment?) never dry and sadly neither does your sweaty body or your post-shower corpse, and with two people in the room, it just gets warmer and warmer. We complained several times and after night 4 (of 7) being almost completely sleepless, I called to say that we either get a new room or we are leaving. So we get a new room, on 59. And of course, the AC is just as bad. But we endured and made it out, sleepless and sticky, and were thrilled to return home to Calgary, Canada where it was -15C on our return. It felt like baptism. A couple more minor complaints: S$30 a DAY for WIRED internet is worse than absurd. It was also annoying that we were forced to take the elevator every time we wanted to get two (and then one) storey up to get to the executive lounge. The stairway door to our floors were unlocked but 60 was always locked- why? This was wasteful and very time consuming. When I checked my folio before checkout I was under the impression that I had our first day's charges waived and in light of how poor my experience was here I was happy to see this. Nope. Just an accounting catch-up I guess- no recompense at all. I adored Singapore but compared to our first two nights' experience at the lovely and AIR CONDITIONED Parkroyal on Kitchener Road, the Stamford was a massive disappointment.", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel....great location!\u201d", "Author": "MissFreo", "ReviewID": "UR23121771", "Content": "Just come back from staying at this hotel over Christmas!

Location: Perfect, the best area to stay in very posh, open air, less congested and just 5 mins by car to clarke quay and orchard street. It has the MRT (city hall) touching the hotel, the most convenient way of travel. ( for long distance . if u r 4 passengers then a cab is better for short distances only. cabs have surcharges in the morning and evening, for a couple as well MRT is much cheaper and convenient, again MRT is for people who have the time to walk a lot, buy a tkt, board the train, reach ur destination and again walk or take a bus, bt for long distances its amazing). It has 3 malls ( suntec + raffles + city mall ) attached with its lobby. The best shoping experience is singapore. You have a orchard street of course but, i still prefered these to orchard street. In orchard street paragon and takashimaya are the only ones i found worthwhile. Service: we got our room within 5 mins of checkin and the best possible on the 43rd floor with a balcony ( what an awesome view).Room service was very prompt and helpful. Reasonable rates too. The staff in general was very helpful, always smiling and made thier best efforts to make u feel comfortable. The pool was good, not extraordinary but has a good spa in the adjoining Fairmont hotel. Also when u dine in some specific restaurants within the adjoining malls u can sign the bill instead of paying cash. It will be charged to your room bill. Very convenient and feels good.

Staying on the high floors of the hotel is really a highlight of any visit to Singapore as the views are great in all directions. The rooms are generally large and they often have 2 queen-sized beds. The decor is becoming a little old and worn, but there are some great features that I would not swap, such as the heavy sliding glass doors to the balconies that can be propped open to let the warm air and the sounds of Singapore in at night. The pool is a delightful place to spend a jet-lagged day or two. The hotel has so many rooms that you can usually get early check-in and late checkout, and cafe swiss is breakfast heaven.

I left after one night because was very disasisfied awith the hotel and its value and moved elsehwere for the rest of my stay. They also gave me the impression that I will receive a good price given that I was a guest three times in the past, but I verified that the same (exhorbitant) price is given at the airport to anyone at the Tourist authority counter. I asked for a non-smoker room, but was given a smoker room. The room is shabby. The TV is old and on the small side. The furnishings are old. The hotel is huge and the lobby is like a busy train station. No personal touch. Room service not good. I asked for a laundry bad, and instead a service peronnel came to take laundry. The hotel is very very expensive for ordinary guests. They ask for about 230 USD (330SGD) for room without breakfast---but to fill up this huge hotwel they give large discounts to corporate or other privileged guests. Don't stay here for more than 160 USD which is the price I paid in the past, and which will still might be acceptable, given the shabby condition of room and impersonal service. This rate by the way, even the 230 USD rate, does not entitle use of swimming pool (which is not great anyway) and gym. So what's in this hotel anyway? The worst part is the impersonal train station feel. I moved to a three star hotel paying half the price, got a better room, with Plasma tv and the room service was immensely better and the room cleaner!!! Especially the three star hotel gave me a feeling of a home away from home. Nice staff. Personal touch. Real care that you are happy. The shower in my Swissotel was also not much good. The water pressure was not great and the hanled for shower are complicated. The service very distant and the hotel is not a homey place. Just an exhorbitantly priced lodging place. Checking in out can take quite some time as this is a huge hotel and they seem to be saving on staff as well as raising the prices a lot. The result of GREED! In conclusion, not a nice place to stay.

I FOUND the room VERY NICE & BIG!!! The room ALSO has a pen, pencil, 2 writing pads & alot of paper for guests to write. I'm also addicted in collecting these items as SOUVENIRS & for MEMORIES !!!

However, on almost all of our stays, we get told that either there are no non-smoking rooms left or no rooms with 1 bed. This is despite reservations being made months in advance. On a couple of occasions the rooms have been extremely 'tired' with old and stained furniture. After complaining, we usually get moved to another room - however, this is not the best way to start your holiday. When hotels take your booking and requests they should make sure they allocate you the appropriate room that you pay for when you arrive. Having said that, we do like the large rooms of the Stamford, the location, balconies and the breakfast that is usually included! Yes we would stay there again - but we always check in with bated breath hoping that we get the proper room and amenities that we book and not have to move around from room to room.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cDissapointed\u201d", "Author": "MelbourneNikki", "ReviewID": "UR14954066", "Content": "We have stayed here at least on six other occassions.

The TV was so close to the bed making it hard to watch. On check out I complained about the room and asked them to make sure when we came back a week later that we would get a better room. On check in I asked again for a better room. There was no room available with a king size bed and that was non smoking. Both of these things I had specifically requested. We ended up in a smoking room Room 4865. Again a corner room with strange configuration. This room smelt of cigarettes and I had a sore throat in the morning. This hotel has no personal service and takes no notice of return guests. The only reason we stay here is for the fantastic location with the huge shopping centre underneath.

We also received a voucher which gave a discount of 50% off food in the hotel restaurants. The only factor I would criticise about the SIA stopover was the Hop On bus \u2013 yes it is free, but it was overcrowded, uncomfortably hot, and the driver would switch off the engine if he stopped for any time, and the air con such as it was, disappeared, leaving all aboard sweltering. In addition you could not see very much or appreciate the city sights from that vehicle, and it took ages to get you anywhere. The next day we realised that the \u2018MRT\u2019 system had a station below the hotel. The entrance to \u2018City\u2019 station is just beside \u2018Starbucks\u2019. A day ticket is excellent value. Using the \u2018Tube\u2019 you can select the area of the city you wish to explore, travel speedily in an air-conditioned carriage, see the particular sights, and move on. Better and more efficient by far. One trip I would highly recommend is the morning trip to the Zoo, with Breakfast included. It is a reasonable meal, but the highlight is when the Orang-utans come with their Keepers and join you. Of course there are good photo opportunities and at times you are literally only an arms length away from them. The trip can be booked from the SH Tours desk which is located just behind Reception in the hotel. A well organised trip which is great value and a memorable experience. The coach leaves the hotel at 8.00 am and has you back by 12.30. The Swissotel is an excellent hotel, good facilities, friendly and helpful staff, nice breakfast, lunch and dinners available at good rates in the Swiss Caf\u00e9 on the 1st floor. Super views over the city from the rooms, we were on the 48th floor. Lifts worked very quickly and efficiently. The hotel block contains a multitude of shops on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors and below ground level there are a vast number of eateries, and a supermarket. We also found a medical practice on the 2nd floor, Drs Singh & Ptns which we had occasion to use, as my wife had a severe reaction to an insect bite.

It takes a short walk from this hotel to Suntec cicty and Marina Square which gives it a superb location. It's across the back of St. Andrews chuch which made us happy.

Booked through SIA Stopover which gave us free shuttle to/from the airport as well as free entry to some attractions and free Hop on city bus. The hotel was full so not able to upgrade to room on executive floor. We asked for harbour view but not available. Instead got partial harbour view on 43rd floor. This partial view was south to the marina area ie towards Suntec and the Singapore Flyer (their London Eye) and the mouth of the river. Suffering from vertigo I could not go out onto the balcony but I was reliably informed by my husband that you could see towards Boat Quay and the concert hall if you leaned out slightly. I could look out of the floor to ceiling window without feeling queasy but no way could I have stood out on the balcony! Room a bit tired looking but perfectly adequate for our needs. Had seen mixed reports about breakfasts but we had no problems in the Swiss Cafe. Full buffet with English-type cooked breakfast - fried eggs or omelettes and the like made to order - fruits, cereals, juice, toast, pastries as well as local and Japanese style breakfasts. Service was excellent. Every day we were in about 0800-0815 so don't know if worse at other times but we had no problems. Plates cleared quickly and tea/coffee topped up constantly. Cost for 2 S$70.00 less 50% SIA Stopover discount plus local taxes came to about S$41 (about \u00a315 sterling) so don't think this is expensive. We did eat there one night again got 50% discount. 2 courses and 2 beers totalled about S$60. Main course portions not huge. Talking about food you have to try Clarke Quay and Boat Quay both of which are within easy walking distance from the hotel. An experience not to be missed though food can be a bit hit or miss. But I must say I wished I'd had a sign to hold up typed up in big bold letters - on one side 'Already Eaten' and on the other 'Not Tonight Thanks'. This would save you having to repeat one of them every 2 minutes during your walk along (especially Boat Quay). All in all hotel was good and in the perfect location for getting out and about. Our fifth visit to Singapore and we have stayed in various locations. This is probably the best. Our room was 4350 with the partial harbour view. I would guess that rooms ending 51 to possibly 61 are the ones with the view over the harbour, Padang etc. Looking at the circuit for the forthcoming Grand Prix the harbour views should have a good view of the quite a lot of the circuit though with it being a night race not sure. And it is no doubt sold out for that period. No problems checking in or out. Again saw reviews which said that you could be waiting for ages. They have staff in the lobby who are basically 'meeters and greeters' and if you stand still for a minute you are approached and your query dealt with. The only time I could see there being a problem is if you were a group checking in at the separate group check in and it coincided with one of the many Qantas crews checking in or out you might have a wait. But as individuals we certainly had a good experience. I would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to be in the central area who want to explore on foot as well as having good access to local transport. Good value with the SIA Stopover.

While work was priority, staying at the Stamford allowed easy access to all of Singapore. The Rooms Had a room on the 36th floor overlooking the city (Boat Quay) and skyscrapers and it was amazing. The outdoor balcony was just really cool to walk out and see ALL of Singapore. If you go request a room at least on the 30th floor and higher, again facing the city would be best. I liked that they had a master control of lights, TV, Air all attached to the clock. So you didn't have to leave your bed to shut out lights or adjust the air. The only concern to me was the air. It was either too hot or too cold, couldn't find a way to adjust to a specific temperature, but was able to get used to it after a while. Overall Hotel Lobby was quite small and could get crowded at times, always something going on, wedding, convention so does get crowded although unless you are checking in or out or waiting for someone, no need to worry much on that. I did like that it was attached to the Raffles Plaza mall. Personally I didn't find the mall very good with stores, but also has access to the MRT (train, which is TOP NOTCH) and access to City Link and Sun City Malls, it was convienent on a rainy day, which it seems to do alot in December. Also Hotel had on I believe the 3rd floor, this GREAT Indian restaurant, forget the name... One thing I did find funny, was I read a previous comment before I left and it noted about the prostitutes who hang around the mall right at the entrance, well that is a very true statement. Surprised that they allow that, but I guess it added to the atmosphere in Singapore, shouldn't be too concerned as they seem to be respectable but would not want to have young kids around that area after 10pm. Location Again as mentioned access to all Singapore has to offer. If you are in decent condition and the weather is not brutally hot, easy walks to Arab St., Little India, and Boat and Clake Quay. A walk to Chinatown is not bad either but a little longer. Overall the hotel was great with location and service was decent.

This is a well located hotel being directly above City Hall MRT, and forms part of the Raffles City shopping complex which is joined to other nearby malls (Citylink, Marina Square and Suntec City). Great if you can't stand the Singapore heat as you don't need to step outside to get to them. The hotel is big and shares some facilities with the Fairmont (until recently known as Raffles the Plaza) next door, such as swimming pools and the gym and spa area - all of these are of good quality and very well maintained. Stayed in a Harbour King overlooking the Esplanade which was generous in size, and like all rooms has a balcony, so you can open the door and get fresh air, and not be hermetically sealed in your hotel room as is usually the case. Breakfast is in the Kopitiam or Cafe Swiss downstairs. Opted for Cafe Swiss which has a very good selection of food, and great service - the only gripe I would have was the way they present the cereal - on a three tiered structure with you having to use a regular sized spoon to serve yourself. Not so great if you are short and like a lot of cereal! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel but would say that's its not such a great place to stay at peak times (like New Year when I was there). As I said its a big hotel with over 800 rooms, and was very full during my second stay. To give and idea what its like at these times: - I waited about 10 minutes to be served at check in (though the three guests that were being served admittedly seemed very high maintenance). Check out however was a breeze (separate desk facing lifts). - The lift service was average (I waited 6 minutes in the lift lobby one morning to get to breakfast). - The Cafe Swiss gets very crowded (though to the hotel's credit they set up the buffet breakfast in an upstairs ballroom as an alternative location) - If you call for something to be brought to your room you could be waiting a while (45 minutes for ice). - The swimming pools on New Year's Eve afternoon were seething masses of humanity.

I did not need my key card to use these, despite having slots available on the panels to use them.

I raised it with a member of the Plaza staff as I passed him to get a response of \"there's a conference on\" but no other action. Likewise there were several hanging about outside the Plaza.

I had to keep repeating myself and the only time he truly snapped to attention was when I confirmed my reservation. When we checked in, the room on the higher floor that I'd requested (note -- it's the higher floors that have been renovated) was not ready. We were given one on a low floor. I decided to give it a chance but it wasn't long before we found 1) the previous occupants' crusty oily stains on the sheets and hairs in the sink, and 2) that the bathtub was not working (the stopper was screwed so there could be no chance of soaking in the tub). A technician came to try to fix the tub, but he could not. He had the sense to say he'd ask for another room for us. We eventually got another room -- on the supposedly renovated higher floor -- but on entering with the porter, we were all appalled to find the toilet repeatedly flushing and overflowing. The bathroom floor was flooded. I wasn't prepared to repack all my stuff AGAIN, so we sat down and waited for a technician to fix that and housekeeping to come clean up the bathroom. The technician took ages to come (while gallons of water continued pouring out), and housekeeping took even longer. We were dying to pee! And in the meantime, we found some creamy white stuff on the sheets... Honestly, like I'd said, the only things going for this hotel are the location -- being very central and connected to a nice mall -- and its breakfast buffets -- yummy, substantial and in a very pleasant environment. If you get one of those unrenovated rooms, be prepared for things not working and icky stuff on the old furnishings. Housekeeping is horribly inefficient -- you could be gone for 3 hours or even 6, and your room can still not be made up. And the scum on the bathtubs is proof of how well they do their job.

There are a lot of restaurants of all standards in the hotel and in the mall below. There is a blurring so it isn't that clear when you are in a hotel restaurant or outside. Our first breakfast was a disappointment, the main restaurant area looks spectacular but the food had a poor selection, it is a Swissotel and so was Swiss style, cheese, ham and buns, bircher muesli. Coffee was scarce. Service wasn't very good either - the receptionist and service staff seemed to be hiding if you looked at them. It took an expedition to find a very good breakfast place, outside next to the pool. We ate in the hotel restaurant and it was very good for service and style, but not cheap. We found two very plush restaurants in a passageway between the hotel and the mall - an Indian and a Thai. We chose the Indian and it was excellent, the food, service and decor - in Britain a place with decor like this would have cost hundreds of pounds but it was very reasonable. We also stumbled on a sandwich bar / deli with tables that overlook the mall and appears to be part of the hotel. The service and food was excellent there as well. There is long distance walking along City Mall which extends from the Stamford Mall, seems like about a mile of tunnels acting as a shopping mall. Also the subway station is an interchange so its good to go in most directions. Staying in this complex is one long period of discovery, there are bits that pop up everywhere and its all high quality.

The zoo was very good too however, if you are only doing one of these trips I highly recommend the night safari. The Swissotel is about 25 minutes in a taxi from the zoo and safari but taxi's are VERY cheap ($13 - around 5 British pounds!)

The breakfast was as varied, ample, and delicious as I've had anywhere, and the large, striking, three-story atrium breakfast room, made up in theatre what it lacked in intimacy. Unlike many of its four star brethren, the friendly staff did an excellent job of continuously cleaning my table of plates and keeping my tea topped up. Breakfast was served until 11:00 AM, which was terrific for my schedule. The major advantage of this hotel is its location. The hotel is attached to the Raffles City shopping mall, which itself is attached to the City Hall MRT station. Through numerous underground air conditioned tunnels, themselves constituting shopping malls, you can walk to The Esplanade, and to numerous shopping malls and a convention center.

In the past two years, however, the service and accomodations have deteriorated. You need to specify that you be given a room on the higher floors, as these have been renovated. I asked the front desk this last visit if the lower floors have been renovated, and I was told that not all rooms have been refurbished. There are 2 locations for breakfast. I found it odd that in one location, honey for toast was available, while in the other area, you would have to request for it. Breakfast coffee in this hotel is awful. But breakfast time is until 11am, which is great. Almost all hotels close their breakfast service by 10am or 10:30am. Check-out efficiency is hit-and-miss. My last stay, I was lucky, and was able to check out quickly. However, I have experienced very long check-outs here that have made me nervous about getting to the airport on time! Good feature are the ice-machines available on some floors; when you check in, ask if that floor has a working ice-machine. Bathroom amenities: even if there are two of you in the room, they'll only give you a set for one (so it's a scramble for the shower cap!). And replenishment of bathroom amenities also hit-and-miss; some days they give you a new bar of soap, other times they don't. The bathtub/shower is horrible; the half-glass door shower enclosure was a huge design mistake. it causes the bathroom to flood, once you take a shower. This last visit, half the shower time was spent mopping up the flooded floor! Room service is fair. I don't know if other hotels have first aid facilities, as I have never had use for them, although I travel constantly. This last time, I had a bad cut, and called for a band-aid. I was told I had to buy the whole pack of twenty for about S$5. I recall that in some hotels, you get band-aids in the room, so I was a bit surprised, but paid for it anyway (it was late in the evening, so I had no choice). This last stay, because they could not give me a room on a higher floor, I was \"upgraded\" to the member's floor. Normally, an upgrade implies either an upgrade of facilities, or added perks (like use of the members' lounge). In this case, I got nothing new for the \"upgrade\", it was the same-sized room, same amenities, no use of the lounge. And one of the two phones was busted. This used to be my favorite Singapore hotel, but in recent months, I've transferred my business to the Mandarin Oriental, where the accomodations are superior, the breakfast selection awesome, and the service and amenities exceptional.

As I entered the hotel, I was really impressed. It really feels and looks like a great hotel. The staff looks very professional in their nice uniforms. But that's where all my woes began! My company booked me here for a 4 day 3 night stay. I was told by our Singapore office that I will not pay anything and will just give my credit card for the customary \"incidentals deposit.\" But I was surprised that they were asking me to pay for the payment of my whole stay! I know there's a mix up and probably its not their fault if that's what their computer said! I was scrambling to call the Singapore office, unfortunately, the front desk people where not even offering for me use their phones! After countless haggling, they agreed for me to just swipe the card for the incidentals. I was given a room at the 48th floor with a stunning view of Suntec City and the Singapore River! The room is also elegantly furnished and the bathroom okay. My only problem is that the room is like so hot! The air-con is not woking properly! It feels like summer inside! I called up maintenance and they sent people to the room, they fixed it and told me that the unit is clogged but it will be okay. After an hour, it feels the same, I called up again and maintenance went there again! They said they fixed it but it was still hot. I am a very busy person preparing for work so I said to myself that I would rather work than mind this problem. I decided to sleep but my night was terribly hot! I woke up the next day and advised the front desk to fix the aircon. After a days work I returned to the room and at least it was quite cold. But after a few hours it was back to being hot!!! Again beacuse I am very busy, moving to another room is much more of a hassle so I just requested the hotel for an electric fan! Well it helped and I had a nice sleep. Breakfast was not that good though I love the pastrami! The location of the hotel is superb with the MRT literally just at the hotels door step. There is a good mall downstairs with a food court!

The hotel is well situated, particularly for the MRT and the adjoining shopping arcade is handy - particularly the little well-stocked supermarket in the basement. The Singapore Airlines 'hop-on' bus, which makes a round tour of the sights, stops close by (reduced fare with a SIA boarding pass, free on stopover packages) and is great if the humidity gets too much for walking far.

Slippers, bathrobe, iron+board, customizable AirCond, choice of pillows, easy-to-set alarm, electronic do-not-disturb button, quick dry-cleaner, quick check in and check out, helpful valet and taxi-hailing service are just a few of the very pleasant surprises.

There is a bar and restaurant on the top level of the hotel-The Equinox Complex (70-72nd floors). The best part was the location. The hotel is connected at the lobby level to Raffles City Shopping Centre. The shopping center is also connected to another Raffles hotel, Raffles The Plaza. Beneath the hotel and the shopping centre, is the City Hall Interchange for MRT. The hotel is close to the Esplanade and Marina Bay area.

I was just disappointed that I was assigned a 12th floor room. The breakfast was OK, I've had worse. Besides, I normally prefer a continental, anyway, when out on trips abroad--but I venture to taste local delights and specialties whenever I have the appetite for it. It could improve on variety, though. They, for example, only offer 3 kinds of juices--orange, pink guava and grapefruit. While their baked goodies were aplenty, some didn't taste appetizing at all. I also hope that they could find a more efficient and effective way of keeping the food warmer. I was travelling with my boss, who didn't like the place at all.

Overall, I would say it was disappointing for a raffles brand hotel at this price - were it 30-40% cheaper, I wouldn't be complaining.", "Date": "October 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland Central, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cLove it...\u201d", "Author": "StillPhone", "ReviewID": "UR4003956", "Content": "I've been staying at this hotel on business trips since 1983 and love the place. The rooms are always clean and airconditioned well, which is a big deal in Singapore. Higher floors are generally nicer but the rooms are always large which ever floor you get. The only problem I have experienced is that sometimes the rooms are so large that remote control for the TV doesn't work! The arrival desk used to be slow but on my last trip they had fixed that problem. I always get the train from the airport rather than taxis as the hotel is on top of the train station.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery dissapointing for a 5 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "member078", "ReviewID": "UR3901221", "Content": "Just got back from a 6 night stay here. I originally chose this hotel because of the location and the good rate i was given.However when I went to check in i noticed that the rate was actually much higher then what i was told. They add extra tax that you dont know about until you get the bill.Dont believe the pictures on the website, the rooms look NOTHING like this!! I was given a room on the 56th floor and was promised a riverview, instead I got views of building work,suntec city and a quarter of the river! A few times i found little ants crawling round near the bedside cabinet, apart from this the room was clean. I expected so much better for a 5 star and was very dissapointed. the reception staff were not very helpful. breakfast was average, there should be more choice.The best part about this hotel is the excellent location, City hall MRT is right on the doorstep and suntec city a few mins walk.Overall i wouldnt stay here again, for the same money you can stay at a much better hotel. i would rate this hotel an average 3 star.", "Date": "September 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cAverage services--dissapointing for a 5 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "Singapore12345", "ReviewID": "UR3754551", "Content": "The stay was meant to be a menigful stay as I was supposed to celebrate National Day, The check-in was extremely slow although there were only a few guest.
