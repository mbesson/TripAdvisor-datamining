The lobby does have internet-capable computers for 200 yen ($2) per 30 minutes. Here are a few helpful hints: To get there, take the Tokyo metro to Kayabacho station and take the exit numbered 4b. Be careful to choose the right side of the station before you exit the metro, because you can only get to exit 4b if you exit by one side and not the other (though if you make a mistake, don`t freak out, it will just be a little more difficult to find the hotel).
