Our tea was then served a selections of sandwiches, some small cakes and two scones with pots of jam and cream, everything was delishous. We chose to have pots of tea (though we could have had coffee) and there was a good selection of teas we could have had, being boring we just chose the breakfast tea.

Oh dear we thought and started to panic rang late rooms back up to say hopefully we could cancel due to the negative reviews they have had. Lateroom's got straight onto the case but called back five minutes later to ask that the manager was not in until tomorrow so we MAY end up paying even if we didn't stay. So I blamed the poor old husband and he took the ear bashing. We went and had a great day out then decided to check in to see what we had let ourselves in for. Firstly we arrived to see a notice on the front door to check in at Tophams Hotel no 28 instead of No 50 which annoyed me as we had walked back and lets face was this place was never going to stand a chance especially as when we walked into Tophams what a lovely bright, clean and shiny reception, so we negatively checked in for Belgravia Mews then to be told that Tophams was not fully booked so they had upgraded us to for the same price, I honestly saw my husband's shoulders lift about a foot with relief so went happily to our room No 4 which was in the basement opened the door and got a really pleasant surprise considering what we thought we would be getting!! then on closer inspection...... there was a really bad odour of damp/drains in the room, the shower lights were not working, a HUGH bath but the shower attachment would only work with the bath taps on, sealing and grouting missing in the bathroom, chips on the woodwork and the carpet could have done with a good clean, the mattress was so soft you sunk in the middle and then the air conditioning seemed to have a mind of its own. However remember we got this at a bargain price of \u00c2\u00a362.16 including breakfast so should we be complaining probably not! The next morning we remember the clonking noise as people walked through the reception area above but we had things to do so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a lay in (good job really). We also then noticed no milk or English tea in the hospitality tray so ventured to breakfast. English breakfast luckily for us was included in the price although again I think this was because we had been upgraded as I heard someone enquire if they could have a cooked breakfast. The waitress obviously says yes but it was \u00c2\u00a319.95, thank goodness she declined. The breakfast was buffet style and when I got there they had run out of eggs and bacon, the rest was all being kept warm under not very efficient chaffing tins. The Danish pastries were excellent though so probably best to stick to continental breakfast. Summary: We did well in the end for \u00c2\u00a362.16 in the middle of London and were grateful for the upgrade despite the maintenance issues. The reason why I am publishing this on both hotels is to warn others not to pay TOO much for the Topham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotel as it does have its downfalls and perhaps try and get an upgrade if you are staying at Belgravia Mews which we could not fault as we did not stay there. All staff were polite but when we pointed out the smell issue not much notice was taken so overall ok but wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay over the top for this hotel.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood location on quiet street\u201d", "Author": "Kazza940", "ReviewID": "UR125335840", "Content": "The hotel overall was very nice and the rooms well appointed and nicely furnished however quite small rooms - no need to put in quite so much furniture.

Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The actual hotel accomodation was quite nice. Rooms furnished tastefully, although ours was a little cramped and very hot. So far, so good. We had our meal booked for 7.30pm (having preordered from a limited menu on a \"romantic 3 course meal with champagne\" deal with Groupon). We went to the bar at 7pm, which was not staffed, so we had to ask in reception for drinks. We were brought our complimentary glass of champagne. After making our way to our table, we asked for wine with our meal. Nope, don't have any wine. WHAT???!!!! have you ever ever ever been to a restaurant in a four star hotel in London that doesn't serve wine?. Ridiculous - bordering on the Faulty Towers. From here, it went swiftly downhill. The \"carrot soup\" was blended carrots, heated in the microwave and was the consistency of baby food. The waitress explained that it was \"creamed\" and this is how they make it italian style. Never had soup like that in my life. Gloup more like. Bruschetta was french stick, with a couple of mushroom, smoked salmon, very basic, very poor, very disappointing. Don't get me started on the mains, they appeared within seconds of the starter being removed. Lasagne was Findus like, microwaved tosh, with a few dry cucumber slices as garnish. No option to order sides, no fresh veg, no chips nothing. Chicken salad, plonked on rocket with some small cubed potatoes and cherry tomatoes. No dressing. Dry, tasteless non descript. Had better food in a Harvester. In fact, later in the evening we went to Victoria station and got an Upper Crust cheese and tomatoe roll that was infinitely better that what we'd eaten at the hotel. Oh and because there wasn't any wine (still can't quite believe it), my husband asked for a bottled beer with his meal, that was served warm, and in a warm glass. Classy. NOT GOT A CLUE. Fits of giggles ensued, it was that bad. On checking out we explained how disappointing the meal was and was told that they would tell the \"management\". The \"management\" needs a few lessons in how a restaurant should be run. This is a nice hotel on the surface, but that's as far as it goes, scratch underneath and it's not good.

The hotel is badly managed, badly maintained and the staff are atrocious. So where to start. The room my children stayed in had water stains on the ceiling, damp carpet near the fridge, we are not sure if this was as a result of a leaking bathroom or fridge. We requested an extra bad for a night and I eventually had to put it outside the room as it wasn't removed a day after it was used....we then had to move the bed from in front of the bedroom door for 2 days as that is where it stayed and the children couldn't get in or out of the bedroom without moving the bed. On about day 3 of a very long week stay my daughter finally took the toilet holder that had fallen off the wall down to reception and asked that it be reattached to the wall and two days later had to request again that it be fixed. Adding to the trials of this room was an airconditioner that had a mind of its own and either created arctic conditions during the night or was like living under a flight path. (we did notice in both our rooms that the airconditioners changed temperature on their own or turned on and off at will). The final straw came when the electricity tripped in the room and the hotel then became a family joke 'Fawlty Towers' would have been luxurious in comparison. So to room 2.........we asked for another room with 2 single beds and received a room with a queen and a fold out cotbed. The cot bed collapsed one evening and it took about an hour to get it back up correctly. The permanent bed was lumpy and I could almost feel the springs in it at night. One of the things that amazed me the most was the fact that there were no mattress protectors and 3 small pillows that had seen better days. And then there was the bathroom......bathgel and shampoo and small amounts of soap are hardly 4 star not even tissues on offer. There is no towel rack near the shower (except the broken one behind the door) and so the trek from shower to grab a dry towel each day was a pain. The reason we couldn't leave towels near the shower was that the shower leaked and the floor became very dangerous after the shower was used. The shower also flooded and on the second day I decided to try and find out why....I removed the drain cover and found a few years worth of hair clogging the drain...........I mentioned this to reception and yes the shower was cleaned up but seriously absolutely no apology just the offer of coffee. And now on to reception.......so many staff, no one had any idea what they were doing and they were all obviously stressed as it was a bit like watching chickens with their heads cut off. I hate complaining and as nothing we asked to have repaired while we were there was done |I thought this was a perfect venue to voice a few complaints.

It was late so we didnt bother to do anything - as us Brits normally do - and got up in the morning feeling cold and tired after a very uncomfortable night on our very uncomfortable bed! Had to put up with noisy cleaners during the day time and noisy guests from either side and above - not sure it was their fault but think the walls were paper thin! We had a good cooked English breakfast with no complaints. We then went to check out and aired our complaints about the room to the American receptionist who took absolutely no notice of our tale of woe and in fact ignored us completely when the phone rang.

We then got in to an argument with the duty manager who had our reservation starting the next night. All we had was the reservation number and not the email confirmation. She refused to check their reservations emails and sent us home at 10pm with no hotel room. She insisted there was no way their reservations team would allow a groupon voucher for a Fri and Sat night. We were also expecting a dinner at the hotel included with our voucher and even though we called in advance to check on the closing time of the restaurant - its open 24 hrs we were told (that already rang alarm bells) but alas, the chef had gone home at 9pm so dinner wasnt possible. So bags in hand and no dinner we went back home (luckily we live in North London) and surprise, surprise we found the email confirmation changing our dates to the Fri and Sat night so we were right, she was wrong. We called the hotel immediately asking for her to call us back in the morning when she arrived at work and forwarded the email to the reception. Surprise, surprise she never called back. So we called her. She then kept us waiting on the phone for 15 mins and finally came back to us to say their computer systems were down. By this stage we were completely fed up. Our weekend was completely ruined and we hadnt even got passed the reception area of this horrendous hotel and we were treated like liars and spoken to like we were completely stupid.

By the time the rest of the rest of the food arrived a good 30 minutes later, we had just had enough and wanted to leave. There was a four person queue for the one available guest toilet, we were then shown to a second toilet on the second floor....again not what I expected, one toilet for a dining room full of guests?? All in all a very disappointing experience and with none of the attention and ambiance that is usual at an afternoon tea treat. Very disappointed, especially after attending similar experiences in the same area/similar hotels and leaving feeling like we have had a treat.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about anyone else but I get very impatient with surprises so forced him to tell me at least where we were staying. He told me we were staying at Tophams Hotel, so straight away came on here to read reviews and see pictures. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lie; by reading some of the reviews on here I was very very worried that my experience would not be one that I would like to remember!! Once arriving though all my worries literally disappeared. The hotel is hidden on a quiet road near Victoria Station, hidden from all the noisy roads, and has a tonne of restaurants in the area. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is amazing, reminded me of Moulin Rouge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very sophisticated!! The staff were very friendly and upgraded us on the spot when I mentioned that it was our anniversary. I did want to look at both possible rooms though (just in case!) and in fact found it hard to decide over a double room on the first floor or the suite on the second floor, they were gorgeous, clean and quiet! (I chose the suite though, why not!) We then went back downstairs and checked in (fastest check in to date) and went up to our room. The staff were helpful for the remainder of our stay, helping us book taxi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, made reservations at restaurants (We were originally going to an Italian but decided to change to a French one last minute). I am usually someone who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like hotel breakfasts, but Tophams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 breakfast was amazing, definitely cured the hangover from the first night! Before we left we saw that afternoon tea was available in the hotel and thought we might as well kill some time as checkout was at midday but our train was at 4. The afternoon tea definitely topped the whole experience off!! My weekend was amazing; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a weekend I will never forget. I do feel bad that the hotel has received such bad reviews but in my mind, when you have a good experience you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think to state all the time that you did via reviews, but if you did have a bad time or even had a tiny thing go wrong you do make a big deal out of it.

I'm afraid I would be nervous of staying here again in case I was given one of their not-so-nice rooms.

We were then shortlytaken to our superb room on the second floor with a small but decent balconyoverlooking the main street. We were assured it would not be noisy as ourneighbours included Ian Fleming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.It could not get any better than that I told my husband. The room was of a very good size; wallpaper was fresh and fashionable,everything clean, no stains or smells (as we are a non smoking couple we cansometimes be put off by the smell of cigarettes left by previous guests butthis hotel did not have any dodgy smells). There was also a minibar withdrinks and snacks, menu for the dinner, hairdryer, and a telephone tocontact reception. When we called the reception to order our dinner we wereoverwhelmed as the hotel was serving that night freshly prepared Italiancuisine by the Italian chef. So we were told, and as it is our favouritecuisine we could not wait to try it. Bathroom was immaculate and it had plenty of toiletries so we had a quickshower and headed downstairs to have our dinner at about 8:30 pm. We were seated in the restaurant with very good lighting and observatory.The furniture was lovely and the silver cutlery well cleaned. No one couldargue it was of 4 star standard, in fact I would give it a half more for theservice we received throughout the evening and our dinner. Also I must notethat some of the public bathrooms in other hotels are appalling and dirty,so I was glad that the bathroom at the Tophams was well maintainedthroughout the evening despite of many guests at the restaurant. Having few sips of our Champagne, which could have possibly been SparklingWine I did not pay it much importance, as the atmosphere was warm and thewaitress attended our table immediately without making us wait.

Yes my stomach can tell, and I canassure anyone that the food served in the Tophams Hotel is not anything butfreshly cooked delicious Italian cuisine.

I was a little apprehensive about this booking as I forgot about trip advisor for in-depth reviews and just went with the booking website reviews. Most of the reviews on TripAdvisor as im sure you are aware seem quite negative. I am relating most to the people who seemed to have ended up being stuck in a basement room or moved to a sister or annex hotel. With this in mind I emailed after making my booking ensuring I requested not to be in a basement room nor should I be moved to an annex/sister hotel as it wasn't stated that this may occur on the booking website. I had a response back within 4 hours of sending my intiial enquiry. Relating back to the reviews, I can honestly say I haven't had any problems with my stay at this hotel and would go as far as saying it is one of the best and more homely hotels I've stayed in. Upon arrival to a warm, well decorated reception area, I was offered a pastry and a seat while they booked me in. As I had booked at a special promotion rate I was subject to a \u00c2\u00a350 pre-authorisation fee for my room, I was happy with this as they went to the trouble to amend their booking details while I was present as I had mentioned that it was not clear anywhere. I was then provided with my keycard and informed where my room was (Room 304). This room was on the 3rd floor and I made use of the elevator, they should maybe move the Christmas tree from directly outside of the elevator as you couldn't really get by - minor really. I opened the door to my room expecting the worst but in all honesty it was lovely, a little small but it was a single room (despite a double bed) and more than adequate. I decided to have a little look around, noticing that the room had air conditioning, a flat screen digital tv on the wall, adequate lighting, a soft-drink mini-bar, tea and coffee facilities and shower items - shampoo & shower gel. In a cupboard near the bathroom was a small iron and ironing board, something you don't often find in many hotels. The room also came with a hair dryer, although this was found in a draw in the bed side units. The bathroom consisted of a standard walk in shower unit which was simpl wonderful, the pressure was perfect and the temperature easy to set. The room was well ventilated and roomy with 2 large towels, a floor mat and 2 smaller hand towels. I needed to use the Wi-Fi and found this a breeze to get onto also, the network ID is Speedway, this opens up a wi-fi portal site informing you the wi-fi is free to use, it's very quick too. I also felt a little warm as had been rushing about on the tube so decided to open my window...low and behold you could open it fully, a miricale in the hotel world it would seem! The bed is extremely comfy and slept like a baby, pillows a plenty and also had a winter fleece thing stowed away in the cupboard with the iron and safety deposit box. Breakfast is served from 7-10am and is well set out. Most rooms come with a free continental breakfast which includes your usual pastries, cereals, toast, tea, coffee and fruit salad. The dining area is very well laid out and the food was very nice. As I said, I cannot fault this place and would certainly stay here again should I visit London. It's in a great location with minimal noise, great reception staff, adequately sized rooms and generally a lovely place. If there is one criticism of the place it would be the lack of information in the room, no prices for the mini-bar, no room service menu and no local information, oh and 2 of the lamps in the room were missing bulbs. That said, a pleasent stay, and a peaceful nights sleep, perhaps my emails before hand might have put them on edge a little and assigned me a better room than what some people have experienced. I really would visit here again as it is lovely and at the price I paid for the room I really cannot fault it.

On arrival I was told there was a \"power outage\" in some of the rooms and I would have to be transferred to another hotel in Victoria. A taxi was called to take me there. Whilst I awaited my taxi, alarm bells were already ringing and things went from bad to worse quickly. Arriving at the second hotel, which happened to be Tophams hotel I was ushered to a separate annex and down a dark, dreary basement-like staircase (where just to add effect a mattress was thrown against the wall on the landing) to a dark basement room with no windows, no light in the room aside from one functioning lamp and a dim light in the bathroom, an nonfunctional phone, no internet access, cold/unwelcoming decor.... without exaggeration it was the most hideous room I had ever been in and I felt very unsafe. I used my mobile to ring reception to ask to be moved to no avail and spent a very anxious night before packing my bags as early as possible and insisting I be moved the next morning. It is difficult to truly describe how awful this basement room was, it felt to be descriptive \"brothel like\".

I received a complimentary breakfast whilst I waited to speak with a manager who never appeared and I was placed in a much more amenable room at approx 10am the next morning.

What a let down! For a 4 star hotel this place leaves a lot to be desired! Everything looked great on arrival as we entered a rather delightful entrance and reception area. But this would prove to be the best experience we would get of the Tophams Hotel. Firstly our check in process was interrupted by a fellow resident who had a rather long list of complaints about her room. Hardly a good omen! Then, after it took the hopelessly inadequate reception staff a full 35 minutes to check our party of 8 in, and we had bartered with them to try and upgrade (unsuccessfully in 5 instances) the single rooms we had all been allocated into doubles, we were taken to our rooms one by one. I arrived at my room (room 209) to find it was barely big enough to swing a rat never mind a cat! The room itself contained a single bed, 2 small bedside cabinets and....well....nothing else! The built in wardrobe contained no coat hangers, the ceiling light was a bulb on a wire with no shade and the lamp did not work and, incredibly for a 4 atar hotel, no ensuite bathroom! The bathroom was a shared one down the corridor. The lack of ensuite bathroom meant there was no running water in the room, yet there was a kettle!! With tea and coffee but no milk!! Presumably I was expected to trek down the corridor to the bathroom to fill my kettle? Perhaps the milk was in the bathroom? Perhaps I should have looked!! :) I would later find out that some of my colleagues rooms were litttle better, one actually arriving in his room to find a pile of dirty linen on the floor!! So leaving the room for our evening event, we comforted ourselves in the knowledge that at least there would a nice warm bed to return too later that evening and a nice breakfast to set us on our way the following morning! But the disappointment was not over! On our return to the hotel we asked the staff if there was a bar nearby we could go and get a drink. They were less than helpful! Then we asked if we could have a drink in the hotel. We could.....so long as we liked rose sparkling wine!!! There was nothing else apparently. I retired to my rat pen of a room and looked forward to breakfast. I arrived at breakfast to find my colleague receiving his upgraded full English! \u00c2\u00a320 of wholesome breakfast! But no! The large food warmers were kept warm using a candle!! At least it was a 4 star candle!! The breakfast arrived cold on an even colder plate. My colleague complained, the breakfast was replaced with one of the warm variety and after eating his way through half of it he discovered a rather uncooked pink sausage!!! At this point he, and the rest of us gave up, checked out and headed to Kings Cross. I have never looked forward to an East Coast mainline breakfast as mch in my life!! Not a good experience.

There was just a flimsily locked door with no night staff, one reason I always stayed there was because it was small and friendly and there was always someone on the door so as a lone female traveller I always felt safe. The shower room had a large uncurtained window on to a road with houses opposite. The light above the sink, which had no plug, was broken, and the toilet cistern was adrift from the wall. In the morning there was no water, hot or cold. In the room both twin beds were broken, the TV remote did not work and the carpet was badly stained. The decor was ghastly and there was no furniture apart from the beds. I packed my bag in the morning and refused to go back.

We were informed that they had goofed and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a room with two beds that we had paid for (there were two of us staying in the room) but not to worry they had fixed the problem and put a second bed in our small room. What a joke. The bed they included in our room made the room so crowded you could hardly walk to the bathroom without moving things. The new bed turned out to be a small metal cot frame with a 2-inch thick mattress. The center bar to the cot frame was broken/bent in such a way that it stuck up into your back and made it absolutely impossible to put your full weight onto the mattress and fall asleep. In the end the frame was removed and one of us ended up sleeping on the floor. The hotel apologized but had no other way to help us and expected us to be happy about that and stop complaining. So in the end we had to choose between staying or going someplace else and loosing the money for the unused nights. We decided to stay rather than spend double for the rest of our trip. On a side note most nights I noticed that they had overbooked and had to turn guests away to a cheaper hotel for the same price. They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that friendly to the guests they overbooked and acted like they had done nothing wrong and that the guest should simply accept their accident (or standard practice) and smile.

I gave him some hotels to look at and he chose this one. It is a very attractive hotel with an excellent location for Victoria train and coach stations being just around the corner. However, the website says there is a full English breakfast but when we booked there was no online option for this to added on and we expected that as we were having the deluxe room it was included in the package. That was not the case and it was never offered to us. On arrival the receptionist took our payment and immediately after charged us an EXTRA \u00c2\u00a380 'pre booking confirmation'. We are still trying to work that one out but have been reassured it will be refunded. Our room was reasonably sized and wonderfully decorated but something was missing. The tea and coffee making facilities had only two coffee sachets and two tea bags, lots of sugar (which we don't take), NO milk and no spoons. In the bathroom, the complimentary quality toiletries were one tiny shampoo and matching shower gel and one tiny piece of soap. The light bulb over the bath had blown and the dressing desk lamp didn't work even after we changed the bulb. The other annoying thing was the lack of a hairdryer. My husband got onto the phone and requested the missing milk spoons and hair dryer and mentioned the non-working lamp. A while later, someone arrived with two spoons. Again we mentioned the missing milk and coffee/tea. They were brought up later on a plate. We reminded them about the hair dryer and lamp. The hair dryer arrived as did a bulb. We let her try the bulb but she agreed it was the lamp that was not working. She said they would ask the maintenance person to look in. We went out to a concert and the lamp had been replaced whilst we were out. Next morning we went to have breakfast and were told we could only have the continental breakfast and if we wanted cheese or meat we would have to request it. On the menu it stated that the continental breakfast is \u00c2\u00a314.95 and the full English \u00c2\u00a319.95. The website would have you believe otherwise. We went out after breakfast and didn't return until mid afternoon to change and prepare for our evening out. It was a huge surprise to us to walk in and find the bed still unmade, towels not changed and tea/coffee etc not replenished. By this time I was so irritated I forced myself to take a long bath and not get into a dispute with the reception staff. At 16.15 there was a knock on the door and as my husband was in the shower I answered it wearing only my bath towel. It was the maid who had come to clean the room !!! At a quarter past FOUR in the afternoon !!! I said it was not a good time and she left. We never saw her again. The room had cost \u00c2\u00a3384 for two nights and whilst the staff (all female) were pleasant, they seemed slow to respond.

The bath was enormous and I was really looking forward to filling it up and having a long soak........no plug and no one available to find one on a Saturday afternoon. Again, newly renovated??? The paint and plaster were coming off of the wall in some places. There was only one tiny extractor in this big bathroom..... which was placed next to the fire alarm.

Refused room and given one in the main building. Had booked a twin, they provided a small room, queen bed, and offered to play a camp bed in the room. Was late for a concert, so just agreed. Camp bed was old, smelly, no sheet provided for the blanket, had to call for one when we returned. Room would have been acceptable for 1 person, certainly not 2, and definitely not a camp bed. Whilst everything looked newish, you can see that it was done on the cheap and there was a lot of wear already. AC was useless, shower was outside of the bathroom (odd) and the main door rattled each time someone on the same floor opened/closed their door. Hardly managed any sleep, mix of the camp bed (whilst collapsed in the middle of the night, and the noise from the corridor).

I stayed for 2 nights last week. The reception area is lovely but when I checked in I was told they couldn't accept my Maestro card (I had already checked prior to the stay that they would accept the Maestro card.....) and then had to go back to the nearest ATM at Victoria Station to take out money so I could pay the deposit in cash. Upon leaving to do this the door handle came off in my hand, comedy moment but not a great start.... After checking in I was pleasantly surprised by the room - although small the decor was modern and the bathroom was a good size. I was a bit taken aback by the small but steep flight of stairs that you had to descend to get down to the wardrobe and bathroom. It proved no problem to me but if you have mobility problems (or just don't want to be trailing down a flight of stairs in the middle of the night to visit the bathroom !) then you might want to request a room where the en suite is on the same level as the room. I would advise anyone travelling who perhaps fancies a drink in the hotel bar that they don't serve alcohol. I was going to have a quiet glass of wine and was advised by the staff that there is no alcohol served there and I would have to go to the nearest bar, needless to say I didn't bother. On the whole the decor and vibe of the hotel is nice and the location near to Victoria and Belgravia is certainly handy and a pleasant area to stay in. However, I would say that this is definitely not a 4* hotel - it has obviously been given a lick of paint and a cosmetic upgrade in the past few years and although that's ok I did notice a lot of issues (stained blind in bathroom, warm mini-fridge, comedy door handle on front of hotel....) that they still need to sort out.

On arrival, late in the evening, we approached the hotel. From the outside it looks nice and reception area is lovely however, this is the only good thing I could say about this place. We checked in and were taken outside the hotel again, along the road and into another building. We were taken up about 4 flights of stairs (carrying our own heavy bags) and as we got higher up we realised that this was nothing like what we had booked. The wall paper was peeling off the ceiling and you could see damp coming through the walls. The carpets were badly stained with what looked like paint. The receptionist took us firstly to the wrong room and so we were up and down the narrow stairs lke a yo-yo (with our bags in tow)!! When we eventually got to our room, it was horrible!!! My friend immediately complained and said that we would not be staying here as it was not what we had booked from the website. They eventually took us and our bags back to reception where we were met with the manager on duty. I say manager but she was no where near a manager. We explained the situation and she said that unfotunately the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing she could do. An absolute disgrace that they had overbooked the hotel and had basically thrown us into a dump next door. She did eventually offer us a room at their sister hotel in Knightsbridge for the night but on looking this up on the i-phone it had even worse reviews than Tophams ad we refused to go there. We asked for a refund and thought we could book somewhere else but she said she could not give us a refund as we had booked through trip advisor. She had a huge attitude problem and was extremely rude when it was the hotel that were in the wrong. She kept saying that she did not have authority to make decisions - well, why was she the manager on duty then??

My friend had booked via late rooms but had booked a non-refundable room so when we read the reviews and wanted to swap hotels we were told there was no way this would be possible. Great! A bit of a worry considering I'm almost 6 months pregnant and we were reading all kinds of things about no en-suite rooms, camp beds and alternative hotels which sounded awful. So, my friend decided to call the hotel repeatedly checking the room we booked was available as booked with en-suite etc. This seemed to have worked because when we arrived for the bank holiday weekend, checking in at 4pm on the Saturday, everything was fine! Phew! The lift is a bit small but to be honest we were only on the first floor so we decided to walk to our room as often as possible since the lift seemed to take ages. When we got up to our room everything was fine. We checked the toilet flush, shower, tv etc. The only thing I couldn't find was a fire safety sheet which should have been placed on the door. We eventually found it in the wardrobe and it was very basic to say the least, not sure what a fire safety officer would make of it, but there you go! So, the room was fine, yes it's definitely NOT a 4* and nor should it ever be listed as one but it was absolutely fine and the beds were comfy, the air con worked fine as long as you had it on during the day and it was switched off at night, and despite being at the front of the hotel it was very quiet and a convenient location. I would agree with some comments about the breakfast though. Not great but it depends what you want. The most basic of choices and judging by the ocado van we saw parked outside on the Sunday morning, that's obviously where they get their food from!! But, all I wanted was a bowl of cereal and some toast and there was plenty of that. Infact you had to cook the toast yourself which I quite liked because it meant I could toast it as much or as little as I wanted. I do appreciate what people say about the room being small and not being able to move chairs though. Fortunately, the breakfast room really wasn't very busy when we went in so we could sit anywhere we wanted. I kept wondering if there were less people staying there than usual for a bank holiday due to some of the reviews on here which is a shame because it's not a bad hotel from my experience. I didn't appreciate the fact we has to sign for what we were eating before we had eaten anything, they could have just noted what we were eating and added it to the bill at check out and I do think it's a little bit mean to state breakfast on the booking, when what they mean is 'continental' and nothing else. In fact, you have to pay extra for a bowl of fruit and any yoghurts, (not that I could see any yoghurts anyway!!) So, all in all the hotel was fine. I can't comment on the \u00c2\u00a32 charge that somebody else mentioned but I will get my friend to check her statement next month since they took a pre-authorisation amount of \u00c2\u00a3100 from her credit card, but they did give a receipt to prove that's what they had taken. The staff were friendly and helpful and kept our bags for us whilst we dud some more exploring of London on the Monday. Would I stay here again? Based on my own experience yes, probably. However, there's just too many bad reviews to run the risk again, which is a shame, because if we hadn't read thes beforehand I certainly wouldn't have felt as worried nor the need to book other hotels just in case this one was as bad as some of the reviews state!!", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAn unpleasant hotel choice\u201d", "Author": "Drucherry", "ReviewID": "UR117501405", "Content": "This was booked through lastminute website for our wedding anniversary.

Tophams Hotel were aware of our name and the guests names. I went in advance to book in person and received an excellent and attentive service from the very sweet receptionist and was assured that our specific requirements would be met, the guests were expected on an early morning flight from USA.

On the day, I telephoned early on the morning to be informed that the previous occupants had checked out but they would not get the room ready any earlier than 2pm. We rang later and were informed that the room was ready for check in and we went on ahead with the luggage (to unpack and prepare their personal items). We were met with a disgruntled guest arguing with the receptionist! (not the one who had made our booking). We then had to wait an eternity whist another guest was checked in at snails pace! The foreign and unprofessional receptionist with an attitude problem, refused to let us have access to the room to leave the luggage or even to give us the keys. We very calmly and patiently explained the situation (several times) and this made her even more resolute and demanded that the staying guests HAD to check in themselves and give their own C/C details, we were informed that she would not deal with us (even though the booking was in my name, fully paid and they had my C/C details AND I HAD ALL PAPERWORK WITH ME!!! . It could have been a scene from Fawlty Towers! In between all of this a friend of hers came in to chat, a black guy wearing a baseball cap and hoodie and upon seeing my face she told him she would speak to him later and he left. By now (approx 15 minutes later) my patience had deserted me and I very forcefully told her to bring the manager to sort this out immediately before I lost my temper - I was told the manager was off sick! I had to tell her to get me someone who had at least minimum intelliegence and common sense and told her there was going to be a lot of trouble if we did not get into the room RIGHT NOW! She went off and returned with someone else who asked us to take the luggage to the dining room, thinking that someone was going to take it up to the room we did so and returned to reception to be told that we could leave the luggage there until our guests checked in (in a public unsecured area)! I retrieved the luggage which was in the process of being moved to the kichen by a kitchen employee?? I told them it was well after check in time and demanded the keys immediately and asked for someone to bring the luggage to the room (suprise - there was no one available)! The girl was told by another employee to take us to the room - we were met outside the room by cleaning staff, heaps of used bedding and cleaning items AND THIS IS WELL AFTER CHECK IN TIME. Apart from a huge cobwed floating on the ceiling the room looked small but okay, however, another problem was that it was a double room not a twin room and was told by the same receptionist that as it was mother and daughter that it should not be a problem for them to sleep together!!! I was told they were twin beds pushed together and that our guests could seperate them if they so wished. I told them the guests would be arriving very shortly and ordered THEM to seperate and prepare them without delay as per our booking and specific requirements. I also asked if the cleaners would be moving everything out of the hallway before they arrived and was assured they would. 15 minutes later we took the guests to the hotel and the receptionist again tried to demand their C/C details, eventually we go them to the room where we yet again were met with the cleaners, used laundry in the hall and cleaners just finishing off in their room. I did not have any further dealings with the hotel but am informed that it was not a good experience and our guests also did not even go down for breakfast there despite payment for breakfast appearing on our C/C statement!

Firstly the room i had on the ground floor was clean and had everything i needed [including air conditioning, on what happened to be a stinking hot day] The reasons it could have been worse; the room was tiny and i mean very small, so it was a good job I was travelling alone. It was supposed to be a double room but the bed was only a 4ft6 bed and there was definitely not enough room for two people. I would suggest booking a twin room and then pushing the beds together, or better still only stay here if you are travelling alone. The mattress also needed replacing but being alone i could sleep at an angle. The shower was good but there wasn't much room to get ready for the evening event i was attending.

The reception area has not enough room and too many staff and the breakfast room was tiny with too many tables crammed in. At best this hotel could be an upmarket 3 star hotel but they advertise as a 4 star, charge 4 star prices and then a guest is disappointed. I heard guests at another table telling the waitress they had breakfast included in the rate, but she said yes only a continental breakfast. The guest argued the type of breakfast wasn't specified and the waitress agreed he was right but that when the hotel includes the breakfast it is only ever a continental, not a cooked. He asked how he was supposed to guess this fact and she just shrugged. The breakfast was hugely overpriced for the choices available. There were no wholegrain cereals and apart from toast, some very tired pastries and a bit of fruit. Another guest asked whether she could have her croissants warmed, but the waitress just said no! I informed the staff I only wanted a continental breakfast and within seconds of me sitting down to eat my cereal I had the bill shoved in front of my face. The waitress looked shocked when i told her i would deal with it when i had finished eating! I have travelled extensively and stayed in all sorts of places and there are so many B+B's that are better than this hotel could ever be, I think they need to remarket. There are so many fantastic big hotels in London that given the choice it would be better to go somewhere else that you are guaranteed a certain standard [Hilton, Thistle etc] If this hotel wants to start getting better reviews it would be better becoming a plush Bed and Breakfast or perhaps just retrain the staff and replace all the beds! Not to mention knock a few walls down to give guests the space they need to dry their hair!

My friend and I eventually managed to get through on the phone number given and booked for a Monday afternoon. When we got there, the receptionist showed us to an empty dining room, where a waitress looked surprised at having customers and told us we could sit anywhere. It was a blazing hot day, and the dining room had a glass ceiling so the place felt like a greenhouse. We were given a tea menu, which had a poor selection of Twinings tea bags, and I then had to wait 15 minutes while one of the receptionists ran to the shop to buy a box of the tea I'd asked for (although the waitress didn't actually bother to tell me this until I asked why it was taking so long). We still hadn't received any food by this time, and when we asked about this we were told the person who does afternoon tea doesn't actually work at the hotel and was running late. She arrived 25 minutes after our booking time, and offered us a glass of sparkling wine before the food. After 10 minutes, I had to find a waitress and remind her of this, after which we received glasses of cheap non-sparkling chardonnay in sparkling wine glasses. The food then arrived on a cake stand that hadn't been screwed together properly. The sandwiches were below average, the portions of clotted cream were ridiculous so we had to ask for more. The cakes consisted of half a cream doughnut, a meringue, a miniature cupcake and a small piece of chocolate cake that I recognized as being from Tesco. We left most of the food, and had to use the nasty wine to wash away the taste, as even this wasn't as bad as the cakes. In addition, there was one toilet for guests which had a large bag of rubbish outside and some cleaning products so I couldn't get to it and had to try again later. The service and standard of food was appalling. The person who runs the afternon teas has no idea what one should actually be like, and is providing an extremely poor service a prices comparable to the Park Lane hotel (which is excellent).

I was quite shocked when the receptionist who was helping us said come this way, and proceeded to take us down the street (about 100 meters) to one of the other parts of the hotel. We were taken to the very end unit (I belive it is called the Belgravia) where we had to carry our luggage up two flights of stairs (isn't so bad, but we weren't even offered assistance). Once in our room, it immediately smelled like mould. I wanted to leave, but my boyfriend didn't want to make a fuss. The room was small, it was noisy, the shower drain didn't drain properly so you would have to run the water to get yourself wet, shut the water off, lather, turn the water back on and hope that it didn't take you too long or else the shower would overflow. It was obvious that the drain had been a problem for a while as you could see the black on the edges of the shower. The cleanliness on other levels wasn't there either - upon arrival I had a cup of tea and left my cup to be exchanged the next day when they cleaned the room - but they didn't they simply rinsed it out and put it back to be reused. It was also an extremly noisy room, in the middle of the night I could hear people running up and down the stairs, yelling and screaming. The phone did not work, which is a big concern especially when you don't feel safe because of the people you can hear inside. We did ask about the phone not working because we needed to make a call, they brought us into another room (which they said was going to be occupied later in the day, or else they would have given it to us) to let us use the phone, but it didn't work either.

Lift is like a cage so was glad to get out on the 4th floor then discovered i had to lift my own cast up 2flights of tiny stairs (this can not meet fire safety regulations) I got to the room and found that it was worse than the 1st hotel. It again had an open shower in the room.....it was filthy, and it smelled of vomit. The windows had barrs on and did not open ( to get rid of the smell). I immediately left the room and went back to reception.....i felt this hotel was repulsively dirty and i was afraid that it was a fire risk! The receptionist called the manager from Tophams and i spoke to him on the phone - He offered for me to stay for free....i told him my safety was not going to be bought and i wanted the room i had booked (the one we have all seen on their web site) or i was leaving. He kept trying to convince me to stay but i gave the phone back to the receptionist and used my mobile to speak to Late rooms who my company had booked this through, they spent over an hour trying to find me another hotel (this was not an easy job and ended up costing me 600 pounds for a few hours sleep) However when the manager heard me complaining to late rooms about their establishment he got very angry and asked the receptionist to make me leave the property. I asked the receptionist to call me a taxi but he said he couldn't as his manager would be very angry ! So I was left alone as a young female traveller outside their hotel in a deserted street with no taxi and nowhere to go. Luckily laterooms came through and found me something and sent a taxi to get me. So i got 4hrs sleep before my conference at a price of 600 pounds but it was worth it to escape the hell that is Tophams and the Knightsbridge Green! All i can say is please please do not stay here.

We received our hotel voucher and booking confirmation several weeks in advance and so thought that all was well. Upon arrival at Topham's in mid-afternoon we went to the reception desk to check in, and that was the start of our problems. The hotel staff immediately caused upset by denying that we had not got a booking even though I handed them the booking voucher with our reservation details. The woman on reception tried to blag us by saying there was a room for us anyway and asked me to pay by credit card. I had already paid in full in advance and so was not happy. I had to go online using the hotel computer to prove that I had paid by getting a copy of my bank statement showing the cleared bpayment, as well as showing them the booking details again. We were then made to wait for over 40 minutes while the hotel staff made phonecalls, using telephone numbers that I provided to prove that our booking was genuine. We were not offered so much as a complimentary drink even though it was a very hot afternoon. The room we eventually were shown to would struggle to be called a \"standard room\". It was small and definitely not the up-grade to deluxe that we had paid for. The shower room had loose floor tiles and the shower door handle was broken on the inside. The shower controls were difficult to operate and the water temperature varied in use. We were at the start of a romantic trip starting in London, then Paris, Zurich, Milan & Venice by train. We decided to just make the best of it as we had no stomach for further upset at the beginning of our dream holiday. I hardly need to tell you that breakfast was a disaster, the poached egg and mushrooms had been heavily sprinkled with pepper in the serving dishes and this is not to everyones taste.

This was our Capital City and always seemed to offer the best in accommodation and activity. We decided to use one of LastMinute.com\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Top Secret\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotels for our stay in London. The priority of our booking was that the room should offer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Twin Beds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Not too many hotels offered such a room, so we decided to especially go for this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Top Secret\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel as it offered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Twin Bed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms. On booking we were advised that our hotel was a 4 Star hotel. It was the Tophams Hotel in Belgravia and our booking confirmed a twin bedded room. We received the written paperwork to this effect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Tophams Hotel was advertised as one of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest four-star hotels providing the ultimate in style, comfort and peaceful surroundings in the heart of Belgravia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With this concept in mind, we proceeded to the hotel. We were looking forward to our weekend break in London, but the reality was a far different story. The Hotel was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel from hell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On checking in, we were told that our double room was ready. We told the receptionist that we had booked a twin bedded room and had confirmation in writing from Lastminute.com; which I was able to show them. They said the booking they had received was for a double room. However, they never showed us this booking. They said no twin rooms were available until the next night. This was not acceptable, but the receptionist did not seem to care unduly, did not seem to have a full use of the English language. Eventually she offered us an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which would entail putting a single bed into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mews\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd double (Mews 5). We said we would look at the room before any decision was made. On entering the room there was a musty smell, dirty carpet and closed dark curtains. True there was a Double and single bed: which in truth was a camp bed with tubular legs. It would probably have taken the weight of a child, but doubtful of the comfort for either a grown man or woman. Half the lights did not work, the room was small and no room for the furniture within. Then we had the shock of the shower/bath/toilet area. This area went below the road and was suffering very badly from damp. The paint on the walls was peeling in many places, including within the shower cubicle. Mould was everywhere. It was disgusting. It was unhealthy, offensive and certainly not what we had paid good money for, which the hotel and Lastminute.com were all too quick to receive from us. The only thing that was worse than this was the second alternative we were offered, namely Mews 4. The bed was smaller, the sewage smell even more overpowering, the wet carpet, the brick wall view from the window. Certainly a far cry from the description of their website, which said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All guest rooms at the Tophams Hotel are finished to a very high standard of modern comfort and style.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We declined the offer of this room and once again reiterated that our booking was for a twin room, money had been accepted for a twin room. As a last resort the girl behind the desk offered to book us into the Vegas Hotel for Saturday night and we could return to The Tophams on Sunday when a room would be available. After checking this latest offer on the Internet, we found the Vegas Hotel was a 3 star hotel, but we had paid for a 4 star. They did have a twin room available, but the pictures on the website were not appealing and the reports on Trip Advisor would have been enlightening. We also mentioned the Vegas Hotel to the French family as they were really stuck for accommodation at short notice, on seeing them at breakfast the next morning they had also declined this invitation. We were rather surprised at the lack of Management over the weekend, but according to the receptionist there is never a manager present at weekends. We were amazed at this due to the activity of the Marathon and 2 football semi finals meaning the City was packed with people. Our visit to the dining room for breakfast was again a disappointment. We were told we could have a Full English Breakfast but firstly we had difficulty getting to a table as they were put so close together no-one could access the row behind if people were sitting on the tables at the front. 14 tables in a small space take some manoeuvring around. The food was on one side of the room but when we went to take up the full breakfast, there was no bacon, hash browns, the sausages ran out before we could get there, almost no scrambled egg. It was a long wait and in fact I had finished the breakfast that was available before the bacon arrived from a chef who was cooking who knows what, who knows where. There seemed to be only a service room, no kitchen nearby the dining room that we could ascertain. On Sunday when we came back in the afternoon, we were advised that the twin room we had been allocated was now ready and so we duly took the key to investigate. The room was a great deal better than the previous one, but one of the curtains refused to open (jammed), the beds seemed narrower than usual, the lights were not all working in the en suite and when I went to have a shower, the shower door came off in my hand! Once again we had to notify reception and they said it would be sorted. If a maid had opened the door to clean the shower, she could have been injured as it was the complete shower door that gave way. The tiles on the floor rocked as you walked on them, the painting and decor in the en suite left challenges to quality and once again the price paid was not matched by the service offered. All in all, it is the last time we would go to this hotel, my wife has assured me that it is the last time she would trust Lastminute.com \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Top Secret\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c30th Birthday Ruined!\u201d", "Author": "KirstieCB", "ReviewID": "UR104486317", "Content": "My complaint to the hotel....

However we decided to grin and bear it and went out for the evening. Only to return to have a bath and when we tried to run the bath it was leaking. My partner also opened the wardrobe before this to look in the mirror and noted that one of the hinges was missing making it impossible for the door to stay open. I went to reception and we were told someone would come down. Twenty minutes later - nobody appeared. I had to have my gallbladder removed so was still in a bit of pain so my partner went up this time and we got moved rooms. It should be noted that we had paid for a king size and we were moved to a double. Only to find that the tv was damaged and unwatchable and the safe looked like it had been broken into with batteries exposed and the front missing! We complained again being told the tv could be fixed the next day but I wasn't happy as the room was a lot smaller.

The temperature in the room was about 25 degrees C and could not be reduced without opening the window as wide as possible, even though there were A/C controls in the room, they did nothing. We did not eat at the Hotel, as the Dining Room never had anyone in it, which is an indicator?

She said the room in that hotel without a bathroom had a bathroom right beside it that we could use...there was a bathroom down a stairs at the end of a corridor, I totally found this unacceptable. We saw the other room in the sister hotel, it was awful. It was more like a student flat and bared no resemblance to a 4 star hotel. We were very upset, I had a business meeting the next morning, was totally wrecked tired and just wanted to get a place to sleep.

There was no milk to even make tea I had to get dressed at 8, walk down to reception in the rain and ask where I could get a shower and they told me I could use one in that hotel, I refused to carry my toiletries on the street in my dressing gown so they gave me a key to a room 3 floors up.

The next problem....we booked 3 rooms but after one of us was given a key we were asked if we knew each other as they only had one room left but that it was a suite! Obviously we were annoyed but I was given the single room while the guys took the suite. Reception gave some hopeless excuse for not having a room and other guests arriving later were fobbed off by being told their payment hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got through and they were being move to a different hotel.

My bedroom luckily was really nice, I was told I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been given an upgrade as it was all they had left.

The bathroom was dirty and full of long dark hairs (nice), there were no hand or floor towels. However, pleased with my room, I settled down to watch the telly and lo and behold, the channels were not tuned in. The room with no loo suggests someone trying to rip me off. The telly, the key and the towels suggest an owner who has no experience of running a hotel. I dread to think what there fire procedures would be if they can't organise hotel basics.

I would like to emphasise that, that it was generally good. My niggles below are minor ones, that the hotel could improve easily. We booked the King Deluxe room, which is in the main Topham's hotel.

There was no room guide in the room, and it was very hot. Had to work out how to work everything myself. Hot water did not work in the shower, and when they fixed it, they fixed the cold water so it did not work... Just took a bath instead. Much nicer anyway.

I would suggest that if you were to stay here you check where you are staying beforehand. The location of this hotel is so handy and we enjoyed our stay. Its really unfortunate that other people have had such a bad experience. The hotel need to get their act together and either do the other buildings up or stick to the number of rooms that they have available that are up to standard.

It was fashion week and all the hotels are fully booked. I tried looking for a good, clean and safe hotel that is on the average price per day right after I landed in London. I was able to get a room at Park Plaza in Victoria, but only for 2 days. So as soon as I landed to London, I decided to look for another hotel where I can transfer on the 3rd day. Most booking websites recommended Tophams hotel whenever my hotel of choice is not available. Tophams is a \" 4-star hotel\", according to these booking sites and that the price per room per night is a premium at the average of 400 pounds. I was aware of the bad reviews this hotel has been getting from travellers but I didnt have any choice at that time. So I booked for 2 nights, amounting to approx 800 pounds. When I got in the hotel, I was greeted by their nice staff. The receptionist however was a big scammer. When I got into Tophams, she gave me a room with no bathroom. When I told her I will transfer to another hotel because they were giving me the room that's not what I reserved and paid online, she pretended to change the room to fit my choice. I later found out that she did not give me a room at Tophams, but instead she brought me to an adjacent inn called Belgrave. That Belgrave connected to Tophams looked as if it's part of Tophams. Each unit has its own entrance and I was surprised that each unit has an upper and ground level rooms. I was brought on the upper level and when I entered the room I was shocked. The door was small and made of unfinished wood, no internet, that means I need to go out in the cold and enter the main lobby of Tophams to get an internet access. I was so suffocating. I immediately told the staff that I need to leave the room to find another one. The staff was polite and told me \"I understand.\" Maybe they are used to hearing musings from disappointed clients. I requested to the receptionist to cancel the amount she swiped on my card but she declined. She told me their policy is non-refundable. I told her that she did not give me a room at Tophams but in its adjacent Belgrave Inn. So she should not apply their terms and policies as they are the one in breach. To cut the story short, I left without them refunding my money. I suggest to booking.com, hotels.com and other booking sites that they should not include this hotel anymore as I felt scammed, as well as the many travelers victimized before me. So, I learned that before I hand my card next time, I will ask to have a look at the rooms first to be sure. Aside from the fees, this scamming receptionist charged a PREAUTHORIZATION charge of 100 pounds. She told me it is not charged at all from my card. She told me that 3x when I was registering. I even asked her for clarification about it. I later found out that my card was charged with that amount. I should've followed my intuition when I read the policies of this hotel when I was booking online. It says \"non- refundable\". I remember, when I checked in at Park Plaza which is really a 4star hotel, they charged my card upon check out and not during check in. Watch out for this clever receptionist she is very tricky. Once I arrived, she swiped my card immediately and gave me rooms which does not exist in their website.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is not a four star\u201d", "Author": "9876", "ReviewID": "UR79958578", "Content": "On arrival checked in which was quite simple and headed for our room.

Maybe you should look to implement a level of call service, try calling other chain hotels you will get the idea from this. Upon arrival at the hotel we was greeted by a lady sat behind a very large desk, who when checking us in stayed in her seat?? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure this is not of her own fault, since there was two other reception staff I saw doing the same. This did make the service seem rather impersonal. I would get rid of the large desk and put a higher smaller desk in the corner, which would also hide your background area, and also allow you to have better security for your money rather than an envelope in a draw?? The lady was pleasant and offered us an upgrade in room, which I felt was only done since she wanted a good review on here? At first glance the room looked very nice, lovely designs and space. However, a few things were noticed after, for instance chips in the bath, tiles in the bathroom not finished off to a good standard, breaks and chips in them. Plus the wall paper had marks on it, overall nice outside look but not finished off to a good standard, or not maintained to a good standard. Which made me think are you classified? I think this is something you should invest some time looking into, since you would know how to close the gap between customers expected and perceived quality, very important in order to benchmark yourself in a very competitive market like London. I hope this has been helpful, but not disheartening to prospective customers since everyone is only human and in order to learn from mistakes you have to have someone to show you when and where you are going wrong, in order to identify and rectify.

On looking for our rooms, the lift bizarrely only goes up one floor so we had to carry our bags up and through a maze of corridors. Our daughter had a single room on the top floor, and having stayed in hotels all over the world, I could not imagine a smaller room in which to spend the night. There was a window, but the aircon, essential in the heat, was so noisy she had to turn it off to sleep. We had a double, one floor down, which was OK although the very small bathroom was up some stairs via an area with a desk in it complete with hair dryer. We checked out the next morning, didn't bother with breakfast, admitting to one bottle of water from the minibar for which we paid cash, although finding some change for a fiver was a bit of a problem. The man at reception said they destroyed the credit card slips produced the day before if no expenses had been incurred. Nevertheless, a few days later, like the previous reviewer, we had an email from the internet hotel agency we always use for hotels all over the world telling us the hotel had reported us as \"no shows\", and they were demanding \u00c2\u00a3263 for the two rooms!! Having emailed the agency concerned, and having retained all our receipts, we appear to have avoided this scam, but we have since been charged \u00c2\u00a31 on our credit card - if all guests are charged \u00c2\u00a31, and don't challenge it, it's a nice little earner!

My partner and I take matters into our own hands and manage to find a hotel around the corner for the next few hours as do a few other stragglers. The best bit about all this is my partner returning to Tophams this morning to find that the previously mute management have gained a voice and intend on charging us the full nightly rate for the aborted stay. How this hotel continues to survive I do not know. They employ some very sweet-natured girls who I feel desperately sorry for having to work for Mr Ali and his appalling management team.

Manager refuses to refund and offer a free night instead for next time !!! Totally dishonest, no respect for customer or hesitation to process undue charges. Add to that rude and unhelpful staff, tiling falling off the walls in the rooms, heating often not working, stinking mews and room service menu rarely available. There is far better value for money in London!!! (Try the Rubbens or the 41, a real treat, minutes away from this trap) In more details if you care to read: I am (or should I say now... was) a regular returning guest in this hotel. But one evening when checking in, and after taking a print of my credit card I am informed that there is no room for me due a technical problem (The hotel did confirm the reservation which had been made a couple a weeks ago). I am offered to go to their sister hotel. I accept and request a taxi transfer, paid for by the hotel. It is late and I wish to make it simple. As I am asking about the facilities of the hotel I am about to transfer to,... the receptionist calls them. When I hear her say \" yes but the guest is here what am I going to do with him\" I do get nervous. She just says that the taxi is coming but she needs to find money to pay the driver. Then after another 10 minutes, there are apparently no taxi willing to come (in London no cab !!????). I do get very nervous and decide to call another hotel and check their vacancies. I request the print of my credit card back and leave. BUT... the Topham still charged me for the night. When I found out on my next credit card statement I called the manager thinkingn this was a mistake. He refused a refund and merely offered a night free of charge next time and a long email of apologies, available on request !!! My credit card company and I agree, this is not exactly the reaction one would expect in a similar situation. A bit of fight ahead!! Overall the place looks great and has been refurbished 2 years ago. But a cheap coat of paint can't last very long. And the staff is far from being professional or even friendly. Summary after trying over 7 different rooms during my past satys: Tiling is coming off the wall in the bathroom, humidity stains on the walls (accompanied by the fetid smell), TV not working, No heating in winter, shower head falling off when showering, blocked drains resuting in flooding, In-room dining not available or reduced menu only, stained bed sheets. And yes, I should mention the size of the rooms, the poor sound proofing, or fire alarms going off in the middle of the night due to problems in the kitchen.

From our experience, and pretty much everyone else we met who arrived any time after 3pm to check-in at this hotel, it's booking management is at best a total shambles and at worst a total scam.

To cut a long and frustrating story short, we ended up, after arguing at length with a very unapologetic manager, in a family room sharing a bathroom for the same price as our two double rooms.

I was wrong - it was a great stay. My expectations were raised when I approached the hotel, it looked clean and a little bit funky from the outside. There was another guest checking in when I arrived, not standing at a big corporate reception desk across a faceless lobby, but sitting at an old fashioned desk in a cosy room with a real fire and quirky art all around. I had a little nose around while waiting and the whole groundfloor looked lovely. I didn't use the restaurant, but they were advertising a buffet dinner for \u00c2\u00a314.99. I checked in effortlessly and was given Room 202 - again after reading the reviews left by others I was a little nervous that it was going to be horrible. But - my room was delightful.

The free WiFi was simple to login to & fast; & as an unexpected bonus I signed out a DVD from the free library (in the lobby) to watch in my room. The location is approx 5 mins walk from Victoria once you've got your bearings, and I had a lovely wander around the surrounding area in the evening, lots to see and do if you want. The only reason that I didn't give this hotel 5/5 is that the staff, while being courteous and efficient, were not inclined to be friendly - but hell, that didn't detract from the quality of the hotel and it's location enough for me not to rate Tophams as a personal favourite.

On arrival we were presented with a locked door. There was nothing on the door to tell us what we should do and nothing on our booking confirmation. Eventually, after ringing and ringing, someone came to the door and told us we needed to go to Topham's Hotel along the road. Topham's hotel looks very nice when you arrive. We were soon disillusioned. The same old story which you will have now read again and again. The girl on reception said they had no record of our booking. We sat for about half an hour before she managed really to tell us this. She was trying to answer three? phones at once and kept breaking off from speaking to us to answer one or the other and take other bookings. At first we were told the hotel was full but then that we could have a room in Topham's that did not have ensuite. We asked what the reduction in price was for the lack of ensuite and were told that the price was the same as the price on our booking confirmation that she could not authorise any reduction as she wasn't management. We went to see the room which was so tiny you could not open the drawers on the chest of drawers nor sit on the one chair as they were crammed down the side of the bed and there was no room elsewhere. Our bathroom was along the corridor and down a flight of stairs. We asked to speak to the management but were informed that as it was the weekend there was no management available. How can a 4* hotel in a major city function with alledgedly no management? After we refused to budge she did phone the manager (at home?) and we were told we could have a free dinner. We had reservations elsewhere. We phoned booking.com who told us that they had proof that the booking had been received and the hotel was obliged to provide us with accommodation equivalent to what we had booked, either in their hotel or in another. Unfortunately we did not insist on booking.com speaking to the receptionist and with hindsight we should have insisted that booking.com found us accommodation as our contract was with them. In the end the receptionist phoned the management and we accepted the room with a \u00c2\u00a330 reduction and a free breakfast. While we were trying to sort out what were going to to do another couple came in who had booked over the phone just a few minutes before we arrived. They were given a room. We can only presume that they had been given our room as they were going to pay more. We took the room as we had no alternative. There were no tea-making facilities in the room, no cups, no glasses, nor were there in the bathroom. No dressing gowns were provided so we had to go to the bathroom in our outdoor coats (I was 7 months pregnant). When we went to reception to ask for some tea we were told it would be brought but it never arrived. In the end we had to go to the restaurant and help ourselves to glasses so we could at least have a glass of water! IN the morning when we got up the cold water tap in the shower did not work so we were unable to have a shower ( we would have been scalded) and there was no time to sort it as we had a timed entry booked at an exhibition. On leaving we asked for the name of the manager and were told it was Ali, just Ali. Again, how can a hotel which claims to be 4* refuse to give out the full name of it's manager? We are also disappointed with booking.com whom we made the booking through and basically they told us to contact the hotel to get some sort of solution.

The rooms are horrid and the staff treats all guests as irritants, overbooking is common, and they do not honor their reservation commitments even with proof. They advertise this place as a 4-star luxury hotel but in my opinion it is not. We (2 adults, 1 small child) had one night reservations at Tophams Hotel Belgravia at both the beginning and end of our 2 week vacation to Europe so we could explore London. We were told free breakfast was included and my credit card was charged the full amount for one of the nights, months in advance, to guarantee the rooms. When we arrived the receptionist could find no record of either reservation and claimed they were full. She seemed genuinely irritated that I was even talking to her. Luckily I had paper versions of the emailed reservation info and proof that I had paid. Only then did a room become available but her attitude remained boorish and annoyed. Regardless, she said they would have to bring in a cot for the second bed and we agreed that that would be fine. I then asked her to make certain we had a reservation for our return in two weeks and was assured that she would take care of it. I then asked details about the free breakfast the next morning and was told that none was included. I again pointed to the emails that clearly stated that breakfast was included with our stay and she re-stated that despite what my emailed confirmation said, it was not included. I asked to speak to her manager and after a very audible huff she dialed a number which rang and rang and rang. She attempted to call this number several times and no one ever answered. Wanting to get on with our sight-seeing I begrudgingly asked for the room key and told her I would talk to the manager later that night or in the morning. I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noticed the man standing off to the side but upon preparing to exit the lobby area he wished me good luck because he too had been lied to about breakfast, was upset about the condition of his room and was waiting for the manager to call or appear to get his money back. Hmm I thought, very interesting. We took our luggage to the room and quickly left to see as much of London as we could. When we returned that night we were appalled by the state of the bathroom and upset that we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noticed it earlier because it was way too late to do anything about it now. The vinyl floor material was completely separated from the floor itself and was warped with long vinyl hills and valleys that measured at least an inch high and deep everywhere. It squished under our feet and the sight and odor of black mold filled the room. Of the two beds set up in the room one was nothing more than a cheap folding couch; not a sleeper-sofa but a two part cheap foam couch. It was incredibly uncomfortable and the two sheets spread on top of it were several inches to short on all sides so you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tuck either of them under the foam at all. The next morning we noticed that the shower head was broken. It was the removable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type attached to a hose but the support bracket that was supposed to be attached to the wall was broken so it required a juggling act to hold the shower head and soap at the same time. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing it had been like that for a long time which resulted in water going places it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not supposed too which caused the floor to peel and the mold to build up under it. Not what you would expect at a 4 star luxury hotel. Next we headed down for our free breakfast with my email proof in hand. The morning receptionist was no nicer and no more helpful than yesterday afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s receptionist so I asked to speak to the manager. Several attempts to call some number resulted in a lot of ringing but never a manager. The receptionist seemed genuinely irritated that a guest in her hotel was even speaking to her. While I was standing there waiting to talk to the manager another guest came in tossed his key on the desk and told her he was going to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make sure his company never books another employee at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and stormed out. Hmm I thought, very interesting. I guess I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m too nice but I got tired of waiting for the manager; there was so much we wanted to see and do in London so we simply left. We returned to London two weeks later and arrived late in the day. We walked in to the hotel lobby and there were two women arguing with the receptionist I had dealt with 2 weeks prior. They had apparently been waiting for hours for their room to be made available and were convinced that the hotel had overbooked and was stalling. They wanted to speak to a manager once and for all. You guessed it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.ring ring ring, no manager. They were asked to step aside and wait for the room. I stepped up and asked to check in. The receptionist informed me that they had no reservation in my name. I whipped out my emails, reminded her about the conversation two weeks ago and she told me that she remembered me but they had no reservation and no available rooms. I told her we had nowhere else to go and had a small child with us and she simply had to find a room as promised two weeks ago and as reserved many months ago but she refused to help in anyway. I reminded her that she was putting two foreigners with a small child out on the streets of London at night with nowhere to go and no knowledge of even where to begin looking despite having proof of a prior reservation. I asked to speak to a manager. She obliged by calling that same number and you guessed it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6ring ring ring but no manager. As we stood their stunned, another guest entered the lobby and said his room was unacceptable as it was a mess, it smelled but even worse it had no power! Hmm I thought, very interesting. Fortunately I had the phone number of a British relative and after a few calls we were able to get a room at a chain called Premier Inns. The room was half the price, twice as large, extremely clean and it had real beds.

It was booked via lastminute.com (Top Secret Hotels) and when I found the hotel details out was pleased as it looked to be a 4 star small boutique hotel as described. It wasn't cheap - \u00c2\u00a3150, so I really hoped that I'd get somewhere of fairly good quality. I did have a scan of the reviews, now wish I'd taken them more seriously, lesson learned! Well, when I got to the Tophams Hotel I was told by the member of staff on reception that I was actually staying at another part of the hotel - The Harcourt, which was around 4 doors down the road. The main reception of the Tophams looked really nice, decorated in a boutique style with a nice fire roaring away and so I hoped that the Harcourt was equally as nice..... Well, the Harcourt is basically just a few rooms (no reception/contact point). The porter walked me down there, not even speaking to me (chattering away on his mobile). Walked into this 'hotel' where there was another man (presumably a member of staff but not dressed in any uniform) who walked me into my room. Have to say as a single female traveler I didn't feel very safe being alone in this situation. Actually slept with the chair wedged behind the door (silly I know but wanted to feel safe). Fortunately, was meeting some family for dinner so didn't need to spend any longer in the room that evening. The room itself had only been loosely cleaned. Randomly in the wardrobe was a plastic pot of microwavable rice pudding (presumably left by another guest). Used tissues under the bed and the shower had lots of black mildew/mold in it. Would not describe as 4 star! However, the next morning was when my problems really started. Was woken at 7.15am by the fire alarm going off in the Harcourt, so stuck my coat and boots on and grabbed my bags (which were packed) and made my way to the reception at Tophams. On the way a fellow resident said that there was water coming through his ceiling from the sprinkler system. The guy on reception firstly wasn't even aware the alarm was going off (slightly worrying - would have thought it would be linked to their reception?). So myself and another person had to explain what was happening to him. No apologise, no instructions about what we should do. For around 5 minutes, we received no communication - the guy just flapped around on the phone, went down to check the Harcourt and came back saying there wasn't a fire but they didn't know how to turn the alarm off. Again, no instructions about what we were to do. Very frustrating - as lots of people having breakfst in the Tophams and I was just standing there in my pjs! At this point, I simply needed to have a shower and leave the hotel to go to a meeting, so I asked a waitress who was walking past (as the guy on reception was proving completely incompetent) if there was a room in this part of the hotel I could use. Eventually got taken to a single room (why didn't they give me this the night before), which had a separate shared bathroom. I then had to wait for her to bring me up a room key and then to cut a long story short, when I tried to use the bathroom the door jammed so I had to go all the way back to reception. Again no instructions about what to do, the guy on reception was just tapping away on the phone/computer and ignoring me. So just took the decision to go back to my orginal room, had a five minute shower and the hell out of the wretched place. Alarm was still going off but people were in their rooms.

We therefore had booked three rooms. My parents and my husband and I checked in without incident, although with all the problems listed already about surly and unhelpful reception staff with very little English. My brother was delayed and both I and my father informed reception that they would be checking in after dinner. We were assured this would be fine. Inevitably, on returning to the hotel after dinner to check in, my brother and his girlfriend were told that there was no room for them and that they would get another room at the sister hotel. We were leaving from Victoria station on a train at 7:30 the following morning so clearly this presented a problem. However, we were left with no choice and my brother and his girlfriend were the third party within the half hour of this conversation to be transported to the sister hotel. They were given a twin as opposed to a double room and the standard was considerably lower, not to mention the fact that the location was extremely inconvenient. Also transported to the other hotel was a young couple from Milan. The girl's parents had provided her with the trip as a present for having just completed her degree and they were in a foreign country at 11:30pm without the accomodation that they had every reason to expect. In the hotel reception desk is a drawer full of cash which they hand out to pay for the taxis to the other hotel. As I have said, there were three seperate parties who suffered this treatment between about 11:15pm and 11:45pm that evening, so let's face it, none of this was a simple error.
