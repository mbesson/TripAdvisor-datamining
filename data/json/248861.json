The staff were very friendly and possibly the world's best pizzeria, Pizzeria da Pasquale, is just around the corner. There is also decent free wi-fi. Now the bad points: We stayed in one of the newly renovated deluxe rooms, 322. The room was a bit on the small side but smelt terribly, a combination of mildew and sewage. I've backpacked around Asia and have a strong stomach but the smell actually woke me up one night as it was so strong. Another thing is that if you want to watch tv and don't speak Italian you'll have to pay extra to get additional channels in English and movies etc. My girlfriend also said that the hairdryer was useless and it took her over an hour to dry her hair (apparently this is very important for you ladies!) Another bad point is the buffet breakfast, if you can opt not to pay for this I wouldn't bother. Rock hard bread, cold eggs etc and there didn't appear to be any real system as to what you should be doing. The location really is the draw card for this hotel, otherwise it is quite average.

But this Domus Adriani, is another building, quite close to the main hotel but something TOTALLY different than living in a hotel. The fasade of the building is being renovated what makes the building extra ugly, inside no cleaning was done any day, people smoked and threw the ends on the common stairs. The lift was a joke of so small, if you are a big american fellow, forget it, you may have to walk up 4 floors. Another thing is if one forgets the inner door of the lift open in another floor, it would stop working ie, you could press the button but it never arrived. . Not to mention the key holder with 5 keys we had to carry around and remember which key to use for which door. * General sleeping conditions were low in the room 508, small room and loud machine noise coming from something in the terrace. * We asked for another room in the main building and they arranged a much bigger one next morning, but since we were staying for 2 more nights and had unpacked we didnt want to move, especially after checking out the new room and feeling the strong smell of cigarette inside. * The lobby was modern/cosy/design , in a limit of being overcrowded by decorative objects. * The staff = italian, not over kind, but not the opposite and they did speak good enough english. * Finally, the hotel was close to absolutely everything, especially if you dont mind walking a couple of meters, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, even Vatikan. Would I stay there again ?? Yes, if I didnt have any other better option, but would NEVER book in Domus ADriani again. Breakfast, they have fruits, scrambled eggs, croissants, cappucino...yogurt... 3 types of bread... it was good enough to me. A last comment especially to norwegian famillies travelling in a big group. It might be good for you to stay at Domus ADriani, since you can all share a long terrace outside to enjoy a drink together at night when the kids have gone to bed. You also share a small kitchen and can make coffee, tea and maybe seat together if you dont fancy outside.But again, your kids might like to walk up stairs or wait to each small group to arrive up with the small lift and send it back again.

Other main sites are also walkable including the Vatican, Spanish Steps and even the Coliseum - although we did order a taxi for the return back to the hotel. The location of the hotel is in an atmospheric area of narrow streets, so a detailed street map is a good idea until you familiarise yourself with local landmarks. There are lots of restaurants and shops nearby, so eating out isn\u2019t a problem. The cobbled roads can be uneven so flat shoes with good grips are recommended for wetter weather. The hotel rooms are clean, reasonably spacious and the bed was comfortable, although I don\u2019t see any advantage to guests from the open style of wardrobe where clothes are on display. The heavy doubled glazed windows keep out the noise from the streets and although I am a light sleeper the external noise didn\u2019t disturb me. The rooms did get very warm in the night, even though it was early November and I had to adjust the settings on the air con control with only limited effect \u2013it might be that the air con is turned down when the summer finishes. There is free internet access via a computer on the ground floor which was useful for confirming the seat locations on the return flight. The breakfast was OK and seemed to cover most guests\u2019 wants with cereals, muffins, yoghurts, croissants and so on. The breakfast room could get a bit crowded at popular times and it\u2019s a pity cappuccino couldn\u2019t be more freely available.

I booked an airport pickup and drop off myself via the internet and although there was no problem with the service I received the hotel can arrange this at a slightly cheaper rate \u2013 email them a few days before you arrive. A tip for visiting St Peters and the Vatican Museum (for the Sistine chapel) - beware of tour guides who offer a service including \u2018jumping the queues\u2019. For the Vatican museum any advantage from not having to queue for tickets is lost by having to walk to the tour company\u2019s office to pay and then hanging around waiting for other members of the group to join. In addition the Vatican museum is so huge you are better taking your time and stopping for a break in the cafeteria half way round rather than being forced to follow the tour guides itinerary. The tour guides also have no official status that I could see with St Peters and you will end up queuing like everyone else, so save your money.

It was impossible to sleep because of the noise. I also did not feel safe when they left the hallways windows wide-open and at night when walking through the alley area. When I arrived the morning man took care of me. I asked the morning woman for help getting to places and everything was either 1 minute, 5 minutes, or 20 minutes. Though I came to learn to add or subtract 10 minutes because her walking times were way off. Pantheon was 5 minutes and Trevi Fountain was 20 minutes. In reality the Pantheon is and Trevi Fountain are across the street from each other. The morning man however, was disrespectful and rude. When I tried to ask a question as to where something was he put up his hand, said very rudely to ask her, and wiped his hand in the air as to shoo me away. The next morning when I asked for him to call a taxi he threw his hands up in the air, said impossible, and ignored me.

Unpretentious on the outside, labyrinthine inside, woven into the fabric of its area. I dare say tourists coming to Rome to experience Vespas, gelateria, and sultry Italian evenings will love this place. Its age and authentic feel didn\u2019t mean it lacked modern amenities though; nice breakfast, air-con, modern bathroom, nice bed \u2013 all present. My bathroom had an odd feature though. Whoever installed the shower screen on my bath apparently had no idea how they work. He installed it on the outside of the bath tub. This meant that every drop of water from the shower that hit the screen ended up, not back in the bath, but on the floor. At the end of my showers, the bathroom floor was somewhere between seriously damp and downright flooded. And the area the hotel is in! Just great. Location is a big plus point of this hotel. Some of Rome\u2019s major sites are but a short stroll away, and everything Rome has to offer is readily accessible. But that\u2019s only half the story. The hotel\u2019s immediate vicinity is a maze of narrow, cobbled streets, small squares, little caf\u00e9s and bars, gelateria and pizzeria. Charming. There\u2019s a nice little pizza shop close to the hotel, frequented by locals (always a good sign) that\u2019ll do you several chunks of nice pizza on a tray, plus a drink, for five Euros. Recommended. Don\u2019t confuse it with the absurdly expensive restaurant on the opposite side of the square. The hotel\u2019s area felt safe too \u2013 it seemed to be constantly full of police, day and night, and not mere city police, but Carabinieri, in large numbers. It can be hard to find the hotel though; returning from my first day, it took me quite a while and an Android smartphone with GPS and Google Maps to get back. Seriously \u2013 I recommend a GPS device, or getting detailed maps of the immediate area (full city tourist maps don\u2019t always show the detail of these narrow streets) and a compass.

This was very reasonable considering we would have to take the train for 15 euro each as well as a cab from the train station anyway. I would absolutely suggest this option. We arrived at the hotel at 9am after an overnight flight and were greeted by a gracious desk clerk. He helped us secure our bags while we walked around Rome and made some suggestions of things to do near the hotel as check-in time was not until 2pm. When we checked into our hotel we found the room to be just like the pictures. Completely updated amenities(flat screen t.v. etc), clean rooms, nice bathrooms and a king size bed. Many hotels actually push two twins together but this was an actual king mattress. We really didn't realize how lucky we were with the location of this hotel. It is ideally located right near the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and 15 minutes from the Vatican and the Colliseum(Opposite directions). The hotel common areas are very clean and have plenty of comfortable couch seating. In full disclosure I must mention the breakfast. There is a large selection of fruit, pastry, coffee, and hot eggs and ham. However the fruit wasn't ripe and the eggs and ham were a little dry. But it was free!!

One of the greatest joys of visiting Rome is walking through the historic district at night, and this hotel posits you in a perfect position for this...a 2-minute walk from the Pantheon, 8-minute walk from Piazza Navona, 13-minute walk to Spanish Steps, etc. You are also right around the corner from arguably the best gelato spot in Rome, Giolitti. The rooms aren't what I'd consider spacious, but they're not overly cramped. We paid for a modern-decor room with a small balcony, which was worth the upgrade. The staff was actually quite helpful with making dinner reservations and answering questions.

This was our first visit to Rome and we used TripAdvisor in order to pick the hotel. We booked through Booking.com and noticed there were annex rooms that were described as being superior to those in the regular hotel. They described the rooms as having a shower, bathtub and balcony with a view. We paid 644 euros for the three nights and looked forward to staying in the room. Upon arrival, we were shown to our room by a man (he has a neck tattoo - didn't get his name) who we would have numerous encounters with over the three days. He led us to the annex, which is a building right beside the hotel. It has a separate entrance on the same street, just a few doors down. Never did he offer to help us carry our luggage. He took us in the hotel which had a front door, then a security gate, then led us up three flights of narrow stairs. There was another door, which was the entrance to the annex hotel, and then to our room. We were given a key chain with 6 keys on it, four of which were required, so there were 2 unecessary keys on the key ring. They were not labelled and made entering the four locked doors very tedious. Regardless, we entered the room and I was immediately disappointed. The room, while a good size, was very run down. The duvet was frayed and worn, and the tiles were mildewy. Immediately we noticed a mould smell. The balcony was small and had no real view, and was too small for more than one person to sit out on at any one time. There were no other people staying in the annex while we were there (that we heard or saw anyways), and it appeared there were 5-7 other rooms there. The annex did have a two person lift, the kind with the double doors. On our first night, we came home and took the lift up. We then went to bed around midnight. At 2:30 am, I awaken by the sound of the room phone ringing, which probably had rung a good 10-15 times before rousing me. I answered the phone and the man on the other end let me know that he was calling from the front desk and he needed me to go out to the lift and close the doors, because one of them had been left open and the lift would not work to move to other floors. To give context, the lift was located one flight of stairs down from the hotel, in the main stairway where there are also residences. The hallway was narrow and concrete, and had numerous other apartments that were not associated with the hotel. This would require me, at 2:30 in the morning, to leave the room, go outside of the locked hotel area, down a flight of stairs and to the lift. Immediately this struck me as weird and my instincts told me not to do it, as I felt I was being lured or something. I unplugged the phone and went back to bed, obviously very anxious at this point. In the morning we brought this up to the front desk, and they told us that they did not call, and that we should never go out in the hallway for that purpose, etc. They thought that maybe one of the residents had called us and pretended they were the front desk. Later that day, the phone rang again and there was only breathing on the line. I then called the front desk and told them again of the situation and the new phone call. The front desk said that a resident could not directly call us as it is a hotel phone, reached only by dialing the room number from inside the hotel. She said the front desk would not have called. So, we never figured out who kept calling us, if it was indeed the front desk, or if someone was messing with us. If it was the front desk, it was totally inappropriate, as the situation could have been remedied by a staff member in less than four minutes. If it was not the front desk, that was a very troubling occurrence. I have never felt so unsafe in my life and I had a hard time sleeping. I was very nervous entering and exiting the hotel at night. We were not offered a remedy and when I asked about changing rooms, I was told we could, but that we'd have to switch twice due to the hotel being at capacity. It should be evident that this was a troubling experience. The rest of the hotel seems safer but these \"special\" annex rooms need to be sorted out. Another strange thing happened during our stay. After a long day of sightseeing, we took a nap in our room before getting ready for dinner. While we were napping, I heard a faint knock, it sounded like it was someone knocking on a door down the hallway. Almost immediately after, the door opened and it was the man with the neck tattoo. In his hands he had the drinks he was going to replace in the mini-bar. Instead of saying anything, or leaving the drinks outside the room, or seeing us and leaving the at the door - he enters the room, walks by the bed we are laying in, opens the closet, and restocks the mini bar, like we weren't even there. I was so surprised I couldn't even say anything, and I would have gotten up but I was not adequately dressed. This was really strange and also unsettling, especially in light of the other events. I would possibly return to this hotel, but would stay in the main hotel. The annex rooms were unsafe, unclean and not worth the over 200 euros per night they cost. The man with the neck tattoo - who also was the bartender at one point - is odd and made me nervous. I wish we were asked about our stay but none of the staff inquired. Had these events not occurred, I would rate the hotel a 6.5/10. The state of the room and the mould smell were definite issues.

This is a great hotel for the American traveler - comfortable, clean and familiar. Both times I stayed here was with groups of friends/family for weddings. The communal couches, nightly happy hour and comfortable lobby are great for meeting up with everyone, relaxing, zoning out, etc. The desk folks are somewhat helpful, if not a little grumpy. The location is fantastic - you can walk to many sites from the hotel and the fabulous restaurant Gusto isn just a short walk away. Rooms are expensive, but very clean. I stayed in a double regular which was fine with a great separate bathroom. The next time I stayed in a twin superior, which was gorgeous - except the shower stall was outside the bathroom, in the middle of the room. Not a big deal, but a little awkward for a double twin room. (If you're not sharing a bed with someone, you're probably not comfortable with them showering in the middle of the room!). Working around this wasn't a problem, though. Breakfast is reliable and good. Unfortunately, there's no wi-fi in the rooms; and you have to pay to use it in the lobby. I had a major problem with this - If i'm going to pay ten euro a day to use it, i want to do it from the privacy of my room. They do have a computer station for guests to use free of charge and most guest seems to respect time limits, etc. I personally would prefer a hotel that's a little more traditional; but I'd definitely stay here again -- especially if traveling with multiple generations (they have an elevator!).", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cRecomanded- will stay again..\u201d", "Author": "DaniTheFox", "ReviewID": "UR114828470", "Content": "Visited Rome early June 2011 for 2 nights after an amazing week in the southern parts of Italy.

We went to Paris, Rome, Siena, and Florence. Needless to say, this required extensive research and planning. TripAdvisor was a vital resource for me, and the reviews have helped ensure a wonderful vacation of a lifetime. In Rome, we stayed at Hotel Adriano. The location of this hotel can't be beat, everything is within walking distance: Piazza Navona and the Pantheon, within 5-10 minutes; Spanish Steps and Fontana di Trevi, 10-12 minutes; Colosseo, 20-25 minutes. However, the hotel is on a quiet side street so as soon as you walk inside the hotel, it will feel like a retreat from the hubbub of Rome. We booked a newly-renovated superior room and it was just the right size for us. It had a good layout, rainfall shower (no bathtub which was totally fine), room safe, and a relaxing colour scheme of soft gray and white. Obviously, I cannot review any of the non-renovated rooms in the hotel but I would recommend the newly-renovated rooms in a heartbeat. The hotel offers a free breakfast and it was a really good spread - scrambled eggs with ham, boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt, cheese, bread, lots of fruit, juice, coffee, etc. I would agree with the other reviewer that the selection does not vary, however, there was enough variety in what was being offered that you could change what you chose to eat from day to day (eggs today, cereal tomorrow). The breakfast room was spacious and charming. You have to ask for a cappuccino from one of the staff, they will make it for you. The only thing I would suggest to the hotel is to allow guests to control the airconditioning in the room a little bit more. We were lucky enough to have great weather during our entire trip in Europe and it was pretty warm in Rome. We could not change the thermostat setting to anything lower than 20-something (21?) degrees. Maybe we had a faulty one? I would consider this a minor issue, it would not stop me from staying at Hotel Adriano again. Some tips: 1. For an inexpensive lunch, there is a small pizza place really close to the hotel that serves amazing pizza (fresh ingredients, great crust). Not a fancy place, you eat on a bar stool and a long counter. Unfortunately, I did not get the name of the place but it is literally a 1-2 minute walk from the hotel (same side of the road as the hotel). Wish we discovered it sooner, we would have loved to try every single one... 2. Sightseeing: The Vatican is a must-do but the lines were sooo long. Save yourself time (and a migraine), book ahead. You can either book online directly with the Vatican or even better, book a tour (I recommend Presto). Same goes for the Colosseo. 3. Do your research on pricing - check travel websites, check the hotel website for special offers, even call the hotel directly. Most hotels offer an advanced booking discount, non-refundable but worth it in my opinion since most will offer between 10-15% discount on top of the best rate. Some will throw in breakfast for free if it is not already offered as part of the room rate. 4. Transportation: I was weary of all the warnings about being ripped off by taxis from the airport to the hotel so I booked with Rome Cabs to pick us up (they have glowing reviews here on TA and they were right). For a few euros more, you do not have to deal with the possibility of dealing with a greedy taxi driver. That's worth our peace of mind and a good introduction to a great city.

We booked our trip through Expedia and Adriano was one of the recommended hotels. From the minute we got to the hotel we were treated like princesses by both the Frond desk and the housekeeping staff. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, extremely clean and modern. The room was pretty spacious for a European hotel. The decor is just beautiful. The best feature of the hotel I must say is the location. Piazza Navona is literally three blocks away, Pantheon about two blocks and the best gelatto place Giolitti is only minutes away. We walked to Piazza Navona, Piazza d' Espagna, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Venetia, Piazza del Popolo (Colosseum)...everything is sooo convenient. For Vatican city though we had to take a 10 minute bus ride. Ask someone they will all help. Keep a map with you at all times though as the streets are pretty identic to each other so you might end up going in circles if you don't pay attention. Breakfast is complimentary: fresh warm croissants, different types of rolls, fresh daily fruit, yogurt, granola, oatmeal, cereal, swiss cheese, ham, eggs (scrambled and boiled), nutella, jam, fresh squeezed juice, cold and hot milk, tea and coffee. Absolutely amazing. Dining: I would recommend you go to as many Trattoria's as possible. That's where the locals eat. Da Tonino's Trattoria is just delicious, at Via del Governo Vechio by Piazza Navona...I wasnt a big fan of the restaurants at the actual Piazza Navona though. If you take the first right from the hotel, on your right you will find the best corner bakery. Fresh pizza, paninis, all kinds of cookies... It was an amazing experience.

The sink did not drain well and would be half full after just washing hands. breakfast was in general quite good but on the last day, a Sunday, the juice had been watered down, this was a shame as the blood red orange juice had been nice during the week. I was also booked in for a business fee and went to pay on the Sunday to see they wanted to charge me 32EUROs more than had been agreed in the email.

Anyway, fantastic shower too. Tv was crap (no radio channels, just a couple tv channels), but you don't watch tv when the city outside your room is a open air museum. Sure, there was some noise from outside. Scooters on the street, the garbage man in the morning, but with the window shut (and for americans: airco on) most of the noise stays outside. Oh, the breakfast. Wow! Two more excellent things: the bar/restaurant across the street and the farmacy around the corner (to cure that extreme hangover you get when drinking too much prosecco on the first night, like we did).

We asked for a higher up room and our request was accomodated. The breakfast each morning was superb. Not only was there the usual pastries, bread, cheese and meats, yogurt and granola but also hot scrambled eggs with meat/ham/bacon. Again, the service staff could not have been more accomodating. If the breakfast is not super, sometimes I would rather sleep and grab a bite later...we would not have even Considered missing this breakfast--it was that good. There was a nice bar with snacks in the lobby that we did not use but saw some people there and it looked really good--so, not sure if that counts for a 'restaurant' but there were also SO many fabulous restaurants, trattorias, cafes and wine bars withing a block or 2 that I don't think you could miss a meal here :^) We felt the location was Very good....walkable to Vatican, Piazza Navona, Piazza Popolo, Pantheon, Spanish Steps. Some might consider that some of those spots would be a bit far but if you are into \"New York\"-style walking you could definitely handle it. A tip: if you decide (like we did) to take a cab to the Colleseum or another farther out spot, it is helpful to go to the major road by the river to get a cab. Since the hotel is located in a cozy historic district with very narrow streets, the cabs seemed to have a problem getting into the area and the rates were higher. Always ask the cab driver \"how much to go to ______?\" and see what they say. If they indicate the meter price will be the rate that's a good sign. If they just start quoting rates (especially in the 15-20 Euro range) we would try another cab. From the Colleseum, we were 1st quoted \"25\" then \"18\" then the last guy said \"where do you want to go?\" and we gave the Ponte Cavour (near the hotel) as our destination and it ended up being a meter rate of 8 euros--a big difference. \u00a1gracias a Giovanni y Julio para un buen viaje en Roma!", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arendal, Norway", "Title": "\u201cOur home in Rome!\u201d", "Author": "mkr68", "ReviewID": "UR77527168", "Content": "Life is too short to be wasting time wondering where to stay while you\u00b4re in Rome!

If you are traveling with someone who isn't particularly close to you, then there will be few secrets after this trip especially if you like the light on!) But I'm not complaining. Breakfast was great - select your own breads, meat, cheese, cake, drinks etc. Your can even boil your own egg. Perfectly acceptable to get you going. Open until 10am too so no great rush. Service and welcome is excellent. The staff are very helpful. The communal areas of the hotel are modern and very tasteful. If I had to criticize any part of the trip it would be transport costs. Tip: from the airport, take the direct coach into Rome (\u20ac8 each and about 45 minutes) I found us on the map as were traveling and realised that the first stop at the Piazza Cavour is just across the river from the hotel and 5 minutes walk to the hotel (you'll need a map). This avoided going straight into the Rome Terminal which would have required a \u20ac15 taxi back to the hotel. However getting back to the airport wasn't cheap. A taxi (it was a merc and very comfortable) was a set \u20ac50. The alternative would have been the taxi to the terminal then train or bus to the airport which would be a faff and still cost \u20ac35.

Well, we looked around for at least 20 minutes and never saw a sign with our name or the hotel on it. So, needless to say, we didn't have the best first impression of Rome. Upon arrival at the hotel, everything went smoothly. The room was very large, two stories, with a huge window. Even though we were overlooking the street, there was very little noise from outside. Everything in the room seemed to be fine until I tried to take a shower. There was no shower curtain, only a 2 foot by 3 foot pane of glass. The shower head was a disgrace...it didn't stay in place, and it sprayed in every direction except the one it was supposed to. This led to every shower being followed by sopping up the puddles all over the floor. Breakfasts were fairly minimal, mostly breads and juices and fruit cup. Overall, the common areas were perfectly fine. Everything seemed clean and orderly. Our biggest issue was with the front desk staff. Checking out we were basically ignored by the arrogant and rude people at the front desk. I had asked the day before about calling for a taxi to take us to the train station in the morning, and was told that they would call when we were checking out because it would only take a few minutes for the cab to arrive. So the morning of check out, I head up to the desk to pay and ask to have them call us a taxi. There was no real acknowledgement of my question, and there certainly was no answer, so I figured that they would call after the paperwork was done. After asking again once the bill was paid, I was told one was on its way and took a seat in the lobby with our bags. Another couple then arrived, also to check out, and was speaking Italian to the two people behind the desk. They checked out and walked out front to a taxi that was waiting for them. I waited another 5 or 10 minutes before getting up to ask again about the taxi. The man who checked us out, nodded in my direction and finally called the cab company. He then said a taxi would arrive in 4 minutes, so we went outside to wait. Overall, I would say the hotel itself was fine. The location was great, Piazza Navona is only minutes away, and most of the other sights are not much further. Out of the four different employees we saw at the front desk, only one was helpful, and the two during checkout were rude and unprofessional. It was enough to make me not want to recommend this hotel to anyone, because I'm sure there are hotels in the same area with similar amenities that have a more accomodating staff.", "Date": "June 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cRome was amazing!\u201d", "Author": "skibill", "ReviewID": "UR14151193", "Content": "I was not looking forward to Rome as to the other places we had booked in Italia.

As you could expect it took 1/2 hour for the front desk lady to organize anything after she had said \"..just a minute I talk to my colleague..\". Ok, we were offered a Double room which was a bit larger for on night and they suggested that we would be getting another room after that and we accepted their proposition. The bathroom (no bath just a shower from the wall/ceiling) was again filthy and disgusting and our mood was also very bad. The third room was ok with twin bed, with much cleaner \"bathroom\" (still no bath, only shower) \"You did not order any bath...\" - explained the clerk, No we didn't because in the Web reservation you could only reserve a Twin/double standard room...! The third room had wooden floors and nicer furniture and it was a bit bigger than the first ones. Breakfast was ok, without any fresh vegetables or fruits .(like in scandinavian hotels for example...). I definately would never go to Hotel Adriano again and would not recommend it to anyone, since I am sure you can find much better hotels in Rome and more value for your money!!! The hotel episode ruined our first days in Rome and the attitude of the hotel personnel was also humiliating and very arrogant. We wondered why we were put to the single room at the first place - do they treat all guests who have booked the room through web like that? Did they try if we would have been so stupid, that we would have accepted the first room as it was...that remains unknown.

The reception area, breakfast room, bar and lounge area were decorated in a modern eclectic style (apparently only recently done) and we thought this would bode well for our room.

The room was small, (we were expecting that) and did have a little balcony with some dead plants in a planter box. The bathroom was disgusting with mould in and around the shower screen, so thick in places you could scrape it off. Also the shower recess was tiny, fortunately my husband and I are thin, even a slightly overweight person would struggle. The shower head was strange as well, coming out in a heavy single stream rahter than spraying. Difficult to wash the hair! I also had to ring for a hair dryer, there wasn't one in the room, but it was brought up straight away. There was also an ant problem in the bathroom with a stream of ants there everyday.

I booked a Double Superior room at Hotel Adriano for four nights (250 euros a night) after reading reviews on Tripadvisor and Venere and contacting the hotel directly to ask questions about type of beds in the rooms and Internet use for guests. I looked at and read everything on the hotel's website. I read nothing about the demolition/remodeling/construction that surrounds the hotel itself and the immediate blocks around it. I was also surprised at the lack of maintenance/cleaning in the hotel's public areas and in our room. The staff at the front desk were businesslike and polite. The room assigned to us was 206 on the third floor ( the size was okay for Rome standards and it had a large bathroom (both the bedroom and bathroom had windows which opened). ( I noticed there was a pool of water on the floor in the bathroom.) As soon as I walked into my room I was greeted with the workmen on the scaffolding a few feet from my window talking and staring at us. Even with the soundproof windows closed the noise was horrible. I went down to the front desk and told them the reason I wanted to move and they said there was only one other room (another Double Superior) available and it was an interior room looking into a courtyard. Room 211 was much smaller and the bathroom was also smaller with no window. It was quieter than the first room, however, the courtyard we looked out onto (see photos) was a demolition site of a building. It looked as if there was an attempt to demolish the building and then they just stopped. There were piles of junk, old commodes, sinks, tiles and bricks, etc. It was disgusting and depressing. I went back to the front desk and they assured me this was the only room available and that it was a Double Superior room. We opted to stay in this room with the curtains closed rather than the niceer room 206 with the noise and men looking at us. Our room' s nice wooden floors were filthy with dirt, hair and dust balls. Even though I left 4 euros for the housekeeper each morning (the first two mornings) I would return to find the same debris and dust balls exactly where they were when I left. The bathroom mirrors were never cleaned. The bathroom shower leaked so much water that we had to use the bathmat and two towels to soak up the water and keep it from flowing into the hallway every day. You would think they would get tired of the flooding and fix the problem, but , no. I noticed that all the sink stoppers were closed when we checked in. After raising them I figured out why. There was a disgusting sewer smell coming up through the sink, bidet and shower drains. It was hard to brush your teeth or spend any time in the bathroom. The stairs from the lobby to the rooms were filthy with dirt and dust balls also. The same dirt and debris was there for the four nights and five days of our stay. There is a small courtyard off the stairway and it was covered with cigarette butts, leaves and trash. It was not touched either for the days we were there. The sofas and pillows are worn and in need of repair or replacement. The rug in the bar/lounge was covered with black stains. At breakfast two ladies from the UK asked us if they could ask about our room and its condition. They told us their horrible experience and we realized it was not just happening to us. The Internet charge is 7euros for one hour, however, there is no mouse, rollerball or touchpad on the keyboard. Instead, you use a toggle button to move around the page and it is like something out of the Pacman era. We gave up and went to an Internet point. The men at the front desk were polite and professional. We ordered a car for the morning of our departure and it was there on time and the driver was professional.

We can honestly say you will not find a more wonderful hotel in such a great location. The hotel was listed as a 3 * but we'd say it was more 4* for an European hotel as the price will tell you but worth it. The hotel was kind enough to have a taxi waiting for us on arrival at the airport due to such a late arrival time(12.30am due to flight delay) but it was at a cost of 60 euros but at least we got to the hotel ok. We had a twin room which looked newly decorated with a fab bathroom and a safety deposit box in the room. The breakfast was served between 7 and 10 but we did find it best to get there no later than 9 as they were somewhat reluctant to replenish supplies. The location of the hotel was ideal 10 minutes to Spanish steps, Piazza Navona, Trevi fountain and the Pantheon are all on the doorstep. We can recommend going to the Vatican city it just takes your breath away. Just a word of warning around the Coliseum that you will see people dressed in gladiators costumes wanting you to take there photo's.........it will cost you 5 euro even with your own camera so take care. A brief note for the ladies flat/wedge shoes are a must for all the cobble streets.

One bedside lamp not working. Fridge in room healthily stocked with tempting drinks etc. Didn't touch them though. We were warned not to put our own stuff in the fridge or it would be confiscated!

Served from 7 \u2013 10am, if you didn\u2019t get there at 7 on the dot there was not much left in the way of hot coffee or strawberry yoghurt. Egg boiler rather a complex gadget. Toaster/grill a bit daunting too. Tables were layed fresh every morning but we often had to use one which an earlier bird had left crumb-covered and which had not been re-layed. Hotel reception a bit reserved. We asked if we could put our passports in the hotel safe and were told we could but it would mean the concierge would have to \"walk all the way over to the other side of the hotel with us to do so\" so we didn't bother the poor fellow. We got the feeling that we were something of a nuisance just being there. Even leaving room key for the day was a bit much for them. (Actually, one concierge in particular who had more than a touch of Ming the Merciless about him). On leaving, while he obligingly called us a cab to get to the station, there was no goodbye as we wheeled our cases out of the foyer, Ming carefully keeping his haughty gaze averted. Rome was fantastic and can\u2019t wait to go back again. We were warned about muggings, pickpockets and gangs of street kids but we saw none of this.

The hotel was booked via a travel agent and we paid around \u00a3100 per night B&B rate, which although seems a little pricey for a 3 star, it is truly a great central location and I would suggest that the modern decor rises above a 3 star, and is closer to 4 star. Our check-in was dealt with smoothly (straight away given a map of Rome showing all the touristy bits), I was very impressed with the lobby. The lift is rather dodgy, I'd recommend walking the stairs if you can, at least one day we were there it was out of action. We had a newly refurbished room with a large kingsize bed and large bathroom including jacuzzi bath, all with wood or slate floors and marble accents. The shower pressure could be dodgy at times but that was my only complaint. It's also nice for a 3 star to offer toiletries and sewing kit etc. There was air con in the room as well as a minibar, hairdryer, TV and modem point. Be careful as you leave the hotel though - it is on a rather narrow street and mopeds are always whizzing past, as well as cars. Also if you are in the refurbished wing on the 3rd floor you may get a lot of noise from the roof terrace of an evening (scraping tables and chairs, loud voices etc) - just let reception know and they will try to do something about it. The breakfast was OK, not great. The breakfast room was rather small and couldn't cope with busy periods. Coffee was lovely though and the croissants weren't bad. Toast and rolls were available, although we weren't keen on them, and a bit of ham and cheese. Orange and grapefruit juice were offered, as well as museli and cornflakes (but not as we Brits know them!) and some yoghurt. Fruit salad (think Tesco's tinned) was also available, as was an egg boiler, although you need to bring your own watch - or, like one guest, as someone else to clock watch for you! There is no restaurant so you have no choice but to go out for lunch and dinner. This isn't a problem though as just 5 minutes will get you to a bank of restaurants when walking towads the Pantheon. Make sure you look at menus first though, we got fleeced by a terrible place in the Piazza Venezia for lunch (it looked like a 10 euro a head maximum place but they managed to change 55 euros for a couple of cokes and two cold margherita pizzas - beware!! Always ask for 'la lista', the menu!). Also go to a Despar if you can, equivalent to a 7-11 or Co-op, water there is just 30 cents for 1.5 litres, rather than 1.5 euros for 500ml by the Vatican! We didn't use a single bit of public transport whilst we were there. The location of the hotel is a comfortable 25 minutes' walk to St Peters, literally 5 minutes to the Pantheon, 5 minutes to the Piazza Navona (Fountain of the 4 Rivers), maybe 10 - 15 minutes to the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. It's a bit of a trek to the Colosseum but not difficult - just cross roads giving the drivers big evils and stare them down! (That won't work with mopeds though... they're nuts...) I'd also recommend a walk along the Tiber River, it's quite peaceful compared to the tourist traps mentioned above. We didn't realise there was a bar there until our last night. Not hugely overpriced, which was nice, 3 euros for a can of Coke and 4 - 5 euros for a bottle of beer, pretty good really. The bar was served either by a porter or the chap on reception so service was variable. There's more space than you realise at the back beyond reception, go take a look, it's lovely. A comfortable hotel, ideal for a city break where all you need is a comfortable place to sleep at night after a filling meal of spaghetti carbonara, and the odd nightcap.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Adriano", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d248861-Reviews-Hotel_Adriano-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$163 - $374*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Di Pallacorda 2</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00186</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "248861", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/bb/59/3f/junior-suite.jpg"}}
