We spent two nights in the Library Room, on the first floor, with no other rooms sharing a wall making it very quiet. The room had a 10 foot ceiling, like the rest of the first floor, and a huge bay window looking west that flooded the room with light. A wardrobe furniture piece was used for a closet, certainly adequate for a short stay. The TV was a small LCD unit connected to the usual litany of cable channels. There was a DVD player if you want to bring your favorite movies. Two upholstered chairs and a round table were in the bay window area. Window coverings, bed covers and decorative pillows were all very tasteful and top quality. An individual room thermostat for the quiet, forced-air heating/cooling system allowed us to keep the room delightfully cool while we slept in the very comfortable bed. The bathroom was large and had a very large, etched glass window bringing in lots of light. The claw foot tub was charming but negotiating the wrap-around shower curtain for taking a shower was a minor challenge. The towel warmer was a thoughtful touch and the terry robes were high quality, as were the towels and bed linens. The late afternoon wine and cheese offering was nicely done. Morning breakfast, served from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. every morning, was excellent. Orange juice and very good coffee were available in advance of a freshly baked pastry (muffin one day, scone the next) that was artfully served with fresh berries and creme fraiche. Three additional items were offered for choice: an omelet (or scramble); eggs any style with chicken sausage; and home-made granola with yogurt and fruit. The dining room was beautifully set with Wedgewood china and quality linens. Tables were also available outside on the porch or in the garden. Parking is available in their driveway for three cars in a row (which can be somewhat inconvenient) or in a small lot diagonally across the street for no extra charge. For a pleasant few days of vacation in the San Diego area, the Britt Scripps Inn would certainly be an excellent choice of a place to stay.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA", "Title": "\u201cRomantic Getaway\u201d", "Author": "LuvSLO", "ReviewID": "UR126918775", "Content": "Stayed here for one night in March to celebrate our wedding anniversary and enjoyed it very much. Although we live in San Diego, we wanted to sleep somewhere else to celebrate our anniversary and this was the perfect place! The property is very unique and has undergone extensive restorations that make it lovely. We stayed in the Balboa room which was very large, elegantly appointed and distinctly victorian. It had a king sized bed that was very comfortable but it seems the mattress might need replacing soon, as I thought I sensed a bit of a sag in the middle. We had a private balcony off the room which was a great place to sit in the morning. I found the bathroom, while charming with its pedestal sink and clawfoot tub, to be a little small. With there being no counter to place toiletries, it was a little challenging to get ready for our evening out. And while I'm sure bathing in a claw foot tub would be quite a unique experience, showering was challenging because it's so compact. There was also an unpleasant odor in the bathroom but I didn't mention it to the innkeepers since we stayed only one night. The room was very quiet expect for the occasional plane flying over in the morning since this area is below the flight path for the airport. That being said, it's also in a great location because it's close to all of the great restaurants in Banker's Hill and downtown. The room was also very dark in the morning due to the blackout curtains, which I loved. I enjoyed the evening wine and cheese reception and it's touches like this that make staying in B&Bs so worth it! In addition to serving great wines, it was nice to chat with other guests staying at the B&B. There was a tray of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies always available in the parlor which was great as well.. The grounds are beautiful and taking breakfast on the front porch was absolutely lovely. My husband brought a bottle of champagne so that we could enjoy it with breakfast and the staff had no problem chilling it for us. We both enjoyed the breakfast that was served; a scone and fresh berries, fresh orange juice, an omelet for him and eggs for me. I wasn't offere tea but would've liked some because I start all of my days with a cup of it. I'm not sure if they don't offer it in general or just didn't offer it to me. Check in and check out went smoothly and they even extended our checkout time until 1:00 which allowed us to enjoy a leisurely morning. Overall, I would recommend the property for a unique getaway, though it is a bit pricey.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing antiques\u201d", "Author": "Karimark_12", "ReviewID": "UR126693301", "Content": "We LOVE Britt Scripps.

There is the most beautiful two story stained glass window next to the stairwell. The main floor includes an inviting living room, a large foyer, a breakfast room, and a kitchen and a couple of guest rooms. The second floor has all guest rooms. I stayed in two rooms: the Balboa and the Renaissance. Each are included in the deluxe category and are the largest in the Inn. The Balboa was the original master suite and includes a large bedroom and bathroom, with plenty of storage and a balcony. It was tastefully decorated and had terrific light. My only complaint was that there was no rim or table in the bathroom to put your soap comfortably when taking a bath in the large soaking tub. The Renaissance room was even prettier, but a tad smaller. While the bathroom was smaller, it was actually better laid out. My only complaint with this room was that the lighting was a bit dim. I found the Inn very quiet. You could get to Old Town in 5 minutes, the airport in 10 minutes and walk to Balboa park and nice eating places. I thought the breakfasts were lovely.

I am vegetarian and had a choice of two meals on the menu. I chose an egg dish that was listed as containing only sun dried tomatoes and cheese. When I took a bite, I tasted meat. I spit it out and asked the proprietor if the dish contained meat. She assured me that I was just tasting the sun-dried tomatoes which she described as having a meaty texture. She did offer to verify this with the chef. When she returned, she notified me that my egg dish contained a turkey sausage.

It's an old Victorian that was in very good condition. The location was perfect for the Zoo, museums, and the hot, trendy restaurants. Their breakfast was great, fresh baked scones or muffins to start, followed by a choice of 3 entrees. The dining room had 3 tables (and they have 9 rooms) so you may have to wait until a table is free, but we had no problem. They have wine and cheese from 5-7 PM in the parlor. Classical music plays in the background at all times. Overall, it was very pleasant and relaxing. Parking was no problem. When you check in they give you a parking pass for a lot that is kitty corner to the hotel. The hostess was very nice and very helpful with restaurant and other tourist tips. The room was nice (we stayed in the Balboa room). Ladies, if you don't want to wash your hair every time you take a shower, bring your own shower cap. Also there was no clock in the room. That can be a pro or a con depending on your point of view. The linens were very nice and there's a down comforter on the bed. The biggest issue for me was that the bed itself was way too soft. There was a down pillow top on top of the mattress. I could not get comfortable, my back was killing me and I got virtually no sleep. If it weren't for my aching back I'd go back there in a flash. One final Expedia warning... if you book a room through Expedia, and request a king size bed THEY CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT FOR YOU. Expedia told me they could guarantee a King bed, but when I got the confirmation it was listed as a \"request.\" The owner at the Britt Scripps was nice enough to honor my request, but he didn't have to.

It is within walking distance of all the museums and the zoo, and some decent restaurants. The inn itself is beautiful, a victorian style house with a large wrapping porch. The room we had (the aesthetic) was lovely too - not cluttered like some b and bs can be. The bathroom had charming antique style furnishings, including a claw foot tub. The tub was cute to look at, but it did not make for a fun showering experience. I consider myself a normal sized person, but I could not take a shower in that tub without touching the shower curtain. The water pressure was not great either. There was also no place to put soap, shampoo etc. except a very small unsteady soap dish like thing attached to the shower. Then when we tried to sleep we found that the room was arranged in just such a way that the charming window over the door let the light from the hallway shine right on our heads. They should put a shade on the window or turn out the light in the hallway that is right outside the door. I am sure that other rooms have different arrangements and different tub styles, and likely don't have the same problems that our room had. My only recommendation is not to stay in the aesthetic. Breakfast was good, not the best I've ever had but good. They give you some choices. They also have wine and hors d'ouvres in the afternoon. The hors d'ouvres are basically cheese and crackers. Finally, regarding parking - I believe the inn has 9 or 10 rooms, but only provide 5 parking spaces - 3 at the inn, and 2 passes for a lot across the street.

Britt Scripps Inn made our trip quite enjoyable. The location is perfect. We were centrally located and enjoyed the quick drive to the beaches and La Jolla, the walk to the Padres game, the stroll through the Gas Lamp District and Seaport Village, and morning runs into Balboa Park. The staff is spectacular. The main entry area is so well decorated that it feels like you're staying in someone's house rather than a hotel. We would highly recommend staying there just for the breakfast. The chef, Paula, does her job very well. We usually stay at chain hotels and eat their standard breakfast created for the masses. The scones that greeted us every morning with coffee and orange juice were fantastic and definitely were not standard fair for the masses. The breakfast was so filling that we usually weren't hungry for lunch until 2pm. The nightly wine and cheese from 5-7p was a pleasant way to snack in the evening. We enjoyed the appetizers so much that we had to go eat dinner or we would have eaten the entire tray of cheese and crackers ourselves. We stayed in the Gothic room and enjoyed all of the features in that room. The sheets on the bed were so soft and the duvet was so comfortable that crawling into bed each night was a treat. Our room had a balcony and we found ourselves on that everyday. The wireless internet signal extended just far enough so that we could sit on the balcony, enjoy the views, and stay connected. The bathroom was modern and updated, but still maintained that bed and breakfast feel. I wish there was more counter space, but I was able to keep my toiletry bag on the edge of the counter and next to the window. There was a claw foot tub and shower combo that had wonderful shower pressure. The towels and bathrobes that were provided were thick and luxurious. When we interacted with the staff it was like talking to a friend. We worked with Sarah, Lexi, Aileen, and Nikki and can not say enough nice things about each of them. When we wanted some area recommendations they were well versed and friendly. When we had some requests, they were more than accommodating. I have no doubt that staying at this hotel made a great trip into a wonderful memory that we cherish.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "Delius17", "ReviewID": "UR76258710", "Content": "Had a lovely time here at this beautiful little hotel just minutes' walk from the park.

Romantic, well-appointed, friendly and casual. Some might expect staff to be ever-present, but for those who desire only a place to hide away and enjoy, this is the place. not a bit of street noise, even though it's on a busy street, it has an accommodating staff, even if they are not 'right there' to help (and I'm one who would prefer to find them, not find them at my door waiting for something). The rooms are wonderful. Ours had a lovely balcony overlooking the garden, where late at night we could sip champagne in comfort and privacy. Very romantic for my new bride and I. Our sleep was wonderful. The bed luxurious, the room appointments lavish (even if the room is smaller, to be expected in a very old building), while everything had and updated feel (such as the bathroom, heater, etc). No noise bothered us, we slept right through the morning rush hour. The breakfast, very delicious. They grow some of their herbs on-site, making the simple, yet delicious, fare even more so. Again, service is attentive, and when we were greeted by Eileen in the morning, she was part of this wonderful Victorian experience. For those who want different than the 'normal', for those who want romantic, to be let be to feel the ambience, for those who are not.... cookie-cutter types, I certainly recommend this beautiful place. If you're the sort who needs parking services, who needs someone right there to make sure you have a clean towel (after you've used three), or someone who simply needs your every need met, this might not be for you.

We stayed in the Garden Room because my wife likes the Shabby Chic decor and I thought this would be the perfect room for her. She was pleasantly surprised. She loved the thick wide crown moulding, fluffy down comforter on the bed, and wood flooring. The Inn was restored to it's turn of the century grandeur and we enjoyed examining the victorian era furniture and intricate woodwork of the day. The stained glass along the magnificent staircase was beautiful. The staff was very friendly and took the time to make sure our stay was comfortable. Our \"Butler\" Jenna was very friendly and took the time to show us around the Inn and gave us a guided tour and history lesson of the Inn. Our room faced the back of the Inn and overlooked the garden. It was very quiet and the only thing that woke us up was the smell of the fresh scones baking in the morning. The breakfast was superb!. We both had fresh scrambled eggs with seasoned potatoes and applewood smoked sausage. This was after a large scone served with fresh cream and rasberries. The coffee was outstanding and Jenna served up refill after refill and told us many guests ask for their special recipe. We were served complementery hors d'oeuvres of fine cheeses and crackers along with white and red wine upon our arrival in the conservatory and sat in comfortable chairs and were entertained by two couples we met who were staying at the Inn. This was the best trip and stay for my wife and I and we plan on returning to the Inn with family so they too can experience the atmosphere and comfort of the Britt Scripps Inn. The only negative I could come up with was the parking, since it's limited cars park in a line, one behind the other. If you had to leave the Inn numerous times it might be a pain. In our case we only left once, Jenna moved the car behind us and the second time we were in the back, no problem. I read that noise can be a problem here but since our room faced the garden we didn't experience any. Another potential concern would be the Claw Foot Tub. We had a shower in the Garden Room so it wasn't a problem but the couple we spoke too had one and they did saw it was a little tough to climb in.

They put us in the Carriage House, which is the old garage turned into a little cottage. The Carriage house is absolutely adorable, and couldn't have been more perfect. It's not very large - but it was perfect for us. It's decorated so cute and the finishes are actually quite top-notch. The sheets were some ridiculously high thread count, I kept saying to my husband \"we have to find some of these sheets for home.\" I think the bed was the most comfortable I've ever had at a hotel. The inside of the main house is absolutely gorgeous, though we didn't spend but maybe ten minutes there. We sat out on the front porch for the included breakfast. They ended up taking so long to bring us our food, we had somewhere to be and didn't get to eat. But the coffee and the scones were absolutely delicious - I imagine the breakfast would have been too.
