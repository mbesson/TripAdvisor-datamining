A good idea would be to ask for a room on the opposite side of the disc. Meanwhile, the disc really is somewhat of a pick-up joint as is the dance bar next door, but their entrances are separate from the hotel. The hotel has other decent restaurants as well as a lounge bar. All in all it's a safe bet, especially with the innumerable Indian tourists staying there. The location too, is great. It lies quietly in the middle of the street, surrounded by decent malls and eating joints. It's conveniently located vis-a-vis other attractions in the city too.

The manager didn't even say that he would speak to the member of staff who had been in our room- apparently it was our responsibily to look after our goods and if he employed thieves then that was just our bad luck.We reported the theft to the police who just rolled their eyes when we said what hotel we were in.

We soon realised though that Dubai is very spread out and we were as central as anyone else. The hotel bars were dark and seedy with prostitutes haunting the place. The drink was surprisingly good though. There are excellent supermarkets either side of the hotel where there is all the usual western food stuffs etc. We found these very useful for breakfast where we bought plastic bowls and spoons for our cornflakes. There is a tourist guide in the hotel lobby who will grab you at some stage or another during your stay. He gave some good advice and arranged the safari and tickets to wild wadi and a cruise on the creek. Avoid the city tour though, this is done in a cramped 4 x 4.
