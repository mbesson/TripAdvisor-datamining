We stayed at the Transit on the recommendation of our educational tours company, and I thought I would post my thoughts to help other schools/youth groups etc who may be considering it. The location is pretty good, very close to the subway (5-8 minute walk). There are shops and a very good pizza restaurant who were happy to give us a seperate area and very good service very nearby. The hostel is on a side street and only about 40 minutes to Berlin airport by coach. Rooms - we had a mixture of room sizes - our party consisted of 21 girls, 6 boys, 1 male adult and 2 female adults so we had double, twins, 4,5 and 6 bedded rooms. These were all good sizes, basic but clean. Showers were not great, our particular room the shower unit is located so close to the wall, right in the corner, that it just wants to spray down the wall all the time, no matter how much you try to direct it otherwise, so having a shower meant practically standing with your back right against the wall. Our biggest problem was the layout of the floors. The hostel only has 2 floors, 3 and 4, and instead of the usual hotel floor corridor with rooms either side that i was expecting, the floors are laid out like the outside of a square, with about 6 rooms on each of the 4 sides. We had specifically requested all our rooms together, to enable us to monitor our pupils safely, but we got rooms on all 4 sides, spread quite widely. When i requested they be changed the staff were very blunt with a \"nothing we can do, live with it\" response. This resulted in problems with noise - from other groups of university students who i would have thought were all old enough to know better - running up and down the corridors in the middle of the night , banging on the doors of our pupils asking for rizzlas so they could roll a joint, and sitting outside our doors having very loud conversations at 3/4am. Again the hostel staff were not interested in listening to our complaints. The other problem with bringing a group of under 16s here is that the bar is open day and night, and many of the other groups and guests took FULL advantage of that, and despite many no smoking signs all over the place the smoke is thick in the bar/restuarant area. Again not an ideal situation to put school pupils into. So all in all, whilst an adequate accomodation for adults wanting to travel cheaply, definately not recommended for school parties. The rest of our trip to Berlin - my first - was excellent, saw and learnt so much and cant wait to go back - just to different accomodation!", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest value for the money in Berlin!\u201d", "Author": "LittleMissExplorer27", "ReviewID": "UR39477034", "Content": "We stayed here as a group of 4, in a 4-bed room, at 128\u20ac per night. The hotel is a converted cigar-factory, so is quiet spacious, and a little industrial. It's quite trendy in the way it's decorated, and they have hung on to the orginal character of the building. Breakfast is ok, typical continental breakfast. We didn't have any other meals there as we wanted to enjoy the city! It's not the most central hotel, but it doesn't matter as the underground is so cheap, fast and efficient. The hotel is located in the 'gay quarter' - we were thrilled as the bars and social life around the hotel was much cooler! The hotel is on a quiet side street, and we didn't hear any noise at all - from other rooms or from the roads (we were on 4th floor). The beds are comfortable enough, and even at this price they do change all of your towels etc every day, and tidy up the room. The safe needed a euro every time you wanted to lock it, which surprised us as we thought it would return the coin. All in all, when we go away, we expect a clean, comfy room, and to feel safe - exactly what we got. Our view is that you rent the room, you don't buy it, so why pay a fortune for soft carpet? I whole-heartedly recommend this hotel to friends and students, maybe not business travellers and definitely not couples.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood low cost accomadation in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "jeep_potter", "ReviewID": "UR21421174", "Content": "9 of us stopped here in October 2008. I had booked 3 triple rooms via the hotel website. On arrival we were placed in 3 rooms with 6 beds in each! The cost per person for 3 nights was 96 Euros which included breakfast. Breakfast is served from 7am until noon in the bar/reception area on the 4th floor. It consisited of a wide selection of cereals, fruit, cheeses, cooked meats and bread. Coffee and Tea were available. Orange Juice was 1.5 Euros at the bar. The rooms were very large. There was no TVs in the rooms. The bathrooms were basic but clean, The showers were especially powerful. My room over looked the courtyard. The hotel had a bar at reception which stayed open until about 3am. Smoking is allowed in the bar which pleased and displeased some of our group. The Transit is situated just off a main street. It's handy for the nightlife in Bergmanstrasse, and if you want to travel further afield then the U-Bahn station (Mehringdham) is about a 6-8 minute walk.
