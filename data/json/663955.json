I feel skeezy just looking at the bed, the desk wobbles. Free WiFi is a joke because I MAYBE can load Google. If I'm lucky and it's like 3AM (which is fine, with the state of the bed I barely wanted to sleep). The staircase does not feel sturdy and may in fact be falling apart. There are no other exits, there's no real handles on the door and staff leaves the room unlocked after cleaning. I don't know if that is normal over there, but I doubt it. The breakfast is terrible, the staff person who runs it literally sat and watched Real Housewives of where ever when there was no water in the kettle. The room wasn't serviced when they gave it to us. The room smelled, probably from the carpet, the shower didn't close properly, and the hot water was iffy at best. One of the beds in the twin room was held up with a piece of plywood where the frame had bent. The towels were so worn I would have to dry myself with the clothes I wore the day before. There's stuff all over the stairs and there were TVs sitting on the third floor landing for no reason other than the fact that I don't think these people know what a trash can (rubbish bin?) is. Basically, I felt like I was squatting in some drug or prostitution motel. Actually, that's an insult to both of those things. At least they service the rooms before giving them to someone else usually. Only stay here if it is the LAST OPTION for one night. Actually, I'd rather sleep in Paddington station. It seemed cleaner to me.

The room description said there were tea and coffee facilities in the room (not in our room or any of our friends), the curtains just about reached each side of the window. Toilet paper was so thin it was almost transparent and the metal stand for accommodating your personal belongings was totally inadequate and filthy dirty. One of our major concerns was the lack of information in the rooms, on the landings and staircase for the procedure should there be a fire, there were no external fire escapes and the only route down was the main staircase. Finally we have travelled to various places around the world but have never had to make our own tea and coffee at breakfast, even at self service breakfasts you are asked for your preference then this is brought to your table. My husband went up to make a drink and the kettle was empty, he then had to go into the kitchen and fill it himself.

I would advice this hotel for tourists who are into hard core sight seeing and plan to spend very less time in the room. They should concentrate a bit on the hygiene of the rooms as they are not well kempt. The hotel has some pluses for example, their buffet breakfast is very good and tasty. Also, the location is great. It is in walkable distance from the Paddington train station and also easilty connected to all the touriest attractions.

The good thing about this hotel is value for money and convinience to the tube and fast food joints, pubs, indian, italian restaurants and good old Angus restaurant chain. The downsides is what you pay is what you get as the bedspread i had have a suspicous big blot, the bathroom tiles can look a tad grotty and the curtains/windows need a good wash. Because this is located on main road and near to St Mary Hospital you may get woken up by sirens of ambulances.
