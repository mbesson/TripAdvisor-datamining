We chose the hotel for its location (close to a train station on the Yamanote Line) and for its price (not too expensive). We checked TripAdvisor for reviews before we booked, but didn't find any, so we took a chance. It's run by the same company that owns the Lornstar, and we found the hotel by looking on the Lornstar's website. Our room was spotless and modern, on the 10th floor. It had hardwood floors, and a firm bed. There was a fridge for our use, a washlet (a fancy electric toilet / bidet), and a nice deep bathtub / shower. Breakfast was included, and consisted of a selection of artisan breads from the bakery next door, jam, margarine, coffee, tea, juice and milk. We could eat on the terrace, in the lobby, or in our room. There were toaster ovens if we wanted to make toast. The staff were all very professional. Some of the front desk staff speak English. Internet is available in the rooms if you bring your own laptop (200 JPY for a 24-hour period) or there are computers in the lobby that are free to use. The neighbourhood is pretty nice, but not as exciting at Shibuya or Ginza. There are no major sights in the area, but there are lots of cheap places to eat, a couple of grocery stores, a laundromat and a post office all within a five minute walk from the front door. There are two train stations close by--Gotanda (also a subway station), and Osaki (which is a little farther away but much more interesting), so it's really easy to see the city. The only drawback was the size of the room. We booked a double, but with our luggage (2 small carry-on sized suitcases) the room was pretty cramped. There was nowhere to unpack our stuff; I had to keep my suitcase in the bathroom under the sink, and my husband's stayed on the floor.We would be happy to stay here again.", "Date": "Jun 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR840542558", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "cheryln"}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs bon rapport qualit\u8305-situation/prix   showReview(18128541, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR773456819", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Yasaka"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066854-d658684-r16669518-Gotanda_Arietta_Hotel_Trattoria-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "658684", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
