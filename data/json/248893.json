The room was also lovely and warm, it was October and typical rainy October weather but we didn't need sheets, which was also good as the sheets were of poor quality. A very good thing was the mini bar which was really cheap! it was only 3 euros for a beer. However the walls were rather thin. We could hear everything going on next door- mainly a lot of showering! The breakfast was O.K. there was choice and variety. We bought spa passes from the hotel before we went. The spa isn't actually in the hotel but in another hotel which is 20 mins walk away. It is a lovely spa but the hotel would benefit from having this in house rather than in a separate hotel. Staff were friendly and bilingual which was very useful. Also the location of Lido is great as the water buses are regular and not too far from the hotel. Overall a good trip.

Dinner isn't served at the hotel, but there are plenty of places to eat on the Lido. Prices vary, so look at the menus outside before venturing in. The hotel is a short walk from the AliLaguna (or other) waterbus terminal. These take you across the water to the main islands of Venice quickly, but make sure you're on the right one.

I like watching tv at the end of the day before I go to sleep, and it was great to watch some NBA sports, fox sitcoms and they were all in english (other hotels dub them in italian). 2) the bathroom was very nice and clean and the bathtub doubled up as a Jacuzzi which was very relaxing.

The room is big and comfortable, but with no view of any kind. The room smelt rather badly of raw sewage - the only room in the hotel to do so. We asked if we could change rooms because of the smell and were told we could do so if we paid an extra 90 Euros per night. We couldn't afford this so we asked for some air freshener to make the smell more bearable. When we went to bed that night it was very cold so we turned on the heating. What a noise!!!! There was a problem with the heater in the room which made it sound like a motor boat. We got no sleep during the first night. The heating could not be turned off and woke us every hour when it turned on. By morning we were very tired and were not looking forward to tromping round Venice in such a state. We asked the desk clerk if there was any possibility of changing rooms as we were not willing to use that room again. We were considering moving hotel if nothing could be done and applying for a refund from the Russo. The desk clerk was very nice and agreed to move us to another room without having to pay extra as compensation. He seemed surprised that the room smelt and that the heating was noisy, but I suspect they knew this and used the room for cheap travellers, maybe to charge extra money for moving? The room we used on the second night was small, but had a view of the lagoon and didn't smell. The heater worked properly, too. The buffet breakfast is very basic, but did seem to fill us until lunchtime. Don't expect too much.

The only meal available was breakfast and in a 4* we would have expected to have been able to get an evening meal. If staying in Venice it was way out (at least an hour on the water bus which stopped at every stop along the way!!). All in all the hotel was ok for a 3 night stay but anything more you would want one with more facilities on offer.", "Date": "May 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWill stay there again, if we get a chance to go back...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3394280", "Content": "My wife and I booked for a 12-14 Apr 2005 stay at this hotel thru hotels. Before we started our trip, we knew that we will be arriving very late into Venice since we took a late flight from London. So, I decided to contact the hotel to advise them of our late check-in. After getting their contact info from hotels, I emailed the hotel ASAP. The next day, I already got a response from them, assuring us that our room will be available when we arrive. The email even included their guide on how to get to the hotel thru different means with the suggested price to pay. Not contented with the email, I called the hotel just as we were leaving from the London airport, again advising them that we were on our way and we were arriving very late. Again, I was assured that our room was ready and waiting. Using the guide that they sent us, we arrived at the hotel without much trouble using the public water bus. By the time we stepped up to the front-desk, the guy just gave us the key to the room. He already knew who we were! :) We were waken-up that morning, and every morning after that, by their heavenly and sweet-smelling buffet breakfast. We did not really need to setup the alarm in the room nor arrange for a wake-up call ever. The morning breakfast was enough to wake us up! The location is in Lido, which is a few minutes away from the Venizia island by water bus. We did not care. The short walk from the water bus station to the hotel was not a big deal to us either. Everytime we take that walk, it was very romantic, even the times we had to drag our luggages with us. We will definitely stay in this hotel again, if we ever get another chance to go back to Venice.", "Date": "April 20, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Russo Palace Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d248893-Reviews-Russo_Palace_Hotel-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$124 - $283*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Riviera San Nicolo 11/A</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30126</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "248893", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/90/ce/90ce0630cb4110c146e05fdff63a48ab6large.jpg"}}
