Club Intrawest uses the top floors of the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre tower and guests are able to use all of the Sheraton's facilities. The location is excellent, within walking distance of many of the major attractions. I had a queen bed room, which had a small kitchenette as well as a seating area with table. The room was a good size and had a huge bathroom, with walk in shower. Being on the top floors of the tower the rooms have magnificent views, especially with the floor to ceiling windows. The room was clean, very comfortable and felt modern (although note for longer stays cleaning isn't done every day). Check-in and check-out was all through the Sheraton hotel staff who were polite and friendly. Given I checked in late and left relatively early I didn't use the Club Intrawest area (which is a lounge area with tea/coffee/snacks/newspapers and PCs available). There is a conceierge on duty during the day who can help with reservations and other bookings. Club Intrawest also gives discounts on some of the Sheraton's paid for facilities such as spa treatments. The gym and swimming pool area are excellent, the pool was a nice size and there are changing facilities there to use. Be aware the gym can get busy though. If you can find a cheap deal for Club Intrawest then I definitely recommend it, especially if your only planning on staying a few nights. However at full price I'm not sure if it's worth it, there's bigger rooms in hotels close by. Bad points - Can be pricey. Good points - Excellent location for downtown. Fantastic views and a really comfy room. Free Wi-fi. Club Intrawest facilities useful especially for those with busy schedules. Tips - The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Skytrain (Vancouver City Centre or Yaletown - both on the Canada line which links direct to the airport). There's a small notice-board outside the Club Intrawest lounge where people put up their hints and tips for Vancouver's best restaurants and activities, well worth a read.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cStunning views and apartment\u201d", "Author": "Starkraving", "ReviewID": "UR116155932", "Content": "Club Intrawest is based on the top 3 floors of the north tower of the Sheraton Wall Centre.

It is closer to the centre of the shopping and entertainment districts. Yaletown, with it's excellent bars and restaurants is an easy 10 minute stroll as well. It's a bit far to walk to the nearest Skytrain station (Yaletown Roundhouse) with suitcases.

As for our experience, we were very pleased with this exchange. The Facility: Located on the top three floors of the Sheraton Wall Center hotel, we received our confirmation for a studio room that we knew would be very compact. So we were very pleasantly surprised to find we had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite on the 29th floor. We were very happy with the room. The living space consisted of an ample room equipped with a couch that sat 2 comfortably, and an easy chair. In the center of the room was an island with two bar stools for eating. Contained within the island was the flat screen TV and the refrigerator and some drawers. On the far wall was the sink, microwave and coffee maker. In the closet in this room was the ironing board and iron, a room safe, a recycle bin and a flashlight. The bathroom had a long double sink, and a bath tub with shower capability and a private commode. The bedroom had a queen sized very comfortable bed, nightstands and a closet. The best thing about the suite was the full outer wall of floor to ceiling glass windows that looked out on the city. While we did not have a mountain or harbor view, we didn\u2019t complain since we had the upgrade!! The only downside to the room was the lighting. The only light in the bedroom were two very small lights on the nightstands that did not reflect into the entire room, so once the sun set, the bedroom was not easy to navigate in. Phones in livingroom and bedroom. Local and 800 calls free. Wifi available in room at no cost. Passwords on the welcome information located in the room. There was a community lounge on the 29th floor that had an Interwest concierge present for a few hours in the morning and the afternoon. Newpapers, coffee, restaurant menus, maps, a computer with printer and a telescope were available for use there. We could also use the hotel concierge in the main lobby. The hotel was very quiet. Even though they had a convention occurring while we were there, we heard no noise and had no problems using the elevator. The hotel was conveniently located on the corner of Hornby and Burrard. The bus stop on Burrard was very convenient. We used only local transportation and had no problems at all. Since this is not a primary timeshare location, Intrawest did not have any events planned for quests, so do not expect an orientation, a welcome event, or any timeshare presentation offers. The Location: We found the location perfect for an urban stay in Vancouver. We arrived at the international terminal of Vancouver airport and took the Skytrain to the Hotel. Skytrain was located at the junction of the International and domestic terminals on the arrivals floor. We went to the lower level near the Skytrain entrance where a 7/11 sold books of 10 Translink tickets. This allowed us to avoid the $5 airport surcharge for any ticket purchased at the Skytrain machine. We took the Skytrain to the Vancouver Center station and then walked the blocks to the hotel. For our entire stay we only used public transportation, using Translink tickets. One day, when we had a number of sites to see, we purchased a Day Pass for the day and it was easy to jump on and off buses. The hotel pointed us to the AIG market two blocks away for groceries. Be prepared for sticker shock. Vancouver has the highest cost of living of any city in Canada. Tax is 12%.

The suite is small, but very comfortable, affording excellent views of the city ( we faced the harbor ) and well appointed. Included was a small kitchenette area, a nicely designed (shower only) bathroom, and a small desk area, in addition to the bed area. The kitchenette had all we needed, right down to a wine cork opener, and as an added bonus, free wireless access with the supplied Intrawest password was provided.

For those that expect daily housekeeping, Intrawest does not provide service but once a week, but then when I travel, I usually don't use daily linen sevices, so it was not a concern. The hotel itself is very centrally located, about five minutes from Robson Street, and within easy walking distance of the harbor, Gastown, Chinatown, Yaletown, and Stanley Park... bus and cab service is also easily available. For food, there was a small IGA supermarket about two blocks up Burrard Street toward the harbor, and coffee shops bordered on the absurd, but the little French cafe on the Hornby Street corner proved to be the best.

Finding a phone number for the Vancouver Intrawest was difficult. Having someone answer the phone proved impossible. I was later to learn that the \"concierge\", apparently the only staff member on site, leaves at 5pm (Intrawest leases 3 floors from the Sheraton. Sheraton staff do the check-in, but can't answer any questions about Intrawest rooms). I finally found a number for the Intrawest \"24-hour concierge\" in Whistler, who confirmed that a studio can sleep 4 (a queen bed and a pull-out couch). Upon arrival, after a lengthy wait while our room was being finished (check in is at 4:00, but our room wasn't ready until 4:30), we were shocked to see that our studio only had a queen bed. It did not even have a couch, let alone any potential for sleeping 4. Luckily the concierge was still on duty but he offered little in the way of apology and handled the situation poorly. He expressed disbelief that anyone at Intrawest had told me a studio would have a pull-out couch and couldn't believe that we had been allowed to book 4 people into a studio (our travelocity itinerary clearly showed our reservation for 2 adults and 2 kids in a studio). All he could do was move us into a new room at the Sheraton, at a higher rate. What we saw of the room was lovely, but given the inadequate staffing and management of this site, I would not risk booking here again.", "Date": "February 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "Matty", "ReviewID": "UR3023711", "Content": "We stayed here in mid December 2004.

Club Intrawest has bought floors 28, 29, and 30 of the Sheraton Wall Center and has provided floor to ceiling windows throughout for a magnificent view of Vancouver. All furnishings were quite up to date and very comfortable. Valet parking is extra but provided great convenience. Our car was ready within minutes of a call to the parking desk. My only criticism is that there is a $10 cdn fee per person for each day of use of the fitness area. This seems a bit chintzy however it may be because the Sheraton actually runs the hotel.", "Date": "May 28, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Club Intrawest - Vancouver", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g154943-d224685-Reviews-Club_Intrawest_Vancouver-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html", "Price": "$160 - $285*", "Address": "<div class=\"wrap_bl wrap\">", "HotelID": "224685", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/86/8f/868f5c1cdb391b42150b6614f373128c3large.jpg"}}
