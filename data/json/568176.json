{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Clean and Spacious We booked our holiday through Thomsons.The room/apartment was large, and clean and tidy. It was quite basic, ie very cheap shampoos etc, and no luxurys, however for the price it couldn't be faulted.The location was good, in close proximity to the beach, but away from the busy areas.The staff were friendly and helpful.The beds were soooo hard. It was painful to roll over, and hard to get comfortable.I disagree with a previous review about the cafe. It was revolting. All deep-fried, and nothing spanish on the menu.I would like to add that Pineda de Mar was nothing special. The beach was beautiful but that is it. All the shops are fulled with tourist souvineers, and we couldn't find anywhere half decent to eat. We are not fussy people, we just wanted perhaps something spanish, or healthy, or some fresh seafood. However, all the restaurants seemed to have the exact same menu, consisting of deep fried food, toasted sandwhiches, pizza, and mexican!! When I say the same menu, I mean the EXACT SAME MENU. We were really disappointed. I would not come back to Pineda de Mar again. I would suggest that anyone thinking about staying here, should maybe rethink and stay somewhere futher up on the Costa Brava.", "Date": "Sep 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR975271193", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "HilaryM"}, {"Content": "Fabulous! We were very pleased with these apartments. Beautifully decorated and a good size. Plenty of space for clothes and suitcases which kept the place tidy too. It also had a full size fridge which is a must to keep the beers and wine chilled which we enjoyed on the front balcony. Great location in the middle of the town. The cafe bar downstairs does a good breakfast selection and the best coffee I've ever tasted. Pineda is very small and quiet with gorgeous beaches. The train service is excellent and very cheap. You can yuse the pool in the Promenade Hotel which is very nice but the beach is just as near.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR680409725", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "dominomags"}, {"Content": "Lovely hotel I have recently returned from the nostre mar apartments in Costa Brava with my boyfriend. We were allocated on arrival and werent sure whether the hotel would be nice. We were allocated to the nostre mar and couldnt have been happier. This hotel was beautiful, very clean, modern and the staff were brilliant. the apartments didnt have a pool but we were given a card on arrival, which would give us entry to the pool at the hotel promenade, which was directly opposite. The hotel was also in a useful area as it was surrounded by shops, bars, restaurants, a chemist etc. Overall, we loved this hotel and would definatley advise anyone to stay there when visiting Costa Brava.", "Date": "Sep 2, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR284684540", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Quite resort, nice apartment Having just returned from Costa Brava, I thought I would share my thoughts on this holiday with anyone who may be interested. I found the Nostre Mar apartmentments to be very well kept and was pleasantly surprised at the size of the rooms. The beds in the room we were staying in however were very creaky and this made it difficult to sleep at night.Pineda itself is a very small and relatively unspoilt resort. The majority of the shops close during the day and reopen at 5.00 ish until about 10.00 p.mFood was tasty and CKs international bar gets a thumbs up for the price and amount of good food.A train is available from the station in Pineda to Barcelona and many of the other resorts. This was incredibly cheap, clean and always on timeIf you want a chilled holiday I would recommend this resort and the Nostre Mar (as long as you are on the front of the hotel - I understand the rooms at the back are not too good!). If your looking for plenty of action and discos - I suggest you go to a different resort.
