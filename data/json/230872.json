The reception staff were very friendly as were the bar staff. We had worried that it may have been better to stay in Alexanderplatz but the hotel gives you a travel pass for your entire stay, which can be used on trams, trains and buses. The trains are so efficient, so there's no inconvenience from staying at this hotel and everywhere is within easy reach. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as we found a cheaper option was to get the train to Alexanderplatz and visit the Alex Cafe round the back of the TV Tower. There's a buffet breakfast for about six euros. We also ate out for dinner so can't comment on the food in the hotel. There's no problem with noise from the trains at all. However, our room was facing the front of the hotel above some bus stops.

At this point we should have just decided to take our own kettle with us, but anyway, we didn't think about that.

We made the mistake of walking around the outside of the station complex to find the hotel, but once we knew where it was - it was an EXCELLENT find. Our holiday special rate included a dinner for two as well as breakfast daily (we stayed 2 nights). The InterCity's provide a local transit pass free with your stay - can't begin to say how helpful that is. In a new country/city/etc.. we had no worries about purchasing transit. Took bus or rail EVERYWHERE - especially easy considering we were sleeping next to the station. Speaking of that, we could also hop next door to grab snacks, drinks, etc.. On our last day, we grabbed a lunch to go for our 4-hour train ride to Prague. The breakfast had a lot of selection, so it was decent. Dinner was OK - considering it was free. Our only choice was the special of the day - duck. It wasn't bad (don't have experience with duck) - it at least got us to try something new. The staff always seemed a little uninterested, but the whole concept of service is different in Europe that the US. The room was fair size for Europe, from review advice we requested a room on the quiet side of the hotel (non-station side) - we heard no train noise. (I'm not sure if we would have - the rooms seemed to be well soundproofed). We were traveling with a toddler, and the crib was sturdy and, although the crib wasn't there when we arrived it was delivered promptly. The beds were 2 twins pushed together, but we ended up with that all over Europe. The comforters were great though - down. The rooms were clean - especially the bathrooms. We don't often ask much of the front desk/staff, but they were very friendly and helpful when we did interact. All in all - we really loved the hotel.
