Being our first stay in a premier inn, we didn't know what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised. The room was plenty big enough, we had a corner family room - 1 mahoosive bed, 2 small doubles, and a cot, was on the 6th floor, so nice and quiet. Food was lovely, we had dinner and breakfast, both meals were good value for money, and really, really nice. Staff were friendly, although they had said about an easter egg hunt to my son, but there was no evidence of it in the morning :( - wasn't expecting anything tbh, but 6 year olds remember (and go on about) easter egg hunts!! Good position in which to explore the city by, tube station a couple of minutes walk away, and the staff were helpful when we needed advise. The thing that I liked the best is that it's no extra for families, than it would be for a couple, and this goes for all ppremier inns so I believe. Also kids breakfast was free (max 2 per 1 paying adult) Feel like we got a bargain, and in london, that's a bonus!!

The hotel is well positioned for walking to the HMV Hammersmith Apollo (approx 15 minutes stroll away), and I didn't feel unsafe doing this walk alone gone midnight... Its also ideal to use as a base to venture into central London, as there are 3 mainline stations nearby - with Ravenscourt Road station being the nearest (about 5 mins away). The only other niggles I had (apart from the small room size), were small things...only one chair in the room (when it was a twin, so one of us had to perch on one of the beds)...noisy students running up and down the corridor...no double glazing (so let road noise etc in)...and was woken up one night by the couple next door having sex! Haha - yeah, the walls are PRETTY thin!!! :D :D And the car park is TINY!!! Apart from these minor gripes, this hotel offers a great location for getting out and about in London, and is brilliant for going to the Hammersmith if you've a gig on (like I had)...and the attitude of the staff makes up for these moans too - they're all really friendly and helpful and were genuinely interested in what I had been doing that day etc. I'd definately use the Hammersmith Premier Inn again - its just a shame the small room etc dulled the shine on what would have been my best Premier Inn stay to date!", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Molton, Devon", "Title": "\u201cYou get what it says on the tin!\u201d", "Author": "dollydollop", "ReviewID": "UR126492118", "Content": "A standard Premier Inn so you know what to expect when you open the door.

There were some security measures in place (you had to use your room key to access the accommodation floors) which helped make me feel safe and secure. The hotel was well maintained and comfortable. The room I had was very small, although I expected nothing else for the price in London. It was fine for me, but a couple would have struggled a bit. The double bed was pushed up against one wall and floor space was minimal - there would have been a lot of edging past one another! The room was clean and well presented, and it had secondary double glazing to help deaden the noise from outside. The bed was what I would class as 'all right' - it certainly could have been a bit firmer but it was by no means was the worst I have ever experienced. The shower room was also clean. Again, it was small, and had no bath, but the water pressure was fantastic. Breakfast was fine, although some Premier Inns give a wider choice of breakfast, space in the dining room was constrained. Above all, the staff were fantastic - all very helpful and courteous. The hotel is roughly 200 yards from a tube station.

I choose because of the location - I wanted something in Hammersmith. It is very close to the tube station if you did want to travel into central London, and there are several restaurant / bars nearby. From the outside it looks really ugly, however as soon as you are inside you get a lovely welcome from the reception team. I would recommend a room on the top floor (12th floor). I had a corner room and the views were amazing - also it was really quiet. The room was as expected for a Premier Inn, so I was happy with this and the facilities. I did eat in the restaurant (mainly as I didnt have much time), however I probably wouldnt do this again. The soup (smoked tomato) was asty but so boiling hot it had to have been heated up in a microwave. It was unbelievably hot - so took quite a while to eat. This meant (I think ) my main course sat on a hot plate for a long time: I had a special salmon with caper sauce, brocolli and new potatoes. Sounded nice but was all overcooked. In summary - would I stay here again? If I needed to be in Hammersmith yes, but if I was visiting London on holiday I would want to be closer to the centre.

Even a good full-length mirror with excellent lighting and a hair dryer with a long cable. I was shattered after a very long and busy day. All I wanted was a bite to eat and go to bed. I went to eat in the restaurant, I was asked how many the table was for. I replied that it was just me and saw I was the only one in the place.

The waiter offered to carry it to my room - I declined as a few people had started to arrive. I slept like a log and heard no noise in the corridor even though I was by the doors/lift.

You do sell yourselves as a business hotel during the week Premier Inn, so get it together and offer free Wi-Fi. It wouldn't cost you anything and if McDonald's can do it, I'm sure you can. Also need to sort out your car park charges at the one in Hammersmith. You have very limited parking and charge \u00a315 for a 24-hour period. This is slightly ridiculous as nobody ever really stays in your hotels for 24 hours. What about charging \u00a310 for up to 12 hours. Incidentally for anyone staying here, although the receptionist didn't know this, there is plenty of parking in the side streets which is free after 6 PM and doesn't start again the following morning until 9 AM so you got an early departure no need to give Premier Inn anything for their overpriced car park.

I wasn't too sure what to expect, because when I got off the bus, the Premier Inn was towering high in the sky in the near distance. As I got closer, I could see that it was a very old building, possibly ex Council offices, so I climbed up the stairs and in to a seating area with trepidation. Down some stairs was the reception desk with what looked like two positions, both of which were manned and busy. To the left of reception was a small bar. Once it was my turn to check in, I was very pleasantly surpirsed at how friendly and professional my welcome was. Power to your elbow R.K, you explained everything to me as I would expect to hear it. You told me about the Good Night Guarantee, what time the breakfast was served and even introduced me to your colleague at reception. I was allocated a room on the 13th floor and here I have a word of caution. The lift only goes up to floor 12, so if you are old or have loads of luggage this is not the floor for you! Before I went out for the evening I decided to give the bar a try and on offer and available were Stella Artois and Carlsberg which equates to a 100% availability of lagers offered. What really surprised me was the price for a pint of Stella, where I was charged \u00a33.20. Now this is 35p cheaper than another Premier Inn that I recently stayed in. I decided to have a couple more pints before I left and again, the barman was great. He was attentive and on top of his job. On my return, I had another couple of pints and again, the barman was good and at the end of his shift, he even took the time out to say goodnight to the three of us that were sat at the bar. Something that is sadly lacking in the majority of hotels. Unfortunately though, all was not well and I had the following issues which I discussed with the manager the next morning.I was allocated a room on the 13th floor and the room was the closest room to the lift machine room and all night long I listened to the drone of lift machinery. Also the room was cold, so I turned the air conditioning on by using the control on the wall that looked like it had come out of the Ark. Having said that, it was fit for purpose but when the air conditioning started its heating cycle it began to make noises like running water-a bit like sitting next to a fountain. So I turned the air conditioning off and resorted to turning on the convector heater that had been provided. This was not, unfortunately, enough to overcome the gale that was blowing under the door. Otherwise, although very dated the room was O.K. In the morning I ventured down to the ground floor for breakfast and was amazed at how small in proportion to the whole establishment the main eating area was. But again, if it was not for the efficient way the breakfast staff buzzed around, the room would have got clogged up. The staff kept on top of clearing the tables and did well at keeping the guests flowing through the small area. I want to point out before I write any more that I am not a freeloader looking for a free room but I felt compelled to speak to the duty manager about my experience in my room and straight away, without any hesitation I was offered a refund. I declined the refund on the basis that all I wanted to do was to point out the areas of my stay that didn't delight me. The guy wrote down my comments in a notebook that he got out of his pocket and I am confident that he will follow through on the assurances he gave me regarding addressing my issues. He did, however, offer to book me a taxi to Kings Cross station at the hotel's cost which I accepted. The guy that dealt with me was Ash and I would like to say thank you for the professional way you dealt with me. So take note, Premier Inn, here you have a hotel where the staff are a credit to you. It's just a pity that this model does not extend to some of your other hotels.

This renders it completely useless for anything other than a quick hand wash. Washing your face is absolutely impossible without cracking your eyebrow on the edge of the shelf.

From where we were sat we could see the meals at the serving hatch. The first meal was placed on the tray, but did not arrive at the table for approx 5 minutes along with two of the other meals. The fourth meal came 5 minutes after this. Whilst we were eating, the waitress started taking plates away while others were still eating - poor etiquette. Next morning, housekeeping tried to clean the rooms at 8.30am while we were still preparing to go for breakfast. Considering check out time is 12, very annoying.

Price, stars and location persuaded us to pick this hotel. In general, we have not been disappointed. Ok, but just for a weekend. Location is fantastic, right next to the River Thames, lots of original pubs and breweries. And even the Hammersmith tube station is not far away (10 - 15 minutes on foot ). Room cleanness overall was acceptable for a 3 star hotel. Room was very tight, too tight, but for two days still ok. The bathroom looked newly tiled. Standard bath furniture, everything unbroken and clean. However, being 6.1 ft tall, it took some time to get a shower, anything but enjoyable: shower head not adjustable in height, so that I had to uncomfortably bend over while hair washing. Ceiling height was much too low, made me feel a bit under pressure. Bed was too short for regular European people caused mainly by an overhanging part of the wall at the head of the bed leaving just a few inches of head room. Fortunately, the bed could be easily pulled forward. Matressee was rather comfortable compared with all the other hotel matressees I can remember of. Carpet has already lived its live. Since a nice carpet deals as a sort of highlight of a room, in terms of customers' satisfaction I think a new one would really pay off. TV was fantastic. Big flat screen with a perfectly clear picture. Plus point. Windows' quality was a bit disappointing. Old glas, broken and ugly looking window frames. Durty little chamber in front of the window. The view, however, towards the London skyline (from the 11 th floor or so) is breathtaking. Never seen anything comparable. This view has risen my overall rating. The 12th floor too kept most noise to a minimum yet there is lots of traffic all around the hotel and clock. Receptionists and all the other staff were very kind and forthcoming. Breakfast was ok, the usual. The price, well, compared with similar hotels and locations in London, I must say, it is slightly unappropriate. 15 pounds cheaper and breakfast included would fit the bill.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "runray2000", "ReviewID": "UR115246235", "Content": "Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Premier Inn at Hammersmith, and felt that it was only fair to give a review.

Highly recommend getting a room on a higher floor for this reason. The room was a great size for a London hotel, it was clean, very comfortable with a lovely bath/shower room also very clean and well kept. Also had a small LCD freeview TV and a lovely letter from the general manager offering extra sheets instead of duvets because of the hot weather (as well as air con and available fans). There was no noise from other rooms and if you have the window open you will get some noise, but with it being on the outskirts of London its far, far less than normal. It was a perfect room for us, we couldnt have been happier. We had continental breakfast on the first day which was a great selection of cereals, pastries, yoghurts, fruits and toast, with plenty of hot and cold drinks all constantly topped up. The staff were very friendly and explained where everything was. We paid for an upgrade to a full English breakfast plus continental if we wanted and that was also lovely. Freshly cooked breakfast which was very tasty. We didnt have dinner or lunch there so cant comment on that, but the small but inviting dinner area was nice and the food set us both up for our sightseeing days.

One on the second floor was nicely refurbished, but the second room on one of the higher floors was draughty, some of the bathroom fittings were damaged, and it was cramped. The view however was great, We reported several issues to staff who seemed indiferrent, which is unusual for a Premier Inn. Breakfast was chaotic. Not enough staff or food laid out or space. Again, this is unusual for a Prmeier Inn. By the way, I have noticed in my last few stays at a Premier Inn that the buffet breakfast (one of their pluses) doesnt represent such good value - price has gone up, selection has gone down. On the plus side, the hotel was very well placed for the M4 and west London (we were in London for a football match at QPR, museum visit, and a theatre show) and had good parking.

The room was spotlessly clean, well maintained and the bed was very comfortable and provided us with two nights' good sleep! The hotel staff were faultless - all of them were cheerful and made the point of saying \"good morning\" at breakfast, which added to the general friendliness of this hotel. Breakfast was well organised, and we opted for the continental option - and food was plentiful, with loads of fresh fruit, yogurts, croissants, cereal etc on offer. It as handy being able to go from breakfast anytime from 7.30am to 11.00am. Check out time was generous too, being at 12pm. I'd highly recommend this hotel for a short break in the city - Hammersmith is a great base, if you want somewhere a bit quieter to go in the evening after the hustle and bustle of Central London!

I did not have a say in where I got to stay and having travelled the world and stayed primarily in genuine premier hotel groups, I was not looking forward to my stay at a budget hotel. However, having been checked in to a 2nd floor room all of which are refurbished I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the room. However, the claim of a good night sleep on the hypnose mattress is not so as I found the beds in each of the rooms I stayed in to be extremely uncomfortable and awoke each morning with a stiff back and aching ribs!!! Having arrived at the hotel in week 3 and been greeted by Jane who I will say is an extremely professional and pleasant member of the team, was allocated room 211 which I had stayed in during the previous week and was very happy to be staying there again. Regretabley, during the two nights of my stay I was horribley bitten over 35 times on my arms and legs and it was only on the morning of my departure that the Operations Manager admitted there was a current infestation problem in the hotel which was being treated by a company called Ecolab. So if you are about to check in and see their vans parked outside, carry on walking and find another hotel elsewhere!!! A colleague had overheard a conversation that several rooms were being treated on another floor at the time!!! I had to return to the hotal the following Tuesday for another 2 night stay and was extremely worried as having spoken to Environmental Health, I was advised bedbugs are extremely difficult to get rid of once they are established as they can hibernate anywhere in a room for months at a time, and are easily transferred between rooms through air conditioning ducts, by the cleaners as the move from room to room and so on!!! I was assured by the Operations Manager that I would be well looked after with a good room (I was not, as I was allocated a standard room after being in a family sized room for the previous 2 weeks and had to complain before being moved!) Other issues with the Operations Manager made me realise that the management didn't care for their customers despite stating they did have a bedbug infestation problem and I had been a victim! So my advice to anyone thinking about going to a Premier Inn and this one in particular is, you will be paying them a lot of money (no where near the so called \u00a329!!!) for a night's sleep in a bed that will at least be pretty uncomfortable but could also include some nasty critters leaving you with bites that will itch for at least 5 days which antihistamines do not relieve, AND also LOOK extremely unsightly.

Checked in rather late, past 9pm, and was really only interested in quick shower and quiet sleep. But I had several smaller issues that really hurt my experience. First, seems like quartz heater was provided only for heating. There was an instructions leaflet on the table on how to activate \"real\" heating, and I've spent good 10 minutes in trying to do so, but without any success. So I decided to give the quartz heater a go; I was a bit uncomfortable in keeping it turned off throughout the whole night (quartz heaters are oftentimes causes of a fire), but this one was protected well, and it worked fine after all. But it would good, if indeed heating is broken in this room, that an info on using alternative heater is provided. Further, I found this shutter, that is closing the outtake of the water from the sink in the bathroom, is broken - so the sink would fill up with the water, and then the water would go out through that emergency aperture near the top of the sink. Also, the desk lamp was not working either. But I was really not into the mood of calling the desk to fix all these things, so I just went to sleep. I slept well, as I was pretty tired, but still I noticed the level of noise is rather high: the noise from the city traffic was significant, but even worse was the noise of some kind of very large fan, seemingly operating somewhere in the hotel building (as the noise seemed clearly distinct from the outside noise). I found the noise biggest issue in my stay, and in that regard, it was especially strange that this hotel is claiming \"good-sleep guarantee\". In the morning, I've enjoyed nice view to the neighborhood (piece of Thames was visible from my room), but again some kind of curtains are put between two level of windows, and it's really hard to move them to the side to enjoy the view. Final issue I had was about the breakfast: again, there was a leaflet in the room, and I understood there exist two options, quick fixed meal for approx. 3 pounds, and eat-as-much-as-you-can from both cooked and continental menu for 8 pounds; girls at the dining room offered continental menu only to me though, and only near the completion of the breakfast I saw other people having stuff from cooked menu delivered. Finally, I was charged 5 pounds something, which obviously means continental and cooked menu are priced differently; the food I ate was good, but I was really in the mood for something cooked, and I think all the options should be clearly stated both in the leaflet, and by staff in the dining room. So, my overall impression on the hotel is really average.

The staff at the reception were more then helpful, and within 30 mins of my issue i was offered a room on the 11th floor. Best thing i could of done, the room was so much larger then my previous room, though i was informed it was a family room. Being up so high the views from the window was great, i was able to see quite a distance, and was able to look out and see the thames. Decided to have my evening meal at the premises on first night . Booked the table for 6.30 and order was taken straight away. However, the bad news was that my dinner did not arrive at my table till 7.15 between this time the waiter was full of apologies for the delay, and to be fair the staff were running around so not sure if this was a usual thing, but when the dinner finally arrived it was not the best meal i have ever had, but by this time i was tired and hungry and was past making a comment about it. But one couple with two restless children had arrived before me and when i had left the table i noticed though the children had had their meal the two adults were still waiting for theirs. My heart went out to them. But the next morning I found the breakfasts very good and excellent service and the staff were really friendly and made you feel that nothing was to much for them in trying to make your stay worth while. I was a bit disapointed though to find that each evening i returned to my room the room attendent had not topped up the tea bags, coffee ect. But as i had brought my own i never bothered to mention it. But i think these should of been replaced without the need of asking for more. The hotel was in a ideal area, The tube station is just across the road, and i was there to go to a show at the Hammersmith Apollo, it took no more then 15 minutes for me to walk it, but even if you did not want to walk its only one station away and you could be there in minutes. Because the hotel is on the main street there are lots of shops for you to visit. A large supermarket is only a few minutes away. I found this hotel to be an ideal place to visit London. I have stayed at other premier inns which i found to be more modern i guess you could say this is a bit dated, but certainly not old fashioned, and i would most certainly stay there again when visiting this area.

There are many restaurants nearby, offering a variety of cuisines; there are also a few fast food places within walking distance. There is plenty of shopping nearby. Also, it's a short walk to the Thames, where you can take a stroll. Very nice! In short, the Premier Inn Hammersmith helped make my stay quite pleasant.

Staff were all very helpful, Ravenscourt Park Tube Station (on the District Line) is about a 5 mins walk away and the area itself , predominantly Polish, felt safe with enough cafes, pubs and restaurants within walking distance. Dined out on our first night at a cheap and cheerful Italian about 5 mins walk down King Street to the right - Casa Mia (had seen a few good reviews for it on the net from locals so thought we'd give it a try). They did a \u00a37.95 menu for a 2 course evening meal - had a huge prawn cocktail and a pasta course - good value by usual London prices. Breakfast in the Travel Inn (also \u00a37.95) for the full English was ok. It is cooked to order, but disappointing that the baked beans were congealed on the plate as though they had been standing for ages and the tea was cold. So, on our 2nd day, decided to try somewhere else - crossed the road and walked down King Street to the right for 5/10 mins max and we found a Weatherspoons pub on a corner that do a cooked breakfast for \u00a32.69 (or a gut buster cholesterol special - 2 of everything for \u00a33.69). We had the \u00a32.69 version and it was excellent - recommend it as long as you can stomach seeing people having a pint at 10.30 in the morning!!. Unfortunately, this stay, we had the car with us - the Travel Inn do have some spaces which are available on a first come, first served basis at \u00a312 a day, but they were all taken by the time we arrived at 6pm so had to park in the NCP car park 5 mins walk away which charges \u00a322.50 per day.
