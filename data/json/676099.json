Somebody has to remind them that they're in the hospitality business No water - considering they provide simple amenities already, what is 2 small bottles of water a day? We had to go out to Spinneys just to quench our thirst after arriving there at night. internet rate is EXHORBITANT - in this day and age of free wireless internet, where a lot of hotels, hostels and accomodations offer free internet to lure customers, theirs charges exhorbitant rates! (4usd / 1 hr; 16usd for 24 hrs). Breakfast - so-so selection. Maybe I'm expecting too much? But for an 8-day stay I didn't see much choice and had to stick to my usual everyday selections. All in all, good hotel. just be informed of the above and your other expectations will be pretty much met with.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service at Ascot Hotel Appartment\u201d", "Author": "ImamManchester", "ReviewID": "UR92267682", "Content": "I stayed for 14 nights at Ascot Apartment (previously Kirklees) and it was a great experience. The staff are very helpful. Nothing is a trouble and they attended to my requests within minutes no matter what time it was at night or day. I stayed in a one bed room apartment which was basically equipped but if you ask the reception for extras they are only there to oblige. Very clean and large with ample space. Lots of room for your travel stuff. Bathroom always clean and fresh. I would like to thank all the staff in general and mainly Paul, Zakari, Asa and Aroun for their excellent care and help Dr. Bayan Al-Kassab", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cStopover in Dubai\u201d", "Author": "NettyA", "ReviewID": "UR35619113", "Content": "We spent 2 nights here on our way to Africa. The rooms were excellent, spacious and comfortable and enough beds for our family (often a problem with 3 children). Though the kettle plug didn't fit into the wall plug! Reception staff were very good. The two downsides were that the pool was closed for renovation (our kids were so looking forward to a swim considering it was so hot outside!) and the service in the restaurant. Don't use the restaurant if you can help it. We were travelling with 2 other families and were exhausted when we arrived having travelled from Australia & NZ and didn't feel like walking in the heat for somewhere to eat - well we should have. It took up to 2 hours for food to arrive - mine actually never did arrive. And my daughter fell asleep in her chair before her's (a hamburger) arrived. When the hamburgers did arrive, they looked like they'd been bought from outside the hotel.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cfantastic\u201d", "Author": "girlies9", "ReviewID": "UR34228617", "Content": "Was abit anxious when i booked these appts but was surprised & very very pleased.

Everything is clean and the staff is very helpfull and kindly. We did not have breakfast in the restaurant, but it is possible to take one. The apartment is close to the Burjuman Shoppingmall and Spinney's, a 5-10 minutes walk. There is a shuttle to the beach, but that is a public beach.
