I just came back from about a week's stay at the hotel. Breakfast was included daily, and included choices from all over the world, American style bacon, eggs, pastries (not fresh daily.) Also they had Asian types of food such as soups, rice, vegetables. It sits right on the city moat at the 2nd ring road. Close to Temple of Heaven and Ya Show for shopping. Behind the hotel is a small 7-11  Korean restaurant accross the street from there. Rooms at the hotel were very roomy, spacious, modern. GLass shower, deep tub, marble. Large closet, safe. Free bottled water, but no refrigerator - or ours wasn't working anyway. 3 chairs, a desk, lots of storage space for all your things. Friendly staff, concierge. ront desk could use more help. Not a lot of staff speak english, but they were always willing to get you someone that could assist. Business center had internet for small fee. I would recommend for Olympics. Taxi cabs were readily available and cheap.

The hotel is located on the 3rd ring road of beijing i believe. its right next to a metro station so its easy to hop into Beijing central.The hotel itself was very clean, as was the room and the bathroom. we had no issues through our stay.Nice breakfast but not as nice as our first hotel JC mandarin in shanghai, but you made most of the choices of food, western foods, oriental foods, healthy options. The tea was wrong, it was wrong all over china, just couldnt get a decent cup anywhere.we stayed three nights at this hotel and it was a pleasant stay.the bar in the lobby is quite nice, as is the 24 hour restaurant, which serves western and local food.The swimming pool was under repair for the period of our stay which was dissapointing as it was sparkling swimming pool.view from the hotel wasnt all that as we were facing the ring road, but we didnt go there to peep through hotel window!summary: nice and clean hotel, rooms feel fresh and new. superb location 10 mins to central Beijing on the metro which is on your door step.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR479452936", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SemiLOOSE"}, {"Content": "Great 4-5 star hotel The Oriental Bay Intl.
