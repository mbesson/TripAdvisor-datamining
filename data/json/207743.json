We stayed in the annex (Detente), with larger and quieter rooms and a great view on the large garden/patio area. Especially comfy bed/pillows and well appointed room/amenities. The garden really adds to this hotel, and you can have drinks/snacks in the comfortable chairs/sofas surrounded by magnolia trees, flowers and other greenery. We really enjoyed coming off the streets of Paris into the garden on the way to our room. The staff at reception, concierge and breakfast area were all very friendly and helpful, especially for Paris. I've at this same hotel a few years ago when it was Sofitel, and now that it's Renaissance/Marriott, service has *definitely* improved. Breakfast was included in the room, which was a good deal since otherwise the full bfast buffet is 29 euros/person (steep!). There are several nice restaurants, lots of cute shops, two supermarkets, pharmacies, etc., in the area-- and a 7-10 min walk to the Trocadero, the Arc de Triomphe, or the shops on the Champs Ellysee. Also 7-10 min walk to 3-4 different metro stations.

Even though it was definitely high end and was very well apportioned and felt boutique-y, it wasn't cliquey or snobby in the least. Reception/Lobby - The check-in at this hotel was very efficient. They had all my information and it was very fast. For those who like this kind of thing, they had a bellman ready to take your suitcases up (I had only one bag and didn't need that). Check-out was equally easy and everyone was really super nice. Everyone spoke English well. I was in the main building. There are 2 elevators. There are more rooms across the courtyard but I didn't see them. Room - very well apportioned. My room was fairly big but two colleagues' rooms were quite small. All had pretty much the same furniture in it though. It is very much retro 1970s look, which worked for me - I loved it,, and I love that the overall theme in the decoration is green, it is unique and cheery. Big healthy closet with lots of hangers. The sheets were cool and crisp to climb into, there were tons of pillows to sleep on, and the comforter was soooo comfy. I wish my bed at home was this comfortable. A nice touch was the ipod docking station/stereo. There was also a flat panel TV, a safe, a pretty large wardrobe with lots of hangers, a hot pot with teas and coffees, and a minibar with space in the fridge so you could put in a couple of cans of soda or bottles of water of your own. The TV has a lot of channels and half a dozen or so are in English, unfortunately they are all news channels and it gets pretty boring watching all news all the time. The curtains are real blackout curtains and you can't see any light through them when they are closed, even at 10 am! (So, if you want to wake up using sunlight, leave them cracked or partly open.) There are slippers and sewing kit. The bathroom has nice smelling soap, lotion, shampoo and bath gel. No conditioner. The towels are not big - the bath towels are pretty small, maybe bath towel and not bath sheet - but they are really fluffy and thick. The hair dryer is in the closet. The shower head is the rainshower type and there was lots of hot water. It was just that half-glass popular in Europe (no doors or shower curtains) so every day I pretty much made a mess with the shower on the bathroom floor. The problem was actually that there wasn't that rubber squeegee bumper on the bottom of the glass so there was a small gap between the glass and the tub. There is turndown service, which is nice, although one day I had the do not disturb sign on the door and they came in and removed the sign and did the turndown service anyhow. I thought that wasn't good, but since I was really just trying to save them the trouble of doing my room - I didn't need housekeeping every day! - I didn't make a big deal out of it. I recommend the turndown service because they leave you Toblerone minibars and chocolates from la maison du chocolat! There was a tea bar which was great with hot pot. Every day I was able to have a couple of cups of NICE tea - berry teas, Earl Grey, mint - it was super and they replenished it. There was also a bottle of Evian complimentary - and they replaced that too, as you drank it. The fridge in the minibar has space for a couple of small bottles of water, cans of soda or cups of yoghurt if you want to put them in. There is internet in the room via ethernet cord (so bring your laptop, your tablet won't work). However, you should be warned that internet is really expensive - something like 20 euros a day or 100 euros a week. This is dismaying as the hotel itself is not cheap, and there's no reason they can't offer free internet or wifi - the hotel I usually stay in just around the corner isn't as nice or as expensive as this one, and they offer free wifi. Amenities (courtyard, bar, fitness center) - the courtyard looks nice and I know there are opportunities to eat and drink there in nicer months but I didn't have these opportunities in February! The bar is nice but not cheap. It's not horribly expensive but it can add up. Beer was 8-10 euro, a caipirhina was 14 euro. The hotel has a really nice lounging area, and we hung out there a couple of times. Fitness center was pretty good - it's not Ballys but I think it's the best one I've seen in a Paris hotel. About half a dozen machines, and an area for yoga and stretching. And 24 hour access with your room key. It's in the basement. There is room service available 24 hours but I didn't get any so I can't vouch for it. Breakfast - Breakfast was great. For a hotel-provided breakfast, there was a lot to choose from. One part had hot foods like eggs, stewed tomatoes, mushrooms and potatoes, one part had cereals and a variety of juices and milk (even skim! yay!), one part had pastries and croissants and one part had salad, meats, olives, fruits, eggs, etc. They were in different places in the breakfast room which was nice because it avoided bunching all in one area and having to wait in line, etc. The use of space was smart. The breakfast room has this ceiling that's a big tapestry of a map of Paris - pretty cool. It's small, and sometimes it fills up in which case they open up the restaurant adjacent for the overflow. They offer coffee or tea, and then the y bring a nice yogurt-compote thing that's berry-flavored kind of a breakfast amuse-bouche. Now for me the breakfast was included and I obviously liked it. But normally it's 29 euros, and would I pay 29 euros for breakfast? Naw. Concierge/\"Navigator\" - They have what they call their \"navigator\" who is basically a concierge. I don't usually avail myself of concierge services (okay I don't usually stay in places with one), but I used this for getting taxis multiple times during the week, finding out a restaurant that we could go to nearby that had space on Valentine's Day without a reservation, and for directing me on a free weekend day. This was the kind of funny thing that happened, and for a while I was not sure he spoke English. I went to him and told him in French that I had a question for him but I'd like to ask it in English because it would be easier, is that okay. He replied no, I must speak in French. I couldn't tell if he was being serious, or if he was teasing me or challenging me to speak French. It was fine, I muddled through it in my bad French and he was great - I don't know what would have happened if I really only could speak English - I explained that normally I go to the St Ouen marche aux puces and where else could I go. He was able from our conversation to get a sense of what I appreciated and liked, and then made a couple of recommendations and told me where I would appreciate, showed me on the map the Metro stop etc., and I was off. And he was spot-on. It was kind of funny because I specifically did not want to do the touristy thing, but something more local and involved, and he got that intuitively and respected it - and not only that but knew some of the more obscure places to direct me to. Much appreciated! Especially given the location here, and the number of tourists probably wanting to go to the Eiffel Tower or Etoile. Location - So speaking of location, I like this location. The hotel is very near to a number of Metro stops, including Victor Hugo, Torcadero, Boissere, Kleber. You can walk to Trocadero, Passy and la Muette, the Champs-Elysee. There are many restaurants in the neighborhood that are not tourist traps (avoid the ones on the circle in Trocadero) such as Victor and Brasserie la Poste, XVIIIe and Mandarin de Ming. There are a number of small groceries nearby as well, for the basics and not so basics.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "ctanski", "ReviewID": "UR124663016", "Content": "This hotel is close to the Eiffel tower, and subway system.

As is the case in any major city, hotel restaurants tend to be pricey but in my opinion the dinner was well worth it. I'd opt for a local bistro for breakfast.

To the management's credit they sent up a beautifully typed apology note with a glass of champagne---a lovely gesture that was greatly appreciated but for a 5-Star property of this caliber I would expect a more proficient, attentive housekeeping staff.

Staff is average. Ladies at the Check in/out were very friendly and welcoming. Worst concierge I have ever met. Unfriendly and not very helpful at all. Concierge did not had manners you would expect at such a hotel and did not have good knowledge at all. For example: We had asked for directions to Parc Monceau. All he said was \"that's a beautiful park\", at that time there was a exhibition of Chinese arts and the park is famous for it's architectural features so you would expect a well trained concierge to give a little more information about the park. There was one DIN A4 information/guide given to us when we checked in. The English version is so simple and full of typos so that it is more a guide to have a good laugh than to take any new information with you. A 5 star hotel should be able to provide good quality when it comes to translation/information. They provide an app for smart phones which is supposed to give some more knowledge about restaurants, things to see and do but it was not possible to download the app at the lobby. The first thing the concierge told me was that my device must be having issues. He tried to download it with his device and it did not work! Instead of an apology and giving the guest the feeling that he will get in contact with the responsible person we were just told that it is not working. We tried to download the app at a free WIFI spot at a park later and it was no problem at all. But after looking into it I would not recommend this app as it is pretty average and not helpful at all. WIFI at the lobby is incredible weak and slow. The only newspaper that was provided in the lobby was China daily. Although we stayed there for 2 nights we did not see any Chinese people at all. What's the point in not providing some other international newspapers? As we stayed at a 4 star rated hotel in Paris a few days later we would not recommend this 5 star hotel at all.

Check-in was fast and efficient, and the person who checked us in accompanied us to our room and showed us how to work everything. She was very warm and friendly, as was the bellhop who took care of our luggage. As Platinum Elite Members we were offered free internet and free breakfast (breakfast otherwise is billed at 27 Euros). The room was lovely in shades of gray, white and green. It was a large and very comfortable room with floor to ceiling window doors with a little balcony railing looking out over the courtyard garden restaurant. The room had a king bed with black leather bedskirt. The sitting area had a gray & green upholstered armchair; a gray sofa (pullout bed), and 2 small round cocktail tables. There was a large desk with a white leather chair. (It will be interesting to see how long that stays clean)! The lighting throughout was wonderful. The room had a long foyer with a door to close off the vestibule part. Off the foyer was a large 4-door armoire on one side and a WC and spacious bathroom on the other side. (A computer keyboard, fridge, Nespresso machine, tray with tea kettle, cups, etc. were housed behind one door of the armoire). The WC was very modern with a \u201cbidet\u201d hose. The bathroom had an enormous walk-in shower with rain shower head (not forceful enough for my taste) and a more forceful, excellent quality handheld hose that you could hang up and use as a showerhead. The sink had a lighted mirror. There was also a heated towel rack in the bathroom. For some reason, the shower cap, kleenex and cosmetic cotton pads were placed in the WC area \u2013 certainly an unsanitary place, especially for the kleenex as a toilet projects droplets over 600 ft. when flushed. Every time we moved the kleenex to the sink area, housekeeeping moved it back to the WC area! The restaurant in the hotel was very good (we had 3 meals here plus breakfast), although we found the service to be rather cold in the beginning. (It warmed up later during our stay). Still, the service in general was below par for this calibre of hotel. There were a lot of people working, but there simply didn\u2019t appear to be enough time to properly attend to guests. (Example: they never asked if you wanted an aperitif, which is typical in any restaurant in France. Even if you did order one, it either didn\u2019t come or it came a minute before your food was served). (Food costs: 2-course lunch for 2 with wine & aperitif was 125 Euros; 2-course lunch for one on another day with 1 glass of wine was 33 Euros; 2-course dinner for 2 with wine was 108 Euros). The bar service was incredibly bad. I almost had to beg to be served \u2013 yet there was no one else waiting to be served. I was sitting at a small table about 15 feet away from the bartender, and even after he brought drinks to the table directly next to me, I was ignored. I had to stare until I could catch his eye; and after 10 minutes of polishing glasses, the bartender finally looked up and asked from behind the bar if I wanted something. When I answered, \u201cYes,\u201d he finally came over from behind the bar to take my order. Again, this is simply unacceptable service for this calibre of hotel. (Cost: 1 not very good Mojito was 14 Euros/US$19+). The concierge desk (there were 3 on duty) was always very helpful \u2013 no complaints here. Housekeeping, however, needs more training. One day we came back to the room to find a rainbow duster left on our luggage; wastebaskets not emptied; and, on a good note, finally, on the 3rd day of our stay, we \u201cearned\u201d 1 bathmat towel but never received one on any of the other 3 days. Once again, this is unacceptable for this quality of hotel. (It is rated 5-stars by the French Tourist Board). So, I\u2019m giving the D\u00e9cor an \u201cA,\u201d because it is a very lovely hotel, recently renovated, all is new and pristine. I\u2019m giving it a \u201cC\u201d for service simply because it is a high-end hotel, and I think it should be friendlier, more competent, and more attentive for the price one pays here. (Compare to Renaissance Place Vend\u00f4me whose service is absolutely outstanding). For location, either an \u201cA\u201d or a \u201cC\u201d depending on how you view it. It is close to the Eiffel Tower, in a beautiful and safe part of Paris, in the posh 16th Arrondissement. It is also not terribly far from the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. However, the hotel is not near the center of town, so it is not within easy walking distance of the Louvre, the Latin Quarter, and other points of interest further away. First-time tourists to Paris may prefer a more central location (such as the Marriott Place Vend\u00f4me). After all of this do I recommend it? Yes, absolutely, it is a beautiful hotel and I, personally, love the location and will definitely stay here again. I just hope that the management of this hotel finds a way to improve the bar & restaurant service as well as the housekeeping staff. Until then, it doesn\u2019t merit its 5-star rating.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg City, Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasant Little Gem\u201d", "Author": "jmichael11", "ReviewID": "UR119455657", "Content": "This was a surprisingly nice little boutique hotel.

It's so basic! The restaurant is very popular, especially on warm evenings, due to the lovely terrace. Good for them, but not good for guests who can't eat there because its fully booked throughout their stay and can't get any service as the staff are so busy in the dining room.

My room was probably 12 square meters, perhaps (150 square feet) small but pretty standard for Paris. i was meeting four other colleagues for business and we had negotiated a decent rate 310 euros for Sunday and 400 Euros for MON- THU. Not to bad also by Paris standards- plus with our Elite Marriott Status (all of us) they provided full breakfast every day. Not inexpensive of course- but then this IS Paris. The room was cozy and well equipped with a small table/desk in between the television bureau (with storage area for clothes. Very quiet even though it overlooked the courtyard (in a separate building less than 30 feet across the courtyard from reception. Very nice overall and dark at nice with solid curtains that could be drawn revealing light silk shades that let in sun.

This was an immediate disappointment- it had a strange elliptical machine (serviceable but cranky) a stationary bike and a cheap and basic treadmills. Also an exercise ball and a set of dumbells no heavier than 15 pounds is my guess. Not in the class with the usual Marriott Health Clubs in Europe. The courtyard was the highlite for our party- after working and prior to dinner we would sit on comfortable couches (wicker with cushions) and chairs and enjoy conversation prior to and after dinner. The staff was excellent and always ready with drinks and the bill when it was needed. The gardening in the courtyard is superb and it is a beautiful oasis with access from the hotel and through a iron gated entrance way. Breakfast was fine with continental (bread & croissants & fruit/yogurt) or a full breakfast with whiting, salmon and bacon and eggs cooked to order.

The location was great and close to three metro (subway) stops which was nice. It was very close to cafes that had a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower. They had an American breakfast for 27 euros but we didn't eat there. How outrageous! Go to a nice cafe 4 blocks south with a view of the Eiffel Tower for much less! We used points for our stay; therefore, we didn't pay anything to stay here. I looked at the hotel rates online, and they seemed quite high for what you get. The reason I booked here was for good, American service but I did not receive that kind of service. I might as well have stayed at a 5 star French hotel with a better, more central location for what it costs at this hotel if I were paying cash rather than using points. Bottom line is really that I'm undecided. It was nice and there were no surprises other than possibly the fact that the concierge was not helpful.

We stayed at the Renaissance knowing full well that it is undergoing renovation. The price was good - a promotional price through Marriott. Do NOT even think about eating breakfast at the hotel. Ridiculous price for breakfast. I am not sure what is going on with the European Marriotts with their breakfast prices. There is no excuse for charging a hotel guest $35 (once you do the conversion) for a buffet of runny eggs and soggy bacon. Go down the street to the square and give your hard-earned money to the local cafe and get a fab breakfast for 1/3 the cost. This is my biggest beef with the hotel. Along with the price of wi-fi. The cafe down the street has free wi-fi. Someday Marriott is going to get the message about wireless costs. While they are not quite ready to prove the five stars, the staff is proud of their makeover. And with good reason. It still smells like paint, varnish or saw dust but I'm not in the room much.

Turn down service is available (but kinda creepy). The location is perfect.

From the hotel it is about a 5 minute walk to either station. The Arc de Triomphe is also near by, and is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Another nice feature of this neighborhood is that there is a small grocery store just two blocks away that is a great place to stock up on bottled water and fruit. The hotel is comprised of multiple buildings, situated around an outdoor courtyard. Upon arriving at the hotel, the bell-hop immediately took our luggage, and directed us to the check-in counter. We arrived at 12pm, and were informed that our room was not yet ready, but would be ready by 3pm. I\u2019ve been to Paris a few times now, and am quite used to not being able to check in early, so this wasn\u2019t a big deal. A nice touch was that the hotel offered to take my cell phone number, and call once our room was ready. The bell-hop stored our bags away, and we went off to be tourists in Paris. Upon returning to the hotel in the evening and finally checking in, we were informed that our bags were already in the room, and that to get there we had to go \u201coutside\u201d and then to the building called \u201cLa Residence.\u201d It seemed complicated at first, but the bell-boy showed us the way and it really wasn\u2019t a big deal. The room itself was quite comfortable. Bigger in size than a typical Paris hotel room. We had a room with two twin beds, a flat panel LCD television, a mini bar/refrigerator, and a small desk. Our room overlooked the courtyard, and was very quiet. We didn\u2019t hear any other guests, or noise from the courtyard. Two things that I really appreciated about the room is that the air conditioning worked very well and ice is available on request.

The hotel does not have a concierge lounge, but Platinum and Gold Marriott members recieve free breakfast in the restaurant 7 days a week, which is a really good deal since the breakfast is normally 27 euro. The breakfast is a full American breakfast with waffles, pancakes, eggs, sausage, pastries, fruits, yogurt and cereal. Definitely the best breakfast I\u2019ve had in Paris. In the morning, complimentary coffee is also available in the hotel lobby for all guests. The hotel does have a small fitness center that has an eliptical machine, treadmill, and bicycle \u2014 one of each. Overall I would highly reccomend this hotel to other travellers to Paris.

I emailed him a week before our arrival to make restaurant reservations, since you really do need them in Paris. Valentina was very attentive and sent cream to our room for our coffee. The breakfast buffet was good foodwise. We had the breakfast 5 times at 54 euros for the 2 of us. But, my wife loved it, and the convenience, before a long site seeing day. Hey, it was our 20th anniversary. The Victor Hugo stop on the number 2 metro was close. It was an easy walk to the Eiffel Tower. In summary, good location, quiet, friendly, small gym, good breakfast (not cheap). We had had chocolates with turn down service, and a bottle of wine for our anniversary. I paid 80 euros to have roses and a bottle of champagne in our room priior to arrival, to suprise my wife. I can't comment on the hotel restaurant for dinner, since we never had it, though it looked good.

It is between the Victor Hugo metro station and the Trocadero metro station which are on two different lines. We had flown into Orly from Barcelona early in the morning. We then took the Orlybus into town, caught the metro to Trocadero and walked the remaining blocks to the hotel. We were traveling with a single totebag each so luggage was not an issue. We went directly to the hotel to ask if we could leave our totebags for the day. When we arrived at the hotel the young man at the front desk asked us to wait a few minutes and he would check with housekeeping to see if our room was ready. And it was! At 10AM we were settled into our room. As a rewards member we had been upgraded to a junior suite facing the garden courtyard area, which was lovely. There are a number of buildings which make up this hotel. You have to walk through the garden area to reach the rear buildings. I wonder how this works in a rainstorm? Our 3rd floor suite 355 consisted of the huge Marriott bed, full closet with dresser drawers inside, safe, window seat, flatscreen tv, desk, couch, lounge chairs, minibar, AC, bath & shower with 1/2 glass enclosure, scale, and bathrobe. It was very spacious and well maintained. Ice is brought up to your room by room service. Our room faced the garden but there was no view because we were an end room which looked toward the next building. It was very quiet at night. There is a workout area, full service restaurant, and breakfast was served in a smaller dining area although I would imagine the garden courtyard is used. Mornings were cool when we were there. Breakfast was a nice buffet, but at 27 euros is a lot for breakfast. Upon checkout the hotel held our totebags for the day and we reversed the transportation process to return to Orly. Two negatives. The entire hotel lost hot water in the morning, so no shower. Also, both of our key cards became deactivated and we had to walk across the courtyard and back to the front desk late at night. I overheard someone else having this problem the next morning. As mentioned before, the view of the Eiffel Tower from the Trocadero Gardens is outstanding, during the day and especially at night. You can not find a better place to see the Tower. The bridge leading from Trocadero Gardens over the Seine is also where the tour boats are located. This was a wonderful hotel and a good location. The staff at the front of the house were wonderful. They employ security which is openly visible. The rates for this hotel are high.

The hotel offered a very nice buffet with eggs, cheeses, breads, juice, crepes, etc. the buffet was priced at 27 Euros per person, so if I had to pay for it, I would have passed--nice, but way over priced. the hotel has a very nice courtyard where you can have dinner or drinks when the the weather cooperates--we never dined there, but they did a good business, and it looked like it would have been a nice spot to spend an evening. The hotel service was very good---we checked in about 3PM, and were taken directly to our rooms by the woman behnd the frontdesk who checked us in. We used the concierge twice for restaurant recommendations--one recommednation was quite good, the other good, but not great. The hotel's location was, for us, perfect. The hotel is on a pretty quiet street that is not terribly touristy. You are located about midway between two subway stations (Victor Hugo and Trocadero), each about a 5 minute walk away, so getting around town was a breeze. You are also only about a 15 minute walk from the Arc de Triumph, and between the hotel and the Arc, there is a ton of high-end shoppig for those who have money to burn. We walked back from the Eiffel Tower one evening after 1AM, (maybe 1 25 mintue walk) and felt perfectly safe. We stayed at the hotel using Marriott Reward points, so all we had to pay was the city hotel tax. Based on what I saw posted at the hotel, the room rates go for 450-650 Euros per night. It was a nice hotel, good location, comfortable, etc. but if I had to pay for the rooms myself, I am not sure I would have stayed--I would not describe the place as great value at those prices. Finally, I would also mention, that if you are lookng fro a hotel where you can immerse yourself in French culture, this is not the place for you. I honestly think evry guest I saw in the hallway, dining room, or lobby was an American. Nothing wrong with that, but if yo never left the hotel, you would think you were in Kansas City.", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cRough experience - no A/C or ventilation, flooded bathroom, room not avail on arrival\u201d", "Author": "PaulSEA1", "ReviewID": "UR34464064", "Content": "This was my third worst stay at a Marriott property. I'm a Marriott platinum member with 75+ nights per year at Marriotts and have been travelling extensively for a decade. 1. Our room was not available on check-in. They told us it would be 20 minutes but it actually took about an hour. We finally got our room at 5:30pm. It was a hot July day, we had arrived on the hot metro, and were very keen on having a shower ASAP. Every time I passed the front desk during my two day stay there was some kind of drama going on about the guest's room not being available. This seemed to be the normal state of affairs here. 2. The room we finally got had no working ventiallation whatsoever. There was a thermostat and a vent, but with the fan set on maximum the air moving out the vent was not enough to budge a tissue. Other tripadvisors have commented on the same problem so it appears to be a known deficiency at the property. As I said before, it was a very hot day so the lack of AC made the room very uncomfortable. Given the ordeal getting our room in the first place I didn't bother asking for a move on the first night. 3. The bathroom had only a small bath tub and no shower curtain. Taking a shower resulted in a flooded bathroom. There was water damage and peeling plaster to show for its repeated abuse. I cleaned up the flood with my towel but the hotel did not replace wet towels at turn-down time. We had to request replacements. 4. The room was otherwise very nice and more interstingly decorated than most Marriott properties. The platinum petit fours arrival gift was generous and came with two beers. 5. My pregnant wife became ill in the wee hours of the first morning. The hotel was very helpful in getting us a doctor who arrived in less than 30 minutes. It turned out her problem was the heat. The hotel immediately upgraded us to a suite in the main building. The main building AC was fantastic and the suite was great. Why did they make me wait so long to check in when they had a vacant suite???? I was happy to have the suite, but it had come at a high price of lost sleep, sick wife, and 120 Euros for the doctor. 6. The suite had the same flooding shower problem and no towel replacement.

It was nice as we were the only ones at the front desk and had their full attention. At the exterior, the hotel looks quaint and nice. Lobby is just a little small but pretty classy (white marble, good layout). The room given to us was very clean to begin with. The carpet felt brand-new and even my wife, who is a very particular person about cleanliness, commented that it's one of the cleanest hotel carpets she had seen. Having said that, the general cleanliness of the room was pretty good. No issues at all! The location of the hotel is excellent. It's within walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and the Champs Elysees shopping district. The hotel is very near other shopping streets (eg. Victor Hugo) and is fairly near the area where embassies are located. I would urge first time travelers to Paris to factor in the importance of a hotel's location as this makes it so much easier for you to move around. The hotel has a little french restaurant within its premises \"Le Relais du Parc\" that is part of the chain set up by the internationally acclaimed Alain Ducasse. It has a beautiful charming courtyard. Breakfast is served in this restaurant. One important tip is to check if the hotel rate includes daily breakfast. The hotel also has a little drinking lounge. Looks nice but I did not try it as I am a lousy drinker. The hotel's gym is very well maintained, clean and pleasant. Seems that the gym is hardly used as the equipment are all very new. The hotel has a ready supply of UK and US newspapers which is a plus for me. Internet access in the room is pretty pricey at 6.99 euros per hour. The only thing I found inconvenient was that the bathtub was fitted with a quarter-length glass pane which was inadequate for keeping water from splashing out onto the floor if you are showering while standing in the bathtub. I encountered this type of hotel design when I stayed in Italy a couple of years back. I believe this is a common toilet design in Europe. The concierge is pretty helpful with their recommendation of places to visit and restaurants in the vicinity.

Junior Suite room 172 has nice windows overlooking the courtyard, quiet, with trees in front for privacy, good light. A hallway/entryway, separate WC from bathroom, sitting area, decent closet space, fabulously comfortable bed, fridge/mini-bar, about 5 English TV channels, more than most Euro hotels. Nice bathroom, 2 sinks, good counter space. Good internet connection (but you have to pay). Completely free using standard Marriott points, including large breakfast for two every day, delivered to our room. LOVED that. Pretty good service. They really try to please, but I will never understand why top Elite status Marriott members hve to beg for decent rooms. Our building had a courtyard entrance, not having to go through the lobby after dinner, which I loved. Still very convenient to lobby for stopping at concierge, etc. CONS: I had called in advance, arrived at 4 pm, didn't get room of choice but did have 2 options. Other rooms not ready. We are Platinum Elite members so you would think we'd get the best they have, but those rooms never seem to be ready. Rooms do not look as spiffy as on the website.

Small lobby, just a few chairs, not fancy at all, but I don't have a problem with that. If you don't want your room sprayed with perfume, make sure to tell them (ech!!!).

So... The GOOD... 1. As stated in other reviews, the hotel is in a good location, close to the Eiffel Tower, Champ d'Elysees, and Arc d' Triomphe. The hotel is also close to several metro and bus stops (including Tour Buses) 2. The rooms are small compared to other Marriott-owned hotels in the US and Asia, but adequate for any major city. The bed is comfortable, the rooms are clean, and housekeeping does a good job of making sure rooms are turned down and cleaned properly on a daily basis. 3.The hotel restaurant is pricey (see BAD section below), especially considering the hotel restaurants ranking as an okay \"19\" for food by Zagat. On the bright side, there are plenty of better priced/better quality restaurants within walking distance, or just a metro ride away. 4. There is also a local grocer about two blocks past the hotel which sells water (1 Euro for a 16 oz bottle), cheap wine, champagne, sandwiches, and snacks. Toward Victor Hugo Circle, there is a pharmacy as well as a bakery (which has the BEST chocolate croissants - 1,25 Euros). 5. The entire staff was English speaking, and for the most part was very friendly, and willing to help with any request. The BAD... 1. The hotel is over-priced. Not the room rate (you need to expect certain costs for certain types of hotels, especially in major cities), but instead the restaurant, bar, internet, movies, mini-bar, etc., etc., etc. For instance, 1 hour of internet access is $7 Euros, which may not sound like a lot, but considering other Marriott owned hotels offer FREE internet, the extra cost seems unreasonable and overpriced. In addition, a drink at the bar comes at a price premium of nearly 400% as compared to the cafes, bistros, and restaurants only a block away. 2. PHONE CARDS - My wife and I bought a local phone card to call the United States. The card was 7,50 Euro. We asked the concierge where to purchase the card, followed his instructions, and came to find out (from the same concierge), that the hotels computer does not allow Phone cards to be used (See over-priced section in The Bad #1). The hotel even tried to charge my wife and me for trying to use the card (but they were nice enough to not charge us the fees). 3. Limited Tour Arrangements. The hotel only teams with one tour Company (or at least that is what were told), so plan your days prior to arriving in Paris, or be prepared to pay double. OVERALL - ABOVE AVERAGE Paris is an easy city to find cheaper alternatives to the expensive hotel offered services, which help you overcome the hotels flaws.

What a fabulous location. We were three blocks from the eiffel tower and a short walk to the Champs D'Elysse. It was amazing. We actually were able to walk mostly everywhere except when we took the train out to Versailles. (Which I would HIGHLY recommend- it was absolutely incredible). The hotel itself is great. It's located in a nice safe part of Paris. Our room was wonderful. Big huge king size bed with white comforter and comfortable bed linens. Our bathroom was huge and it was all marbled. We had a room that was bigger than the average room. (Not sure how we got that- but it was great!) The windows opened up out to the courtyard- which was so pretty. The breakfast each morning that was included in our plan was a great hearty breakfast to get you through till lunch. Although, if you wanted to, you could walk down the street and grab a croissant for 1 euro. Oh and a bit of advice- if you want to take the night river boat trip down the Seine (no dinner included- which I would recommend because we got off and went and had our own dinner-much less expensive and just as fun) Get your tickets at the dock. Especially if you stay here, the walk to the water was a couple blocks and we got ripped off paying $90 each to take a bus from across the water (that we had to cross to meet the bus) back closer to our hotel. Most people just bought the tickets for the night cruise at the gate and that was definitely the way to go. And if you are thinking that you can't travel to Europe because of the weak dollar, don't listen to yourself. We set a budget for every day and were able to stay within it because of the fixed meal options. All restaurants have their menus posted outside so you can check it out before you go in. All in all, It was a perfect hotel for what we needed. We walked a lot and so we definitely loved that our room was nice and comfy to come back to after a long day of exploring. I would most definitely recommend this hotel- especially to anyone who is making their first trip to Paris and wants a great hotel with a central location.", "Date": "September 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cElegant Botique Hotel in Prime Location\u201d", "Author": "jackosan", "ReviewID": "UR19262897", "Content": "The Renaissance Le Parc Trocadero served very well as the base of operations for my daughter and me during a week's stay in Paris in early August. Located in the heart of the 16th Arrondissement, an upscale residential area, the hotel is a 10-15-minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe or the Eiffel Tower. Victor Hugo is the nearest metro stop. Trocadero and Boissiere are also close at hand. There are numerous mid-priced restaurants in the area and several markets to pick up wine, snacks and sandwich makings for the room or for picnicking. The hotel is comprised of several interconnected townhouse-type buildings surrounding a central courtyard. The \"Superior\" room was small, but well-appointed. The windows opened wide and faced onto the courtyard. Traffic noise was minimal. The twin beds were pushed together, but we were able to separate them by moving around the nightstands. Most importantly, it had the extraordinarily comfortable beds that one expects of the Renaissance brand. The bathroom was tight, but clean with very nice toiletries. The lack of a door/curtain on the bathtub/shower does take some getting used to, however. Sadly, Renaissance continues to charge (read gouge) for internet access, a service that is free in most enlightened hotels in the 21st Century. Service was friendly and professional, if sometimes lackadaisical. One glitch -- when we arrived to check in at 5:00 p.m., our room still was not ready. They were very apologetic, though, and invited us to enjoy drinks on the house in the courtyard while they readied the room, and then sent up a bottle of wine and a tin of butter cookies along with a note of apology. On the other hand, on the evening of our sixth night, a knock at the door brought delivery of a complimentary fruit platter and another bottle of wine -- a very nice touch. I cannot comment on how the room price compares to similar hotels in Paris, because we used Marriott Reward points. Given that the lowest published price I saw for that period was \u20ac299, I thought we got very good value for our standard award. We did not eat at the hotel. The restaurant was closed for vacation during August, though I understand that breakfast was available. In fact, much of the 16th was closed for the annual August vacances. We had much better luck finding shops and businesses open in other less affluent, and more touristed, parts of the city. The Latin Quarter, in particular, was a good bet for finding a large variety of decent, moderately-priced restaurants during August. Convivium, a Sicilian restaurant at Place Victor Hugo was one excellent restaurant that we found open near the hotel (though it was at the outer edge of our price range given the weakness of the US dollar). With 5 bags, a Saturday morning taxi run to Charles De Gaulle ran \u20ac50, a similar ride in from Orly the prior Saturday afternoon cost \u20ac34, so if you're traveling light, you can save a bundle by taking public transportation. Also, if you like to walk (and Paris really is a walking city), you'll do better periodically buying carnets (10-packs) of metro/bus tickets (\u20ac11.40) than buying transit passes.", "Date": "August 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, AZ", "Title": "\u201cHigh end hotel in a good location\u201d", "Author": "Prassina", "ReviewID": "UR18731148", "Content": "I stayed there with my husband and our two daughters for 2 nights.

The 2nd leg of the flight was great! Straight from DFW to CDG, All in one long nights sleep. 10 hours. (Thanks to the drugs of course.) We arrived at the LPT in the late morning and checked right in since our room was ready. The hotel has 4 floors with 0 floor being the ground floor? Our room was on the 1st floor. Thats 1 floor up from 0 floor? There are 2 separate areas of this hotel. The main area being accessed directly from the lobby. And ours, the other area being accessed from the courtyard. Both are connected but separate? The first floor is their nonsmoking floor. However I don't think there are many requests from the French for a non smoking room . Our room was spotlessly clean and stayed so all week. Turn down service was a nice touch with Godiva chocolates and another cleaning of the room. As stated in an earlier review the LPT is now a Marriott property. So a good use of your Marriott points would be to upgrade to a Tower view room. They have 2or3? The service here was perfect. What ever we asked for was quickly addressed. We were given a room with a queen instead of a king as we requested and when we asked about it we were told most hotels put quests in queens because the kings are just two twins put together and people complain about that. The queen turned out great because the mattress and bedding were delightful. The breakfast here is great. Lacking nothing. Technically called a buffet but they will cook you anything you ask for right on the spot. Do not eat lunch! You won't/don't need it. Your pants will thank you. The hotel is located a short walk between the tower and the arc. And close to the double decker bus stop. $22euro for a 2 day pass and It stops at all the hot spots. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. Our favorites were Le Petite Retro and a Guy Savoy moderate$ called Le Butte Chaillot. Expect to pay from around $80 to $130 euros for a nice dinner for two with wine there. One word of caution while walking around. Watch out for the land mines!

The concierge' was great and with his help I was able to master the metro. Going to the flea market and other sites around Paris. The hotel does need a good cleaning on the carpet but my room was charming and over looked the courtyard. Which was very quiet and we were awaken each morning by the sounds of birds chirping. Our stay cost us 3k in US $ for 8 days and this included breakfast each day. Most of our breakfasts were taken in the room as room service at no additional cost. The champagne I purchased went great with the orange juice included in the breakfast. The service was the best I have ever seen, whenever I called the front desk or room service, what ever I had asked for was at my door before I could even put my phone down. Now that's service! The little bar in the lobby was great for meeting other folks who were passing through and we meet some nice couples there and made friends with several of them. The location is great, 4 blocks to the Eiffel Tower and 3 blocks to Arc and 1 block to a Starbucks, grocery story, laundries cream shop,wine store, restaurants, bakeries, I can go on and on. Spend your money on Paris not the hotel....This is a great value for the money.

It was a breeze to get to from the Gare du Nord (Eurostar) on the Metro and is right in the middle of 2 Metro Stations (Victor Hugo and Trocadero). No more than a 3 minute walk. On arriving the staff were friendly and helpful. Their command of English was excellent and they even understood my pigeon French! The concierge was really helpful and does know his stuff. The room was small (we had a Superior room) but adequate - you don't live in your room! As for the bed... Fantastic! The bed you could get lost in with a down bottom sheet that moulded around you. As for the pillows they were the best I have even slept on. I wanted to bring them home in my suitcase. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower top which was fun. As a lot of other people have said the shower screen was a joke but hey you don't have to clean up so why worry? There wasn't a kettle to make a hot drink which was a disappointment to my Partner and the mini bar was expensive (E8 for a can of coke). However, this didn't stop me using the fridge for my own drinks overnight so again, no hardship. We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on this. There were some good restaurants, patisseries and a supermarket close by so there was no need to eat there. There's a good market close by (Rue Clare) where there are a number of good restaurants to sit at to ease the aching feet. A great place to sit and people watch was at the Bistro on the Trocadero that looks onto the Eiffel Tower - can't remember the name but you can't miss it just keep walking until you can see the Tower. The location is great. The Eiffel Tower is only minutes away and you can catch to RER from there to Versailles for a bargain price of a few euros. We like to walk when we go to Cities and this hotel was easy for that - very tiring but good and makes the bed even more welcome. The batobus (River bus) was by the tower as well. We got the Metro to the Sacre Coeur and that area. We bought one book of Carnet for the Metro (10 tickets - 1 per journey) for both of us. This was enough and both of us could use the book it wasn't one book per person as I first thought and reading the guide books. Overall the hotel is worthy of its 4 stars - yes, in places the paper was peeling slightly but nothing to worry about and the room was on the small side but the bed took up most of the room; as that was great the hotel can be forgiven. I expect good things in my hotels but I don't expect perfection and I wasn't dissapointed here. If I return to Paris I would stay at this hotel and would recommend this place to anyone.", "Date": "April 12, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Renaissance Paris Hotel Le Parc Trocadero", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d207743-Reviews-Renaissance_Paris_Hotel_Le_Parc_Trocadero-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$359 - $505*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">55 - 57 Avenue Raymond Poincare</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">16th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75116</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "207743", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e8/0c/1b/private-inside-courtyard.jpg"}}
