Thankfully, we stumbled into this Comfort Inn! Found it on hotels.com and gave it a go. Before I could even get the words out of my mouth, the receptionist Shivani had us booked into our room at the advertised rate! No hassle like our previous hotel! Also, my cousin who was with me had his dog with him & the staff was very kind in acomodating our puppy. Not the easiest thing in NY! So for the 3 days we were there, we had a great rate, a great location (off of Times Square enough to avoid getting immediately sucked into the crowds), & great service (the staff was friendly & professional throughout our stay!) The management even allowed us to use the lounge/cafeteria area to do a dry run for my show. Not every place would ok with that! The one big con of the location are the slow internet access (don't expect to be streaming videos). So to sum up, our stay was a memorable one for the right reasons! A decent room at an excellent (by NY standards) price in a good location! If you're traveling through NY for a couple days, I would recommend this place!

Spacious bathroom (although the bathroom didn't get any heat -- BRR!) that was clean, had plenty of hot water and excellent water pressure. I've seen luke-warm reviews about their continental breakfast. Word to the wise: go early. The food is good, warm, and there's an excellent selection. Seating is super-limited though and it gets crowded quick especially if there are kids running about. Free coffee is available ALL DAY which is a super-nice feature. The location was prime. We took the Lincoln Tunnel into the city and upon exiting the Tunnel, we were practically at the hotel's doorstep. AWESOME. We were only a couple blocks from everything we wanted to see. The hotel felt very safe and was well-kept. Only 2 \"negatives\" ... 1) There is no Comfort Inn parking garage. There's an Icon garage across the street and it's about $40 for 24 hours. Super-convenient, super-fast, super-friendly. But it's $40 for 24 hours. Welcome to New York! and 2) Occasionally a strange sound would come from the air vent in our bathroom. I called the front desk and they said there was something about air pockets in the vents when it gets really cold outside. We only heard it twice, and not for any long duration. HUGE \"positive\" ...

It was too late to cancel the reservation after I realised my mistake, since I had opted for a non-refundable rate. Was a tad worried after reading the reviews here, but it all worked out pretty well. First off, let me say that I paid about US$250 a night for the room with two double beds for FOUR people, which is actually really cheap for the Times Square area in Manhattan. The room was small (even more so when you have four people), but at least it was clean and served its purpose (we needed only a place to sleep in and were never around during the day). The bathroom door didn't lock properly (no biggie) but that was the only problem we encountered. Shower worked fine, and water temperature and pressure were great. We stayed here over a weekend, and it was hard getting to sleep on Saturday night because the hotel is right next to a male strip club and the club's patrons were outside making a lot of noise way after midnight. Then again, we had a room on the second floor facing the street, so perhaps getting a room on the other side of the hotel might have helped. Breakfast was nothing much to shout about - pastries, juice, sausages - and the dining area was small and crowded (you might have to take food back to your room). The reception area is small and there is usually only one person at the counter, which means you might have to wait in line for a while. The check-in process took a while, but the staff was courteous and friendly, and gave us all the information (breakfast hours, wifi password) without us asking. You'd be hard pressed to find a hotel room at this rate around the same area in Manhattan. So while this wasn't a great hotel, I'd still recommend it for a short stay if you don't intend to stay in your room all the time (and who does in New York?) based on the fact that it's very affordable.

We inspected thoroughly for bed bugs before settling in, and found no evidence anywhere. TV was limited; just a few stations and the reception sub-standard (non HD on flat screen TVs?).

The one negative comment I would have is the size of the breakfast room, which I can see would be difficult for the hotel to change! We intended to take advantage of the free breakfast but couldn't bear to squeeze into the crowded room, and the bedrooms are really too small to take food into, so we treated ourselves to a nearby diner.

I had to ask for towels to be brought up so we could cover the floor and asked where we could use the bathroom during the night if we needed one. I was informed that we could go down the breakfast area and use the toilet over there (which was about 10 floors down). The towels were delivered quickly. Of course I had to use the bathroom during the night (being jetlagged and all) so I had to get dressed again in the middle of the night, go down to the breakfast area in a dimly lit hotel and then get back up to the room again. Very uncomfortable. The next day we were moved to another room, ad the staff present were kind enough to have us check out the room first. The room we received on the 18th floor was much better (and also had the kingsize bed we had reservations for). All in all, we were happy with that but obviously we wanted some compensation for the first night. We talked to the general manager David and he offered a refund for our last night. He would deal wih Expedia (we booked via them). We were happy with that arrangement and the friendly service. However, the compensation never came.

I will simply LIST the drawbacks, as describing in detail would take pages: outside door handle to room 504 half missing, door didn't open properly and when it did, it caught inside on the bathroom door handle, internet not working, room was DIRTY - beds looked slept in - we wondered if it had been cleaned, toilet required 4 flushes, A/C was not \"cold\", rather just air blowing out. While I was at the front desk, there were 3 calls from other rooms about maintenance issues, a young boy who came down to tell the front desk that his mother had called about an overflowing toilet but no help had arrived, and two other guests were there complaining and trying to get help with the internet.

When we discovered the internet was not working from our room (\"out of range\" error) we asked if we could be moved to a room closer to the internet router and Skylar said \"NO.\" He told us that it was a \"Sunday and the internet signal is just low\" (WHAT???) and to come to the lobby with our laptop and work there. I explained that both of my daughters are taking online college courses and needed in room internet to sit tests and Skylar responded RUDELY that we should just come to the lobby. In desperation, we tried the lobby and the internet did not work there either. We came to find out that the internet was not working in the entire hotel. Skylar's rudeness and unwillingness to honor Choice Hotel's satisfaction guarantee was the straw that broke the camel's back. We asked to check out and not be charged for the 3 nights we had booked. We were allowed to check out, but Skylar said he could not refund the the $800+ we were charged and that we would have to take it up with the manager (who was not available).

We were there 5 days every day fresh linen was in carts parked near the entrance of the hotel. Yes linen outside on a cart all day and all night I guess because it was always there. More linen and cleaning carts in the emergency stairwell. I am not sure but could imagine that would be illegal. The breakfast room I believe had 3 tables maybe 4 never really used the area other than to get coffee because I just didn't want to stand in the heat to eat breakfast. The place was always elbow to elbow and they were out of coffee two days and out of cups two days. If you want to wait awhile it will show up eventually. Now we are in the room. Rooms are very small, among the smallest I have ever had. Furniture is fair and the room is and was kept clean. First night the room had no toilet paper, hair dryer, and no TV remote. Some of that was fixed on the second day but never got a hair dryer. The second night we had no towels but they were aware of that and they made the delivery of the last two towels in the hotel to our room. Most importantly the rooms were quiet, the bed very comfortable and the air conditioning was great. Like I mentioned the room was clean, mostly. Those days there was no coffee in the basement there was a 4 cup maker in the room. There was always fresh coffee available but the maid never emptied the pot or toss the grounds. The neighborhood is obviously in transition there are 4 nearly new hotels on the block between 8th and 9th Ave. There is however almost that number of vacant buildings or buildings being torn down there also. Last but not least the location is near time square but you are also near the bus terminal and next door an all male club called Hunk-amania.

This is not necessarily the hotels fault but the other businesses in the area on the same street keep the street an sidewalks clean near their establishments.

The Comfort Inn building is an older but very nice building whose architecture conforms to that of the rest of New York City architecture (the intricate carvings on the facade). I'm sure the building has a rich history as most of the buildings in Manhattan. The best part is, it's half a block from the epic Times Square! The next best part is, it's near all the public transportation, both the busses and subways, all heading in both directions, Queens, Bronx, and Brooklyn. Half a block towards the east, subways B, D, F, M; One block towards the west (in Times Square), subways N, Q, R are all available, within 1-2 blocks walking distance. My husband and I bought a 7-day Metro card that took us from Times Square to Central Park, downtown Manhattan, Queens, Coney Island, and everything in between.

Therefore marks for Cleanliness, Location, Rooms, and Sleep Quality have been rated as Average. The reason why I am writing this negative review is due to their reservation policy, of which I have encountered today (one month prior to date of stay). I was originally planning to stay in NYC for 3 nights, therefore I made a reservation at the 'Comfort Inn Times Square'. Upon being informed I needed to stay one additional night, I simply googled 'Comfort Inn Times Square', and made the reservation. Little did I realise (as someone is not familiar with the area), that I had actually reserved a room with 'Comfort Inn Times Square South'. Aware of my blunder, I had phoned CI - South. The worker had said, \"Not a problem to cancel and get your refund, just call in the morning, 'cause you need my manager.\" So, as instructed, I had phone the next day. When speaking with the manager, I was told that no refund could be made, nor could I have my reservation transferred to 'Comfort Inn Times Square'. Basically, the best management could do was to re-arrange the date of my stay within the next 2 months. By the way, this is only the 2nd time I'm coming to NYC in 36 years... I'm sure I won't visit within the next 2 months. It's not like I don't want to give my money to Comfort Inn, I just don't want to have to shift hotels for just one night!!! Again, the blunder, confusing: \"Comfort Inn Times Square\" \"Comfort Inn Times Square - South\" I'm admitting fault for mixing them up, but as someone who isn't familiar with NYC hotels, is it that difficult to switch from one Comfort Inn to another?

However, the room and bathroom were clean. The hotel windows could open but the noise was incredible, you expect it in New York but where the hotel was situated seemed worse and the windows could have benefited from more noise proof. The hotel provided a free breakfast which was very nice. It was a basic buffet choice of cakes, pastries, waffles, cereal juices and hot drinks. This was a godsend and I couldn't find fault. I personally wouldn't use this hotel again for the price I paid. It's cheap and cheerful but only if you get it at a cheap price is it worth it.

The room was left spotlessly clean and tidy every day and both it and the bathroom were of a good size. The beds were very comfortable and our room looked as if it had only recently been refitted so was a very nice place to be in. The breakfast provided at the hotel was always very well stocked with a massive range of foods to suit most people and the member of staff on duty each morning was very welcoming. The only thing with the breakfast room was that it did get a little full if you are going to eat after around 8.30am as the seating is a little lacking. In all, the Comfort Inn Times Sq, is a great value for money, brilliant little hotel and I would very much recommend it to anyone looking to visit New York.

The answer to this, staying at this hotel is a definate no, you are really close to Times Square. Our break was 5 nights B&B. We got the bus from Newark Airport (cost $25 return per person. Would cost $15 one way) and got off at the Port Authority Bus Depot. It literally is a 5 minute easy walk to the hotel and a waste of money if you were to use a taxi. The hotel had construction work on going outside but this did not impact on our stay. We got a twin bed room on the 10th floor and it was small but functional, given the limited time we were in the room. The bathroom was a good size and had shower, bath and washbasin. There was a hairdryer there as well. (Remember to take an adapter for phone chargers, hair straightners etc). There was not a lot of wardrobe space so we tended to leave stuff in the cases. There was an iron and board although we never used it. Tea coffee making was also provided. Breakfast was on level 1 and consisted of a wide selection of pastries, freshly made muffins, cereals, fresh fruit and tea coffee and fruit juices. The eating area was small but functional and you could take food back to your room. We ate breakfast two mornings but ended up going for breakfast at a place called Tick Tock which is near Madison Square Gardens. There are so many things to do and places to eat that you will not be stuck for choice. At the end of our stay we kept the room for $50 as it needed to be vacated by 11.00am and our flight was not until 7.50pm. The hotel staff explained we had two choices. 1- We vacate the room by 11.00am and they would look after our luggage. 2- We pay $50 dollars and keep the room until 7pm. We decided the latter and we were glad we did as my wife and daughter did not feel like going out and about the last day. If I was returning to New York I would use this hotel again. That said I would also check Trip Advisor to see if there was better available.

Some rooms overlook the current Times newspaper offices and the main bus terminal (which makes it convenient for buses, a taxi dispatch and several subway lines - stations for various lines are interconnected by underground walkways there). The neighbourhood isn't great looking though there are some well run deli's and coffee shops nearby. I read somewhere (Choice hotels site?) that the hotel has a restaurant - they must have mixed that up as it doesn't, thought there are places to eat nearby. We've been to New York before and know hotels are pretty expensive there, like many other big cities where real estate is at a premium. We got a good rate (for the date) via Quick Book and stayed a whole week at this property. We paid a bit more per night than on previous trips, but the room was a whole lot better, and there were more facilities including breakfast. The first room we were allocated wasn't the type we booked, but I got the duty manager to change it as we wanted a king size and just one bed. The 4th floor room was clean, modern and well appointed with a good TV, safe large enough for a laptop plus cameras, passports etc. The rooms are however small and there's isn't a lot of space for luggage - you have to be disciplined with your stuff. The bathroom was fine - clean and everything worked well including the shower (to operate the shower you have to pull down on a small ring on the end of the bath tub faucet/tap spout which can be confusing). I used the free wifi successfully several times with both a laptop and a wifi phone. Connection speed was OK. You have to get the access code from reception. We had no trouble sleeping. The bed was very comfortable, the aircon worked if you wanted it, you could open the window for fresh air (though that made it a little noisy with the sounds of the city). I asked about a refrigerator/microwave but apparently they only had 3 rooms with those facilities, which were all in use. In the end we didn't need them, and chilled a bottle of wine using the ice bucket. We had a few minor niggles during our stay, but most of these were dealt with by the front desk staff - the maid took the complimentary newspaper away before we had a chance to read it, the phone wouldn't allow me to make a local call and so on. Be aware that there may be a small daily charge if you use the safe. The breakfast was good, with a selection of cakes and pastries, cereal, juice and waffles. The breakfast room, in the basement, is small but adequate. Some problems come from how guests behave and use it, with some folks choosing to sit long after they have finished eating, seemingly oblivious to other guests waiting. It pays to get in there early if possible, and you can always grab something and take it back to your room. Tea/coffee were available there 24/7 along with complimentary snack bars. There were also vending machines and a ice maker. There was also a coffee machine in the room and the maid left enough for a couple of cups each day. Bottled water was also provided in the room some days. All the staff at the hotel were great, particularly the guy running the breakfast room. The front entrance and lobby weren't great to look at, particularly as there was construction work going on when we were there, and you sometimes get bags of trash piled up, but it's functional. There's a concierge desk available for booking tours, tickets and transportation, though we didn't use it. There's a small waiting area in the lobby and the staff will hold luggage for you. They kindly let us use the restroom downstairs to change and sort out our luggage before our transatlantic flight home.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cFilthy, Noisy Hotel.

We arrived on a Saturday night, greeted by an enormous pile of black rubbish bags and 'Escuelitas', the nightclub next door, in full swing. There were lots of the club kids hanging around by the hotel entrance. The entrance & reception area of the hotel are dirty & small. Our room was located in the basement, where you could hear the music from the nightclub, thumping through the walls. It also stank of damp, & was tiny. There was the bed, & room for me to walk in front of it & down one side. The walls were marked & dirty, with torn portions of wallpaper. The bed cover had large stains on it including (I hope) what looked like some sort of blue candle wax. How anyone is supposed to sleep in this room is beyond me. The tv had no remote, there were no bin liners in the bins and there were no opening windows, but there was a balcony door, which, when I asked, I was given a key to. However, the air con system chucks out warm air here, into a dirty smelly courtyard. The smell was bad. We shut the door again and braved the damp smell inside. The bathroom, was actually clean, and of a surprisingly high standard when compared with the room itself. We asked to be moved, but the hotel was full. The staff said they would relocate us the next day. We attempted to use the kitchen facilities to make some food & discovered tomorrows breakfast, sitting (bagged) on the floor in a dirty closet. The plates were made of polysterene & mine actually melted from a piece of toast sitting on it. The kitchen & cleaning cupboards were both on our floor, so after a night of trying to sleep, we were disturbed all morning by people coming to use facilities, and the cleaning cupboards which are also on that floor. The staff knocked twice within an hour, wanting to relocate us. Clearly all we wanted to do was sleep, but this was never going to happen. We were VERY tired. We had had a long flight the night before. This was our first New York experience. We also had no idea of real day light, or the weather from this low level room, making it even harder to get motivated. We relocated to a room on much higher level (16?). The view, of all the buildings, and dirty, treeless streets was actually quite depressing, but any lower floors on the same side would have had a view of a car park below. The window at least opened a crack, but again, the bed sheets were dirty & smelt disgusting, I mean AWFUL-no way was I sleeping in them tonight. They brought us our own refrigerator & microwave so we could avoid the kitchen level, but by then I had discovered the bathroom door did not shut, the shower head was broken, still no bin liners in the bins & I had just had enough of this hotel now. We spent the day finding another hotel, and relocating. This meant coming back for our things & asking to be transferred (to another Comfort Inn). They said they would charge us for both nights & that a transfer was not possible due to the hotels bring under different management. (If we had booked through an agent it was apparently possible). We were told we would have to come back the following day to discuss this with management, & ask for our money back. The manager was currently unavailable. Our first day in New York was ruined by lack of sleep, money spent on around town & worrying about finding another available hotel. We DID get all our money back for the nights charged. But it took a lot of time, effort & wasting the precious time we had in the city, & were not compensated for that.

It all started when you first pull up to the hotel it looking like a building site with rubbish bags all over the the place and to say they smell it was like being at a rubbish tip, Also i would like to add that before you get in the hotel you always have to walk pass the hotel staff puffing away on their cigrettes 2 inches from the door. After this you walk through to the reception area which is more dirty than any i have ever known i really wanted to wash my hands after touching any thing in that room. To be honest the staff behind the desk were ok cant complain about that they gave me the key and off i went after tripping over 10 bags as the room is so small. So up the lift i went to the 14th floor hallway was clean so that was a good point. Into the room well when i say room more like a cupboard i thought it was going to be small but a place for the suitcase would of been nice then to top it all off looked out of the window into the building opposite you could see what was on there computers so you need to leave the blind down all day which does not help when you feel your in a prison cell any way. The next morning after a good night sleep as the bed is nice at last the hotel has got something right we went down to the breakfast room, we took one look at this and laughed and went out for breakfast i did not fancy eating 1 inch away from the person next to you seriously it was that small and im not lying. The location of the hotel is very good as its right on times square but the avenue its on is dirty smelly and just a hell hole there is no way that my wife would of gone out on that road at night on her own. Then to top all this off the last morning we got up and checked out which the person on the desk just took the key and did not say a word which i thought was rude and as the hotel had booked the taxi for us i just politely asked is that my taxi outside and his reply was DONT KNOW JUST GO AND ASK this was so rude so i just walked out.

They don't have a fitness center or a pool but who wants that when you are in New York? Get out and see the city. All things aside the best thing about this hotel was the staff. New Yorkers are not known for being friendly which we saw in the streets asking for directions, but this hotel's staff went above and beyond what would even be considered hospitable.

As I say the hotel was good value but dont expect anyone to give you the thumbs up on anything I can assure you will be on your own. So do your homework at home dont bother asking for any assistance cos you will get none. Had they taken 5 minutes to give us directions it would have made a hugh difference. We went to the New Yorker up 8th to get basic info on standard info. Though as I say the hotel was value, the service within was nil. There was a helpful gentleman on reception who gave us some info after we had asked and been blanked by the Conierge. Prior to travelling we had pre booked and paid for a private car to collect us from the airport. It didnt turn up so we called the number the number on the reciept.

We were able to navigate from the hotel to subway stops, and walk to MOMA and Radio City...not too bad of a walk and so I felt the location-to-price ratio was very nice! The continental breakfast was often picked over, but you could always get coffee and some poptarts or cereal if you wished. The staff was lovely. I stayed with my 14 year old daughter and some other family members were on a different floor. We never heard any noise from other rooms or from the club. Our view was of the bus terminal, but who cares? The room was fine and the king bed was super comfortable.

When we arrived we were greeted by the staff and the hotel had been booked and paid for in the UK before arrival. I was told that the room had NOT been reserved for us despite having a receipt to confirm this. Having showed them the receipt they then allocated us with a room. The room itself was small and not ideal for 3 females with suitcases, despite it being a 2x doublebed room. We were tripping over our suitcases throughout the stay! Not ideal! On day 2, after returning from a day out, we return to find we had been locked out of our room. We asked reception about this, who said it was an error and then reprogrammesd our key to let us in, 10 mins later they call to advise we have not paid our room and would have to pay again! I refuse and tell them to liaise with the booking agent as they had already taken payment. They refuse to make the call to the UK to resolve the problem and kept demanding for us to pay in full again! The manager himself was very cocky to say the least and very unhelpful. In the end, he calls the UK after standing there for 30mins demanding he speaks to the booking agent. The booking agent gives him company credit card details to pay for the hotel, but the manager refuses to take the details saying he needs it in writing and it MUST be faxed to him! This annoyed me to say the least as the booking agent was giving him details to make the payment! This ruined our whole evening worrying about whether this issue would be resolved. None of the staff members bothered to tell us the following morning that the whole issue had been resolved! I had to constantly ask and the answer I always got was - I dont know, someone else is dealing with this matter. I will get them to call you. Least to say this matter was between the booking agent and the hotel! We should not have been involved to this extent. Not only did this ruin our holiday, but we never even got an apology for all the hassles this has caused! I would never recommend anyone to stay in this hotel, the customer service is the worst I have ever experienced!!!!!", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Temecula, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and very nice staff\u201d", "Author": "CaliMom05", "ReviewID": "UR17132444", "Content": "Our family of six booked 2 rooms via the Choice Hotels website and stayed for 4 nights.

Our kids were ages 8, 10, 20 and 23 with two adults and we all felt comfortable in the hotel. Breakfast was usually on the go, taking it up to our rooms or walking out with it on our way to the subway. The Port Authority subway stop is just a few blocks away - very convenient as the boys made a few trips to Yankee Stadium and the girls went shopping downtown. An easy walk to Times Square from the hotel as well as to see a Broadway show.

Stayed in the hotel from 9 to 12 Jun 2008. Being new ,it was nice and quiet on the 18th floor. Rooms were small. Breakfast included in the rates were ok and the staff in the breakfast room were helpful, but not the front desk who were not very friendly. We suffered a bad traumatic experience which i have to highlight here. We booked through the hotel Concierge and paid $64 ( Receipt J 14359 ) for a shuttle bus ( operated by Apple Commuter Company INC ) for 4 leaving at 5.25pm on 12 Jun to bring us to the JFK airport. Halfway the bus broke down and we were left stranded in the middle of the road. There were another dozen or so pax on the bus.The driver did not bother to help us or give any instructions as to how we could get to the airport.We had to wait for more than 30 mins before a private cab stopped to pick us to the airport. As it was near our departure time, the 30 mins wait was traumatic and very stressful for fear of missing the flight as we cannot afford a delay back home. We had to pay 3 times the normal fare demanded by the cab driver.We had to dash to check in and my wife fell and suffered bruises on the arms and legs herself. I have sent a email to the hotel asking for a refund of the shuttle fare and cab fare and compensation for duress and trauma suffered as a result of the breakdown of the Bus but to date I have received no response.
