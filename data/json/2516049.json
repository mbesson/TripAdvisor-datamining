It's a bit of an odd set up but it really doesn't matter. You check in at the Magic Castle Hotel at the bottom of the hill (which being ranked 2 of 295 on Tripadvisor should give you a good idea what to expect), and then the free shuttle will take you and your bags up the hill to the Hollywood Hills Hotel. It looks more like an apartment block than a hotel, and that's because I think it is. There are many rooms not marked with a number on the map the hotel give you, and I think people live there. Not that this matters. The room we had was huge, with a lovely King size bed and kitchenette area. The view out on the balcony was just fantastic. The rooms themselves are a bit tatty and in need of a refurbishment, but if they were all new and nice then you'd easily be paying double the price for this place you are now if not more. Whilst the furniture and fixtures are worn they are very very clean though. The only bit of dirt I saw anywhere was on the wooden plank that runs along the bottom of the balcony doors, and I have no doubt if I had reported it, a cleaner would have been there within minutes, the service is that good at this place. But I didn't report because it didn't bother me (too cold for the balcony)! The location just can't be beaten though. Even if you are a slow walker it's no more than 6-7 minutes to Hollywood Boulevard, and you're right in the middle of everything being near the Highland centre and the Chinese Theatre. The pool area is also absolutely lovely and the views are just as stunning from there. It's not heated mind you, but you can go down the hill and use the heated pool at the Magic Castle if you wish to. The front desk at the Magic Castle were also extremely helpful at all times, and provide free snacks and DVD's. I've never been to any hotel before that does that (the 5* places are the worst for ridiculous mini bar prices), and it's a really nice little touch. The one and only criticism I would have of the staff is their knowledge of the local area. We asked two different staff members for restaurant recommendations and got the exact same list of places from both staff (are they trained to say the same)? They were all pretty touristy, shopping mall type places (nice enough, but you could find them anywhere), and we were after good local non chain restaurants. However this is a very very minor criticism from someone who loves eating out, I'm sure 90% of people would be happy with the recommendations! Overall though I loved this place and would definitely return 100%.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "Reed W", "ReviewID": "UR126521107", "Content": "I booked this hotel through Orbitz because the hotel's own website showed no availability, but Orbitz still had rooms. I reserved a 1 bedroom suite, which was supposed to have a separate bedroom with a king size bed, plus a living room with a queen size sofa bed and kitchen. When we got to our room, it was just a basic hotel room with one king bed and a small kitchen. I called down to the front desk, and they said they were very sorry but they had no other rooms available, so all they could do is send up a roll-away bed. Once I saw what that was like, and realized we were missing an entire bedroom, I called back and asked to speak to the manager. The manager said she was terribly sorry, but they made a rare mistake, and she offered to give me the first night free, plus a discount on the second night, or help me find another hotel if we decided to move. Well, moving was just too much trouble, so we stayed both nights. The view is fantastic, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the king bed was very comfortable. We asked for a couple things (e.g., extra blanket), and they were delivered to the room promptly. We took advantage of the shuttle, which saved walking up and down the hill. It was very easy to walk to Hollywood Blvd where all the main attractions are within a few blocks of the hotel. On the last day, I asked for a late checkout, which the manager was happy to arrange. Then, on top of all that, she said she'd decided to give us a full refund for the second night as well! It is rare to find a hotel manager who really understands the value of good customer service. I could have left very disgruntled about the mixup, and posted lousy reviews, but instead the manager went out of her way to apologize for the hotel's error and to do everything she could to make it right. We will definitely return here on our next trip to the area.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cHollywood Hills Hotel\u201d", "Author": "greenfnlantern", "ReviewID": "UR125571232", "Content": "The wife and I were in town to see a few concerts on the Sunset Strip.

But finally, this is the place! At the last minute, we needed a place to stay in Hollywood near our apartment for one night. I called The Magic Castle (another GREAT place to stay in Hollywood) but they were booked and suggested their sister hotel, this one. And it was $50/night less expensive... which was perfect for us. After booking the room, the receptionist asked if we were celebrating anything, and I told her our anniversary was coming up (but honestly, I hadn't thought of celebrating it that particular night). When we arrived there was a bottle of wine with balloons, a card (hand signed and very sweet!) and a delicious little chocolate cake from Susina Bakery (a great LA bakery) waiting for us. It was unbelievably welcoming and awesome... and because of it, we decided to celebrate our anniversary that night with a nice dinner at Yamashiro! It was very romantic and fun. We never expected to have such a fun impromptu anniversary celebration! The Good: Friendly/welcoming/professional/helpful staff... everyone included!

BUT we did not care one bit because the service/location/view was worth so much more. The decor was easy to get over since we were enjoying the experience so much.

Safe neighborhood just steps off Hollywood Blvd and the Walk of Fame, Grauman's Chinese Theater, etc. A little tricky to find but well worth it. It is the sister to the Magic Castle Hotel and is up a steep hill which you can drive to and park with secure guaranteed parking, walk to, or get a shuttle ride up to. The Magic Castle Hotel itself is a little pricier but very nice looking with nice pool and apparently big suites. The Hollywood Hills Hotel is a step down in quality but still very decent. Really it is a bank of small apartments, some of which are still rented as apartments, some as rooms. Since it was a quarter mile up in the Hollywood Hills, the view was magnificent from our large balcony in the one bedroom suite. Kingsize bed, good size bathroom/double sinks, foldout double sofa, table/chairs, kitchenette with dishes, microwave, fridge, TV's in living room and bedroom. Not huge and not fancy, but homey and nice, everything working, clean, quiet and comfy. Then there is the staff. By far the nicest, friendliest, well informed staff I can ever remember. They will help you find things, get places, stay late, park easier, and just make your stay so much better. Complimentary sodas, snacks and candy are available - just ask and they fill a bag for you. They packed us a bag to take to Universal Studios and several times just to take up to the room. Hot cider and cookies in the lobby in the evening and nice continental breakfast in the morning. Check in, snacks, breakfast, free DVD loan are all done at the Magic Castle Hotel down the hill. MCH pool is heated and HHH is not, so we were invited to swim down there, as well. We did ask for a ride up the hill once and they couldn't have been nicer. Also, by staying there, you can attend a dinner show or brunch show at the Magic Castle, otherwise you have to be a Magic Castle Member (a magician!) Brunch is the only time kids can attend and coat/tie is not mandatory. The food and shows were fabulous and the hotel staff let us leave the car in their lot.

We stayed 3 nights while we did a quick stopover on our way back to Australia from Florida. The good: Fantastic service. Nick, the guy at the desk, was truly a font of knowledge on the local attractions. Helped me with booking a day tour that turned out to be brilliant. He explained how the hotel worked, that we could get free mini-bar snacks and soft drinks and about the included buffet breakfast in the morning. All the other staff were also friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the mornings is awesome and sets you up for the day. The average: The rooms could do with a bit of a spruce up. There was mould in our bathroom and the room was pretty smelly, stuffy and hot. The small air conditioner didn't really do much to help so we ended up having to keep all the doors open which isn't ideal. Some new carpets and a split-system airconditioner would help. That said, the room was ample in size for our family of 4. There is a separate room for the master bedroom and a pull out sofa. As our kids are older we bought an air bed and sheets at the local Target for our son to sleep on (too old to share with sis :0)). The pool area was teriffic and the views of the city from the balcony superb. There is a shuttle bus up and down from the sister hotel (Magic Castle) for breakfast if you want it. We just walked which only takes 5 mins at the most (no wonder the yanks are obese if they can't take a small walk up and down a hill). The location is great, you can easily walk to Hollywood Blvd for the nightlife, star walk and city tours. Plenty of places to eat also within walking distance.

We used it as a base of operations on either side of a road trip to the San Francisco area. Because our other son was traveling with us, we opted for the suite to begin with. We booked another suite (one floor higher) on our return to Hollywood. Then, when our son flew home before us, downsized to a smaller room. So, we got a good sampling of what they offer. Customer service is a priority with this hotel, and everyone I dealt with . . . from initial booking, to the front desk, to the air conditioning mechanic, to the shuttle driver were all very pleasant and helpful. Being separated from the Magic Castle Hotel, at the foot of the hill, was not a problem.

The swimming pool was a plus . . . located in a remote section of this hillside retreat, it was gated as was the entire hillside compound. Well-maintained, it provided relief from the hot temperatures. My major gripe, was the level of building maintenance common to all rooms. Windows that didn't lock . . . same with a slider. Domestic water temperatures that were excessively hot, and were reported but not sure if they were fixed because of our short time in each room. Areas that needed caulking and painting. Overall, we would stay here again as the viewpoint of the city from the hillside gave us a feeling of place. From our balcony, we could see the Griffith Observatory, downtown L.A., the Capitol Records building, and a good portion of Hollywood.

It's a \"sister\" hotel that's a 5 minute walk away and borrows some of the Magic Castle's services. At first I was pretty annoyed. Instead of the bright, family friendly Magic Castle I'd booked, I found myself climbing a very steep, dark hill up to this place, which appears to be mostly residential apartments, and those that aren't filled with permanent tenants are used as hotel rooms. It has a coded security gate at the entrance, but the actual room security is pretty poor. The room smelled of gas, and the air con was incredibly loud. I was fairly unhappy by the time I settled in (I called the desk to ask to be moved but was denied). Then I looked out of the window (of room 504) and the view immediately made up for a significant part of that unhappiness. On a clear day you can see the Griffiths observatory, the corner of Hollywood and Highland, and Downtown LA in the distance. It's a really great view, and when the sun came up, the hotel suddenly started to feel a lot more secure, nestled in the hills amongst the typical Hollywood houses and the Yamashiro restaurant next door. As it's run by the Magic Castle, you get use of their free breakfast, their free \"mini bar\" (you have to go to their front desk to collect items), their pool and their mostly lovely staff. That's a definite plus, but as I say - I wanted to be in the Magic Castle, not a 5 minute walk away. Worth noting that there's no internet at the hotel, you need to walk down to the Magic Castle's pool area if you want that. The location is pretty handy though, as it's a short walk down the steep hill to Hollywood Boulevard, which meant it was easy to get to the Chinese theatre before the crowds turned up. If you do stay here, bear in mind you can use your pool key to get through the lower car exit gate which saves a lot of hill walking. The pool (separate to Magic Castle's pool) is very pretty, themed after the Yamashiro restaurant, but quite busy and loud (the residents were playing music there for most of our stay - if you like Alkaline Trio you'll be OK here). The car parking is awkward, but safe and easy to access (costs $10 a night though). My main gripe is that there's a few factors that eat away at my ability to sleep here - the door locks feel loose and the doors rattle in their fittings at night; the air con is insanely loud at times; the fridge buzzed like crazy; the room smelled funny - if only the place had a bit more attention maintenance and security wise, it would have been a fantastic stay.

You check in and eat breakfast at the Magic Castle Hotel as the rooms of the Hollywood Hills Hotel are up the hill and some of the property are residential apartments. When we arrived we were greeted with a cool drink and instantly made to feel very welcome. We had a studio room with a kitchenette with a lovely view of the Hollywood Hills. The room itself was on the older side but it was quiet and spacious. The walk down to the Magic Castle Hotel took 7 minutes (and I'm not a particularly fast walker) but it is quite steep. We never did walk up as there was always someone able to drive us up to our room. We never waited longer than a couple of minutes for a ride and this was at all sorts of different times of the day including after 10:00 pm. The continental breakfast was great, including yogurt, cereals, toast, croissants, scones and muffins. There were a number of juices and tea, coffee and instant hot chocolate. Definitely a big cut above the average. The Magic Castle is located a block and a half from Hollywood Boulevard. Once you are on Hollywood Boulevard you turn left and right there is Madame Tussauds and a bit beyond in the same block is the Chinese Theatre and the Kodak Theatre. Madame Tussauds was amazing and the half hour tour of the Kodak Theatre was certainly worth doing. In the area in front of the Kodak Theatre there are a number of stands with numerous brochures, with lots of information about attractions, some with coupons for the local attractions. There is also a manned Information Centre there on the left hand side as you are facing the theatre. The entrance to the theatre is actually quite far back from the street past a number of shops and the box office for tour tickets for the Kodak Theatre is located there. One other attraction which we thought was wonderful was the Hollywood History Museum. It had a huge collection of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia and so much more. It is on Highland just off Hollywood Boulevard and again really worth seeing. One more thing, we loved our tour of Warner Brothers Studio, especially our tour guide Andy K. We had dinner at Yamashiro, which is just above the Hollywood Hills Hotel. The view from the restaurant is beautiful and expansive and it is not too expensive if you watch which entrees you order. The Magic Hotel staff made the reservation for us and imagine our surprise and pleasure when we were served a free appetizer compliments of the Magic Castle! One other thing about the hotel as that they had a list of goodies, snacks and soft drinks that you could have by simply going to the front desk and requesting some. My son (and I!) really loved this, particulary at the end of a long day exploring Hollywood. I can't say enough about the staff at the Magic Castle Hotel.

Just near to our room was a roof swimming pool that has recently been renovated and had we had more time would have been a lovely to relax- very quiet and peaceful. There was a complimentary continental breakfast served in the magic castle hotel at the bottom of the hill- all you really need- pastries,cereal, biscuits, coffee, tea. You could also use the pool at the magic castle hotel. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful in pointing out restaurants, attractions. If you wanted a lift up or down the hill anytime all you had to do was call and they would pick you up or drop you off- especially useful in the evening when going out for dinner. The hotel is about a 5 min walk from the chinese theatre and walk of fame as well as a large modern shopping centre with good restaurants inside. We thought this hotel was good value for LA and in an ideal locaion- Universal studios -5 mins as well as warners brothers studio. It is about a 10 mins drive to Beverly Hills and Rodeo drive- definately worth a drive through.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!

If you want to use the pool you can use the Magic Castle hotel which is heated. The hotel is very near Hollywood Boulevard - Grauman Chinese Theater and the Walk of Fame. We found that you really do need a car in LA - the distances are just so big and I don't think public transport is that great. I really liked the Grove Shopping Centre and the Farmers Market. We also went to the beverly Centre for some more shopping. Went to see a The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in CBS studios, went to Santa Monica beach, Universal Studios which was only about 10 min drive away, Six Flags and also to an LA Lakers game in the Staples Centre which I would highly recommend.

Finding the Hotel: At the beginning of your stay at the HH Hotel, you must check in at its sister property, the Magic Castle Hotel. Like other reviews, my wife and I plugged the Magic Castle into the sat nav, and ended up at the door of the (associated) Maigicians club next door. The valet there was very polite and pointed us in the right direction. There is a short term (10 mins) space to park right outside of the reception. Arrival: We received a very friendly greeting from the lady on the front desk and our booking was confirmed. Whilst waiting, a guy came up and offered us a flute of traditional lemonade, which was a nice touch and much needed after a long drive to LA. Another guy came around 2 minutes later with chocolates for us. The receptionist informed us that we were in room 504 - her favourite. We were given two room keycards and a seperate key for the swimming pool. You also get a keycode to enter into the gate of the car park, along with a tag to hang on the rear view mirror - failure to do this might result in you getting towed. Location: Be warned that it is quite a steep hill up the the HH Hotel from the Magic Castle - about 0.25 miles. Overall the hotel is well located - we (like seemingly everyone else in LA) drove everywhere, so the hill didn't bother us. Once down the hill, Hollywood Boulevard is close by and an easy walk. You are also at the right end of town for Universal Studios/Warner Bros etc, only a 10-15 mins drive away. Breakfast is complimentary and served in the Magic Castle Hotel. We started walking down the first morning, but could not find a path, and didn't fancy the steep walk up the road, so went and took the car instead - there may be a path that we failed to find, but what looked like stairs down from the pool area ended in an abrupt halt where at some point the road had carved across them! If you do take the car to breakfast you can park (check the hours) for free in Orchid Avenue just down from the Magic Castle. We didn't ask, but the Magic Castle Club is closed in the morning and has a huge car park so you may have been able to park there too. Someone else on Trip Advisor mentioned that the staff will run you up the hill if required - this is good, but was neither advertised nor mentioned to us. The Room: First impression was that this is a decent sized room. Think more studio flat than hotel room. As you come through the door, there is a kitchen area with breakfast bar, cooker, fridge, microwave and sink. Part of our reason for choosing the HH was the kitchen facilities. After 2 weeks on the road, we actually longed for some home cooking rather than eating out. We were very disappointed by the equipment in the kitchen - one tiny saucepan, a small frying pan, plates, cutlery and.. that's it. Not even a tin opener, no over tray or gloves. There was washing up liquid and a sponge, but no tea-towel to dry anything. In general the kitchen area was tired and could do with a refresh. It was adequate, but could have been better. The bed was large and comfortable, linen was clean. There was a couple of armchairs and a side table in the living area, as well as a TV. We don't go on holiday to watch loads of TV, but the TV reception was generally poor. Plenty of channels though. Again, the living area is a little tired feeling - old carpet, worn fittings etc. The bathroom contained a bath/shower, sink and WC. All were clean enough, but all were old. Think of this more as a dated motel rather than a modern hotel and it is fine. There is air-conditioning via an old in wall unit - noisy but effective. The highlight of the room is undoubtedly the balcony - or rather the view from it. The balcony itself was a bit crusty and in need of renovation/decoration, but there is a great view over LA downtown and over the Hollywood Hills. It was great to stand out here at night and watch the city go by. Breakfast: The complimentary breakfast was good. Yogurts, bread/toast, cakes/muffins, cereal, juice and coffee. All good and all just right to start the day of well. Parking: There is secure parking right outside the accommodation block. One thing we found annoying was this: each room has an allocated parking space, clearly marked with the room number. Given this, why does the hotel charge an extra $10/night (+ taxes) for guests to park here? If you weren't parked here, the space would be sat empty. You need to display your pass in the car when the car is parked or you'll be towed, plus you need a code to get in the electric gates, so you can't get around it. One of my personal pet hates is unnecessary car park charges by hotels. Facilities: HH has a laundry - $1 for a wash or dry, $0.75 for powder. Last wash has to be in by 21:00 in the evening. There's an ice machine and drinks vending - $1 for a can of soda which is actually good compared to most hotels. There is a very nice looking swimming pool. We never found time to use it, but it did look good. There are sunbeds around the pool. There is wireless internet at the Magic Castle Hotel and also an internet 'booth' in the courtyard area by the MC pool. Overall: I have to say that I hadn't intended this to be a negative review. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the HH Hotel and would recommend it to anyone. The staff there were superb. The receptionist asked my wife how the room was, and when the reply was \"it was fine...\" she seemed genuinely concerned by this. We had the best view in the house in our room and that made the experience really. In writing this review however, I am trying to think about how I would feel about the room as a stand-alone entity, ignoring the awesome views. The rooms and fixtures and fittings are dated, but they are clean and everything we used worked fine. We paid over $200 a night including parking, so for that price I would expect more. Without a car, I'd personally not want to stay here. The views and general location, plus the excellent, attentive staff are what pulls this up from average to above average. Rating the room on its own, I'd say 3/5 at best.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Amazing Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Janey3", "ReviewID": "UR20485242", "Content": "With my partner I have just returned from an eleven night stay at the Hollywood Hills Hotel, beginning on 16th September 2008 and can say with all sincerity both of us were more than happy with all aspects of the hotel and its service. Believe me, I am the type of person who tells of a situation exactly as it is and if I wasn't happy about an issue would speak out but in the case of the Hollywood Hills I had nothing at all to be unhappy over. Check-in for the Hollywood Hills is at the Magic Castle Hotel and from the second we arrived to the second we left the front desk staff couldn't do enough to assist us and made us feel completely welcome. The Hollywood Hills is located (obviously) on a hill behind the Magic Castle. The distance to the Hollywood Hills is perfectly walkable and although a little steep is pleasant, taking around only 10-15 mins at a steady pace. We walked most days, without any problems and found the walk great for excercise, but for anyone unwilling or unable to make the walk the Magic Castle staff are always more than happy to drive guests the distance - at any time of day or night. A drive can be requested to or from the hotel just by asking at the foyer or picking up the phone in your room. As for the hotel itself, let me firstly point out the amazing views of LA it has to offer. We took a studio city room (room 404) and it had the most fantastic, extensive view over the city, right to downtown. It also had a gorgeous view of the Hollywood Hills (see my pics). Sitting on the balcony watching the sun rise and fall over LA is something I will always remember. The room itself was a decent size, clean, tidy and perfectly acceptable. There was a good size private bathroom, with the bath, sink area and toilet kept in pristine condition. The shower was powerful, a good tonic after a long day. **Please note - the TV worked fine and had more than enough channels for someone taking a vacation** The bed was the most comfortable of any I have ever stayed in at any hotel. It was huge! No chance of my partner kicking me in his sleep - he wouldn't make contact! The kitchen area was also clean and well stocked with cooker, fridge, microwave, grill, pots, pans and even washing up liquid. The location of the hotel is very quiet, away from the citys' noise but is ideally located for Hollywood Boulevard. The walk from the Hollywood Hills to street level is much shorter and attractions such as Graumann's Chinese Theater and the Hollywood and Highlands shopping mall are minutes away. The hotel is also ideal for travelling elsewhere in LA. Bus services run from Hollywood Boulevard to pretty much everywhere and the fare is just $5 for an all day pass. Also, the Metro tube is at the side of the Hollywood and Highlands Mall, running directly to Universal Studios and so forth. Each morning, a complimentary breakfast is provided at the Magic Castle between 7 and 10am, consisting of fresh pastries, cereals, yoghurts, bread, juice and teas/coffees - all are delicious. During our stay we were also given bottles of water, chocolate and other goodies, free of charge, given with a smile! The staff are so genuinely friendly and helpful. Any queries are dealt with instantly, they even printed off directions and bus times to local attractions for us as well as checking in on line for our flights home and printing our boarding passes. The hotel also has a laundry room open until late, where wash powder can be purchased for a small price. The Magic Castle offers use of its' pool and sun loungers at any time and staying at either hotel gives access to the Magicians' club just next door. At the side of the Hollywood Hills is the Yamashiro restaurant. From the restaurant there are the most spectacular panoramic views of the city, well worth walking the two minutes to photograph. All in all I do not have a bad word to say about this hotel. If you are looking for great value ($159 per night for a studio city room) a stunning view, comfortable, clean accomodation, friendly service and close proximity to Hollywood Boulevard, this hotel has it all. If you expect pure J Lo style luxury and 100% modern and expensive fixtures and fittings or are upset at the thought of a daily walk up and down a moderately steep hill you may need to look elsewhere.

The check-in, and general hotel logistics are a bit 'fiddly' to negotiate, quite quaint in a way - but definately worth it if you don't mind the hassle - for example the apartments are right at the top of a steep hill, with tricky access on foot - so the Magic Castle staff- and they were very glad to do it, would ferry us back and forth up and down. which was fine since they're very chatty and love telling you about LA - as do all the staff.

I travel on a budget so the price of $190 per night (that includes the state & hotel taxes of 14%) was more than I wanted to pay but I discovered that the hotel was well worth it. The hotel sits on a hill that overlooks Los Angeles so we had a great view of the city and even could see the Hollywood sign. I especially enjoyed looking out our balcony & viewing the city lights at night. Our room was equipped with a full kitchen, though small but it had everything: microwave, frig, stove, coffee maker, and even plates, cups, & silverware. There was a mini living room with couch, chair, and TV & a small spot for a table to eat our meals. The cozy bedroom had another TV & with a soft duvet on the bed & the bed was roomy enough for 1 adult & 2 teenagers. The bathroom had double sinks & the tub was equipped with water jets to take a relaxing bath. The hotel is linked with the Magic Castle hotel that is down the hill & that's where we ate our continental breakfasts. We could use the pool at the Magic Castle but found it to be small & always crowded with kids. So we swam in the bigger pool at our hotel. In fact, we were the only ones in that pool which is surrounded by a waterfall & Japanese garden next to a classy Japanese restaurant. Because we were up on the hill & away from traffic, our stay at the hotel was quiet & peaceful. Check in is at the Magic Castle hotel & I was greeted with a bubbly lemonade drink while I registered. We were shuttled up the hill to our hotel in the hotel's Toyota Highlander car. I was told that the lobby is open 24/7 and the shuttle car between the 2 hotels is always available to bring you back & forth. Also at any time, you can request a nice variety of free snacks. I would give this hotel an excellent rating if not for the fact that the furniture is worn, the carpet had stains & the walls could use fresh paint. Luckily past reviews on Trip Advisor prepared me for that. I felt that the hotel had a quirky charm that was enhanced by the curvy scenic drive up the hill; complete with a friendly neighborhood cat roaming the premises. Overall, this hotel far exceeded my expectations & the service was fast & friendly.

It was a bit tricky to find at first because the actual rooms are up on the hill enclosed behind a pin-code protected gate and the main office is located at the bottom of the hill on Franklin street. Once we figured that out and checked-in, we received the password to open the gate and also given our own reserved parking space, which is later added to your bill at $10/day. The location was very convenient since it\u2019s a few minutes\u2019 walk to all the main attractions on Hollywood Blvd, such as the Chinese Theatre, Kodak Center, Walk of Fame, etc. It is a very safe location because it\u2019s up on a quiet residential hill, and especially because the rooms and parking are enclosed within the secure gates.

King size bed and a sofa bed, kitchen with stove, refrigerator, microwave, coffee machine, cups, plates, etc. The bathroom was good, with the exception of several ants which could be found crawling around everyday.

They also had complimentary breakfast and a pool at the main office, but we had no time for that. Too much to see and do in Los Angeles.

The pool is unheated, but in the height of the summer at least, the water was positively warm. Great place for a refreshing dip and to hang out and watch the sunset. The distance up/down the hill from the Magic Castle should not be underestimated - it's about quarter of a mile and pretty steep all the way - allow 20 mins for a round trip to the Magic Castle. They do offer a shuttle but we didn't take them up on this. You can use the faclities at the Magic Castle Hotel, but given the walk, it's best to treat this as an optional bonus rather than an integral part of what you're paying for. Breakfast at the Magic Castle is a reasonable help-yourself selection of cereal and pastries, fruit, juice and coffee. Worth popping in your way out in the morning, but questionable whether it is worth walking up and down the hill for. All in all, worth it for the great views over LA and a quirky and memorable stay.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel with home comforts!\u201d", "Author": "JohnnyDeeelite", "ReviewID": "UR18816165", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Hollywood Hills Hotel and it was a very nice place.

To a person, they were all very accommodating and attentive and really helped to (mostly) turn around what was for us, initially, a horrible experience. I understand the pressure they must be under in dealing with the Hollywood Hills Hotel. In December, we got the news that my partner had been nominated for a Grammy award. I went to look for a hotel and quickly found the Hollywood Hills Hotel and the Magic Castle Hotel. Armed with the knowledge I gleaned from their website, I thought the HHH would be a good choice, particularly because of the view and what we perceived was the style of the hotel based on the website presentation. I called the reservations line and explained we were coming out for the Grammys and were looking forward a great experience. After a long flight across the country (and, I might add, a ferry trip from the island where we live and lots of connections), we arrived on Friday night, Feb 8. After a somewhat bewildering front desk experience (the front desk for the HHH is actually at the Magic Castle Hotel down the hill - yes, there is a pool, but use the one down here. Yes there is wifi, but it's down here, yes, there is breakfast but it's down here, etc. No mention of the Grammy nomination, something I mentioned at the reservation time. It would have been a nice touch to wish us well) off we went up at the hill (no offer of assistance with bags, finding our way in the dark, etc). Imagine our disappointment when we saw the corridor where the room door for 203 is. The pile of US Mail buckets in the hall, the darkness, everything. Once in the room, the cracked paint, the stained rug, a dresser with a drawer missing and the rest of the drawers stuck and on the way to broken. The bed was okay, but all night there seemed to be a parade of odd smells. With all the comings and going of the neighbors outside - many of the hotel units are long term rentals - we joked, but crack house did come to mind. It was pretty bad. The next day, we had errands to do: get our tuxes for the awards ceremony, get the tickets for the events, etc, so we were out of the room for several hours. Imagine our disappointment when we came back at almost 4 pm and the room hadn't been serviced. It was the last straw and it was at this point we reached out for a room change down the hill at the Magic Castle Hotel.

The room was open yet cosy and the down conforter and pillows was a great treat. Really beats sleeping on those glorified curtains you get at most hotels. Even the tiny shampoo and soaps they give you were wonderful. Normally I just ignore those at other hotels but these were like ones you'd get in an expensive luxury hotel. The balcony was my favorite part of the room. It was big and had a table and chairs and the view was GREAT. I really can't express that enough. It was so nice to come \"home\" to a quiet room above the city and sit on the balcony and just relax before going to bed and waking to another day in the busyness of L.A. I also want to say how nice the staff was and how great the service was. The ladies at the front desk were so friendly and helpful and every person I came in contact with there were the same way.

The hotel people cannot spend money doing major renovations because they have actual tenants living there. I imagine whenever the tenants finally vacate, they will do massive renovations which will result in room rates five times what they are now and sort of a \"ruining\" of the experience here (in my opinion). Years ago when I went to LA I would stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt in one of their poolside cabana rooms. There was something about them that reminded me of how Hollywood used to be in the fifties. Since they renovated the HR all of those kinds of great authentic Hollywood experiences were gone. Only to be replaced by all things gross and glossy mall-like any-city any-place. The HHH is the last real great place to stay in Hollywood. If you need room service, and want luxuries of that sort -- you won't find them here. But you will find the same quality linens and bed that you will get at the other over-priced hotels in Hollywood. Personally, I'd rather stop by Mayfair Market on Franklin and pick up water, food, etc., or Victor's deli for some wine and then keep them in the fridge (every room has a full kitchen) than to order the exact same things and spend more money. You also get complimentary dishes and basic pots/pans. On my most recent visit I was \"upgraded\" to a one bedroom suite. I honestly prefer the Studio City View because I liked that the room was more open. I thought the \"bedroom\" area made it more congested. The *best* thing about the hotel is the balcony and the view. NOTE: There are two types of rooms here. When you drive into the compound there are a row of rooms on the left-hand side of the road and a row of rooms on the right-hand side of the road. The rooms on the left at what they call rooms with a \"hill view\" and the rooms on the right are what they call rooms with a \"city view.\" I have never seen inside a \"hill view\" room, but judging from how they look from outside, I wouldn't stay in them. The ones you want are in the greyish building on the right -- the city view rooms. But then again, from outside, those don't look so hot either. Never mind all that - this isn't the place to stay if you're shallow and into surface only. Easy to get a complimentary ride down the hill if you just wait to call the front desk until you're ready to go. It takes them about 4 minutes to come pick you up. The service at the HHH is great. Gretchen delivers some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. I'm very afraid of writing this review because I want to be selfish about this hotel and tell no one it's here. Because I have this horrible feeling that sooner rather than later more and more people will realize what's here and Paris Hilton, or the like, will ruin it. Also -- I'm not a budget traveller. I have no problem spending $400/night on a hotel room or $200 on a nice dinner. The reasons I love the HHH are more about the feeling - the energy - the sense of magic and a taste of what true Hollywood has to offer. If you want to feel a part of it, stay here. If you want to be destracted by glossiness and mall-like atmosphere, stay elsewhere. The HHH is for people who want to be near everything but yet hidden, out of view, nestled in a quiet place. So that at the end of the day, you can retreat.

The buildings were originally apartments, and the outside has not been kept up at all. The place kind of reminded me of a place you would see on an episode of cops!! For us, two women traveling alone, we were freaked out. The inside of the room was nice, very spacious, and great view of the city from the balcony. Had we stayed in this room, I probably would have enjoyed my stay more, but we didn't, because after the first night we discovered that the heat did not work. The staff at the magic castle (who owns the HHH), was very accomodating in changing our room, but 2 minutes after stepping foot in the new room we decided to check out, that room was not at all like the first, was dirty and smelled like stale cigarettes! We packed or stuff, and went down to the magic castle to check out...the staff asked us if there was a reason for leaving and I told her that we were not at all happy with the conditions at the HHH and they knocked $100 off of our stay for the night before, and offered for us a suite at the magic castle hotel for a discounted rate. We did take the suite, and found the Magic castle wonderful. I have to say thank you to the staff here they are amazing...especially Gretchen (I believe that was her name). I think that if you get the right room at the HHH, you could be satisfied with your stay, but if you are traveling alone, or a group of women...the place might seem a bit seedy...but the Magic castle is a great alternative.", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fremont, California", "Title": "\u201cOverall pleasant experience\u201d", "Author": "alvatse", "ReviewID": "UR6566300", "Content": "I love the location! It's only a couple blocks from the Hollywood Blvd and Walk of Fame and other tourist spots. The hotel staff was very nice. I asked for 2 sets of toilettries, and the staff brought 6 sets and more! I\u2019d say 2 things though: 1) if you are going to rely on their shuttle service between Magic Castle Hotel (where the front desk is) and Hollywood Hills Hotel (they both belong to the same property), make sure you wait till 10 mins prior to the time you need the service. If you call too much in advance for shuttle for a particular time, they forget to pick you up. However, the cars they use as \u2018shuttle\u2019 are very nice and clean. Seems like they mostly use 4WD to pick up/drop off guests. 2) the bedding is very clean. I\u2019m very picky about bedding but HHH has very clean bed sheets, comforter, and pillow case.

I just got back from staying one night at the Hollywood Hills Hotel and was immensely disappointed. The only reason this hotel deserves 1 star is because of the friendly staff. When I first walked into the room I was pleasantly surprised. The room was large with a small kitchenette area and a large private balcony. I put our drinks in the fridge, but noticed it was as warm as the room temperature. I thought no big deal since the size of the room is above average and the balcony was a nice feature. My partner and I decided to check out the pool, but ended up being disgusted by its condition. The bottom had flaking off paint and was plagued by algae. We went back to our room and turned on the A/C and took a shower. While I was in the shower within 5 minutes the water was freezing cold! My girlfriend couldn't even take one after me because it would not even get just a little bit warm. When I came out, the floor around the A/C vent was soaked! On top of that, only one light worked in the entire room! Luckily I got the room at a discounted price, but if I had paid the standard rate, I would have demanded some compensation. This hotel could have easily received 5 stars if the owners would just put some money renovating the entire property. I felt the quality of the hotel was equivalent to a Motel 8.

I found this gem of a hotel here at TA. It seemed to have some solid reviews so I thought I would give it a try. All expectations were met. I was in Hollywood for a wedding and needed a central location. I spent a fair amount of time in Studio City and in Silver Lake. HHH was perfect. It is just above the noise of the city. It has great views. It is part of the Magic Castle Hotel and gives you access to the MC pool and breakfast. So, I will surely stay here again and would recommend this place to my friends.

First, the staff couldn't be better. So welcoming and helpful. Beautiful views. The bed very comfortable. They gave me a free room upgrade as I had trouble finding the right place to check in so that was nice. Parking is scary depending on where your spot is. I was a little suprised at the $8.00 a day parking fee. Room a bit worn but clean and spacious. After my first shower I took a pretty good fall on the bathroom floor which is very slippery when wet so beware!I Was confused where to check in so I'll pass on this information. Check in at the Magic Castle Hotel lobby (not to be confused with the Magic Castle Club). There you get a welcoming glass of bubbly lemonade. Nice touch. Yes you do have to walk a steep hill to use your laptop for free wireless internet or to get the yummy Continental breakfast in the Magic Castle lobby. But after two or three scones it's probably good I burned a few calories going back up! I suppose you could drive down but then where to park as it is tight in front of the hotel. Great location although it can be tough crossing the street at the bottom of the hill. But that's summer in LA i guess. All in all a great stay at a place with reasonable rates with a great location.

We returned for another full week in May of 2006. We asked for the same suite that we had last year, and were very pleased that they were able to accommodate us. This is like our home in LA! With so many things to do in LA, this hotel is in a perfect central location... an easy trip via the local Metro station to Universal City Walk, or downtown to Union Station and Olvera Street... an easy drive to the beaches; Venice - Santa Monica - Malibu... an easy walk down to Hollywood Boulevard... and when you return, you're on a secluded hillside with a view across Hollywood to the LA skyline that makes you feel like you own the entire city. The staff is truly great. Ashley & Mary Jane quickly and courteously resolved a couple of minor issues at check-in. Gretchen is wonderful, she makes us feel so welcome; and she loves LA so much that she is a great resource if you're looking for suggestions of things to see or do. Darren, the manager, is a gentleman and a pleasure to converse with. I found everyone to be genuine and sincere (either that, or they all deserve an Oscar for being exquisite Hollywood actors). Once again our suite was clean and comfortable. I can only think of one other hotel we stay at where the bed is as comfortable as home. In spite of the unfavorable comments you'll see regarding the pool, it's actually just fine. Sure, it needs a paint job, but it is clean. The surrounding terrace with its pagoda is charming and relaxing. Admittedly, the exterior of the building is dated and somewhat tired looking, but the place is so comfortable, that's of minor concern.
