Very much overpriced both for room and board and, it would appear, now living off a lost reputation of by-gone years. We are not inexperienced international travelers \u9225?and certainly not in Italy and Tuscany -- but we must admit that in this case we were taken in.We had a room on the loggia. When it was opened, a cloud of dank and moldy air greeted us, a warning we should have heeded. Clearly the room had not been recently aired or cleaned. The proof of this were the cob-webs and the half dozen spiders or so we killed in our brief stay.The pictures as currently shown on the web do not match the reality of the accommodations. They were taken either some years ago or else with the advantage of special lighting. Our room, despite its once-fine murals, was dark, dirty, and dingy.Our room, at a top dollar price, like others on the loggia had no windows, and only access to light and air through two shuttered doors. The glass enclosures were too flimsy and revealing to leave open by themselves; but the shutters blocked all air and light to the outside world. Sleeping in this airless vault was extremely uncomfortable.The garden of potted citrus trees, obviously many years old, was delightful, but the rest of the grounds were unkempt and in a sad state of maintenance. The pool was a foot or two low in water and littered with leaves and debris; no one, so far as we could see, used it during the time we stayed at the Villa.Much is made of dining at the Villa in its advertisements. The one meal we took there we must admit was of good quality. But the charges are outlandish. We had many other fine \u9225?indeed, much better \u9225?meals in Tuscany at 40% -- or less -- of the price charged by the Villa. (We would recommend, for instance, the restaurant in the \u9225\u6969irst Hotel\u9225? just off the A1 autostrada in Calenzano, for far better service and food for a fraction of the price charged by the Villa. Sometimes, indeed, outward appearances are not what they seem.)There are simply too many superior accommodations in Tuscany, especially around Florence, at far better prices and with far better services, for any traveler to give the Villa Villoresi a first thought, much less a second.", "Date": "Jun 2, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR854450112", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "gpp"}, {"Content": "Total peace but close to Florence       dinner at Villa Villoresi on their terrace", "Date": "Aug 16, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR883080444", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "elliemae"}, {"Content": "charming comfort, lovable caring management, excellent cuisine I stayed at the Villa Villoresi this past summer, and it was like a home away from home, but in the lush beauty of Tuscany! They pampered us with a lovely candlelit dinner on the terrace, with everything either grown or made on the Villa's grounds or nearby. The proprietress, Cristina Villoresi, is a countess, and this is her ancient family home, of which she is extremely proud. The family tree on the wall in the lobby goes back many centuries. The structure itself dates from the 12th century and is actually a National Monument, but there are nice amenities like a swimming pool and updated bathrooms. Original frescoes, antiques, and vaulted ceilings are throughout. Make sure to go when it is a little cooler than the middle of August tho; all of Florence is extremely hot in mid summer. A sweet memory!", "Date": "Aug 11, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR873932550", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d239519-r5457833-Villa_Villoresi-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "239519", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
