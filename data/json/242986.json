Don't be fooled, it's not. It's a 15 minute walk to nowhere, though at nowhere you at least find a subway station. Still, the neighborhood itself is amazingly uninteresting and appalling, ie ugly and at night full of drunks on streetcorners. Next up, the horrible, ill-making smell which for some reason comes from every possible bathroom in the hotel. It was explained as some summer-based problem with river water coming up (?!?); Still, summer was gone and the smell remained. Regardless, how could one accept any excuse?? Rooms only have double twins, which leaves me wondering: is there actually anyone aside from a bunch of students travelling together that rather sleep on a smallish twin bed?? Minibar is advertised as complimentary, though you are chargest for every refill (last time I checked, that was not the definition of free). Breakfast is so expensive, you might expect caviar and champagne. While the selection is definitely decent, it in no way compares to the outrageous prices. In general, food appears to come at a price which is quadruple it's value. Staff is mostly uncompetent, albeit somet are somewhat friendly. However, the front office manager is probably the most unfriendly, uninterested, arrogant, rude and uninterested person in the world. The kind of person that intends to make you feel sorry for any inquiry you might have dared to ask. Anything positive about this hotel? Well, the wellness center is ok, and they did make an effort to be trendy (endresult however, they failed somewhat). Well that, oh yeah, and they are right on the banks off the Spree, however if you are not a river fetishist, this will not make up for all the things it lacks.

Was initially concerned about the location potentially being too far from the places we wanted to see in Berlin. Great experience started with reception staff giving us a room at 10:30 AM which was many hours before the official check-in time. After a long flight from Calgary that was greatly appreciated. During our ten day stay we found everybody, from the front desk to the restaurant and room service, to be extremely professional, pleasant and helpful. They all spoke very good English which was a great help for us as non-German speakers. Requested additional pillows were in the room even before we reached our room (#224). The room was good size with a couple sofas and a desk. Free in-room safe was great to have. Very clean/spotless room and the bathroom(bright).Both very good size. Towels were good size and plenty in number which sometimes is a concern in Europe. River view from our room was great. Barges/cruise boats going by made it really a pleasure to look out the window. Location was great. Away from the busy/ noisy areas. Easy access to all the popular sites by public transport. Only 4Km from Brandenburg gate.For us that was an easy walking distance. Less than 30 min to Alexander Platz (Bus/Train). Nearest bus stop was about 50 yards (take #245 to Main Railway station and from there to anywhere in Berlin within minutes by S/U Bahn or train). Lunch boxes were ready for us at check out time (5 AM) . That was a very nice touch. Recommend reserving the room with breakfast rather than paying for breakfast after arrival (typical German- with a lot of hot /cold choices w/meat/eggs/cheeses/ fruits/yogurt/cereal etc, etc) ). We found that to be an excellent value. There are two nearby mid size grocery stores (less than 10 minute walk) with lots of fresh fruit and good bakeries. Reception Staff is quite knowledgeable about nearby restaurants and recommendations were right on. Walked around even after dark with no concern about safety. Air conditioning was appropriate to provided just enough relief from heat without making the room freezing cold. Free use of an high speed internet terminal at a private corner in the lobby (with color printer/no extra charge for printing) was greatly appreciated. All in all Adrema is a great value and if we make another trip to Berlin it will be our definite #1 choice. The hotel is close to Tagel (TXL) airport and taxi fare was(as of yesterday ) 12-13 euros (depending on the traffic).

The rooms are very modern and beautifully designed, especially the bathrooms. Everything was exceptionally clean. The river view wasn't quite as spectacular as I'd hoped - I'd imagined being able to see a long stretch of it and across the rooftops, but it's quite a built-up area so you can't see all that far. Still, it was definitely nice to have, as opposed to just looking at buildings. In our room we had a flatscreen tv with remote, which also doubled as an internet terminal (though there is one in reception which you seem to be able to use for free). There was also a hairdryer, and (quite expensive) minibar and snacks. It was a real shame not being able to make tea and coffee in your room, though. As is common in Europe, our double room had two single beds pushed together. The beds were a bit on the soft side and gave me backache, and the pilows were very very soft and sort of formless, making it hard to sit up in bed. But the linen was all plain white and crisp and fresh. The breakfast is extra at 14 Euros, and another 3 Euros to have it in your room, which we did on our last day and I have to say it was worth it. It was very generous and our breakfast for one easily fed two people. There is a little greasy spoon on the corner where you can get a cheaper breakfast if you like, and a supermarket and Burger King five minutes' walk or so away (the restaurant is closed on Sundays). The Adrema is a little bit out-of-the-way, but it's only a short walk to either Tiergarten or Bellevue S-Bahns, or you can walk through Tiergarten or along the Spree into the central area of Berlin. The staff at the Adrema mostly spoke English and were very friendly and helpful. Reception was open 24 hours a day, which was useful when we wanted to get a cab at 2am. Although there was a bit of a feel of a business hotel about it, with a few conference-goers going in and out, we were there for a romantic weekend and it was fine for us. I'd definitely recommend it - in terms of value for money, we got a lot of designer bang for our bucks!", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel, Not very good location\u201d", "Author": "gillycooke", "ReviewID": "UR6500298", "Content": "Stayed here 14-18 Dec. Lovely Hotel but not a very good location as well as some others. We stayed on the 6th floor over looking the river (request this when booking) and had a great view of the city. It is situated in the suburbs with a lot of turkish restaurants. the area dosen't feel safe when you get off the bus but actually is ok. The breakfast is 14 euro a day but if you come out of the hotel and turn left on the corner is wee cafe that does a a very cheap breakfast for no more than 5.50 euro. If you need instructions on how to get to the hotel phone up and they will fax them to you. Once you get the hang of travelling to and from here its grand. I would certainly stay in the hotel again as I know how to get to and from no problem now but if you can get somewhere nearer to the trains stations P.S. There is no kettle amenities in the room that was our downside.", "Date": "December 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood river views\u201d", "Author": "EEYORETIGGERR", "ReviewID": "UR6457221", "Content": "This is a really nice design hotel located slightly outside the city centre.

We found our room to be beautifully modern, bed very very comfortable, all extremely clean, very well priced and in an OK location with friendly, helpful staff. Our room faced the road and we had no trouble whatsoever with traffic noise. The air conditioning was really needed as it was an extremely hot July and our room had full sun most of the day. We chose to walk to and from the underground which took about half an hour, and although it was very hot in Berlin it was an easy walk. There are many restaurants near the hotel and a beautiful cafe on the corner with the best coffee and most beautiful pastries. The open topped double decked bus tours really are a must and we also did a walking tour of the city which was exceptional. The Adrema is a fantastic hotel and if given the chance we'd definitely stay there again!", "Date": "October 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "2bTraveling", "ReviewID": "UR5703356", "Content": "This hotel is a fantastic value for the money.

The images online of the hotel looked fab so when i got there to say I was shocked was an understatement...The hotel is extremely impressive. The initial greeting from the staff on booking in was so polite and the hotel itself appeared very modern and clean. We stayed on the 3rd floor which was fine. Again, very very clean and well lit with lighting sensors so that you dont have to faff around looking for switches. The room was beautiful. It was absolutly fantastic and again so clean. Very modern. The staff in the bar / resturant were lovely. Greeted us everytime we entered and couldnt do enough for us. They went out of their way to make sure that we enjoyed our stay. Very Polite and really made an effort. we had breakfast at the hotel only which again, was fit for a king twice over... The hotel was located pretty central and unless your really idel and cant be bothered to absorb your surroundings then really walking to the main attractions like The Brandenburg gate should not be an issue. It probably took about 20-30 mins to walk Tiergarten and it was really pleasent along the way. Local cabs will stop for you at the hotel location - just thumb them - and they will tell you the places to go. All in all this hotel is finely located along the River Spree and is dead romantic in the bar on the evenings when it gets dark and there is little noise. The staff are great and we will definatly be going back there again.!!!!!!!", "Date": "July 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah, USA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful rooms; OK location, Ok services\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5288631", "Content": "When we arrived at this hotel, we were quite impressed. The rooms are beautiful, clean and modern so we were quite happy. However, there is a restaurant on the first floor, our room was on the second floor. The first night you could hear the music from the restaurant but it wasn't too loud or disruptive. The second night was awful! There was a private party that lasted until almost 3AM complete with karaoke to crappy American songs and traditional Jewish songs. I can't even describe how loud it was! I wouldn't stay there again without asking if there are any private parties \u2013 or I'd just research a better place to stay.
