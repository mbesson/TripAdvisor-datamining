We got it for a great deal and stayed for 3 nights in mid-March 2012. Arriving at the hotel was a great experience. It was a cute neighborhood away from the main attractions of the city, but virtually void of tourists. Lots of great cafes and amazing bakeries nearby, and the best part was having the metro stop just short walk away. The room was very basic, but what we had expected for the price. However, they did have a very nice, modern bathroom that seemed spacious in comparison to the room. The hotel staff was generally friendly, and helped us understand the metro lines and which stops to transfer at when visiting attractions. All and all, we found this place to be plesant and quaint. It had it's quirks, like the rock-hard bed and four flights of windy stair, but the quirks made it cute and feel authenic--it felt like we were staying at a little Mom and Pop's hotel on a little Paris side street versus a chain hotel on the main drag. Would definitely recommend for those who want to save some money, and don't mind staying a little ways out and using the metro.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cGreat value stay\u201d", "Author": "Lowri J", "ReviewID": "UR125909039", "Content": "I stayed here for 4days in total and what a wonderful hotel it was.

We don't speak French, and they were fine with that. Your have your own bathroom (other place did not) Free WIFI, and an easy to use safe for your valuables. Good Neighborhood - lots of food choices and safe. About a 5 minute walk from the Metro. No AC controls in the room that I saw, but windows on either side of the room that opened kept it plenty cool. Good size bathroom/shower and a decent size room in general. In addition to the bed, we had a desk, 2 nightstands and a closet. CONS: Not the hotels fault, but the shuttle to the airport from here needed a 1-2 day notice to reserve it. We didn't do that, so we were forced to take a 55 Euro cab ride to the airport. TV only has two channels in English so we rented a few movies from iTunes at night when we were looking to save a little cash. It's on a small street not on the general tourist map that we used constantly, so it's more of a 10 minute walk from the Metro when you're trying to find the street.

I stayed at Hotel du Theatre for 5 nights in March. The location is great. When you step outside of the hotel you can see Sacre Coeur Basilica and it's right near 2 metro stops (Rome and Villiers, lines 2 and 3). The rooms are small, but it's Europe so we thought it was fine. The rooms are also very dark, there is very little lighting and on our last day there one of the bulbs blew, making the room even darker. We booked through a third party website and paid 80 Euro/ night for a twin room with free breakfast. If you book directly with the hotel it's about 140 Euro/ night. I don't know why there's such large difference, but there is. There is free WIFI which was a bonus but no English channels on TV. I read in another review that they have English CNN but we were unable to find it. Our room was VERY hot. The heater was on full blast and you don't have control over the temperature, so you can't turn it down. Because of this we opened the window, but the street was very loud so we didn't get a lot of sleep on the weekend when the bar next door was busy. We found it really hard to find somewhere to eat near the hotel. We ate at La Gondole one night and it was really good, we ate at another restaurant on the main strip, it might be Chaptal... and it was really BAD. Service was just ok. No one went out of their way to help us. We hung the \"do not disturb - no need to clean our room\" sign on the door, but our room was cleaned anyways. The breakfast is good, it's a nice perk. It's a lot of bread, some juice and yoghurt. With everything being so pricey in Paris, this is definitely a plus. There is an elevator/ lift in the hotel, you can't fit more than 2 people in it. It's tiny but it works. Other than that it was a fairly good place to stay.

I protested in vain. The concierge got a taxi for us to take us to the other hotel \"The Romance Malesherbes\" , a sorry looking hotel, stuck in a noisy street next to a cafe. Why the hotel carries 3 stars, I do not know! When we arrived we discovered that there has not been any communication between the two hotels so that the clerk balked at paying the taxi fare and when I reminded him about the free breakfast he said he did not know anything about that. He further said that I should not complain since they found me a nice room. The room in question was a small \"mansarde\" under the roof, nice enough because it had two windows facing each other which let a nice breeze in, but not worth the price tag of 210 Euros. The bed had no lining and the edges of the blanket were horribly frayed, one electrical outlet was pulled out of its socket, and we discovered that we had to pay for the WiFi. Not to mention the light in the elevator which turns off as the door closes.... and the suspicion of one of the employee that I took two breakfast because he saw me bring a coffee cup up in the room before breakfast.

I prefer to concentrate on Parisian life, outside of my room, nice restaurants, museums, evenings at the theater (by the way, Hotel du Theatre is near my favorite theater,Theatre Hebertot, and I was told that French iconic star Jean-Louis Trintignant would rest at Hotel du Theatre when he was playing at Hebertot in Art by Yasmina Reza and in Comedie sur un Quai de Gare). Why is Hotel du Theatre the place where I stop regularly? First the location. See the site below: http://www.railways.incanada.net/Paris2006/Rue_de_Levis.html So close to Rue de Levis, a mini-Paris in itself, alive and colorful with its daily open air market where you meet real people (no tourists there!) and discover many little restaurants close to Hotel du Theatre that give you a real feeling for French traditional food (my favorite: Le Patio Provencal and Un Air de Famille). Close to the Villiers subway station from where I can travel easily all over Paris after getting my weekly pass (bring one recent small photo and ask for a weekly pass Navigo Decouverte, the cheapest way to travel by bus and subway). http://parisbytrain.com/paris-train-metro-week-pass-navigo-decouverte/ Moderate prices: why spend in hotel rooms what I love spending on books or gifts to bring back home? Warm welcome: the staff has always been most helpful with little requests of mine. Pleasant breakfast: hey, I am not there to splurge on breakfast.. Paris is for lunches or dinners! All I want is something to get me going: fresh coffee or tea, some pastries (they have a nice assortment of miniature croissants and brioches every day), OJ ad lib and here I hop on my bus to discover Paris. So their selection is pretty good for the price! Appropriate rooms, access to wifi, TV and radio, hair dryer, clean environment, that is enough.

We would never recommend staying at the Du Theatre for the following reasons: During our first reservation, which was for 4 nights, the bathroom sink did not drain properly so the filthy and gross sink stopper was left sitting on the bathroom counter for the entire 4 day stay. The public computer was not working, the television in our room did not work, a light was out, and we had to ask for toilet paper and soap. Our second reservation was for 2 nights.

We understood this and did not have a problem with it since earliest check in was listed as 12 noon. But we were also told not to worry that they would find a room for us since they owned 3 hotels in the area. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why they would say this since we had a reservation? After taking a shower and washing my hair the next morning, which was on our last day in Paris, I discovered the hair dryer did not work.

Once again, the public computer had not been repaired, our room had a light that was out and we again had to ask for toilet paper and soap. Except for one gentlemen working in the evening on our first stay, the staff at the Du Theatre hotel were very unfriendly, appeared to us as lazy, and had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attitude.

Cons: Unfortunately, we were given the room right beside the front desk, the room was very small and tight , no AC, had to borrow a fan from the front desk, could hear people and noises from the main entrance, there were a couple of dark stains on the bed sheets, the main light switch broke on the second day, the drawers were not real-just for decoration, taps were very loud, and could hear other people using the taps and waking me up in the morning. We weren't expecting much food at breakfast, and were right, just mini croissants, cereal, yogurt, coffee and juice.

Our bed was a two twin beds in a queen sized bed frame. But who cares? The area is pretty quiet too. Even if we had a bar next door. The only thing was their garbage can is sooo small, located in the bathroom, and the only 1 in the whole room. And broken. Other than that it was great. The breakfast wasnt so filling though. Croissant and coffee. Anyway, it was okay coz you can always just grab a good breakfast in cafes along the way or crepes on the go. The have several cafes even before you get to the Rome station so its fine. They also have a free internet access by the reception area. Which was great since we didnt bring our laptop.

After our first night we asked to change rooms, citing the noise, the cleanliness of the room and the broken hairdrier (I was asked if I knew how to work one), but the receptionist didn't appear that bothered, almost as if they knew the room wasn't right in the first place. 'Laissez faire' would be a good way to sum up his attitude. The room we were allowed to use temporarily was much cleaner and clearly illustrated how unprepared our original room was. The breakfast was farcical. You have to get up early because it simply runs out and is seldom replenished. The woman in the dirty apron was more concerned with puting the clean glasses back on the shelf than noticing the orange juice, the \"hot\" water, the \"cold\" milk, the cardboard croissants and the Coco Pops (now that is criminal!) had run out.

Also for you summer travellers, please remember that there is no air conditioning in most European hotels at this price-- We were there during a 'heat wave', and opening the doors overlooking the street were quite a treat...a bit loud though, so take those ear plugs with you off the plane!! The breakfast was ok--bread, yogurt, warm milk, cereal--head to one of the local cafes for a cafe and croissant instead. Though you could waste your day sitting there chatting, so if you need something quick to get you going just hit up your free breakfast instead. The location is great--like everyone else said it was so easy to get anywhere. Though not very easy to get there from CDG. We took a taxi 45 euros, and on the way back took a shuttle (front desk will call for you) for roughly 37 Euros for 2 people. If you take the shuttle I suggest you know which terminal you need to be dropped off at and have the front desk tell the driver in French (or if you speak the language, tell him yourself). We ended up being dropped off at the wrong place--adding a half-hour onto our 'trip to airport' time. The first night we walked through the Moulin Rouge to Montmarte up to see the Sacre Coure. Absolutely beautiful at night. Grab a bottle of wine on your way and hang out on the steps of the Sacre Coure overlooking the city...awesome! Don't mind the greasy men trying to get you into the nudie clubs on your way there/back, the are harmless and just doing their jobs-- The cafes in that area are open very late--and it's just nice to sit and people watch. Everyone speaks English in this area, and really any tourist spot you go to! A drop of French goes a long way though...makes you seem friendly-- Also there is a place called Monoprix that is fabulous for grabbing gifts--we went to the one on the Champs Elysee, but there are a few in this neighborhood too. You can find Fauchon, Nutella, Kusmi teas, Valrhona choc, and many other things to take back. My friends loved the sea salt with the cork top; and chestnut creme sold in a box with 3 tubes (I split them up and wrapped them in French newspaper).

We demanded that they find us a room as we had paid for our room in advance and we were eventually checked into the hotel. From there on our stay was very pleasant - the room was small but well presented and the breakfast on offer was more than adequate. The only problem was they couldn't find the key to the safe in our room which meant we had to carry our passports etc around with us which was far from ideal. We were only in Paris for a few days and were disappointed that we had lost so much time trying to sort our accommodation out, even though we had booked and paid well in advance. Given that our experience was similar to a previous reviewer, who was also moved to an inferior hotel due to a leak in the room, I would not be inclined to stay at this hotel again. I would also urge the hotel management to either sort the plumbing out in their hotel or ensure that, if they are going to move guests to alternative hotels, they move them somewhere decent.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel du Theatre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d233568-Reviews-Hotel_du_Theatre-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$118 - $254*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5 rue de Cheroy</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75017</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "233568", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7a/fc/7afce66358e4b3681b46de5f51d3bf2d7large.jpg"}}
