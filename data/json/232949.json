Ask at the front desk (you have to get your own way back). The hotel is stark, being owned by the monastery and the feel is like walking into long school hallways. There is no elevator so get ready to climb the terrazzo stairs with your suitcase. The bedrooms do not look like the ones pictured on the web site. They are greatly embellished for the pictures. Half the furniture in the picture is not actually in the room. The ceilings are high, the floors in the rooms are terrazzo with no rugs (very cold) and the walls have no pictures, only scones. The bathrooms are fine, not elegant, just adequate. Get used to a vinyl tub/shower combination unit. Even though our room looked out on the back alley, it was still nice to throw open the shutters and see the sun and hear the church bells right next door.

Hotel is a beautifully restored monastery with lots of original features and a lovely atmosphere. Hotel is ideally situated close to the bus and train stations. Buses from the airport cost 5 euros each way and run every 20 mins. You could also get a water bus or water taxi which are more expensive. Hotel is down a very narrow street about 7 mins walk from the bus station right by the Scalzi Bridge and vaporetto stops. We had booked a superior room which was on the second floor overlooking the garden. There are no lifts but our bag was brought to the room. Room had a kingsize bed, good lighting, desk with flatscreen TV, minibar and double wardrobe. There were no drawers but space in the wardrobe for underwear etc. Bathroom was small with shower attachment over the bath but no curtain. Both rooms were warm and spotlessly clean. There was a bar/sitting room with comfortable seating which was very peaceful. There was not an extensive wine list, the house red and white were 19 euros a bottle, they were drinkable but not great. They also provided complimentary crisps, nuts etc. Yes we were woken at 7.15am by the church bells but it didn't bother us and we were then able to snooze until 8.15 when they were rung again! Breakfast buffet was good with the usual cold meats and cheese, rolls, cereal, yoghurt, fruit and wonderful croissants and pastries which were freshly cooked. Matteo at reception was very helpful in recommending good local restaurants, I would certainly suggest if you are going to Venice for the first time that you do some research before you go as there are nearly 800 restaurants in Venice and many of them are overpriced and aimed at ripping off the tourist. I would recommend Osteria Al Vecio Pozzo (reviewed separately) which did amazing pizzas and was full of locals. St Marks's Square was amazing, especially in the sun, but be prepared for crowds and hugely expensive cafes - we paid 20 euros for a coffee and a sprite (some charge you to listen to the music too!) but it was worth it to experience the atmosphere. Despite the crowds, graffiti and tacky tourist areas, Venice is one of the most photogenic places I have ever been to, you just need to be prepared to wander and get lost in order to see the real Venice in all its beauty.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts, United States", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Missy C", "ReviewID": "UR128024342", "Content": "Very nice hotel with a great lobby area.

It is close to the bus and train terminal and a short walk away from the water taxis on the Grand Canal. This hotel is a converted monastery and has the features to prove it, right down to the pulpit in the lounge. It has a lovely outdoor area for warmer days, which did not apply for our visit! We were welcomed in a friendly manner by the reception staff and that was maintained throughout our three day stay. The room was clean and well equipped, apart from the lack of a mirror in the bedroom, which caused some delay in preparations when starting the day or going out. The bed was large and comfortable. Breakfast at the hotel was what you would expect from a continental hotel - a selection of cereals, cold meat and cheese, croissants etc, but there was not a great variety of any of these. OK if you're not too fussy! Also there is no hot water machine so if you like your tea or coffee hot, you will not be too happy. Coffee is served from a jug and hot water from an individual jug, which soon gets cold. If you're going to Venice be sure to go there with a good bank balance. We have never been ripped off so much on our travels. We found it impossible to find a good restaurant and prices were topped up in all sorts of ways, service charges, charges for vegetables (portion sizes unbelievably small!). If you get a snack near to S. Marco - BEWARE! - drinks prices are astronomical! Having said that Venice is one of those must visit places. St Mark's, the Grand Canal etc have to be seen. The trouble is that thousands of others want to see it at the same time so crowds are the norm. TIPS - get a pass on the water buses for as long as you're staying and prepay for the Doge's Palace (then you can walk past the queue to the entrance).", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Sunworshiper10", "ReviewID": "UR127754424", "Content": "Hotel very easy to get to from bus station.

Very convenient, Vaporetto stop right across. Can also walk to San Marco (kind of long but interesting). We had a small baby and thought it will be easier to stay near the train station rather than drag all our suitcases and the baby all over town. You basically get out of the train station, make a U-turn into the first small alley, and it's right there. The entrance is hard to spot as it is hidden - just look right across from the Chinese restaurant. The only problem is the smell permeating the hotel - they have those plug-in things throughout the hallways and in the rooms. I unplugged mine. The heat was also turned on even though it was not that cold outside. It was impossible to change the temperature from inside the room. I had to open the windows, but then it gets loud in the morning, and I did not feel comfy leaving the window open when we're not there. The shower also was small and had nothing to hold the soap. Kind of awkward to have to bend and put the shampoo on the floor. Kept knocking the faucet handle and changing the water temperature accidentally while doing that. I found a four-star hotel next door that agreed to offer us the same price, but reviews on tripadvisor indicated they also have the same problem with the \"Venice smell\", so we decided to stay in Abbazia. For two nights, it was not bad. The location made up for the deficiencies. I did not have problems with the church bells. As long as the window is closed I hear nothing from outside. The problem is having to open the window due to the excessive heat.

We arrived at the Santa Lucia train station and were checking in the hotel five minutes later. It's location is beyond convenient! We were concerned that we might hear noise from the train station, but Hotel Abbazia is a quiet, serene spot in an otherwise crowded place in Venice. The hotel is also a great starting point for sightseeing in Venice; there is a major vaporetto stop a few minutes' walk from the hotel, and the hotel is located just off the major street that is filled with shops and restaurants. The rooms were in good condition, though a little run-down. Then again, everything in Venice is a little run-down. The only downside to our room was a curtain that had a torn loop and didn't hang properly and the headboard, which was covered in fabric, had little scratches and some threads hanging from it. This is what keeps us from ranking the hotel with five stars. However, the bathroom was fabulous! Nice tile, nice sink, nice tub, nice fixtures--and the bathroom was spacious. Also, the tub had jets. Considering the location and the fabulous bathroom, I wouldn't let some small tears in upholstery keep me from booking this hotel. The breakfast was average, certainly enough to tide you over until morning. As vegetarians, we had some delicious pastries and some fresh fruit and yogurt. People on a gluten-free diet will be happy to know that they have some gluten-free products available; we didn't try any, though. The staff was warm and welcoming. We were given invaluable tips for our time in Venice, and they always asked how we were doing and whether they could assist us with something. One other thing we enjoyed about the hotel was the quaint courtyard. It's filled with lush bushes and vines, and in a city that doesn't have many gardens, this was a welcome sight for us. We spent time just lounging on the comfortable wicker furniture.

We sayed here 3 nights in late Dec. We arrived on the train, and found the hotel to be just minutes from the train station. Thus said, it was tucked away on a quiet street so that it was very quiet and set apart from the ususal station hustle and bustle. The staff were fabulous--friendly and helpful in everything. They set us up for a free water taxi to Murano where we got a tour to a glass facotry. From there, they got us another taxi to Burano for lace! Really special! They recommended excellent and not touristy places to eat and were just a great resource for any info we needed. As said, the hotel is in a great location--minutes from either the train station or the bus that goes to and from the airport. You can also get the vaporetto (water bus) to any part of Venice from there as well. We are a family of 5 and so we had to have two rooms. The rooms were spacious and clean....one had a bath the other a shower. Each day they were perfectly cleaned up. The beds are typical European in that they are a little hard---but that is the way they are in Italy.The breakfast was a VERY complete European continental with a large variety of things to eat. I have seen MUCH worse in my travels! They had fresh donuts and corssaints, crostata, yoghurt, cereal, eggs and meat. In addition to having spacious rooms, they had a large common area with sofas and a bar for drinks. They had daily newspapers from around the world and was a great place to hang out. The value was excellent and we would definately stay there again.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cBest staff ever!!!\u201d", "Author": "FussyTraveler67", "ReviewID": "UR122275440", "Content": "The front desk staff are the most helpful staff ever. They will do anything for you - call to see if something is open, help you navigate via maps, answer e-mails before you arrive (they answered all of my questions promptly and efficiently). The place was an abbey (that is what Abbazia means) and the pulpit in the lounge provides great ambience. I had many requests regarding rooms and the staff managed to meet them all!!! We stayed there December 17 for 4 nights which is a slow time of year. They gave our family 2 rooms on the second floor (there are no elevators) that were both behind an outside door so we could shut that and get between our 2 rooms very efficiently. The rooms had burgundy silk walls - you felt like you were in Italy! We had a great tiled shower with doors - my one suggestion to the staff is to hang a shower basket from the door for guests to put soap and shampoo in (not a big deal but easier for use). The beds are nice and long but a bit hard - the way it seems Italians like their beds. The breakfast was wonderful with boiled eggs, juice, hot chocolate, various coffees, croissonts, buns, ham, meat, cheese, yogurt, cereal, toast, fruit - a full selection. Everything was tasty and good. The location was right around the corner from the train station and easy to wheel luggage between there and the hotel (they even tell you where to turn that avoids the steps). Coming from the airport we took the Aliguana boat because we thought a boat ride would be scenic but I recommend the land bus (I think it's the ACTV - if you e-mail them they will send you directions from the drop-off to the hotel which you need because it is easy to get lost in Venice). The bus is 5 euro a person and the Aliguana is 15 euro/person and the bus is quicker and picked up right outside the airport whereas you have to walk quite a way at the airport to catch the boats. It's a nice walk to St. Mark's (maybe 25 minutes, I'm a slow walker) past lots of shopping so it's fun to stop and look. I recommend going in the off-season because rates are cheaper and you can even bargain on a gondola ride for your family (I think we paid about 80 euro for a 50 minute ride for the 4 of us that went all around the grand canal, under the Rialto bridge and in side canals). The best is to bargain to 60 euro and tell them you will give him a good tip if you like the ride - he even sang and whistled). The weather was cool and we wore 2 layers of light jackets so we could take one off when it warmed up. We took the train for a day trip to Verona and it worked well . We took the local trains which stop more but are cheap - but know that you have to validate your ticket at a machine before getting on the train for the local/regional trains - or you can get a huge fine.

Cons: No elevator, bells ring for two minutes daily at 6:15am and 8:15am at next door church, no shower in room We took the train in from Rome and with 150lbs of luggage, it was nice to only have to go two streets from the station. Huge plus for us. Also only minutes from the the main vehicle lot, Piazza Roma, where a taxi or bus would bring you in from the airport or ship port. The service here was great. I cannot remember everyone's names at the front desk but they were all super. I appreciate that their name tags have flags on them to show what languages they speak. Which is great for incoming guests. The courtyard is beautiful with a mix of modern and vintage furniture. Unfortunately it was cold and rainy so we didnt use it. Breakfast was traditional Italian continental breakfast with no notable high or low points. The common area of the hotel is spacious, has tons of character, and seemed to be popular in the after-dinner hours. For reference, we stayed in room 312. Keeping in consideration that European hotel rooms are always small, our room fit a nice newer queen bed with frabic covered headboard, pin lighting, built-in storage, and a desk in the living space with a surprisingly spacious bathroom. We liked the fabric lined walls as well. The only negative of the whole hotel was that the bathroom did not have a shower. Just a tub with a faucet and sprayer on a hose. We like our showers so this was a bit out of our comfort zone.

One tip is when arriving by plane its easier to take the boat service to Guglie as its not far and have only one small bridge to cross ( with suitcases), If you arrive by bus, its a bit far to walk and you have to cross a very big bridge.

No, it's not on the canal and you have to walk down an alley to get there, but it was worth every step. I traveled with my husband and two grown children. We had two rooms towards the end of what they called the first (but I would call second) floor. The rooms were next to each other, but the doors did not open out to the hallway, rather they faced each other in a small alcove off the hallway. Both rooms were spacious (especially by Italy standards) and the bathrooms were also a good size. The hotel was once a monastery and it still had that Old World feel to it. The floors and woodwork were beautiful. It also had an unusual feature for Italy - screens on the windows! The screen were like shades that could be pulled down if the windows were open - and the weather was nice enough to keep the windows open at night! After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, I thought the bells might be annoying - but they were not as loud as I had expected them to be. In fact, the sound of the bells was the perfect alarm clock -almost like you hit the snooze button because they would toll every fifteen minutes from around 7 to 8 in the morning. This was fine because breakfast started at 7:30 and lasted until (I think) 11:30. What set this hotel apart was the service. The entire staff was friendly and helpful - from the front desk to housekeeping. All were willing to spend a few minutes talking with us and pointed us towards good, reasonable restaurants. What I liked most was that it felt like we were in a more residential spot than a tourist spot. It's location was around the corner from the train station, at the Ferrovia vaporetto stop. which was quite convenient. Breakfast (included in the cost of our room) had a good variety of food (the fruit was excellent) and we ate in the courtyard everyday. Internet was free. The only complaint I had was that the beds were hard - but I found that to be true in all the hotels I stayed in in Italy.

The staff were always extremely courteous and friendly, and their policy of letting you leave your bags post-check out (they have a nice \"luggage room\") is great. We actually sort of hung out in the lobby before catching our night train out of the city even though we'd officially checked out hours earlier, and no one gave us a hard time about it. The room itself was very cute, nice bathroom. The included breakfast has all the essentials and there's a great garden. Plus, free wifi can't be beat! A few cons, however: as we were warned about, the churchbells (at around 7:15 and 8:15 am) are amazingly annoying, and last longer than you'd think! At least a few minutes each of nonstop ringing. The other big issue we (and many other guests at the time) had was with air conditioning -- although our room (and all rooms, I imagine) have individual A/C units, it was basically glorified wall art that emitted vague puffs of cool air. If you were standing directly under it and stayed very very still you could feel the temperature drop a few degrees, but that was about it. While we were in Venice temps were in the 80s and it was very humid and unfortunately that made it pretty difficult to sleep at night. Even with the window open our room stayed quite stagnant. If A/C is a big priority I would probably not book Hotel Abbazia, especially if you're travelling in the hot summer months.

They try to overcome this by using a plug in airfreshener which I personally think just makes things worse. The furniture in the room is very old and needs changing/repairing. The mirror was cracked, the shower leaked and the wooden furniture was chipped in several places. Some of the ceramic tiles in the bathroom were cracked as well. The bed cover had an unpleasant stain. The bar area was beautfully decorated and the rooms probably were beautiful when the furniture was newer. We did not get a very good night's sleep as when I switched off the light the smoke alarm was flashing red lights in my face (batteries need changing?). Also, if you are a night owl, be prepared for the loud church bells to continuously disturb your slumber starting from around 7am. Breakfast offered a very poor selection. No hot food (except for warm boiled eggs) and no fresh italian cheeses. You are in luck, however if you like burnt croissants, cold meats and dry cake.

Fabio at Reception was magnificent - from giving directions to the hotel, to alloting us the rooms we wanted, to recomending restaurants that were superb. Thanks, Fabio. This hotel was earlier an Abbey, so quite an experience to stay. Lovely central coutyard with sit-out. Great breakfasts daily. Free internet. Morning church bells and the aroma of freshly-baked cakes & cookies for breakfast were the best morning alarm. Our double room on the ground floor was VERY small but our triple room was nice and airy. Some of the rooms on the first and second floors are more spacious. No lifts and no airconditioning till summer, but the outside temperatures cooled the room adequately. Just outside the hotel lane is the main Vaporetti station for the boats to all the attractions, San Marco, Rialto Bridge, etc. Day-pass is best option to take.

All my e-mails were answered quickly and thoroughly by the manager, Alvise. I loved this hotel! If I return to Venice I will definitely stay here again. Arrival at Marco Polo airport - purchase a ticket on the ATVO airport bus for 3 Euro. The bus will leave you off at Piazzale Roma - the main bus terminus. Then it is just a short walk across the bridge over the Grand Canal, past the train station, and make a left down a narrow passageway, and the hotel is on the left. Don't drag a lot of luggage with you anywhere in Venice. You really don't need that much \"stuff.\" The hotel is a former monastery. I had a single room which was quite roomy. The church bells were a great way to start the day. Several previous reviews complained about the church bells. You are in Italy - you are going to hear church bells. Besides, do you really want to sleep in while in Venice? Nice bathroom with fluffy white towels that were changed daily. Plenty of hot water. The room and the bathroom were extremely clean. Breakfast - magnificent! Lots of meats, cheeses, fresh fruit, breads. And, oh my goodness - the pastries! Several times I was able to have one of the chocolate croissants that just got out of the oven. I am still dreaming about the pastries. The front desk staff was professional, extremely helpful and full of good advice and information. Their professionalism was greatly appreciated. There are 2 laptops to use to check your e-mail, etc. (No printer.) Because I am a budget traveler, I filled up at breakfast and was good to go for most of the day. The front desk recommended a restaurant called BREK. This restaurant is cafeteria style and the food was very good. Go out to the main street, make a left, and then it is just a short walk and the restaurant is on the left. The front part of the restaurant has sandwiches and drinks. Go a little further back and you will find hot meals, salads, a good wine selection and desserts. I was able to purchase a bowl of spaghetti, a huge salad and a small bottle of white wine for 11.40 Euro. The food was excellent. If you are going to use the vaporetto, check into buying a ticket for several days. It is much cheaper than 1 single ticket. I took the vaporetto to Murano and spent a short time there. But the real treat is to take the vaporetto to Burano. Brightly colored houses - pinks, yellows, blues, greens, etc. - with laundry hanging from the windows. You cannot take a bad photo on Burano. And don't forget to have gelato. Plenty of gelato places within a short distance of the hotel. You will do plenty of walking to burn off those calories.

We took the bus from the airport into Piazalle Roma. The rain was pouring hard and we were so glad we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to walk very far to get to the hotel. We crossed the Ponte di Calatrava bridge (modern-looking glass bridge), passed the train station and made a left on a little alley street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all in about 5 minutes.

We also walked from St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square to the hotel one night which took about 45 minutes with some window shopping and stopping at a grocery store. The hotel is very rustic with a lot of old world charm. The standard room we had was quite small with a window looking out into their garden and the church. The church bells were our alarm clock in the morning and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us. After all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not every day you get to wake up to church bells while sleeping in an old monastery in Venice. The room was very simple with a desk and a closet for hanging things. There really was not enough room to for storage and it was a bit challenging with only two carry-ons. The bathroom was pretty big with terra cotta colored tiles everywhere and a decent size bath tub. The room and bathroom were kept clean. Free-wifi was available but they also had two laptops we were able to borrow provided you stayed in the lounge. There were plenty of comfortable couches for lounging and a bar in the lounge/sitting area (even had a raised pulpit).

Most of the water buses stop near the Ponte. The hotel is a former convent, which has been extensively refurbished recently.

But unlike most station areas this is as good as the heart of Venice. A beautiful old building that once was an Abbey and still retains the 'quiet aura' with buckets of charm and style. This can also be said of the wonderful staff [especially Merko] who all speak excellent english and have a good sense of humour to lift the mood of any weary traveller. The food range at breakfast was excellent apart from cold coffee from a machine. In January, this was the only meal served at the hotel but it gives the opportunity to try any of the many hundreds of restaurants nearby. Beware of the ones adjacent to the Grand Canal which are a bit of a rip off. Expensive, minimum of half bottles of wine and with added cover change even in a quiet season. Anyone with a love of old towns full of history will not be bothered by the daily chime of nearby bells in the morning. It's all part of the character and something more to remember it by. The water bus is 2 minutes walk and costs 6.50 euros to travel the whole length of the canal to San Marco. It is only a half hour walk back via the Rialto Bridge and without getting lost. Don't use the water taxis unless you have won the lottery. Will definitely stay at Hotel Abbazia every time we visit Venice.

There was plenty to choose from at breakfast, such as fruit, toast, croissants, cereal, rolls with cheese and ham, cakes, coffee machine ect. In the evening we went to the bar and had drinks before we went out, the barman was really friendly and very generous with the drinks, and he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even charge me for my baileys. Drinks by the bar were cheaper than I thought it would be. The bar area had sofas and tables and it was always busy in there. We often came back from our meal and had drinks in this area, although the bar shuts quite early, think it was 11pm.

To get from marco polo airport use bus only 3 euros each or for a real treat take a private water taxi which cost us 130 euros between us but was absolutely amazing. Once out of the centre of Venice it was like being on a speed boat very exciting felt like we were in james bond movie, fantastic way to get back to the airport. Oh and about the bells yes they are loud and they go on for what seems like ages at 7 oclock in the morning however it all added to the character of the hotel. The first morning was a shock and then after that you just get used to them and don't notice them so much so please do not let this put you off.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elwood, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cWONDERFUL!!

The staff, each and every one, was truly outstanding and helped to make our stay quite pleasant. A couple of things that we haven't noticed in prior reviews that may be helpful. When walking from the bus station, there are folks that will help you with your luggage across the glass bridge. Rates vary, so ask first! 2 Euros seems to be an appropriate amount per bag. Others have mentioned that the hotel is quite close to the bridge, and it is, kinda. With heavy suitcases, it seems farther so any energy saved crossing the bridge might be helpful for dragging the luggage the last 500 meters! When leaving the hotel, if your luggage has gained weight, there is a service that we haven't seen mentioned. The front desk wil arrange to have your luggage picked-up at the hotel. You follow the gentleman to the left side of the train station where a taxi will be waiting to take you directly to the airport. It costs 60 Euros but we felt it was worth it. The gentleman pulling the cart clears a nice pass through the crowds and it certainly saves a lot of time and aggrevation!

When travelling from Marco Polo airport, the quickest and cheapest way to travel is by bus. When you walk out of the airport the buses are straight in front of the door and if you get a ATVO blue bus to Venice it takes about 20 mins and costs 3 euros each. From the bus station cross over the glass bridge in the direction of the train station and the hotel is down a narrow street past the station 2/3 minutes away.( look for the yellow wall ). The water bus is the best and cheapest way of travelling around but if you are staying more than one day get a 48 or 72 hour pass. It costs 6.5 euros each for each single trip on the water bus so costs can easily mount up. We got a 72 hour pass and hopped on and off the bus as many times a we needed and was much more cost effective.

The front desk were very friendly and responded very promptly by email.. It was a great hotel in a really good location ( we thought the best having walked around a great deal during our stay) set back off the main street, so nice and quiet but with lots of resturants,snack bars,minifood stores and shops ,in fact everything you needed was right there and great start off point for anywhere in Venice, with the boat service right nearby.As with all hotels you have to do some walking with your case so be prepared for steps over the main bridge but its much nearer than most or if you want to avoid any steps theres the public boat bus which stops right at the end of the small ally leading to the hotel. Its a restored abbey and has loads of character and original features but everywhere is kept spotlessly clean and it is very pleasant to walk through the hotel corridors to your room and dining area. There is also a pleasant inner garden where you can enjoy a relax or take breakfast in the morning.Generally after spending all day walking around Venice, which can be very tiring, it was always a joy to enter the hotel and to be attended by the excellent staff on the front desk, friendly and with a comical sense of humour. All other staff such as cleaners and porters were also friendly and polite giving a very relaxed atmosphere. I must mention Alvise the hotel manager, Mateo,Fabio and Mirko all did a great job to make you enjoy your stay and they will always offer you a porter to carry your bags. The room over the garden (208 ) was small but had a fabulous modern bathroom with mosaic tiles and double shower .The room & linen were spotlessly clean and very tidy , great job by the room service! Breakfast was from 7.30 to 11am which was great no rush ! very good with ample selection of hams,cheeses, boiled eggs, pasteries,fresh fruit, cereals,fresh orange to drink with coffees and hot chocolate.Although from a machine the cappochino was excellent and there was plenty of jams, toast, bread rolls etc and yogurts! The dining room staff were always on hand if you needed assistance and everything was kept topped up ,if not you just asked and they sorted it for you.The tables were cleaned ready for the next guest and you could eat in the dining room or take out to the garden after 9am, if you wished.Other reviews have mentioned the church bell which rings out loudly at 7.30 am and again at 8.30 am( or there abouts) but it only rings for about a minute and we found it a great alarm call and the second chime acted as a snooze ! We quite liked the bell, no problem , just seemed to go with the hotel ! We had a fabulous time in Venice but would personally recommend at least 4/5 nights to explore the city well, visiting outer areas and not just the main sights, some of the best sights were seen at night walking around over the narrow bridges under archways with all the shades and lights and glittering water - fantastic! So dont just visit Venice as a day trip! We went to Lake Garda for a 5 day stay but were disappointed with the Hotel and the area did not appeal to us as Venice did, although very beautiful to drive around and see the lovely towns etc. So we decided to check out and return to Venice and called the Abbazia who did everything they could to accomodate us again. We did one night in Verona ( which was amazing ) and back to Abbazia to be greeted as happy returning guests! the room was older in style as it was all they had at short notice, however upon request they went out of their way to prepare another room for the remaineder of our stay in room 310 , a superb room our favourite of all - thanks guys! The room was again spotlessly clean overlooking the garden and the bell and with all the great breakfast to look forward to all over again !

On the other hand, although our room was supposed to be \"superior\", it wasn't superior to anything at all. I had made my reservation six months ago and had noted that this was our honeymoon vacation. However what i was given was the smallest of so called superior rooms; one of the rooms in the corner with no view, two single beds put together and getting apart all the time, a tv with a couple of channels, a standart wardrobe and a small bathroom with no bathtub. All of our three-star standart rooms we stayed during our honeymoon trip were better than this one; all had larger rooms, double beds, bathtubs, coaches, views, some even had balconies and some of the hotels had actually offered us free champagne. This room however was nothing like in the pictures; and when i told this to the reception i was shown a standart room which was actually the smallest and worst room i have seen in my life, almost impossible to breathe looking to a closed area with pipes, to convince us that our room was superior anyway. But later i discovered that, in fact we were given the worst room because other superior rooms were bigger, had extra furniture and nice views. I consider this to be dishonest and very unfair; because when i made the reservation months ago, all of the rooms were available and i even had contacted the hotel a month ago to reconfirm if our reservation was safe. What is the meaning of reservation if they're giving away rooms according to some unknown discriminative criteria and honoring our oldest-dated honeymoon reservation with the worst one left? Did they think that others would complain about it but we were such losers that we wouldn't notice it? I may still recommend the hotel hoping that others could get lucky enough to be cared and favored, unlike us. But i'm giving them the worst rate, the exact value they gave us.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThis was the perfect spot\u201d", "Author": "FP4BMO", "ReviewID": "UR73655499", "Content": "We have just returned from an extended Italian trip and this hotel was our first experience with Italian accomodation.

Upon our arrival on the ATVO Flyer, Hotel Abbazia was just a 10 minute walk to the hotel and very easy to find. One drawback was that we had to cross the bridge with heavy luggage, but we managed. We could have taken a vaporetto (for around 6 euros each), but opted to manage it ourselves. It's baffling that whoever was the architect of this bridge did not keep in mind weary travelers dragging luggage over those steps! Oh well! The hotel has a gorgeous reception area, and the hotel personnel were so welcoming and helpful to us. We arrived on a VERY warm July day, and felt that the AC wasn't cooling the room as much as we'd like (we're from Texas...what can I say!) but it did get better and was not a huge issue. The breakfast was wonderful and you could eat either in the dining area or outside in a nice courtyard. Many reviewers mentioned the bells as a bother, They were literally outside of our window, but I loved them (and I was up anyway!) After our cruise, Hotel Abbazia allowed us to store some luggage while we traveled to Florence and the Tuscanny area. We came back to Hotel Abbazia for one last night before departing for the states, and to our surprise (and without asking) we were upgraded to a junior suite that was fabulous! The vaporetto stop was a few minutes from the hotel and we were in the heart of Venice (St. Mark's, Rialto) in a short time. We walked to the Rialto area in around 20 minutes, and that was with a lot of stopping to window shop! I believe this hotel was a great value, was in a safe location, and would definitely stay there again, even if we weren't going on a cruise!", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorks", "Title": "\u201clovely location, fantastic staff\u201d", "Author": "Holidaymaker183", "ReviewID": "UR73224327", "Content": "We stayed for a three night break in july.

This hotel bills itself as a 3 star property but in our opinion, it's definitely more like a 4 star hotel. First things first...location! This place is located just a few moments from the bus terminal and train station. However, it has none of the negative connotations of being close to that type of place. You dont even know it's there. Location is super important because theres no motorized transport in Venice, so lugging around bags over cobble stone streets and on water busses is an inconvenience, especially if your hotel is 30 mins away from the bus/train station. But it wont be a problem for you if you stay here! Also, it was the little things that made this stay great. The helpful front desk, the charming outdoor space next to the dining room, and the complimentary laptops they offer guests to use if they didn't bring their own laptop. Oh yeah, the free breakfast was nice too. I should also mention that while the outside of the hotel is nothing out of the ordinary, the inside is majestic and interesting. From what I understand it was an old monastery that was converted to private use. Check out the bar area next to the lobby. There's a pulpit up by the wall. Pretty cool. As for the rooms, they were decent and pretty well decorated but nothing special. Ours faced the inner courtyard which was relaxing and lovely (except for the 7:20am church bell ringing 100 times - not even kidding). I should also point out that the rooms were flawed in a few ways. First, the showers were a bit on the crappy side. There was no fixed shower-head, just a detachable one with a long hose and a holder on the wall. However, the holder was affixed about 2 feet off the floor, so you couldnt stand under the stream of water without holding it up. Made for an interesting shower process. Also, no mirrors in the room aside from the bathroom one. And finally, minimal storage space for our stuff. In the end, I highly recommend this place. Check it out for sure if you are going to Venice! Pros - Good value, clean, comfortable property, free breakfast, great location, fast wireless internet (also free), complimentary laptops to use, very cool inner courtyard to chill out in. Cons - Basic, though tastefully decorated rooms, awkward showers, no mirrors in the room, poorly stocked minibar, the morning church bells are ridiculously loud and go off at 7:20am on the dot every day.

We had private tour of the of factory and a staff member there who was knowledgable beyond compare. The location is outstanding.

One of receptionist also allowed me to settle the payment on the night before departure eventhough it was already past the scheduled time for early payment. Please note, the location is great, in my opinion. Because it is really convenient for the railway station and piazzale roma (the bus station). I prefer this location to allow me zero hussle for early morning departure to airport (<10mins walk to bus station and 20 mins journey time by bus). However, it is not that convenient for tourists who aim for attractions in san marco area and surroundings. You will need to walk more or less 30 minutes or take unbelievably expensive water bus. And the other thing, the hotel is providing free wifi. However, I cant connect it with my handset. Fortunately, they have 2 units of laptops that you can use only in lobby area. It is a plus for me, because the lobby itself is really comfortable. Please don't expect a first class breakfast.

Breakfast is fantastic with a great choice with the usual ham, cheese, rolls, coisannts, pastries, etc. One thing I will point out, which has got nothing to do with the hotel, is that Venice is INCREDIBLY expensive. We thought it would be expensive, but not on the level of paying euro 6.50 for one small beer(!) . We only discovered on our last day that if you stand at the bar and drink, it is a lot cheaper than sitting down outside! The food is also extremaly expensive in restaurants and not that great either, unless you know where to go to eat. Fortunately, my sister knows Venice well and was there during our stay. She took us to a fantastic pizza restaurant where all the locals go to eat, although I don't think we would ever find it again on our own! Its a shame that Venice has become so pricey (apparently and sadly only one third of Venetians are now living in Venice, the rest are holiday apartments). Its unnecessary and spoils it due to prices. All in all I strongly recommend this hotel as great value and particuarly well located.

The staff did take our luggage for us, but even so, that poor guy had to take 4 gigantic bags up and down 4 flights of stairs. We had a deluxe room which was big, however, the windows opened up to a dumpster and I'd rather have a small room with a bed that is somewhat sturdy. We were up all night listening to dogs barking in the alley that our room overlooked. The restaurant that was recommended by the staff was horrible!

Plenty of choice and always a table and the staff were again most friendly and helpful. As for Venice itself. A lovely city which is much more compact that you first think. It is so quick and easy to walk everywhere. The Vaporetto is also a quick and reasonably cheap way of exploring the city. We would recommend the restaurants on Campo Santa Magherita and also the irish bar on this square where drinks were reasonably priced. We would also recommend the irish bar further up the street from the hotel (Lista de Spagna).

I had breakfast in that garden every morning. The hotel has free wireless high speed internet. The hotel is around the corner from the train station and right next to the water bus stop, which will take you anywhere in Venice, so the location is very convinient. Also, I loved the neigborhood - one block to the side of the tourist path and you're in a one of the quaintest and most authentic places in Venice. The staff is very helpful and fun. The breakfast was not the greatest - two varieties of cold cuts, one kind of cheese, some fruit, yogurts, cereal and breads, but no vegetables or prepared food. There's no restaurant in the hotel, so if you get hungry in the evening you can't order food to your room. The bilding is a walk up - just like all others in Venice, but the staff carries your luggage up and down, so as long as you can carry yourself up the stairs it shouldn't be a problem. Another flaw is the bells from the monastery right next to the hotel. They ring those bells for several minutes around 7 am every morning and they were heard loudly in my room (I kept my windows open). There was one night when I was so tired that they didn't wake me up, but on all other nights they did. I had no problem falling back to sleep right away though. If you're sensitive to noises and have a hard time falling back asleep, this might be a problem for you. Overall - great stay, tons of fun and wonderful memories. Will stay here again if I'm ever in Venice - can't beat the location, the garden, the fun Italians at the reception and the great rooms. On a side note - they have one room, which is very small, with a single bed and a small window facing the street. The bells are not heard as much there, but you can hear voices on the street with the window open. I negotiated to stay there for 50 euros/night for two nights when I extended my stay. Compared to 180 euros/night this is an amazing deal! People pay a little less to stay in hostels and here you have your own room and all the services of a great hotel for just 50/night.

We stayed at the Hotel two years ago, and thought it met our budget needs when we were paying for two nights for a group of 5. This time my wife and I stayed here one night before boarding a cruise. We stayed in a Standard Room, which is very simple, clean and functional. We spent most of our time out of the hotel, sightseeing. Showers are very tight and snug-- there is not a lot of room to move around without accidentally popping open the shower door. There is no elevator, but hotel staff will bring your bags up and down the stairs for you. We stored our bags with the hotel while we went to Murano, but asked them to keep our bags in the front office instead of the luggage room. Breakfast is included and is a self serve buffet-- hard boiled eggs, croissants, cheese, salami, cold cuts, prosciutto, coffee, orange juice. We took the hotel's free shuttle to Murano to a glassmaking company called CAM-- it was truly free with no obligation to buy anything. [I'm a believer that there are no free lunches, so they must recover the cost some other way.] We were treated to a personalized tour with a glassmaking demonstration. Much of the Murano glass they produce is art. Many glassmakers are on holiday in August, but CAM has a glassmaker who does demonstrations for tourists visiting the factory. Afterwards, we were on our own to walk through Murano and shop in different stores. We hopped on the waterbus to get back to the hotel. A few tips on arriving and leaving....We arrived in Venice via Marco Polo airport. The first and more expensive way is to get here is via private water taxi-- 95 euros, which is pricey by current exchange rates, but worth the splurge if you are arriving here at sunset and want to take in the views. The other way to get here is to take a land taxi at the airport to Piazzale Roma, and hop the waterbus at Piazzale Roma one stop to the Ferrovia stop. It's about 35 euros for the land taxi, plus the cost of a waterbus ticket, which you'll likely buy anyway, to ride up and down the Grand Canal. The other way is via water bus from the airport, which we haven't tried. Venice is one of our favorite places to visit, and we would come again to visit. We would also consider this hotel again. The hotel is close to the train station, and when we were here the first time, Venice was our first stop before we traveled via train to Florence. You can easily roll your bags from the hotel to the train station. To get to the cruise terminal, we took the waterbus one stop from the Ferrovia stop to Piazzale Roma, then caught a land taxi to the cruise ship terminal. The land taxi cost us 9 euros to get to the cruise terminal.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best choices in Venice\u201d", "Author": "MyWave68", "ReviewID": "UR39391051", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Abbazia in March of this year, but I am just now getting around to writing the review. This hotel had everything we were looking for, and I couldnt have been happier or more satisfied with our stay there. First of all, whether you take the train in or fly in, the hotel is very easy and accessible. It is literally just steps from the train station, and when taking the shuttle from the airport, you simply have to cross the bridge over the canal, go past the train station, and its the first street on the left. I say street, but its actually just a walkway, as is all \"streets\" in Venice. You will walk right past the street if you are not careful, so just remember when you pass the train station, take the first left you come to (right past the little restaurant). There is also water taxi access right there as well. The hotel itself is very nice, and was originally a friars convent and church. Very old world and romantic, not modern at all. But exactly what you would picture in a Venice hotel. We were traveling with my girlfriend and my two teenage children, and were very happy to find out we could get a quadruple room, with a kingsize bed and two single beds. If you have ever traveled in Europe, you know this isnt easy to come by. There was a slightly odd combination in our room of completely old world feel to the room but a completely modern looking bathroom, but once again, it was perfect for us. The hotel had a wonderful staff, the people at the front desk were very friendly and accommodating, and in the evening they opened the bar area, the bartender was very neat and precise, and it was a nice gathering area for people who werent quite ready for bed in the evening, even after walking all over Venice during the day! They also offered a basic continental breakfast every day, which was nothing special, but was nice to be included in the cost. And finally, the hotel was very reasonably priced, I cant remember exactly but I am thinking we only paid like $300 US for a two night stay.

Our room very very small, but fine for us. Our bathroom was actually pretty large, with a huge shower that had two very large shower heads in a long rectanuglar shape. Two people could comfortably shower at the same time. We inquired about taking a vaporetto to Murano and the staff offered a free water taxi and tour of a glass factory with no strings attached. That was a pleasant surprise. The location was good. We were pretty far from the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, but we had no problem walking there. It was fun exploring the back alleyways, which were much more quiet than the main routes. There were also two really nice restaurants that we ate in not that far from our hotel.

We were spending 3 weeks in Europe and these were our last nights in Italy. Out of every place we stayed, this was my absolute favorite hotel. We chose to splurge a bit here and had more bargain types the rest of the trip with the exception of our hotel in Spoleto. We arrived late on a very rainy night and it was a great relief to just go down the steps from the train station and make a very short and easy walk to the Abbazia. I failed to get the name of the gentleman who checked us in, but he was very friendly. Our room was large, lovely and overlooking the courtyard (Double Superior-no smoking). A king bed and big bathroom too. There was no shower curtain (like I found everywhere in Italy this made showering without flooding the bathroom a challenge, luckily we had perfected that by then) :) Despite being very near the train station and water taxi station, it was very quiet. The only disturbance, which I found made our stay even more enjoyable, was the church bells. From what I remember they rang around 7:15am and I stopped counting the number of tolls. On Saturday they rang every hour after around 7am up 'til ???. We could see the bell tower from our bedroom windows. Loved it! Breakfast, buffet style, was nice and a sufficient way to start the day. Nothing extensive. Set up was in a dining area and the garden seating would have been great in warmer weather. The large seating room upon entering the hotel is very nice with a bar. Great place to relax before catching the train or meet up in. There is a good size \"closet\" for luggage storage if needed. Seeing the monastery past in the surroundings added great ambiance. The location was great. Venice is easy to get lost in, but since the hotel is so very near the train station (Ferrovia) following those yellow signs could get you back. It is also on a \"main\" directional strip that you can follow signs to favorite sites....again, though, getting lost or not being able to find what you are looking for is easy!

Overall, we rate it the best-value hotel we have ever stayed at. Believe everything you read from the other reviews. Its location is great - Marco Polo Airport, via shuttle bus and vaporetto, to door is about 40 minutes. About 6 mins walk from Piazzale Roma and 3 minutes walk from Santa Lucia railway station (look for the little alley way opposite the Scalzi Bridge - then 100m on the left). The very slight downside is that any ventures off to the touristy bits involve some time planning. The Abbazia's proximity to the Railway station means there are plenty of good-value trattorias/pizzerias within close walking distance, as are shops of all kinds. Despite its location, it remains quiet all times. The hotel used to be part of an old monastery, so the layout, style of decor and general atmosphere is one of quiet, understated charm - lots of beautiful dark wood panelling and cool marble. The pictures on the hotel website tell the truth. Our room was a standard double. It was smaller than some might be used to, but very tastefully refurbished and scrupulously clean (as indeed was the whole hotel). The bed was very comfortable and the room had a very reasonably priced mini-bar and a personal safe. The only down-side was the limited storage space which meant partly living out of our suitcases (not many people are likely to spend more than a few days in Venice anyway). The en-suite was lovely with a double shower! The breakfast room was well-run and the freshly-baked rolls kept on coming! Standard European breakfast food/drinks were on offer - all very tasty - and a healthy appetite could be served if necessary. The garden was a delight to use for breakfast but they like you to stay indoors until at least 8.30am, presumably to give some consideration to the late sleepers that overlook the garden. The biggest plus for us was the friendliness and the welcome offered by all the staff, particularly the gentlemen at Front of House. They all spoke excellent English which reduced my meagre Italian to an irrelevant embarrassment! Marko was only too willing to spend time booking a Pallazo Ducale visit for us, and Matteo offered the use of a PC in the back office to do my online check-in for our return flight. Nothing was too much trouble.

The entrance hall and the receptionist were very welcoming. Check in straight forward, room on ground floor so cannot comment on issues of lack of lift. Room 106 was a lovely room with a lovely shower (also with a bidet!) Only gripe really was the lack of coffee/tea making facilities. Although we didn't use the mini-bar the prices looked very reasonable. Other reviews will make negative comments about the bells from the nearby church tower. We quite liked them.

We stumbled upon Rialto Bridge, and did make an effort to find St Marks Square, but discovered so many other little nooks and crannies that we would never have found if we were relying on a map. A highlight was probably the best ice cream shop in Italy (close to Rialto Bridge as you walk towards it from the station side of the Island....sorry can't give you much more than that) There are plenty of little resturants around the hotel but I would advise looking for somewhere away from the main tourist routes. The prices drop and the service is far better. We noted a place that seemed popular with the locals at lunchtime near Tres Archi (about 15 mins from the hotel) and went back there in the evening. I think it was called Pizzaria Tres Archi. It lived up to expectation and had a great meal on the side of the canal as the sun set. Breakfast in the hotel was a nice start to the day (other people have mentioned the bells - it took getting used to but it prepared us for Tuscany where every village seems to ring bells early in the morning). Good Italian coffee with loads of pain au chocolat, bagels, and spreads, along with youghurts, cereals and fruit (probably tinned though). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and definitely plan a trip back next summer.", "Date": "September 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cayman Islands", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, great location!\u201d", "Author": "TravelCaymanIslands", "ReviewID": "UR19888622", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for three nights while on our honeymoon in Venice.

Since we were arriving by train, it seemed logical for us to look for a property close to the train station or at least accessible without much difficulty from the station.

We decided that Venice would be a unique experience so we should do it properly. Continuing this theme, we then settled on the Abbazia as being a former abbey, it would have some additional character which would add to our Venice experience. The hotel is indeed like it is presented on the web. Church bells sound in the morning, 120 times I think we counted at 0715 and 0815 when we were there. It is very handy for both the train station and the vaporetti (waterbus) stop which are no more than 5 minutes walk away. Whilst there must some merit in staying more central, the downside to that would appear to be that you have to transport your luggage with you. Once we realised the logistics of moving around Venice i.e boat/walk, we were delighted therefore with the convenience of the Abbazia to the station. Within a few minutes walk is a good selection of tourist shops and restaurants. We had a superior triple room which was on the second floor. No lift, but the receptionist arranged for the porter to carry our luggage up. Good size room, high ceiling with what appeared to be some original beams and what looked like a loft area. Perhaps because of the size of the room with the high ceiling and loft area the air conditioning was not great. Breakfast was disappointing. Did not seem to be any waiters per se, more kitchen staff who when they spotted you would stop what they were doing to see if you wanted coffee. First morning was reasonable although had quite a wait to get a glass for some orange juice. The second morning we were slightly later in coming down (not late, just after 9) but must have been just after the rush. Tables mainly emply but none cleared and no staff about. We had to clear a table ourselves and find clean plates etc from neighbouring tables. Not much on offer other than some burnt croissants ! Only bad breakfast in our whole 2 week trip to Italy. The other disappointment was that the bar was closed when we were there. The bar itself is one of the highlights of the hotel and it would have been a lovely way to finish the day off with a quiet drink in such a unique setting. Receptionist explained that barman had had an accident but was okay. However, bar would be closed for the whole week and it was not possible to serve drinks.

Before we even arrived in Venice I was impressed by the hotel - I booked a standard room directly online with the hotel, but changed my mind a few weeks before I was due to arrive so asked to be upgraded to a superior room. The staff were lovely and quick to respond by email confirming our request. I stayed in this converted abbey with my boyfriend from the 7th of August for 4 nights. We arrived in Venice from Treviso airport by bus and were dropped at the Piazalle Roma (bus station). I won't lie - we did have a bit of trouble finding the hotel and with our suitcases, burning sun, mass of people and bridges it was not pretty! If you head towards the S.Lucia Railway station, the hotel is down a small alley directly across from the Ponte Degli Scalzi (which is a lovely bridge, on the same side as the train station). There is a sign on the right hand side of the alley wall \"Hotel Abbazia\" and an arrow. But Invest in a good guide book with map! Some may be put off my the hotel being down an alley way but I found no problems with this, even at night and never felt threatened. If you are arriving by train or travelling on by train this hotel is perfect as it is directly next to the train station - some have said that this is a dodgy area at night, but we never saw anything to make us feel uneasy. The minute you enter the hotel, you are captivated by its charm! When you walk down the alley way the hotel is about half way down on the left. The doorway is welcoming. After being greeted by the welcoming Fabio, we had to walk through the bar area / sitting area to get to the stairs to the room. Our room was 307 and as there was no lift we had to carry our cases up the 3 flights of stairs but was no problem. In all public areas you are reminded of the building's history - the pulpit in the bar area, tapestries and religious figures / paintings on the walls. On entering our room it was big and spacious, all in blue! There were 2 big windows that had typical Italian shutters that when opened looked out onto the garden. I have to point out that I had asked especially for a room high up, non smoking, with a view overlooking the garden - and all my requests were granted. The bathroom was big with lovely white tiles and a large mirror. The only down side was it was a bath with shower in it - you had to sit down in the bath and use the shower that way as there was no shower screen. But we were warned when booking that it was either bath OR shower. An added bonus with the room - a safe and minibar! Further adding to the charm were the church bells that went off at around 7.15am - a great wake up call! Breakfast was included in our deal and was served at the times of 7 to 11am. Available was tea / coffee / fruit juice, ham, cheese, youghurts, cereal, bread and croissants. A lovely continental breakfast! There is an inside seating area and an outside area - the outside was disappointing! It looked nothing like the pictuires on the website - the tables were covered in birds droppings and when we did eat outside we were so plagued by pigeons we had to eat inside! But if birds do not bother you then it won't be a problem. The hotel may seem far away from the main area of Piazza San Marco, but Venice is a very small city and we found we could walk all the way round from the hotel in 25 / 30 minutes.

The staff are great - very helpful indeed - happy to e-mail directions and answer queries before arrival and during stay. Unfortunately there is no lift, so luggage is a problem for arrival and departure if your room is 2 flights up. Breakfasts are fine - and cater for most tastes. The rooms are simple but classic given the history of the building. You shouldn't need an alarm clock for an early rise. There are 2 sets of bells to wake you - the first suggest you should get up and shower and the second peel for 130 counts mean you should be down for breakfast as it's around 8.30 and there's a busy day ahead. To get to the hotel we caught a bus from Marco Polo airport (3 euros each) which dropped us off at the bus station (only a short walk then to the hotel). The worse thing was that although it was only a few minutes' walk from the hotel, you have to lug suitcases over one low bridge but then a mighty beast of a bridge (about 80 steps) before you get to the ally where the hotel is situated. The Vaporetto stop (water bus) is a minutes' walk from the hotel and you can buy a 72 hour pass next door to the stop for 30 euros which entitles you to travel as much as you wish around the network, including glass blowers island of Murano which is a good trip for 1/2 day. Although you can walk across Venice quite easily in about an hour, it's easy to get a bit lost as it can be somewhat of a maze. A laminated street map \u00c2\u00a34.99 is a must. It's easy to walk 4 or 5 miles a day exploring the place - it's certainly a watery labyrinth - but it's good to jump on the water bus to save your legs every now and again. Train station was only a couple of minutes' walk away, which was so useful when we travelled on to Verona. There are steps up to the train station, but walking from the hotel, there is a side entrance to avoid carrying heavy luggage up steps. I think that either a ruck sack or small to medium case (wheeled type) is a good idea.

My husband and myself (and four other adults) stayed for one night on June 10th. Fabio, who worked the front desk when we checked in, was very kind and accommodating. Even though we arrived at the hotel in the morning and check-in wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until the afternoon, Fabio allowed us to stow our luggage in a separate room and even kept our laptop bag behind the desk. Our flight was very early the next morning and therefore we would not be able to have breakfast the next day. He let us eat breakfast the day of our arrival instead (at 10am). The coffee was very good. It was a lot like Turkish coffee\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstrong, grounds on bottom. The hotel has a beautiful courtyard in which to eat breakfast or relax with a book. My husband and I stayed in room 410. We loved walking into a thoroughly air-conditioned room after the heat of the Venice streets. The room was very clean and we slept well on a pretty decent mattress (king sized mattress really comprises of two twin mattresses put together). Room 410 is on the top floor (5 flights of stairs folks) and has a cathedral-like ceiling so the room seems bigger. The bathroom is modern and sleek and well lit. The room, however, is not well lit. The room has 3 small lamsp and one of the bedside lamps wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. A few things you should know: 1) There is NO elevator. You must be able to carry all your luggage to the room. 2) There is NO iron at this hotel. When we inquired why this was, we were told that most Venetian hotels do not have irons due to fire-safety rules. Only the 5 star hotels have this (or so the rumor goes). I highly recommend bringing Downy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wrinkle-releaser\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd spray (travel-size to get through security). 3) There is no soap or shampoo in the shower. However, there is liquid hand soap by the sink. Bring your own soap or use the liquid hand soap. 4) Our two windows had closed shutters and we were unable to open them because there was a screen between the window and the shutters. Therefore, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to see our view (probably of the courtyard) and the room remained dark. 5) Internet usage is 5 euros for a 24 hour period. 6) Breakfast was pretty good: It consisted of lemon curd filled croissants, rolls, sliced meats, sliced cheese, good European butter, nutella (chocolate-hazelnut spread), jam, coffee, milk, yogurt, various cereals, some fruit, orange juice, and another juice that tasted like V8 fruit juice. I think there were a couple other dry crackers/cakes pre-packaged and tea but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try them. 7) There is a busy shopping area about a block from the hotel (but not as busy as the Rialto Bridge/St. Mark's square area) full of restaurants, cafes, and shops. The hotel was very helpful in getting us to the airport. They called for us to have a steward pick up our luggage at the hotel and we followed him to a van where he drove us to the airport. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it is more than a 20 minute drive. We split this with another couple that the hotel helped us find and paid 40 Euros per couple. We heard the water taxi would have cost us 100 Euros, so the staff at the hotel helped save us some money. I think we would stay here again. The other hotels in the same area with comparable ammenities were almost 100 euros more. It was clean, quiet, cool, and it had breakfast.

About a 4 hour trip but not at all uncomfortable. The Hotel Abazzia is tucked into an alley and is a converted monastery. We had a junior suite which was huge. The bathroom (for those who are into them) was VERY MODERN with jacuzzi. The front desk personel were beyond excellent! If you e-mail the hotel directly they will get back to you with accurate information within an hour or so. They really made our stay terriffic. The Grand Canal is right at the front door. The vaporettos stop regularly right in front and you can get anywhere in Venice from right there. There is a bridge over the canal right there also for easy access into other areas. Take advantage of the \"free\" water taxi to the island of Murano. It is free and a nice experience. You will buy some glass (which is why they offer it for free one way) so it is not a come on. Make a day out of going to Murano and then to sister island Burano (by vaporetto) for lace. Both islands are full of stores and restaurants spend an hour or two and then get the big ferry which takes you to St. Marks Square and the pigeons. You can take the vaporetto from st. marks back to your hotel. it takes about 30 minutes but you will stop at and see some amazing stations along the way. Also don't miss a trip to Lido Beach. It was really amazing to swim in the adriatic sea and the beach itself was really cool...and topless...get off the vaporetto and walk to the beach through all the upscale shops of Lido. Really and amazing place. Finally, back to Abbazia...the breakfast in the morning is good. some cold cuts, cheese, cereal, fresh baked muffins and breads and good coffee. there is a bar in the lobby which is very nice and a good place to just sit and veg. The casino is a short walk away....not las vegas...beware.....but all in all a good time. If you are flying out of Venice it is about a 10 minute walk to the main bus station. busses leave about every half hour...you need to buy a ticket for that bus in the bus station.

Breakfast: bread rolls, sweet-filled croissants, meats, cheese, jams/honey, fruit juices, fresh coffee, tea. Was ample to keep us full until lunchtime. We found that food came out in stages as there was only one waitress who was serving coffee/tea and clearing dishes whilst replenishing and setting out the food. Room: Standard room of a good size with good quality furnishings. The decor was all blue which made the room dull and dingey. TV offerings were dire - only one English speaking channel which was CNN - I know you don't go to Venice to watch TV but I do like to watch a decent news channel! Bathroom was a bit of a let down as shower was simply a mixer tap on the bath with no curtain or glass panel. However it was adequate when we had mastered the art of not getting the water all over the bathroom whilst washing!

Vaporetto stop within yards although we found most places to be walkable (San Marco about 45mins slow pace) - part the fun of Venice is to wander around the little streets investigating and exploring, something that would be missed by taking the vaporetto from A to B.

We arrived very hot and tired after 5 hours on a train from Switzerland - with no airconditioning due to some problem. As anyone who went to Europe this summer knows - it has been very hot. We were probably pretty grubby and miserable looking when we arrived - but the front desk was very welcoming and we were soon feeling a lot happier. The rooms were pleasant and had airconditioning - not the freezing variety we know and love in the USA but enough to provide welcome relief from the heat and humidity. The front desk were always very pleasant and helpful. Loved the hotel and it's ambiance. I really enjoyed the area - lots of nice little shops and away from the main tourist crowds. And getting to the tourist areas was easy with a Vaporetto stop nearby. The only bad thing - we were only there 2 days. I am trying to figure out how and when I can go back for a longer visit to really explore Venice. And yes I would choose the Abbazia again.

Make sure you check that you are offered a renovated room, ours was small, shabbily furnished, and had dirty carpet and walls. The bathroom was very basic and small, and there was a problem with the shower draining. We initially did not have a very good response to our complaints, being told that this was a standard room, and if we wanted better, we should have booked a superior or a suite, as these were rooms that had been more recently renovated. We were charged Euro 205, including child, for one night, then we were moved to a superior room, (at extra cost, no problem with that). This room was very spacious, more recently decorated, and cleaner, but the bath (this time no shower) had a similar problem with draining. Apart from these issues, there is a small pleasant garden area for breakfast (but you have to be lucky to get one of the few tables, otherwise it is a large indoors dining room), and a nice bar/lounge area to sit in. A nice touch was the communal bookshelf in the hall, where guests could borrow (or deposit) books. We were however disappointed with the attitude to standard rooms: we think that clean carpets and walls, unchipped furniture, and functioning bathrooms are mandatory in such an establishment, not reserved for the more expensive rooms.

Our bathroom did not have a shower and obviously running a bath takes longer, so this was a bit of a drag every morning, but all in all, just a minor inconvenience. Breakfast is about average by Italian standards. It includes ham and a selection of cheeses, and a range of breads and cereals. Prices in both the main bar and the room minibar are very reasonable, particularly when compared to elsewhere in Venice, which is very expensive, even by Italian standards. Most hotels only seem to want to rip you off with the price they charge for additional services, so this was a new and remarkable departure. I have only one complaint. The outdoor breakfast area is infested with scavenging pigeons and other birds, hopping about on recently vacated tables looking for scraps. I cannot understand why so many other reviewers rave on so much about this area. Usually an hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outdoor breakfast area is packed during good weather but here it was usually less than half full. This speaks for itself.

I cannot gush enough about the many facets of this hotel- the location, the room, the atmosphere, the staff- everything was so wonderful. The hotel is filled with antique tapestries, glass ware and furnature that gives you a sumptuous feeling. It is very convienient for water buses and the train station, which was perfect for us because we were traveling to Florence after Venice. We arrived earlier than the stated check-in time by about 1 hour. The staff prepared our room in a half-hour and made us espresso during our short wait. The large sitting room adjacent to the lobby is so amazing! We stayed on the first floor of rooms, down a long, quiet hallway. Our room had two full-length balcony windows facing the courtyard, which was lushly green with banana trees and flowers. Even though our room was considered a \"standard\" room, it had two areas separated by an arch- the bedroom and a sitting room with a table and upholstered chairs. The walls of our room were covered with a gold brocade fabric that shimmered in the evening. There were also chandeliers in both areas. The bathroom was enormous compared to Italian standards- approximately 10x6 feet. The only downer was the shower was attached to the wall, so we had to sit on the edge of the large tub and bathe that way rather than stand for our shower. The bathroom was impecably clean and the linens really were linen! But the towels were thick and fluffy. The room had a very large closet with a safe and extra blankets and pillows. The breakfast buffet included with your room tariff is wonderful and the waitstaff that bring you caffe' and the' are friendly. You can eat in the garden on good days, and they set up a buffet outside for your convience. Every morning there was warm custard-filled brioche as well as hard-water rolls, Parma ham, provolone, yoghurts, jams, and my favorite- Nutella! There was also three types of juices, one of which was I think mango. There was also fresh fruit. The best part of our experience was the gentlemen at the reception desk- they were so kind and helpful, and even made us a tea tray one evening when my mom mentioned she was craving tea. They also arranged a private taxi to Murano for us and a tour of a factory- NOT a high-pressure \"tourist trap.\" We also had drank some water our last night and when we settled our bill, they tore up our mini-bar receipt and didn't charge us the 2,60 euro for it. It's a small thing, but I remembered it. If you are reading this and have spent weeks looking for \"THE place\" to spend your precious days in Venice, Hotel Abbazia is it! It made our experience so wonderful, and the three days we spent there set us off in a great direction for the rest of our two-week vacation. Also, here are some tips: -When you arrive, buy a ACTV (public transport) pass. Aside for getting you around, the views along the canal and in the lagoon and basin are breath-taking. -Walk sesteri S. Marco at night, it is mysterious and magical. In the Piazza there is a string quartet playing and the gas lamps are burning. Pick up a hot chocolate to go from a caffe- it is called cioccolato in tazzo. It is like melted chocolate bars. Unforgetable. -Whatever you do, DON'T get a Bellini at Harry's Bar- they're 14 euro EACH and that isn't at a table! Oh, and they're about 4 oz. too. I sought out Harry's Bar because it was in all the travel guides, but it wasn't that great of an experience and bloody expensive to boot. -Finally, get lost in Venice. That was the best experience we had was weaving in and out of alleys. We saw REAL Venitians, not throngs of tourists! We traveled down alleyways so narrow our shoulders brushed walls, and found shops, wine bars, caffes and beautiful sights we wouldn't have seen otherwise. And if you get the opportunity, take a ,50 cent traghetto ride- so terrifying but exhilirating and you'll never forget your jaunt across the Grand Canal standing in a gondola!!", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, Ca", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5374285", "Content": "We stayed there in May, 2006.

A lovely courtyard holds tables and chairs for those who chose to spend a peaceful afternoon with birdsong. The breakfast (included in the price) has a good variety of continental choices. There are several trattorias and bars a short distance from the hotel. The best part of the Abbazia, though, is its staff. Matteo, Fabio, and Raphael make you feel welcome immediately and will help with any request you may have. All of the staff speak English very well. I have read people complain about the church bells in the morning, but they never bothered me. It may be a little hard to find, but if you face Canneregio from the base of the Scalzi Bridge looking toward the buildings on the train station side, look for the narrow opening by the Olympia Cafe.

Yes you do get a wake up call from the bells every morning, but bells have a slightly more appealing ring to them than Radio Four.I would certainly stay in this hotel again and have no hesitation in recommending it to friends.", "Date": "October 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, UK", "Title": "\u201cWe were very impressed!\u201d", "Author": "cltc", "ReviewID": "UR4050150", "Content": "We chose the Abbazia because of the Tripadvisor reviews and because we didn't want to spend a fortune on accommodation for our 5 days in Venice last week. (Venice prices are generally on the high side, but the Abbazia is good value for money.) We were not disappointed, in fact in some ways the place exceeded our expectations. As has been mentioned, the hotel is very conveniently situated - almost next door to Venice Railway Station (though you wouldn't realise it - there's no noise), and a 10/15 minute walk or one vaporetto stop from the airport terminal, which itself is just 20 minutes by bus from the airport. But as with everywhere in Venice, you do need a map to find it! Although it's not very near to the main tourist sites, they're only a short vaporetto ride away. Don't be put off by first impressions. Yes, it's down an alleyway, but then Venice is full of alleyways and very safe. Yes, the entrance is unimpressive. But once you're inside, you find yourself in a huge old former convent, immaculately clean, and full of character. There's even an old pulpit in the wall near the bar! The Manager on Reception couldn't have been more friendly and helpful, and even the person behind the bar was very friendly. Our superior room was perfectly adequate (no view, but you don't need to go far outside for views!). Breakfast did get a little hectic for the staff on duty between 9 and 9.30, but this wasn't a problem - and breakfast is available between 7.30 and 11 anyway. And the early morning church bells are a pain, particularly the loud 7.15 one, but you can always go back to sleep again or get up and about earlier in the day. All in all, an excellent hotel for its price and we would certainly stay there again if coming back to Venice.", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Summerland, B.C., Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved our stay there\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4042689", "Content": "We stayed four days at the beginning of September 2005.

The hotel is charming, as are the front desk staff. They offered sugguestions and were very welcoming. The rooms are spacious and nicely furnished. I do think Housekeeping could do a better job sweeping/vacuuming the hardwood floors in the main part of the rooms. The bathrooms are very pretty but they really do need to at least put up shower curtains or doors so that those of us who don't like to take a bath can use the shower attachment provided without dousing the whole bathroom. I personally won't bathe anywhere but my own home, just out of sake of comfort. (I'm a germ freak) Jetted tubs especially, harbor tons of leftover bacteria, skin cells and other goodies from people who have used the tub before you. Therefore, we had to sort of sponge bath/shower off standing up in the tub. Twice we really got the bathroom soaking wet and had to use hand towels to dry everything off. The breakfast was good but the inside dining room was stiffling hot. Also, they are entirely understaffed. Both mornings I saw two people running around trying to keep afloat while guests stood and waited for bowls or spoons or some other thing. And forget trying to get a cup of tea or a coffee -- they can barely keep up with clearing off the tables. At the end of our meal, when we got up to leave, a poor girl who was flushed and sweating ran over to ask if we wanted coffee or tea. I didn't even have the heart to ask her for anything because she was visibly overwhelmed.

They weren't really that bothersome and we were not looking to sleep in anyway. Well I guess that's it. I don't think you will be disapointed.
