It is a little hard to find but the hotel do give a good printable map and directions on their website. The location is fantastic, set on a quiet enough canal across from Mozarts house and 5 min walk to St Mark's Square and about an 8 min walk to Rialto. Everything, including the staff, was lovely from the second we got there. We stayed in a suite with a canal view, and other friends of ours stayed in a superior room with canal view and I can honestly say for the overall extra price we paid we were delighted! Our room was top floor and we were told we had \"the best room in the house\" which I completely agree with! Big bed, large wall mounted flat screen TV, plenty of storage in the wardrobe and a chest of drawers, a safe, a table with 4 chairs and a separate seating area with fold out sofa bed and a lovely balcony looking right down on the canal where you could watch the gondolas going up and down all day. The bathroom was small and had a shower but no bath (which was no problem for us) and there was toiletries provided. The breakfast buffet was good, no hot food but a good selection of pastries, meats, yoghurt, cheese and breads and your tea/coffee was brought to you. This is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in, the price we paid for the best room in the house was amazing, we stayed for 3 nights and we absolutely loved it. Compared to everything else we saw this place was a good bit cheaper and turned out better than I could have wished for. Yes, it is typically venetian meaning steps and character but if you dont want it stay in a boring chain! I think some of the negative reviews on here are unjustified, people who have issues with stairs and continental breakfast should read up the hotel information before they decide to book.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Forlimpopoli, Italy", "Title": "\u201cForget the other hotels, the best is HERE!\u201d", "Author": "meryjune", "ReviewID": "UR125559188", "Content": "It was a great experience, all I can say is positive. The hotel is located about 300 mt from Piazza San Marco, in the heart of Venice. Check in was quick, my room was on the third floor and there's a good deal of stairs to climb so be young and fit. The room was perfect, it was recently renowed, with one single bed, enough lighting fixtures, flat screen tv, a little balcony, private bathroom with shower, toilet, hair blower etc...and......air conditioned! It wasn't obviously on at the time I stayed but it would have been if it was summer, it's quite a bonus in Venice. Breakfast was a small but satisfying buffet of salty (salami, bologna, cheese, soft cheese, bread) and sweet (pastries, cakes, cereals, jam, butter, honey, chocolate cream, yogurt...) items. Accompanied by a hot drink. The staff is cool, very kind, I really appreciated all of them. Also the hotel is open 24 hours per day, no curfew. So a recently renewed single room with new furniture, private bathroom, air conditioned, immaculate cleaning, a good breakfast, close to San Marco costed me 45 euros one night, 55 euros the other. It's the best ever, no other place in Venice would give me a decent breakfast for that price, most will just offer a sad, carb loaded, sugar loaded, totally unhealthy pastry and that's all.

We stayed here for 3 nights, our room had a very nice bedroom with a big bed (nice firm mattress, great pillows), living room with a sofa (opens up into a double-sized bed) and a big bathroom (shower, no bath) with new, fluffy towels. We had three people in our party (grandmother, mother and a 7-year old child). Service is excellent - we arrived at 1 am, and the beds were all made up for us (sofa was also made into a bed), and the room was air conditioned. Breakfast was more than ample, selection of smoked meats and cheeses was varied and everything was fresh. A very nice touch - at breakfast they serve freshly brewed cappuccino in addition to the regular coffee. The hotel is located right on the smaller canal, and the building is old (hence, high stairs throughout and old, small closets in the room) but the building is kept in excellent condition. Everyone in my family is asthmatic and allergic to pretty much everything, and we were very cautious going to Venice in July, thinking of mold and insects, etc, but the hotel is all smoke-free, and again, very very clean. They allowed to keep my daughter's soy milk in the fridge at the reception for the duration of our trip, and they also kept our bags at the reception after check-out for half a day at no charge. The property owner and the reception team are super nice and help with directions around Venice. So for your trip in Venice, I strongly recommend this hotel. My only advice is to download a map into your mobile phone with GPS before coming to Venice, as finding the hotel for the first time, at 1 am, with a sleepy child was a challenge (however, there were some people, gondola drivers and police around at that time to ask for directions).", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saltillo, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cMy visit to Venice, Hotel Mercurio\u201d", "Author": "latinopablo", "ReviewID": "UR121933258", "Content": "The hotel is very modest but the service is good. The best think of this hotel is that is located 5 minutes far away to plaza San Marcos and the vaporeto station, so is very easy to move arround once you get familiar with the area, is a little difficult to find the first time due it doesnt have a big advertisement. The room we stay was single, one bath, tv and clean. The price compared to others hotels is very cheap, so if you dont want to spend much money is OK, the price we pay on Dec was $60 Eur per night. It includes breakfast, is not as big as we are use on America, but it has ham, frut, yogurt, coffe, juce, chease, and sweet bread. One advice buy the vaporeto ticket for two or three days depending of your stayment, but you can use it to go anywhere, Burano, Murano, arround the \"Canal Grande\" its alittle bit expensive but it worth, we pay $25 Eur for 36 hours per person. If you want to have a good lunch take te boat to LIDO is a nice place with better prices, Plaza San Marcos is good but you can imagine the prices. If you want to but Murano stufs, I mean if you really want to spend some money you can go, but if not, you will just spend time walking watching the stores and cute hadcrafts of glass, I think there are more places to go if you have short time in Venice.

I picked Hotel Mercurio primarily for its location in San Marco and for its reasonable price for a hotel in this highly popular area. We had a little bit of a hard time finding it at first, but once we located it...it was very easy to get to and in a great location (only a few minute walk to Piazza San Marco). To be honest, I thought our room would be a little bit nicer...but it was large enough in size. Our parents had a suite in the newer or maybe renovated part of the hotel and their room was amazing! Our room did have a nice view of the canal and we often heard gondoliers singing as they passed by. I thought the staff was very nice and accommodating in every way. I am really surprised to hear about the bad service that a previous reviewer talked about. They couldn't have been more helpful to us if they tried. Jacomo, Monica and Natali were each extremely helpful in securing our water taxi to leave, helping us find the restaurant we were looking for and other locations as well and even in bringing luggage to my parents' room. I must have been there at the same time as the previous reviewer as that our TV was also out due to the storm. It affected the old part of the hotel, not the newer part. To be honest, I came to Venice to see the sites and get lost in the charm of the city...not to sit in my room and watch TV...so while that was a shame (for the TV not to work)...it didn't affect my stay whatsoever. The included breakfast was ok, but what they lacked in assortment, they made up with pretty good cappuchinos. One negative...there are no elevators. This didn't affect me for my room, but my parents stayed in the newer part of the hotel three flights up. When my father (in his 70's) heard that he would have to take his luggage up three flights of stairs, he almost reconsidered staying there.

Since we were planning to stay over the weekend, it was pretty expensive for a Suite that would accomodate 4 people--about 560 euros for two nights, which translated to approximately $700. We still decided to stay here after the recommendation and reading great reviews on this site. Also, it was in a good location, still touristy but not AS touristy as staying right near Piazza San Marco. Alot of the gondolas pass by on the small canal nearby, which can be nice to hear the guys sing. However, be prepared for the loud and obnoxious tourists who feel compelled to scream and shout while going down the canal. Gondola rides stop at 12 midnight, too! The last thing you want waking you up are overjoyed belligerent student travelers who feel liberated away from their parentals. ***Pros: 1) When it came time to check in, all of our luggage was in the very nice suite (apartment building next door, situated overlooking the canal). 2) Breakfast served in the morning included home made cappuccino, not from a vending machine. ***Cons: 1) Extremely rude elderly male staff member who works the nightshift. We had problems with our phone. We were dialing everything correctly, but there was still a busy dial tone. When arriving at the front desk, he told us we were doing it wrong and had us demonstrate with the phone in the lobby. Everything worked fine and we proved to have done things correctly. He then told us to go back to the room to use our phone because we couldn't use the one in the lobby. We explained to him that it was an urgent call and that our phone did not work in the room. He insisted that we were using it wrong!! Even after dialing everything correctly in the lobby!! This was a very urgent phone call, and there weren't any pay phones to be found. Very frustrating, especially if you're traveling from afar and communication with your loved ones back home is imperative! However, the male staff member working the dayshift was very friendly and so was the woman at check out. 2) My sister slept on one of the roll-away beds they use for quad rooms. The next morning she woke up with several bug bites on her arms and legs. We never left the window open and don't recall seeing any mosquitos in the room before we slept. 3) Left baggage near their front desk before check in. It is not in a secure place.

Excellent location - close to St. Marks square, and walkable from Rialto bridge. But Venice is a smallish place and I would rather stay somewhere else in Venice than pay so much just for this location. 2. Natale, the old, friendly, helpful man at the front office. Despite Natale, I would still rate overall customer service as bad. Negative points: 1. Bad Customer Service - Everybody else other than Natale was plain rude and sarcastic. The lady at the front-desk during the day just wasn't interested in helping anybody. Here are some examples - - The TV wasn't working throughout our stay and her response on day 2 was a simple, \"I can't help you since I'm alone at the desk\". - When we checked in, I asked if she had any room with a canal view and her response was \"you'll see enough canals when you are outside in Venice, why do you need a canal view from the room\"!!! - When asked if there was an elevator to go to the room, she said \"there is only 1 flight of stairs\", not mentioning that there were 23 steps to that single flight! - When I asked her whether Internet was free, she replied \"nothing is free in Venice\"... of course, sarcasm was free, it seems! - The lady managing the breakfast buffet was another rude lady, wagging her finger at us when we tried to help ourselves to a pot of hot water for tea. 2. Exorbitant charge for internet - EUR 3 or 4 per half hr! We got some limited time free because the TV wasn't working! Lucky us!!! 3. No elevator - the 1st flight of stairs had 16 steps to get to the reception, and then 23 steps to get to our room (if memory serves me right). 4. Small room - the room was small, the bathroom was even smaller. 5. The shower was the smallest I've ever seen. There was a stand to keep soap, but no shelves in the stand -- brilliant! Having said all this, a word of thanks again to Natale, the old man who was at the front desk in the evening shift.

Generally it's kind of tough to find addresses to begin with and after about 2 hours of searching with our backpacks on we gave up and my Wife approached a police officer who was more than happy to point us in the proper direction. (Hint.. For addresses in Venice, you must know the quadrant you want to be in as there are duplicate addresses in each quadrant) Once we reached the hotel we were confronted with a huge staircase, we reached the top and met Monica the lady at the front desk. She was a huge help and extremely friendly. We had rented a canal view room and she stated that instead of giving us a room in the hotel, she offered us an apartment a few doors down from the hotel. We took it and were more then pleased. We had our own entrance that entered onto a courtyard. Off of the courtyard were several doors that led to private residences including our apartment. Inside the apartment we were pleasantly impressed, it was ground floor (meaning no huge amount of stairs) and about 8 feet above the canal itself. There was a small kitchen (no cooking appliances though) and a seperate bedroom. Off of the small balcony we had a beautiful view of a small canal and for curiousity sake was facing the former home of Mozart. The room also had it's own AC and fully stocked mini fridge which was refilled daily. Here is a list of the only downsides we could think of. 1. The shower was very small. Walk forward and park yourself. Don't drop the soap! 2. Sleeping-in is a little difficult, although we weren't bothered by it and thought it was kind of neat.. The canal the hotel is facing is on a major gondola route, so you will get a lot of singing and music late at night and fairly early in the morning. 3. The second day that we were there the water level in the canal was low and it became pretty smelly. Actually, it was smelly enough that we had to close the window to our room. This was allievated the 3rd day when it rained overnight (the smell completely disappeared) I would highly recommend this hotel and especially the seperate apartment. Another Hint for finding the place.. It's only about 7-10 minutes max away from San Marco's square. If you can find that, you know your close. PS. A great place to eat is the Al Teatro. Fantastic food. If they still have it, I suggest the Chef's Pizza, which looks more like a Calazone. Inside was baked Brie, and on-top was Rucola, Shaved Parmeasan all drizzled with olive oil.

Staff is extremely helpful and very attentive. Getting to the hotel was easy for first timers like me. However, the hotel's website instructs you to disembark at \"Station 14, Calle Vallaresso\", which is wrong or the very least a bit confusing. The street next to the station is named Vallaresso, but the water bus stop/station is \"San Marco\". My wife and I arrived very early in the morning on a Sunday, so the very tight streets of Venice are practically empty. This allows us to navigate without getting pushed by people following you. Breakfast was basic but very adequate. This includes your standard bread, croissants, cake, variety of spreads, cheese and butter, cereals, yogurt as well as fresh banana and apple, orange juice and very good cappuccino. We overslept on our 2nd day, but the lady was nice enough and accommodating to prepare a breakfast tray for two to take it to our room. Our room has two awesome views of the canal, one at the dining area and the other from the bedroom. However, this room is located \"outside\" of the hotel. The building where the hotel is located is still being renovated, so there are scaffoldings around it. Luckily our window is not completely covered and can still see the gondolas passing by. Construction noise starts promptly at 8 AM, so be prepared not to stay in bed all morning. Bathroom is small and shower stall is very tight. The window next to the shower has traces of mold and so does the shower curtain. On our last day the hotel maintenance staff came in our room unannounced to repair the water heater. Hotel sits across a historic building where Mozart stayed in Venice. Facility is also less than a 2 minute walk to La Fenice. The streets leading to San Marco are lined up with designer shops (Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Bruno Mali, etc.) and it is so close to the hotel that we both ran back to our rooms to rest then head back down again.
