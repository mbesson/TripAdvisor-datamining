{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved the Gran Hotel Amazonas The hotel is not located in the best area of the city, and at night the area is very shady, especially with the prostitutes (mainly transvestites) lining up the street, but once you enter the hotel, you can't believe it is located at such a location. The metro station San Antonio is a couple of blocks away, and the Zona Rosa is only a 30-50 peso taxi ride away (if riding the metro, 2 pesos away). I stayed at the hotel for about a month, and the deluxe room was less than $25 U.S. daily. The room was spacious, the bed king size, very clean, and seemed as if it were recently remodeled. Even the bathroom was nicely decorated, seemed like marble tiles to me. I stayed a couple of times in one of the Jacuzzi Suites (at approx. $40-$45 U.S. daily), and wow, was I very impressed. The front desk staff, maids, and staff in general are very friendly. I ordered room service a few times, and the food was tasty and affordable. I would greatly suggest this hotel, but recommend that if traveling to and from this location, to catch an authorized cab. If riding the metro, do so during daylight hours.", "Date": "Apr 7, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR949211318", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "qualit\u8305 prix excellent hotel   showReview(14360872, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR442781516", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ToulouseLydie"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d183907-r3341356-Gran_Hotel_Amazonas-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "183907", "Price": "$29"}}
