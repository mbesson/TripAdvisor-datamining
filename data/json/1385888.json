The regular hotel I stay at was booked as was every other hotel in the area and this was my only option. I thought by now this hotel would have gotten the full upgrade, but no. The carpets in the rooms are worn and dirty, the beds are old and uncomfortable. No upgrade to flat screen TV's and every channel was fuzzy. The bathroom plumbing in the shower is backwards, meaning the hot comes on first so it took me a good two or three minutes to figure out what was going on, then realized I had the same confusion on another visit there. What annoyed me the most was the check in process. The guy at the front desk was wearing reindeer antlers (ok that was cute) but he was totally unattentive. When I arrive at the check in he was sorting the coupons for the priority members, told me to hold on a second, which turned in to about 3 minutes, then when he decided to check me in he discovers a problem with the phones, call someone on a walkie talkie, meanwhile another person walks up to the desk and he gives her his full attention, then turns around and starts to go back in to the office. At which point I threw my hands in the air and he then decided to check me in. What really fried me was I am a HI Honors member and the check in process should have taken less than two minutes. I stood there for 10 min waiting to get checked in. And don't get me started on the restaurant. High priced frozen food. Once in the room, the AC unit sounded like a machine used to pound rocks. It was so loud you couldn't hear the TV. Basically they upgraded the facade, added a new logo behind the desk, painted, replaced the carpets in the public areas, but that was it.

We obtained this hotel via Priceline which advertises it as an airport hotel which it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. If you want something close to the airport choose something else. Upon arrival we called the hotel and ask them to send the shuttle. They stated that it was on the way. Forty-five minutes later, we called back asking where it was and were told that it should be there soon that the first time we called the shuttle was on the way back from the airport to the hotel thus that was why it was so long. Note that the shuttle leaves to go to the airport at the top of the hour. It is a 20 to 25 minute trip from the hotel to the airport. Thus if you just miss the shuttle, it will be about 45 minutes till you see it again. Most of my issues were with the shuttle. The other issue we had is that if they are not needed for an airport run, the shuttle (at no charge) will take you and/or pick you up from the Dolphin Mall which is about 15 minutes away. They were a group of us that afternoon wanting to go and they took us with their shuttle. We were at the mall a few hours and called to see if they could pick up and take us back to the hotel. We were told that the shuttle was on the way back from the airport and would then come get us at entrance 5. We estimated 35 minutes. Well 45 minutes latter we called and were told that once arriving back they had to take people to the airport and it would be about 45 to 60 minutes. Now don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, it is more important for them to take people to the airport than get us at the mall. The issue is we thought they were coming for us, wasted 45 minutes and ended up getting a cab. In short, take the shuttle if available to the mall but plan a cab back to the hotel (about $20). Upon arrival our room was not ready so they stored our luggage. We walked down to 37th St to an Italian Restaurant that was okay and pricy. Upon our return our room was ready. Our room was 207 and it was a king sized bed. The room was standard Holiday Inn. It was very well maintained, very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and the shower worked very well with great water pressure. The bed was very comfortable (this is always subjective) for us. The WiFi was free and worked very well. We were going to go the Bar/Restaurant next door but it was packed at 8pm on a Friday night so ended up in the bar at the hotel. Very limited choices on the menu at the bar. We just had an appetizer item which was okay. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on this for your main meal. If you leave the hotel and turn left on 87th and go about 4 blocks there is a couple of long, barn like strip malls that have restaurants. One that we ate at that was excellent was Brisas de Espana. Good selection along there. The are is very business focused so not a lot to do right there within reasonable walking distance. If you have a car this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be an issue. If you are without transportation and cannot walk more than mile each way then you will be restricted or at the mercy and cost of Taxi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. They have a little mini-mart with sodas and a few pantry items. The staff was friendly and helpful.

We had easy access to Coral Gables and all points south. By taking NW 36 St we had easy access to the airport expressway and the beaches without taking the infamous Dolphin expressway. We were actually able to get places we wanted to get to faster, even though we were further away from some of them. As for the hotel itself, it is a very nice Holiday Inn. The rooms were clean and secure (a plus after last year's debacle). We had plenty of space on a king sized bed. It was quiet (though I don't think many guests were staying when we were there). The staff was very friendly. The only problem we had was minor in that the shower had trouble maintaining a constant temperature. Sometimes it would have trouble getting warm enough, while other times you couldn't get it cool enough. That is hardly a major problem though. The high speed internet was sometimes tricky, but the place had free parking. Free parking is a cherished luxury in Miami for a hotel, so I will take it since, in my opinion, charging for parking is one of the most cheapskate things mankind has invented.", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for the price\u201d", "Author": "cchri1p", "ReviewID": "UR27420719", "Content": "I got this hotel for $45 on Priceline, which is a fair price for what you get.

This hotel was, in my opinion, at the very boundary of what could be considered an \"airport\" hotel, and their airport shuttle only ran once an hour. We were quite delayed, so once we had collected our bags, we called about the shuttle but, being tired, decided to take a cab instead of waiting the 30 minutes for the shuttle's scheduled arrival. The cab ride ended up being about $23 ... like I said, this hotel is just barely an \"airport\" hotel. Once at the hotel, the desk clerk was very nice (though asked for no forms of ID) and gave us a non-smoking room with two beds even though we were of course originally booked in a \"Priceline\" room that was a king-smoking room. The room was nothing special, but it seemed clean and did offer free, if slow, wi-fi. Being late, we walked next door to the Doral Ale House for dinner which was fairly tasty, had good drink specials, and was packed for the Indy-Jacksonville NFL game. The next morning we strolled around the neighborhood to find perhaps a cheaper breakfast than what was offered by the Holiday Inn. The neighborhood seemed very walkable and well-kept (unlike some of the war-zone areas I've seen in Miami). We turned right and found absolutely nothing (besides Carnival's headquarters). We then headed back the other way and found a Dunkin' Donuts in a strip mall. After a quick breakfast, it was back to the room to get ready to leave for the ship. We debated on whether or not to take the free shuttle back to the airport to catch a fixed-rate cab to the port or to just have the hotel call us a cab. We went with the latter, and after a 15-minute wait, our cab arrived. A 20-minute and $40 cab ride later, we arrived at the Port of Miami.

Don't bother! We stayed here because we were arriving late into Miami and didn't want the hassle of having to navigate a strange city in the dark. The room was ok - but nothing special. The worst thing however was the noise, apart from being woken at about 1am by loud music which was coming from the disco on the top floor and went on til 3am, there was also the noise from the planes going over, which thankfully drowned out the dreadful music.After a disturbed nights sleep, breakfast was on the cards - after failing to get any response from room service for half an hour, we went to the restaurant, where we had to wait an hour for our food. Normally we'd have walked out, but not knowing where else to go and being starving having not eaten the night before kept us in our seats, there were many who did walk out though!", "Date": "February 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cI'll be back\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR927415", "Content": "Wow!

This time I was traveling with my wife and two children flying from Boston to Miami (a 9 hour affair from house to hotel). When I booked the room I phoned the hotel to inquire about their airport shuttle service since we were arriving late in the evening. I was informed that the service was available until midnight. Since we were due to land at 11:30 I did not see a problem. (We originally had reservations at the Intercontinental Miami Airport but their shuttle ended at 10PM). Upon arriving at the airport I phoned the Holiday Inn at the baggage area. They informed that the shuttle was not available since the driver did not show up for work. This was quite discouraging since I was standing there with my family and 7 bags ready to start our vacation (on New Years Eve no less). The gentlemen at the front desk informed me to take a cab and they should reimburse me. After waiting many minutes in a cab line the cab took us to the hotel and we paid $20 after your desk told us it was about $10 to $15. After we got out of the cab there was no bellman available to help us with our bags, so my small son and I took them inside ourselves. We checked in at the front desk and the clerk said he would call a bellman. After waiting for many minutes the front desk clerk disappeared and there was no bellman in site. We therefore lugged our bags ourselves to the 5th floor and opened the room. Upon entering the room we noticed a strange smell similar to bug spray repellant. We attempted to open the windows but they were sealed shut. So we opened the room door for a while and settled down. However after many minutes we noticed the smell not dissipating so I called the front desk to get another room. Upon entering the other room I noticed the same odor and called down to the front desk clerk. He informed that he had checked other rooms and noticed the same smell. After a long discussion with my wife we decidrcontinental Hotel. By now it was nearly 2AM. I had to telephone a cab and wait 30 minutes for it to arrive. The front desk clerk apologized and told me there would be no charge for the room at the Holiday Inn. I paid the cab driver $10 and the Intercontinental staff was extra good at handling our bags at 2:30 AM as well as getting a sandwich in my room for my hungry son. Subsequently a charge appeared on my credit card for the Holiday Inn room. So I phoned a Mr. Nelson Martinez hotel manager. He informed me that he would investigate the matter and return my call the next day. 3 days later I phoned and he advised me that he had not looked into it. I phoned again the next day and he said that yes there was a mistake and that he would be crediting my charge card account. Also he would pay me the $20 cab ride. Now since that last conversation I have phoned him long distance 4 times, left messages, and have never seen the credit or heard back from him.
