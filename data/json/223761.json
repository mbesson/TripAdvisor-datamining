I have stayed here in the past but very short trips and had probably the best room in the hotel when I stayed previously. The whole experience this time was terrible. To start out, they double billed us and booked 2 rooms instead of 1 as we requested. The room was small, smelly, sticky carpets, dirty bathroom, mildew/mold ceilings, and wait did I say small!! The linens were hideous, curtains were dirty, balcony neglected, the maintenance was shotty! Blah! The indoor pool is a joke, they closed the outdoor one which actually wasn't bad before. The elevator is rickety, the breakfast at the restaurant was terrible, the front desk staff were actually nice, but when we checked in there was only one person and it took awhile. Basically, don't waste your money and go here. It is so overpriced and needs a complete overhaul.

It was over all a very satisfactory experience. Good Points: 1) Location !! Location !! Location : its located right at the beach. We didn't take a sea view room but it didn't matter as it took a minute to get to the beach. Also, its right in the middle of activity with many restaurants around. 2) Price: Not sure what the season rates are but we got a standard king for $60 as it was off-season. It wasn't a sea facing room, and the view we had was of the parking lot located behind the hotel. We spent the entire day on the beach so didn't matter to us. 3) Room: The room was very big,clean and bright, just how I like it. Lot's of sunshine and natural light and colorful decor. It also had all the basic amenities, microwwave, refrigerator, hair dryer, coffee machine, clothes iron. Much better than I have seen in some hotels with better rating. 4) Indoor swimming pool: It has an indoor swimming pool at the ground floor, looked very nice and clean though we didn't actually use it. 5) Enviornment Friendly: I really liked how they had taken steps to make everything enviornment friendly. Not sure how well all the practises are actually followed, but it did seem to be a nice effort on their part. 6) Friendly staff: I spoke to 3 people on the front desk, all of them were polite and friendly. The house keeping staff was also very co-operative. Not so good points: There was nothing bad 1) Bathroom: It was spotless, no problems there. However it really needed some sort of mats or something for absorbing the water on the floor. It got totally wet after I took a shower and was like that for most of the duration of the stay. I do not like using towels for cleaning the floor hence it remained messy throughout. 2) Lighting in the room was very poor: The room was a very good size but there were only 2 lamps, that too located at odd corners. It was poorly lit by the night and I wouldn't have enjoyed reading in that much light. 3) The pillows: The pillows were more like cushions and a little comfortable.

I'll start with the good: just a few steps to the beach; couldn't be more convenient, located near several decent places to eat. Neutral: 2 mile walk to the midway where the games and rides are. We didn't mind because that's how we got our exercise in but someone older or with kids might find it too far to walk. Now the bad. The first night we were awaken by banging at the door with two men yelling \"Police, open up!\" Being from NY/NJ, I'm not trusting that it's really the police at my door in the middle of the night. When looked thru the peephole they were standing to the side and didn't show ID. As I went to call the front desk, my b/f opened the door with the latch on and saw that they were in uniform. One came in with a flashlight and looked out on our deck asking if we were out there. I said, \"we were SLEEPING!\" and he said \"sorry, wrong room.\" After that my heart was racing and I couldn't fall back asleep very easily. Went to the front desk the next morning to ask what was going on and all they could say was there was someone yelling on a balcony. We asked what we should have done. They said the police have jurisdiction but you don't have to let anyone in. That was comforting. The next night the TV stopped working. A kid from the front desk came up and played around for 10 minutes finally fixing it. He said he's fixed about 40 in 4 months. Channels on the room listing aren't necessarily what you'll get. We had a about 10 channels and when I called about one in particular they said it might not be working because it was raining out. The room was average, bathroom door didn't close right, a hot water heater was badly disguised by a broken sliding curtain thing. And the \"best room available\" offer when I booked got us 2 double beds. Water pressure is really bad because they have water saving shower heads. Build in ten extra minutes for travel time while you wait for the elevators which are slow. The indoor pool and spa area could use some work but was sufficient when it rained out.

A few notes for you to consider. If you are disabled, be sure you have a parking permit since that will get you in on the ground floor of the garage. Otherwise, up you go and no elevator. Check in is on the first (ground is the street level) and there is only one space in the garage for people who are checking in. I took the chance and parked, registered, and brought my parking permit back out. The rooms are pretty much what you have read in other reviews. I regret that the restaurant next door (south) has their exhaust fan blasting so, unless you like the smell of food instead of sea breezes, it's not much fun sitting out on the balcony if they are cooking. The location is outstanding. It's just plain great to be there except . . . the mold. The room had obvious mold (black around the air conditioning vent . . .

I was traveling in this case with my parents, who after back surgeries earlier this year require baths fitted with handicap facilities (e.g., bars for tub, high toilets). Mostly I view hotels from the viewpoint of a solo traveler, so can't comment on the indoor pool (who needs a pool at the beach?) but it looked small/medium. Garage parking. Two slightly slow elevators with doors that are a bit vicious if they start to close, watch out you don't get hit. My room was a second floor sideview of the beach, which had a perfectly nice view, the metal awning described in an earlier post is there, but no cigarette butts, could be a problem if rain is pounding. I was happy enough with my room, evidently refurbished fairly recently, outfitted in pastel coastal colors with a king-size bed, lots of pillows, an a sofa where you could open the French door and get the side ocean view, or sit on the plastic balcony chairs. Small bathroom but quaint, pedestal sink with hair dryer - nice feature is the solar lamp, plenty of towels, soaps, etc. They offer to get you stuff you forget. One thing - the mattress seems to be some older springy type, didn't bother me much but my parents complained it was too soft and bothering to people with back issues. You kind of wallow in it, like the mattress is old (or cheap). Everything seemed to be quite clean, so I felt pretty badly when we discovered that the outdoor faucet quote \"had been faulty so the handle was removed and it's been like that for 2 years\". (Who runs a beach hotel and doesn't provide outside rinse facilities? It's going to cost more as guests dump more and more sand into your plumbing when they get to their rooms - geez.). Another slight annoyance was there was only ONE ice machine on the ground floor, I love my ice, hate it when hotels make you hike for an ice machine. But having the in-room fridge and microwave is a huge plus. I was crazy about the in-house restaurant, really delicious pizza, great drinks, excellent service, I'd stay here again just for the pizza - restaurant for sure gets 5 STARS! For my purposes since I just want a quiet, convenient, place to stay with a fridge and easy beach access, this was perfectly acceptable - if they had a ground-level bathroom I didn't see it, so if you come in from the sand you have to go to your room to use the bathroom, and thanks to the broken faucet sand gets everywhere *shrugs*. Overall, it's sort of like a Hampton Inn that needs a bit of work, but it's fine, especially if you don't spend a lot of time in your room anyway. We chose this over the Marriott, prices in this area are bloated anyway, but we are not spending $400+ a night for a hotel room in an upscale hotel. Fortunately we showed up just before a tour bus pulled up with around 50 people staying here. I would stay here with kids, the outdoor pool is gone, evidently made into a sitting area, I'd just be prepared to NOT spend daytime in the hotel, to keep an eye on the elevator doors, and head for the beach or boardwalk - if you are from out of town the boardwalk can be a LONG walk, take the tram or wear good shoes.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lebanon PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, good restaurant and very nice location\u201d", "Author": "kujoslice", "ReviewID": "UR76069507", "Content": "3rd time at this hotel with my wife, son 12 and his friend.

We checked in alright, and went to our room to find out just how much of a pig-sty we were staying in. Horrible! The bathroom was gross: Mold on the ceiling, stained towels, dirty floor, a \"rubber\" around the shower head (see photo)!?! The room was small, smelly (mostly due to the restaurant across the way), and extremely run down considering the hotel claimed to be renovated. The ceilings were very low, the beds had a dip in the middle, the curtains over the balcony slider had stains on them, the coat closet had a huge water heater taking up all the space, and the AC vents were moldy as well. Speaking of our \"view\" - it was of the adjacent hotel and restaurant across the way, complete with dumpster smell. The slider barely moved it was so old and falling apart. After seeing all this, we tried to move to a better room, but was told the entire hotel was sold out! I did visit our friends in an oceanfront room... still a bit run down, with stained carpets, but no moldly bathroom. On the plus side, the restaurant was great. Breakfast was yummy and the waitstaff is fabulous. The bartender was very nice. Don't ever stay here! Its great to be on the boardwalk, yes, but stay somewhere nice and just drive down to the boardwalk and pay parking, or take the bus!

You could write your name on the dust on the glass shelves in the bathroom.

Instead, it had peeling light and dark blue paint on it, with water dripping from it.

(rm was approx $180/night, not including taxes, not bad for peak season) This was a good location on the boardwalk, head south and you are right at the shops and attractions. We took tram ride up and down boardwalk and the further north you head, the more it was just hotels and houses and less of the shops. I was happy w/ this hotel. Yes, the elevators were slow when we checked in but that is to be expected w/ the heavy usage they were receiving. Once everyone was settled, the wait was never that bad. Parking garage at rear provided adequate parking. It is confusing if you come in across from garage at indoor pool level cuz check in is one floor up. Better signage about this by the hotel would help. The hotel has a U-shaped configuration and the even number rooms ( on the south side) are definitely less desirable, overlooking the Brass Balls Saloon. The higher floors are better because you are above the neighboring building. We were on 3rd flr and AC units and their noise line the alley between you and Brass Balls. However, we were first room around the corner which still gave us a small but nice ocean front view. There was never a \"partying\" noise problem from next door while we were there, but, it was a Sunday and Monday night, so probably was calmer than a Fri or Sat night. Room was small, but I wasn't really planning on hanging out in there anyway. Our room was clean w/ 4 pillows on each bed and lots of shelves in the bathroom. Hotel employees were all very nice and the issue mentioned by another poster regarding the safe was clearly explained at check-in (although I might have just gotten lucky w/ my clerk, so be sure to ask.) Indoor pool was rather murky looking when we arrived, but we had good weather, and mgmt did recognize problem and close and drain pool on the second day of our stay ( a Monday). Outdoor pool is small, but interesting w/ water features and bridge crossing over it. Good for kids at the end of the day or to sit overlooking the boardwalk. Again, be advised, this area is small, w/ approx. 4 umbrella tables and two lounges on each side of the bridge. There was an outdoor shower near the boardwalk pool which came in very handy for a final cleanup after we had checked out but stayed the day on the beach. Bicycle rental place was located in basement of hotel, very handy and run by very nice people. I thought restaurant was expensive ( $9) breakfasts, but we did have a pizza late one night, (it was available until midnight) and it was very good. Overall I think this hotel provides an average clean room w/ a great boardwalk location. We would have no problem staying here again.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Altoona, PA", "Title": "\u201cNot a bad stay, not a good one either.\u201d", "Author": "AltoonaMomto2", "ReviewID": "UR8139313", "Content": "Well, to start off, there is a nice parking garage right behind the hotel. This was nice at the time we stayed... we always got a ground level parking spot. The hotel lobby was nice, and check in was quick. The decor in the lobby was quite nice and comfortable. The elevator and hallways were nice as well. The room was sort of small (2 adults, 2 children under 3 years old). But how often do you really sit around your room for any length of time? The pool had a strong chlorine smell and was not heated as the website said (so I thought anyway). It took forever to get the room cleaned, and even then, it wasn't exactly tip top shape. On our second day, my 3 year old son found an aspirin pill under the TV stand. Thankfully, he showed it to us before doing other things with it (such as putting it in his mouth). That was a real turn off, that could of been a life or death situation. BTW, I also found a love note between the headboard and the night stand the same day. In other words, I think they need to be a little more thorough in cleaning. BTW, the bathroom is WAY TOO TINY! I couldn't even have the door open when I bathed my kids, there's just not enough room. My knees touched the door if I sat on the toliet with the door open. Check out is another story... they neglect to tell you about the safe fee. (except in the tiny, tiny print that is at the check in desk and on the safe itself.) Upon check out, we said we didn't use the safe, so we aren't going to pay for it. (this is an option, you know). Well, instead of the girl removing it, she added it into our charges, totaling an extra $4.50 (safe is 1.50 + tax/day). So, then she figured out how to remove it, then she was going to charge us the full hotel stay amount (including the 1 night deposit we already made). So, after being on the phone w/her manager and 20 minutes later... we finally got the right amount. All in all, for only $139/night in mid/late June... I guess the stay wasn't too bad.. except for the cleanliness issue.
