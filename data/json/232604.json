{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great place to stay just outside the City We have just returned from our first trip to Berlin to visit family who live in Friedrichshagan. We got cheap flights to Schonefieldwith Ryan Air and initially booked the Hotel Boelesche (126) as it was close to where our relatives lived. The Hotel was 20 minutes from the airport (taxi 23 Eurous) and nearer than Berlin City. Trains and buses go round the clock but if it's a late arriving flight a taxi may be preferred. We had a lift to and from the Airport but it appears to be very acessible via local transport.The Hotel is down a small drive and rooms (apartments really) are around a small quite courtyard. We asked for a triple bed room but there was also a sofa bed in the lounge too, so four could have stayed. The 3 single beds were on a second open level via a small spiral staircase and everywhere was freshly decorated clean and very comfortable. Down stairs (in addition to the sofa) there were table, chairs, TV (with satelitte), a small kitchen with cooker, kettle, sink and a fridge, a seperate toilet, shower and sink. The fridge had a mini bar facility with beer , wine water ,soft drinks and snacks. It was very private and you had a key so you could come and go as you wished.Breakfast was included and served in a small dining area off the reception a couple of doors down. Breakfast was great, bread rolls, cheese, meats, boiled egg, fruit juice, jams and lovely coffee all served with a smile!!The people who own it are very nice and speak good english and they try to make you as comfortable as possible. This is a great option to visit Berlin as the Hotel only cost us \u62e298 for two nights for the three of us (we could have slept four and the cost would only have been even less that \u62e215 a night with breakfast!).The area is quiet and safe with some nice affordable restaurants  shops and near to a lake and forests with lots of cycling areas. We walked to the train Station in a few minutes and got quickly and efficiently into Berlin and the ticket for all five of us with unlimited travel until 3.00am the next day only cost 15 Euros in total! There are also trams and some really old ones near the station if Trams are of interest to you. There is also a small cinema in the area which has been refurbished and although we didn't get to go there our friends say its very nice and quite quaint.We visited a really lovely local old style German restaurant /bar in Sharneweber Str. and seven of us had a main course, plenty of wine beer, free bread and dips and a nightcap for \u62e270!I would recommend the area and the Hotel as a very affordable option for a visit to Berlin and we will be staying there again next time we visit!!", "Date": "Feb 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR945845428", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "HeatherDS"}, {"Content": "Petite pension de famille tr\u732bs conviviale et calme!!!   showReview(21276540, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR765064433", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jpaul57"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d232604-r6766750-Hotel_Boelsche_126-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "232604", "Price": "$103"}}
