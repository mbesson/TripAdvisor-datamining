(still have not got). After getting off the ferry from Fajardo and arriving at Culebra, we found that our hotel was right across the street from the ferry dock. Two of my girlfriends and I rented the \"Sailfish\" room at the Hotel Kokomo after seeing the room on the hotel's website. It was not at all like the pictures. I think these photos must of been taken when the hotel was brand new. Once we figured out that we had to enter the \"vacation planner\" door to check into the hotel we were on the right track. We were met by a nice female who gave us our room key and directions to get to the room. You have to enter a separate door, and climb two flights of unstable stairs to get to the top floor where our room was. Our room was secured by a small padlock (not comforting for 3 females not from the area). Once we entered we were upset by the quality of the room. We knew we would not be staying at the Ritz-Calton but the room was full of stains all over the furniture (so much so that you could not find a clean place to sit anywhere on the couches) and the walls had stains and also the ceilings. (See photos) The only positive things I can say about the whole room was the bathroom looked like it had been updated in the last few years. The bedroom was also the same with the stains and also had a door but no stairs to get down?? (from the third floor). Once entrace both in and out. There were windows in the livingroom covered in plywood (not sure why??). The kitchen was a wreck, I am not sure who would want to attempt to cook in there. There was an overwhelming smell of mold in the rooms. We decided we could not stay there and went back to the desk for a refund to stay somewhere else. We were told that we would have to contact the owner directly (in New York I think). After several attemps to contact him, we left a message saying we were going to post on trip advisor and got called right back. He said that he would refund our money but when I said I was still going to post my review he was yelling at me and hung up on me. We did get all but $50 back, (not sure why he kept that amount?) I would strongly suggest looking at the B&B/inns for Culebra, there are a lot of other places to stay. I have friends who have stayed at Mamasitas and said it is very clean. Feel free to email me with any questions. Even after that drama I would still go back to Culebra (staying at Mamasitas or similar)-- it's an amazingly beautiful island!!! We had a great time eating at Mamasitas and spending the day at Flamenco Beach ( I can see why it's rated one of the best in the world) and can't wait to go back again!", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison", "Title": "\u201cNot terrible, but I'd try another guest house\u201d", "Author": "Madisonlovestotravel", "ReviewID": "UR7721854", "Content": "Thought it would be a decent place located right off of the ferry, and it was. But since the whole island is only 7 miles long or so, you can walk, take a taxi for $2 per person, or rent a jeep for $40 a day. The rooms were modest...had beds and a bathroom, no TV/clock/phone. One person in our group complained about hearing the ferry come in early in the morning, but it never woke me up. We did have an unfortunate night that my boyfriend woke up at 3:00 in the morning to discover that the fans and AC were off and it was 85 degrees in our room. Pretty miserable night because none of us could get to sleep, but we found out the next morning that the power went out on the whole island (since it runs on generators). We saw some cuter guesthouses closer \"into the city\", but beaware, the ones on the water tend to attract more bugs. Mamacitas has a restaurant and bar within that seemed nice when we were there for dinner. Villa Flamenco is right next to Flamenco Beach one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, so that might not be a bad idea either. I'd think you could travel to Culebra and find a decent place to stay, without booking in advance. They all seem to be reasonably priced. Then you'd be sure to have a place you'd be happy with. Beware: We took a nap after being on the beach all day, and when we woke up to eat around 8:30...the city was dead. Everything was closed! Hotels have a policy that if they serve food, they stop serving at 9 and must close the bar at 10. Considering there are about 3 restaurants (Mamacitas, Dingy Dock, and El Eden---which has fabulous sandwiches) and 3 bars, (the ones listed above), it may be good to bring your own food. Oh, there was a Chinese restaurant that we managed to eat at as it was closing up. Not exactly an ideal dinner. If you're looking for a secluded island with beautiful beaches and aren't looking for luxury in any form, Culebra is the place for you. Or else, take a day trip to Culebra from Fajardo and stay at the Fajardo Inn of Scenic Inn (same hotel, Scenic Inn is a guest house for walk ins only and has the same amenities of the hotel), or the Ritzier El Conquistador.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cCulebra in general\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3490887", "Content": "Culebra is a beautiful place to stay, when I go at least twice a year I usually stay in a house close to zoni beach, I rent private home, this is what I like to do when I go there, this place is paradise and nothing to do but RELAX all day long, is like meditation and food for the soul.

We knew we were not going to the Ritz but never dreamed that we would be staying at a place that has only one lock on the door and others may have the exact key to your place. We were going to sleep that night and I was a bit worried about having only one lock on the door. It didn't appear to be safe. I was thinking about putting a chair or some heavy table in front of the door. While I laid awake contemplating if I should do that I looked over at the door and notice that the door knob was turning and the door was starting to open. My husband and I immediately jumped out of bed and threw ourselves onto the door and slammed it shut, my husband yelled out \"Who are you and what do you want!\" Whoever it was never said a word and split. It was a super scary moment for us and there was really nowhere for us to go since it was late at night and just about everyone in the town was closed down for the night. We called the owner of the place and he immediately came to our aid. He does not stay at Hotel Kokomo, he lives about a half hour away from there. He felt terrible about the whole thing and he moved us to another room facing the street and next to the office. It didn't help ease my fear of someone having a key to that room as well. Since we were pretty much stuck there for the night we had no choice but to stay there. We put a table in front of the door and I pretty much stayed awake for that night. This place is not a place I would recommend to anyone. Until this new management gets their act together, I think its not a safe place to stay. I also learned that this owner had just bought the place about 3 weeks ago and he has a lot of work to do there. For one thing he needs to change all the locks and put in an extra security lock or chain on top of the one that is on the door. We also had no hot water at all. There is no phone or TV and you will only get one towel per person and that is it. I think for the little bit you get there it is a little expensive. I would probably never consider staying there again. We called the cops that night and just from what they were saying it doesn't sound like the people there are bad at all, and from what they were gathering it sounded more like some drug attic wanted to just find a place to crash for the night and probably has done so many night, since he does have a key to that room (#7). We were planning on staying two nights there, but after that we decided to head back to Puerto Rico and just stay there instead. Oh another thing the streets there are under major construction and it is very very hard to get to and from there. I mean the streets are all dug up! Plus you will be awaken by all the construction noise that begins at about 6AM.", "Date": "May 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dover, DE", "Title": "\u201cOkay for the money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1704444", "Content": "This trip was done on somewhat of a budget, so $70 a night on Culebra was about the limit of what we were willing to spend.
