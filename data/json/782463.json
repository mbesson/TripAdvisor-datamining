We stayed at Hotel du Nord le Paris Velo December 5th to 7th 2011. It's a 10 minute/1 kilometre walk from Gare du Nord and only 100 metres from the Metro station Jacques Bonsergent and only a little further to Republique in the opposite direction. The street itself is non descript, the hotel being the prettiest looking building draped in greenery. Inside is a hodge podge of nick nacks, trivia and guide books - not all for Paris and not all in French. It has a homely feel to it with warmth, despite the time of year and the solid stone floor in reception. Our room was on the first floor, we took the elevator with bags on arrival but the spiral staircase is manageable. Our room was directly above the reception it was not a problem; the only hotel noise we got was coming through the wall where the elevator shaft was the other side. The room was warm, so warm in fact we turned the heating down a notch and opened a window whilst we were indoors. The bed was two singles put together with a surprisingly snug fit. And comfortable. The en suite was a three piece with a shower not bath. Apart from a slight let down in the wardrobe/drawers department and no kettle/tea coffee facilities, we had all we wanted...there is a flat screen tele. Breakfast is in the basement. Arched stone walls and ceilings fitted with a mish mash of furniture. Breakfast was traditionally French, 4 pieces of bread, tea or coffee and some home made jams/marmalades. A bit dissapointing for the true Brit in me but it did see you through the morning. Hotel du Nord is a nice place, it is spotlessly clean everywhere and the staff speak very good English. It's definitely value for money and if your going to be spending most of your visit out and about this place is great.

We had breakfast out of the hotel (there is a place on the main road, somewhere behind the hotel on boulevard de magenta, i cant remember its name, its blue in colour, serves a hot drink, orange juice, croissant or pain au chocolat for about 5 euro) but I think it is well worth having the hotel breakfast for 7.50 euro, as a simple breakfast can still be quite pricey in the local cafes.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cA Hidden Gem\u201d", "Author": "minghui79", "ReviewID": "UR119881721", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Du Nord for 3 nights during our recent visit to the city of Paris.

The well-maintained bathroom was small but it was certainly functionable.

We ended up having our daily breakfast at our own cosy spot at the basement. I liked that the service staffs in this hotel were all very friendly and helpful to our needs. They spoke good English. Prior to this trip, I had misgivings about the French being arrogant. Hotel Du Nord certainly helped changed that misconception. In fact, everywhere we go in Paris, we encountered very nice Parisan hospitality. For expensive Paris, Hotel Du Nord provided good value for money in a decent neighbourhood that wasn't too far from the sights.

Oh, and it has to be inexpensive. Not many places fit this criteria, but this one does. The rooms are good sized, the bed (in our double) was comfortable/large and the bathroom right sized. There is street noise, so it's always nice to have earplugs handy. It is VERY basic - no frills here, but what more could you want for 82E? We found the breakfast, at 7.50E each was an excellent deal (remember, this is Paris), so we had it all 5 mornings. There are places around that serve coffee and a croissant, but they charged the same price (for less food). For breakfast here you'll get coffee/croissant/juice/2 kinds of baguette breads/jellies. It's not what many of us are used to for breakfast, but it really is quite good. As others have said, it's near several metro stops. Once you've figured out the metro map, getting around Paris is easy using the metro. You can walk to the sites from here (Louvre 30min, Orsay 45min, Notre Dame 25min), but it's really not through the best parts of town, so we found the metro (despite being crowded at times) a better way to get around. BTW, it took us 1 hour to get from here to the CDG airport via metro/RER. Good restaurants are limited in this area - we found better offerings on the other side of the canal (about a 10 minute walk). This is not really the tourist part of town, so fixed priced menu offerings are not easy to find - you'll likely have to order ala carte. The staff is helpful in providing restaurant recommendations. Would I recommend to my friends? Yes.

We stayed in a 'renovated' room, which may have made a big difference. It had new laminate flooring and lighting and a nice bathroom with a tub/shower. The whole thing looked to be easily cleaned and was tidy. Our room opened up onto a window well between buildings on the back which provided ventilation without noise. The windows on the street would be more interesting, but louder. The room was really small, but I presume that's normal for Paris. I didn't go there to watch TV. The manager was very helpful and pleasant, and we had no trouble with the booking. We left our bags early in the day and checked in later with no problem. Our visit in May had great weather and needed neither heat nor cooling. I have only one real comment on this hotel - don't be there in a fire. As far as I could tell, all of the rooms opened directly onto the open stairway up the middle of the hotel. It has wooden treads and would make an excellent chimney. I could see no other way to get out - no exit stairs - except the windows. On the back, that nice window well would fill with smoke in no time and I think any occupants would be stuck. And the front door needed a key to open it from inside or outside, so not great for a panic exit.
