The breakfast is really good and one of the pleasures associated with staying at this hotel, ranging from cerial & toast right through to full English breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausages etc), in fact you can have it all, depends on how much you can eat.

I also have had experience of sitting on the stairs waiting for a breakfast table to become free, and would also point out that some of the top rooms are up three flights of stairs, which can prove very difficult when you have luggage and a family as there is no lift and no-one to assist you with carrying your cases. Also if you are going to this hotel, try to book a room on the back as they are much quieter than the front rooms, which can be noisy at night.

Quite a climb with heavy suitcases and no elevator. But for the price you can'y complain as it was reasonable. And typical of upgrades done to older hotel rooms that didn't have their own baths they converted the closet into a tiny bathroom.

After reviewing what seemed like endless reviews and comments about dozens and dozens of London hotels I picked this one because, in general, the reviews were good, and because of its great location. The descriptions said that it was convenient to Paddington Station, which has an express train to and from Heathrow. I'm so happy to report that all of the good things written about this hotel were true! Our room was very nice and always kept spotless, as was the bathroom, which was small but normal for that area. My husband and I like to walk and so we found the location even more convenient than I thought it would be. We were very close to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. In fact, after a long day of sightseeing, we often spent some time in the parks to relax. We were able to walk to the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Space Museum, and also to Kensington Palace. And, one day we actually walked to Buckingham Palace, then to the Thames where we enjoyed Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, and the London Eye, then home by way of Trafalgar Square and Picadilly Circus, all in one day and all on foot! On the few occasions where we went places by public transportation, we found Paddington Station a good starting point for any type of train or bus, and it's only a couple of blocks from the hotel. Along the way between the station and the hotel you'll find many restaurants and shops, so if you'd like to stay in the area, you can. Our only glitch with the hotel was an issue involving our payment. By way of pleasant e-mails with the owner, Harry, I determined that we could pay for the hotel with British Pound Travelers Cheques. The night before we were leaving, we were checking out and were told by the lady manager that she could not accept them. After much discussion, including the fact that it was a bank holiday and we couldn't exchange them anywhere else, she finally did accept them. Upon returning home I sent an email to Harry explaining how unhappy I was about that problem. He explained that he and his wife were away on holiday and the substitute manager didn't understand that Travelers Cheques were acceptable as long as they were in British Pounds. He apologized and said he'd make sure she understood.
