At first, I did not like that we had an interior room since we had paid for a \"superior\" I assumed it would have been an outside room. Miguel showed me other rooms that were available, but I decided to stay with our original room. It was darker, not much light, having no exterior windows, but the only time we were in there was to sleep, so it actually worked out great. The beds were very comfortable, and the room was very clean every day. The only issue I had with the room was that the shower pressure was not strong, at all. It took quite a while to get the shampoo out. Also our ceiling fan was a little squeaky. Other than that, I would stay here again. Its location a block from the beach was great. The restaurant downstairs had good food at good prices. They have an agreement with a beach club a couple blocks away that will get you beach chairs (and an umbrella if you are early enough). Around 10 pm or so, everything went quiet around the hotel, which made for easy sleeping. Besides the location being awesome, the staff is even better. Miguel went out of his way for us each day, helping us with taxi's, reservations, etc. The staff at night were extremely friendly as well.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phillipsburg, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Beds\u201d", "Author": "kingstupka", "ReviewID": "UR126426532", "Content": "This is an adorable property with great staff.

This hotel was very comfortable, clean and great value indeed. We slept well, had clean, fresh linens, fresh towels, A/C, hot water, internet, cold drinking water, beach towels, cool roof view, everything you need. It had a great Mexican feel about it, cheery atmosphere, close to 5th ave shopping, and the bus. But what this hotel had that others did not , were some amazing people at the front desk. We can not say enough about them. They made this little hotel, a home away from home. We felt like we were family. There were several great staff, but the two that we had most often, and who we will remember, were Miguel, and Simone. They were both excellent. Miguel, was by far the most efficient, helpful, intuitive, reliable, willing, and honest staff member we have ever encountered on our travels. He made the Cielo a warm, friendly place to come and go from. He always had a friendly smile, and time for you. He makes this hotel a five star. We also met the manager at the front desk once, Steven, I believe his name was, an American; and we wished he would have taken the time to have a drink, or share a meal with his guests, as he seemed intriguing, maybe next time. He is obviously running this hotel efficiently. We spent a week there, and ate next door at the restaurant, every morning. The food was good. You are right in the heart of things at the Cielo.

Had a chat with Steve the owner & we got the same feeling from him as well, he really cares, sent us to restaurants that he eats at, cenotes that he goes to, even sent us into the back streets too eat some real local flavor, my wife was so scared..... but everyone was so nice, the chicken was the best I ever had, so delicious. We felt like such fools, so ignorant, Playa is probably safer then where I live in NY & I am paying $12,000.00 a year in property taxes, go figure, I know now you really cant trust the media.

What we loved the most, was the service, I give you 5 Stars, we felt like we knew everyone for a long time, I cant explain it, but what ever you guys are doing, its working, I had to drag my wife out of there, we both didn't want to leave.

WHAT WE LOVED: The staff, very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. The beds were the most comfortable I've ever slept in, in PDC. Crisp beautiful linens, no \"doubtful clean\" beadspread but a quilt is available if you get cold - not really imaginable. The intimate hotel is small but rooms and their entrances were very private and secure, almost like going to your upstairs bedroom at home. The proximity to great restaurants of every taste and budget. The beach club arrangements with Wicky's were perfect. The great pedestrian 5th Ave. and the beach both were steps away. The 50% breakfast discount at one of the most popular restaurants,Carboncitos, just next door, was a nice perk. WHAT WE LIKED: The homey Mexican art decor, the shower and bathroom space and the large shelving area for clothes storage - WITH hangars (sometimes almost non-existant in hotels). There are water coolers (no fridge) and flushable toilets (some hotels discourage this). The roof top is a great place to relax after a day of sightseeing and is in the middle of a remodeling phase. The bar wil be nice, with beautiful views. MISC: TV is available and when we asked that our TV be moved a little for better viewing it was done immediately. We had no need for a phone. Miguel was gracious enough to offer us a choice of rooms, especially one with a larger bed after one night - we had not asked but he overheard our concern about it. The air conditioning and overhead fan were fine-quiet, as was our room. There are nice \"black out\" type draperies for those who want to sleep a little longer in the morning. We love the early morning sun so we didn't need to shut them. I liked that the owner was on premise and we are interested in learning about his endeavor in Tulum concerning a green/eco friendly hotel. I'm sure it will do well. We laughed on hearing one of his anecdotes about a shopping trip - \" I'll take 40 mattresses to go\". Very clean and comfortable is this hotel. I'm glad I made the switch. All in all, I hope to make this my new home there and felt I was.

Have stayed in several hotels in the centro and close to the beach. Some of them were twice the price of El Cielo and not half as nice! I found the hotel because I have eaten many times at Canrocitas, the wonderful and very reasonably priced restaurant next attached to the hotel (5 steps off of Avenida 5th, on Calle 4). Carboncitas is crazy good and I hate to say \"cheap\" as that can mean not do good, but this place ROCKS for the food and drink. At happy hour they have TWO tacos al carbon for 11 pesos. Do the math, that is two for a dollar. And they have the most awesome 55 peso huge margaritas ever. They bring you the best chips and multiple sauces for the tacos, including their famous pumpkin sauce, pico de galo, guacamole sauce, mmmm. When you stay at the hotel you get half priced breakfast here. Considering that all the other places I stayed give you a crappy free bfast of toast and coffee and juice, getting Carboncitas breakfasts for half price is a very good deal. Their omlets (esp. the chorizo ones) and fantastic. The special cinnamon french toast is yummy. I got one of those two and coffee (free refills) and a mango/pina/orange smothie for breakfast and was set until happy hour time every day. Now for the hotel. I asked by email for a quiet room in back and one that is cool, as it is blazing this time of yr there. What did I get? For 55 dollars (and get this, the 4th night was free) I got a huge room w/two queen beds and enough room to store the bar stools and stereo I bought for my new condo in Playa, and still had enough room to dance around the room solo. The AC was fantastic, as opposed to the ones at the other hotels I stayed in which just did not cool the rooms enough. Great TV reception, unlike two other hotels I stayed in. Several English stations and movie stations- I had something good to watch every night before drifting off to sleep after my nightly Carboncitas margarita. The staff is very nice, very friendly. I met two of the owners and also Roberto at the front desk was particularly sweet, helping me haul up the stuff I bought for the condo. Housekeepers were good and trustworthy. I left my IPad and the new stereo and stuff in the room and nothing was touched. I tipped them nicely when I left. Love this place. If my new condo can not handle everyone who comes to visit, I am recomending El Cielo to my visitors. For $165 I got 4 nights of bliss there. Oh and the rooftop is cool also. Only drawback is no pool, but with the caribbean one half block away, and AC that blasts like a fridge in the room (and celing fans), who cares. Oh also hot water, although it takes a few min. to get hot- don't give up, just wait a bit, it will get hot. Watch out for other hotels in this price range in Playa. Some look good on internet but are skany or not so friendly once you get there.

The staff were all very friendly and responsive and the owner took the time to give us his personal recommendations for dining. We loved all that we tried and hope to get to the rest of the list next year! We especially appreciated the water cooler station in the hallway outside our room. This is genius - every time we drew from it I gave thanks that I picked Cielo. I found the hotel mostly quiet but one night several couples were staying in the room next door and we could hear their party pretty well. Since that could happen anywhere I just waited them out (son had no problem sleeping thru). The beds are not pillow mattresses but felt ok after walking around ruins all day. The air and fan both worked well. My only small criticism would be of the adjoining restaurant, Carboncitos. A limited breakfast is included for hotel guests. We thought it adequate and inexpensive with bacon and other supplements from the regular menu but on 2 mornings we had hoped to catch a quick bite from the hotel guest menu before hopping on a bus. They couldn't provide their simple breakfast in the 30 minutes we allowed either day (couldn't be more time due to their opening time).

The hotel is charming and beautiful, but it was the people who made our stay so amazing. Miguel, Roberto, and Andrea, who all work the front desk are fabulous. Andrea is so helpful and cheerful; it was delight to come back to the hotel each day. In fact, we started to call the hotel \"home.\" If you want advice about what dishes to order in restaurants, then ask Andrea. She has a genuine love for culinary delights that is contagious. Steve, a managing owner, was great too. It was obvious that he cares about the hotel. He treats his staff with respect; to me this speaks volumes about his character. He was also exceedingly helpful to us. He has many plans for the hotel that I am sure he will enact. I, however, did not see any problems that needed fixing. I thought it was perfect. We stayed at Hotel Cielo for three nights then headed over to Cozumel and then back to the Hotel Cielo. The people at Hotel Cielo worked with our unique schedule including a late departure for our flight home. The room was clean and nicely decorated. We did not notice any noise that interrupted our sleep. At night there was some music early in the evening but not later than about 9pm. In the morning the shops open at about 9am which accounted for some noise, but it did not bother us. The breakfast at Carboncitos was beyond our expectations. We expected some dried up muffins and coffee. The breakfast included choices of different freshly prepared dishes. If I could do it again, I would have eaten more dinners at Carboncitos. The prices were reasonable and the food is delicious. In fact there is a happy hour that is an excellent value that we should have taken advantage of. Across the street there are some shops. In the morning Maurice is there and he is great. If you can, I would try to give his shop some business. He won us over by never asking us to buy anything but instead sharing his love for his country. In all, we would stay at Hotel Cielo again without even looking at other options.

I have stayed in PDC many times, always in a different hotel. This property is beautiful. It's charming and house-like. Beautiful garden, tiles, woodwork and ironwork. The rooms are spacious and spotless. There are several things that if fixed could make this hotel even nicer, such as better bedding, lighting and closets. This hotel is a great budget option for those that don't mind uncomfortable beds and can sleep through anything. The hotel is in a busy, noisy part of PDC. The service at this hotel is top notch. All of the staff are gracious and accomodating. I had better service here than in some 5 star hotels. Kudos to all of the staff for their kindness! My stay started off in a great room at the front of the hotel. I had a balcony and view of the water. The room was HUGE and comfortable. The first night was miserable though. A store owner across the street from the hotel allowed full-on construction to be done in his store from MIDNIGHT to 5am!! That's right, drilling, hammering, voices shouting over the drilling. Unbelievable that a business owner could be that thoughtless and stupid. I went downstairs to the front desk at 1am to complain. They did go over and talk to the construction workers, but it didn't stop. Needless to say, I did not sleep the first night. In the morning, I asked to be moved to a room at the back of the hotel and was promptly given a different room at a lower rate. The room was nice, but darker and smaller. The armoire in the room reeked of mildew and I couldn't get the smell out even after I ran the AC all day. I ended up closing the doors to the armoire and that seemed to help. The bed in the first room I'd had was comfortable enough, but the bed in the smaller room was awful. It was lumpy and worn, making it hard to sleep comfortably or soundly. The noise at the back of the hotel was much less than the front, but I was able to get some sleep with the windows closed and the earplugs in. The other odd thing was the position of the faucets directly over the top of bathroom sink (I've attached a photo). It was impossible to bend down to wash your face or brush your teeth without smacking your head on the faucets. Quirky and annoying. The amenities at this hotel are TV, AC, hot showers with good pressure, free wifi (which always worked), in room safe (which really is too small to put anything but your wallet into), free beach towels (with refundable deposit) and a continental breakfast at the attached restaurant. There is a convenience store and laundry close by. I would recommend this hotel to those on a budget, who don't mind noise and uncomfortable beds. I probably would not return as I the older I get the more I value my sleep!

So much more authentic and comfortable than high-priced, cookie-cutter resort rooms that are miles from the action of 5th Ave. You just can't get better than Hotel Cielo with regard to location, price, staff, etc., etc. Upon leaving, our ONLY \"complaint\" (if you can call it that) is that there really should be some lounge chairs on the rooftop. There really isn't a common area like a lobby where guests can sit and relax except for the rooftop, and there are no comfy chairs up there... Which is a shame because it's such a nice view. I would definitely stay at Hotel Cielo again.

Real wood windows that opened, double wooden french doors that opened to the balcony that was furnished with comfy chairs and flowering plants. Below our room was the rightfully-acclaimed Carboncito's, whose friendly staff was eager to satisfy our hunger, and quench our thirst. We learned the hard way that the stores in Playa are prohibited from selling wine and liquor after a certain hour on Sunday. Not so with restaurants, as Adrian guided us to a wonderful bottle of chardonnay which spent the evening with us on our balcony. All of the staff was eager to help us with the dozens of questions we asked, and constantly inquired as to our well-being. We even got to meet the hotelier-extraordinaire Russell, who graciously interrupted his own dinner to greet us. It spoke volumes for the character of management when the staff recounted events that occurred last year at this time, during the height of the Swine Flu scare. As many hotels and restaurants were laying off employees, or closing altogether, the principals of Cielo/Carboncito's retained the entire staff, dipping into personal savings in order to do so.

Another warning, your room will be very clean, but don't expect unnecessary amenities such as hairdryers, irons, flat screen TV (although there is a small TV with satellite), etc. Lastly, the website advertises the rooftop lounge, but this is in fact closed - if you want a patio or any sort of view out to the street or ocean, make sure you ask for it when making your reservation.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cHotel Cielo-The only place to stay in Playa Del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "jandNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR53814566", "Content": "Great location, near everything \u2013 restaurants, beach, nightlife etc, yet secluded enough so that you aren\u2019t interrupted by the hustle and bustle.

I had arranged a transfer from the airport to the hotel. I was worried because my plane was late & I was hoping they would wait for me. While in florida, I called the U.S. (718) number for the hotel and the front desk assured me that the transportation would wait. Sure enough, Once I exited the airport there was the driver holding up a card with my name on it. Upon arrival at Playa, the hotel was very easy to find. I was promptly shown to my room; changed, showered and went to the restaurant for a bite and a big margarita. The room that I was given, room 12, was a bright room with 3 or 4 windows that faced the central outdoor hallway of the building.The room was very comfortable with a nice firm matress. The bathroom was small but more than adequet with nice tile & stone work in the shower. The room was clean with an A/C & ceiling fan. The sink that was placed in the room was a bit ackward though because it was set far back against the wall and it was a bit hard to shave but I just attribute this to the quaintness & charm of the hotel. I found the staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. There was no communication problem with the front desk staff except for the overnight person who didnt quite understand me when I wanted to check out the night before I left since I had an early morning flight. I decided to wait till the morning, we settled up and everything was fine. The ammenities of the hotel consist of a wonderful garden rooftop lounge. Since I was travelling alone, I found this roof top a tranquil escape from the busy 5th ave where I could sit and take in the sunset, have a drink and read a book. The restaurant 'carboncitos' was very tasty, authentic mexican fare. In fact I heard many people that came to eat there raving about the food. I didnt know how good it was so I had no expectations & was pleasantly surprised. It was a bit off 5th ave enough not to be noisy while taking in the sights of the people walking up and down that very busy street. I ate there once for dinner and once or twice for lunch. The salsa sampler platter was amazing. Ive never had pumpkin salsa which was very delicate, especially compared to the other salsas on the plate. My favorite was the salsa verde and the darker red smokey salsa, of which I forget the name. I found the waitstaff very capable, one of the waiters seemed a bit shy when it came to speaking english but still very attentive. And yes there was a patrons' sink which is just outside of the bathroom - Have no idea how that one reviewer could miss it? All in all I had a great stay. The rooms were clean, quaint and comfortable. This is not a luxury hotel, thats not what I was looking for and the hotel management doesnt try to be anything more than what they are. Just a great local place to enjoy Playa.

The centeral location was also a huge plus for us. The free wireless internet worked well and was great for occasionally keeping in touch with home. From my first e mail inquiring about a reservation thru our entire stay the staff, especially Roberto and Henry were very helpful and friendly. They would even research the internet when we asked a question they could not answer. We were in room 18, a second floor balcony room facing the street. The room was clean and spacious for the 3 of us. The shower was good, although you might have to wait a minute or 2 for the water to warm up. The mattresses were firm. There were a few minor annoyances. The wooden armoire for hanging clothes had an awful musty smell. The smell did not seem to linger on our clothes, so as I said it was a minor annoyance. The room smelled fresh with the a/c on. The colorful curtains that you see in pictures on the internet are the only thing blocking the light. There were no shades, so it was bright in the morning. We got used to it but it might be tough for some people. I can't speak to the brightness of other rooms. I think some may only have windows to the courtyard, which would be darker and quieter. We encluntered the street noise discussed in some previous reviews. Between about 11 and 11:30 pm the street quiets down, but that's when the garbage and perhaps some delivery trucks show up. The first night was rough, but we got used to it and all the positives of the hotel much outweighed the minor annoyances. They have a water cooler by the front desk. So, either bring bottles form home or buy your first bottle and save it to refill. The breakfast was really good. A potential problem for some is that breakfast does not start until 9:00. They serve until noon. The free breakfast offered limited choices. I thought the French toast was excellent. They also offer pancakes, which are okay and eggs rancheros or Mexicana (hot and hotter). Breakfast inclues coffee or tea. The fresh squeezed orange juice was well worth the extra 25 pesos to us. The hotel offers beach towels free for a $20.00 deposit which is returned when you return the towel. We found the beach north of Avenue Constituyentes much nicer than the beach near the hotel. If you want to just lie in the sun near the hotel I recommend Yan y TAn, which is the beach restaurant directly on the left as you reach the beach from the hotel. They had good, reasonably priced food and drink. An umbrella and 2 chairs rent for 80 pesos. At that point the beach is narrow, rocky and has some seaweed issues. North of Constituyentes (about 19th Ave) the beach is wider and the water seems cleaner with no seaweed or rocks. One day was cloudy so we just threw towels on the sand. The other sunny day we tried to get into Mamita's Beach club, but they had no umbrellas left to rent. The next hotel south is Kool and just south of Kool is a beach area with palapas left over from some business that closed. We took advantage of the free shade and walked next door to Kool for drinks and the bano. We were surrounded by locals and ex pats. If you are wondering if the hotel is safe I can tell you this. The room doors don't lock automatically. You have to push the button on the door knob. Several times we went out and forgot to lock the door. Nothing was ever missing including my son's lap top.

We stayed here one night before heading over to Cozumel. First of all, I had emailed them a week ahead of time to confirm our reservations and was assured they had us down for one night. When we arrived, the man at the counter looked confused and I was told that they had us down for the previous night and that they had been expecting then. Thankfully I had printed out all of our emails for all the places we were staying and showed him our confirmation and that we did indeed make reservations for this night. He looked confused and wasn't sure what to do but then said our room would be ready in 20 min. Well, we were lucky enough to get room #1, a ground floor room in the back of the hotel right next to the restaurant next door. It was dark and musty and very noisy because when we went in the bathroom, it sounded like our shower went right into the middle of the restaurant. We could hear everything that was going on and hear what the waiters were saying. Needless to say, we were not happy. My husband complained and thankfully there was another room available a couple floors up. At least in that way they were helpful. So we moved to room #16 ( i think) and it was alright for one night, but very loud and noisy from the restaurant next door and the doors and windows were not very soundproof. It was our most dissappointing choice for hotels. And when we checked out, we were told we owed $94, but I had already made a deposit earlier.

Internet/phone service place right next door -- and very cheap to check emails (unfortunately I had to keep in touch with work when I was there...ugh!). The restaurant was delish, they offer free breakfast if you stay in the hotel, but the place doesn't open till 9AM so I had to go across the street to a breakfast buffet that opened at 7 (in order to get in as much beach time as possible!). I'm a vegetarian and I found all of the restaurants I went to in Playa quite accommodating -- but be aware most of the restaurants use pork for flavoring in the beans. It is a bit noisy at night in the area in general, but not so bad after 11PM at the hotel, especially since it is on a side street off of 5th Ave (which is the main drag that stretches parallel to the beach. My room overlooked the front entry/courtyard. I didn't really need the A/C, but the room was equipped with it and also a ceiling fan. I would have liked it if they gave you a bottle of water in the room, since you can't drink the water, but they did have a water cooler downstairs so you could fill your own bottle. Other than towels in the room, you could ask for beach towels. They gave a bar of soap but no other toiletries. It's a tourist area, so there were a number of stores in the area to buy them, though. I was on the second floor, in a room with 2 beds. The upstairs rooms are not good for those with disabilities ... not sure about the downstairs rooms. The staircase doesn't have banisters, but is walled so you could lean. I got a touch of vertigo going up to the roof, though.

There is also no common area in the hotel - the rooftop bar and terrace looked like it had been struck by a cruise missile. Obviously some major refurbishment is taking place, but nothing changed there during my stay so you will have to ask when these works are due to be completed. Without somewhere to meet fellow guests (I was a solo traveller) it's just a place where you can sleep, noise permitting, and no more. I ate twice in Carboncitas, the restaurant next door where breakfast is provided, and it was poor. The staff are friendly and Henry is very helpful and knowledgeable about all things to see and do in Playa. He made some great recommendations and did all he could to help when the room I was due to move to from box no. 13 became unavailable, but the bottom line is there are far better places to stay in Playa for the money.", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and lovely staff!!!\u201d", "Author": "kaede2007", "ReviewID": "UR21683329", "Content": "So for my moms 60th bday, we decided to take a trip together and after a bit of research and reading wonderful reviews on trip advisor, we decided to stay at Hotel Cielo in Playa del Carmen. We flew into Cancun on Nov 1 and after about a 45min bus ride on the ADO bus, conviniently located just a couple blocks from the hotel, arrived safely where we were greeted by Henry with his warm smile and showed to our room on the second floor, which was to be our home away from home for the next 7 nights. The rooms are quite basic and a wise choice for budget concious travellers with beds, tv, a/c, daily housekeeping,basic ammenities so bear in mind-if u are looking for luxury, this may not be the hotel for u. This hotel has a great location. It is a block and a half from the beach, a block from the colorful streets of 5th ave, where u can have margaritas on an open patio, try one of the many different mexican restaurants, listen to mariachi bands playing music, or shop for everything from sunglasses, to postcards to souveniers as a reminder from your holiday. Henry and the front desk staff are very helpful with offering advice on authentic restaurants off the beaten track, giving directions with easy to follow maps and helping out with planning day trips in and around the Mayan Riviera, everything from visiting the ruins of Tulum to sightseeing around Cozumel for the day. Right beside the hotel is a great restaurant called Carbonchitos. The staff are friendly and efficient and we had breakfast included in our hotel package along with probably some of the best coffee ive ever had... So overall, our stay at Hotel Cielo was fantastic, the only thing i would mention are bring toiletries such as soap, shampoo etc as they do not provide in the room. The rooms can sometimes get a bit noisy as it opens onto the main street and the walls arent very thick so if ur a light sleeper u have been told. I would definitely stay here again and recommend all my friends and family to do the same.

Still, it's free so there is very little cause for complaint. Variety would have made it perfect of course. Overall, this was a great stay and great value for money in Playa. Playa itself is amazing, the beaches are not as beautiful as in Tulum, since there is more development here but the town is really fun.

My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Cielo from July 4th-11th, we came across the hotel here on TripAdvisor and after reading all the great reviews, we decided to book it. We ended up loving this hotel just like everyone else did. HOTEL- Awesome is really the only way to put it. The hotel staff were really really great. Henry and Roberto were really great. We became good friends with Henry, and actually invited him to come stay visit us in the states. He was extremely helpful in every single way, and he was so nice. He even helped me out when my boyfriend became very sick one night! We got to go out with Henry a couple of the nights too and had alot of fun with him. Russell, the second owner was really nice too and he made sure we were satisfied with everything. The waiters at Carboncita's were all very kind and always had a smile on their faces. The maid's did a really good job cleaning our messy room every day, and it was pleasant to come back from a long day to fresh towels, and made beds every day. We stayed in room 21, which looked over 5th ave and had an ocean view, which was awesome! I loved walking out on the balcony and seeing 5th ave and the beach all right there. I really liked the decor of the room, and the hotel in general. It gave it a very mexican feel, which we both really liked. We had a problem with the hot water one night (to be quite honest...Ive had a hot water problem at every single hotel Ive stayed at, even the top notch ones so this wasn't surpring to me) but my boyfriend told Russell about it and it was fixed very very quickly...whereas at other hotels Ive experienced having to wait days until it was fixed. Some people said the beds were really hard, but I didnt think so. I thought they were good. Some people also said the pillows werent that great, but again I'll have to disagree...I liked them, and my boyfriend can get really picky and he was fine too. The hotel has a very cute boutique style to it...really nice, definitely a great place to stay. LOCATION- The location of this hotel could not be any more perfect. It is in the center of everything (Restaurants, clubs, bars, shops, beach). I read in a review that was recently posted here that it is too noisy and loud...and I have to completely disagree. I stayed in the ocean view room, which overlooked 5th ave and didnt think it was noisy at all. Of course there are bands playing and things like that...but typically people arent holed up in their rooms in the afternoon and evening, they're out shopping or eating dinner or out on a tour. By the time 11 pm rolls around its very very quiet. All of the bars that are still loud are located a few blocks down and you definitely cannot hear them. If you think noise is a problem, just request a room towards the back of the hotel. The beach is incredibly close (way less than half a block even). When Im picking a hotel to stay at for vacation, location is most important to me, so if this is true for you---this hotel is perfect for you. My boyfriend and I like to be in the middle of all the action, and walking distance from everything, and we definitely were. BEACH-- I really liked the beach...I was never there in the early morning, but during the day theres definitely alot of people there. There are plenty of beach chairs that you can sit on (for a small amount of money) Towards 3-6 it gets less crowded (and even so its not insanely crowded like some beachs can get). A few people told me if you take a cab about 10 minutes from 5th avenue there is a beach that is pretty private and really quiet, so if you're into that you can always take a cab there for 5 bucks or so. Bring lots of sunblock if you burn easily, because the Mexican sun has no mercy at all. The other owner of the hotel put it nicely....if you can see the sun, the sun can see you! BARS/CLUBS- They're EVERYWHERE, and they're so much fun. My particular favorite was ULA-GULA...its really hard to miss because its right on the corner of one of the streets and its illuminated in yellow. Roberto and Louis make the most unbelievable and delicious drinks. I live 10 minutes from manhattan, which have great bars...but NOTHING in NYC even compares to this place. Roberto is leaving to live in london in a few days but louis should still be around for a while, so go get some drinks there!! The two bartenders there are young, fun, and outgoing and will make sure you're having a good time. They also have a restaurant upstairs thats fantastic. One block down from Ula-Gula is like a mini upscale cancun, bars and clubs and a bunch of crazy fun there..check out Cocomaya, they have Cabana's on the beach! If you arent into the loud music and crazyness theres plenty of other bars there that are very laid back and much more quiet for you to go to also. RESTAURANTS- Carboncita's is right below Cielo, which is perfect because they have THE best french toast EVER! Im not sure if breakfast is included for everyone, but it was for us...so dont miss out on it, it was really good!! Not only that but they really had some awesome mexican food there. It was better then any place on 5th ave. So if you love some really good mexican, EAT HERE! Henry also suggested we go to El Fogon (alot less touristy then alot of place on 5th) which was really good too..but I still liked Carboncita's better. It is definitely worth trying though. My boyfriend and I ate at many, many different restuarants there. We also really liked Blue Lobster (good italian), an argentinian steak house called Sur, and Ula-Gula. If you love sushi check out SUSHI GINZA...its VERY good (ask henry where its located, he'll help you out). They just opened a week ago and really have awesome sushi and beautiful restaurant! TOURS- Henry booked us a tour with Rio Secreto, and I have to say that this was the most amazing experience ever. Its a tour of the cenotes (caves). This particular cenote was discovered only two years ago and they only started giving tours of it 3 months ago, so its brand new. Its absolutely beautiful. We also did snorkeling, which was good but Ive done better. If you like snorkling go on the ferry (locacted on 5th ave) and take it to cozumel (about a 40 min ferry ride)...they have awesome snorkling there. SHOPPING- There are stores absolutely everywhere...so if you love shopping, bring some extra cash because they have some very very cool stores there with some awesome items! Even if you dont plan on buying anything there, its nice to just walk around and check out the different stores. Lastly, the only suggestion I would make is to put a pool on the rooftop, its really pretty up there! I dont really care about pools when I have the gorgeous beach right in front of me, but some people like to take quick dips...so it would be perfect for that. We will definitely be coming back to Hotel Cielo in December and we cant wait!!! We love Playa and think its perfect in every single way (except maybe the brutal sun in July)...come visit!

Both my husband and I agree that LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! You could not ask for anything more. This beautiful hotel could not be more convenient to anything you could possibly be looking for. And beleve me, we asked Henry where to find everything our hearts desired. From Walmart, to a laundrymat, to the best place to go dancing late into the night. The staff at Hotel Cielo was more than happy to tell us where to go, and how to get there. We met Russell on our first night there, when dining at his restaurant Carboncitos (which by the way as the greatest guacamole and limonadas!! The staff is always so helpful and eager to please). We enjoyed their tacos, and mentioned to him that we were vegetarians. A few days later, when we ran into him (which we did all around Playa!! It's such a small community that it's easy to meet up with the folks you've met along your trip/excursions/meetings etc...) Russell recommended a restaurant that had a huge selection of vegetarian plates ~ La Kalaka, which was just a few blocks down from the hotel. What was so cool about the recommendation was we were about to head over to his restaurant for our meal, but he gladly shared his business w/another fellow community business, so that WE could experience something new and delicious. Very cool, and much kudos to him and his integrity. I could write a novel about how much we loved this place ~ just know that staying at Hotel Cielo, you will be taken well care of! The owner and his staff will go out of your way to make your stay comfortable, relaxing, and memorable! ** As for the hard beds... both my husband and I did not find them hard or uncomfortable at all!

We went on vacation to enjoy Playa del Carmen... not stay hours in our rooms, although you could!! ** And a huge thank you to Russell and Henry ~ I had terribly injured my ankle before arriving in Playa, and every night I was given a hefty bag of ice to help with the swelling.

We originally planned to stay at Luna Blue, but they required a 3 night minimum on advance reservations. Rather than gambling that they'd still have availability, we chose Cielo based on the reviews here. Our overall experience was very good. The staff was always available and helpful, particularly Henry and Roberto. They were both genuinely enjoyable guys and were always eager to help. We also met the owner, Russell, and he didn't hesitate to stop and help us figure out plans for the day. We stayed in one of the larger rooms (28) with a King bed and two doubles. There were just two of us, but I believe the only rooms with King beds are the family rooms. Our room is the one in the photos on the hotel's website, and it is positioned upstairs in the front of the hotel with a balcony overlooking 4th street. The room itself was clean and comfortable. The air conditioner is very loud, but it kept the room plenty cool. We did get a good bit of street noise at night, but it wasn't a problem for us. Honestly the noise of the AC came in handy to drown that out when we were ready to sleep. Others may prefer to be in the back of the hotel, where I'm told it's quieter. The only real negatives we experienced in the room were the beds and pillows. As others have written, the beds are pretty hard. We actually found the pillows to be a bigger issue. They're more like lumpy couch cushions than typical sleeping pillows. Fortunately we both brought our own pillows, but we likely would have purchased a couple from Wal-Mart if we hadn't. There are only a couple of other issues that seem worth mentioning. One is that the hotel does not provide beach towels. We were actually misinformed about this by a staff member our first afternoon, and we took some hotel towels to the public beach. When we returned, someone else explained they prefer we not do that. He said they used to provide beach towels but don't any longer. This means you'll need your own towels (Wal-Mart is about an eight block walk) or that you'll want to stick to beach clubs where they're provided (at a price, of course). Second, there are no safes in the rooms. Usually when we went out, I left my laptop and our passports with Roberto or Henry at the front desk. They have a safe there, and though my computer (a macbook) didn't fit in it, they locked it in the cabinet. This was fine with me, though I'm sure some would be less comfortable with it. We found Carboncitos, the restaurant downstairs, to be very good. We ate there both mornings for breakfast (which is included) and loved the french toast. We also had dinner there our last night and really liked the tacos. Of 4-5 places we ate in Playa, Carboncitos was both the cheapest and the best food we had. The pastor is great. We also had drinks from the bar and took them up to our room both nights. The rooftop lounge was closed while we were there (I'm not clear how temporary that is), but we did spend a little time sitting up there the last night. It's a nice little view of the town and Cozumel across the way. Beaches... We spent a couple of hours at the public beach the first day. It was fine, but you definitely have to pay if you want any sort of chairs. The second day we took a cab further north on the beach (which was only about $2 USD) and spent the afternoon at Kool Beach Club (formerly Tukan). We rented a couple of chairs and towels, had a few drinks, and enjoyed the afternoon. The beach was a little nicer there if you're willing to pay for it. I believe the chairs were $7 each and the towels were maybe $5. One other random piece of advice - be sure you bring all the sunblock you think you'll need. We walked to Wal-Mart the first night for a few items, and we found that sunblock was much more expensive than it is in the US. They know who the market is for that there. Thanks to all the folks at Hotel Cielo for a nice stay in Playa. We wouldn't hesitate to stay with you again or recommend you to friends.", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, FL", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel in a great location with wonderful staff!\u201d", "Author": "flyingphish", "ReviewID": "UR17252666", "Content": "Absolutely loved this place!

The ADO bus station is a 10 minute walk away so getting to and from the airport and other places is very convenient. There is also a Walmart (with a bakery!) several blocks away that is within walking distance. Carboncitos, the restaurant downstairs, serves really good tacos, fresh fruit smoothies, and the best guacamole. I tried guacamole from two other restaurants in the area and was greatly disappointed after having it at Carboncitos. Mario was our usual waiter and he is very polite and attentive. Overall, I was satisfied and happy with this hotel. I would return and recommend this place to friends. However, from my perspective, some cons about this hotel might be: - no in-room safety box, mini fridge, or blow dryer - only one small mirror in each room - the bed is kind of small for two people - some rooms have windows facing the walkway so curtains cannot be pulled back to get some sun - drilling/construction noises on some early mornings woke us up", "Date": "June 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel!\u201d", "Author": "crum23", "ReviewID": "UR15871290", "Content": "My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Cielo.

The hotel itself is small and unassuming and though it sits right off the main drag, it wasn't loud. The area of 5th ave where the hotel is located shuts down earlier than places farther down the strip which allowed us to get some sleep back that our jobs and children had taken away. The rooms were quaint. The window AC unit was old but cold and the bed could of used an upgrade. The free breakfast in the morning from Carboncitos, the hotel's restaurant, was pretty good, offering you a choice of pancakes, french toast, or eggs as well as a good dinner menu at reasonable prices. Try the pastor(seasoned pork), it is the best in Playa. The hotel has a cool roof top lounge that is very relaxing and almost zen-like, not to mention the great view. Overall, we loved it and would definitley stay there again. Playa is a great beach town and the surrounding areas have so much to offer, such as going to see cenotes or to Tulum, with its unique Mayan ruins on the edge of cliffs overlooking white sand beaches and turquoise waters. And there is even more if you venture further inland. A week wasn't enough to do all the things we wanted to do.
