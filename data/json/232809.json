The hotel has a good( but quiet) location, right beside the Arguiles Metro Station that has two great routes to all the main tourist areas and provides easy access to many others. Just a few minutes walking from the Temple of Debod and the Parque del Ouste, 15 minutes walk to the plaza Espana and Gran Via and across the road from Zara, Mango and El Corte Ingles where you can shop to your hearts content. Very clean and well laid out the fully air-conditioned room was ideal for our needs. The staff are friendly and helpful at all times and were really nice to our children, especially since none of us are great Spanish speakers. Did not have breakfast at the hotel as we liked to be out before the sun got too hot but there were many other local options around if required. If you are staying be sure to use the roof terrace, it's almost a secret. It was hardly used while we were there but is wonderful for sunbathing or lovely and cool for a drink on a warm summers evening and has amazing views across Madrid and the surrounding area. Hope to return again and would definitely stay here again if in Madrid", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cgood and bad\u201d", "Author": "Birdparker", "ReviewID": "UR131811758", "Content": "Stayed here for 5 days with husband and young children to be nearby for a family christening - the layout and finish of the rooms was of a high quality, however a few things were lacking. Aircon was terrible, virtually non-existent and from other reviews this appears to be the norm for some rooms. My daughter's bed was a pull out which had a low shelf directly above that she would hit her head on if she attempted to sit up in bed! No tea/coffee in the room which may be normal for spain and the tv was obviously all spanish channels. Seems to be a trend at hotels now to include the absolute minimum of notepad paper in rooms, this was no exception. bathroom was fine but shower temperature extremely difficult to control so a frustrating experience all round. No fridge either which is a big problem considering the no aircon and the outside temp. Downstairs had free pc with internet but only one which was inevitably always in use. Breakfast was fine although all continental, nothing hot/cooked. All in all it was fine - just fine - but i've stayed in much better hotels in my time.

The main downside was that the air conditioning seemed a little weak, and had to run constantly. In the middle of my last night it broke, and the room heated up. I solved the temperature problem by opening the window, but that created a sound problem, as it seems the Madrid nightlife doesn't die down until 5am!

Its only shortcoming, if you are looking for a centrally located hotel, is that it is in the Arguelles neighborhood, not far from Complutense University of Madrid, so, walking up Gran Via and La Princesa would take a good half hour or more from Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol (but it's half an hour or more of great people watching, historical architecture, and window shopping!). On the other hand, it is a slightly more residential, quieter, and safe-feeling neighborhood with lots of college and high school students chatting and lazing about. It is also near the #6, and kind of near the #4 Metro lines (Arguelles station). This hotel is very family-friendly: there is a front desk area devoted to kids, with stuffed animals on nearby shelves, and the breakfast room has a kids' area with pint-sized bowls, plates, donuts and cereals. A bowl of apples is available in the lobby for snacking. There is a gym here, which you usually only find in high-end hotels so you can work off all those pasteles, tapas, and cervezas!

So I'm complaining and trying to have my money back since then (almost one month!) and I still don't have any answer. I payed twice. How come the hotel doesn't notice that??? In addition I have to say that some people at the reception are not helpful at all and the room they gave me was also awful (with view to the fire stairs and dark).

Our room was quite spacious by European standards and included a separate little children's room which ours greatly enjoyed. The beds were comfortable and the property was clean and bright. The location, while not super central, is fine as well: there is a metro stop (with 3 lines) within one block, a department store/supermarket across the street, several reasonably priced restaurants/sandwich shops, and you can easily reach the Royal Palace by walking through the pleasant Parque del Oeste. The breakfast buffet had nice variety and was a good deal at 10 Euros per adult (if you prepay at check-in). The fitness room was surprisingly well equipped for a three star hotel and an internet terminal was available and worked well. Finally, the personel was always friendly and willing to help as much as they could. The big problem that was hard to look past was the air conditioning. It was simply inadequate (even when left on full blast constantly) to cool the room which was warm and stuffy, especially during the evening and early night. This made for poor sleeping conditions. The staff was sympathetic and offered us a different room but it didn't seem to be any better, just smaller. The hotel, while quite clean, as mentioned above, does seem in need of some refreshing to counter evident signs of wear and tear. Also, on arrival we found that only one bed was made for our boys. Even though we offered to do this ourselves, not much could be done because the maids were gone for the day and the reception had no access to clean sheets and could only offer us an extra pillow. We improvised and the bed was made the following day but the episode suggests poor planning by the hotel. The bottom line is that for the price that we paid, we probably could have done better.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cDecent Hotel - Some Caveats\u201d", "Author": "puckbunnyLA", "ReviewID": "UR105500630", "Content": "I stayed at the Tirol in room 305 for a business trip in April 2011 for 8 nights. The hotel was close to our office (less than five minutes walking) and it is also within a block of the Arguelles metro station; you easily get around most of the city by going a few stops and changing lines. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the front desk service varied from person to person. The good: -- Location - while not in the heart of the city, it is in a nice, clean, safe neighborhood close to metro; convenient to our office -- Room was a corner room - was spacious and clean The bad: -- The room (facing Urquijo) was consistently noisy -- I can deal with that except: -- The air conditioning was non-existent (due to the noise, I couldn't keep the window open). Now I'll chalk this up to language differences but when I asked the front desk, I was told the hotel did not have air conditioning; a different colleague was told air conditioning is turned on later in the year; either way we all experienced some sleepless nights where the air was stifling but we couldn't open a window due to the noise -- The room doors didn't have the mechanism that lets them close softly; in the wee hours morning as people return from bars/restaurants I would be jolted awake by doors slamming shut -- The hotel charges 1 Euro for each usage of the safe -- If it matters to you - toiletries provided varied from room to room (I had body lotion + conditioner but a colleague was told no conditioner was supplied to any of the guests) The hotel is a good value for the price but there were some quirks that I could have done without.

Since we were traveling with two young teens, we opted for the \"family room,\" which was two pretty sizable beds pushed together for the adults, and a bunk bed for the two kids. The room was surprisingly a little bigger than I had expected, given that I'm always expecting something very cramped in Europe. But this was not the case here -- the kids loved their bunk bed and our beds were totally fine. Space was a little tight (biggest complaint: lack of drawer space for a 4-person room), but really we completely made due. The bathroom was totally fine as well. Every day when we returned, the room was spotless. While the hotel's location is not dead center in old Madrid or next to the Prado, it really did not matter. You are a block from the Arguelles metro station and you can get about anywhere within a couple of stops. As a matter of fact, on Christmas Day, my family and I walked straight down to Plaza D'Espana, the Royal Palace and then into the heart of Plaza Mayor... and it was truly a grand experience. The neighborhood is still quite nice. Every morning, my family and I went to Cafe Es Tea across the street for a simple inexpensive breakfast and off we went! The T3 Tirol offers tremendous value and we kept saying to ourselves: this is quite a deal. It was certainly more economical that we all stayed in the family room as opposed to splitting up into two separate doubles. However, there is a \"Business Corner\" right near the front desk where you can use the PC for free Internet access. The only minor quibble we had is that there is really no official \"concierge\" for a this hotel, and that would not be a big deal except for the fact that the quality of front desk help varies depending on who is on duty. Most of the folks who work the front desk were terrific. One of the front desk employees seemed to be from the \"I don't know\" camp. When we asked him for a suggestion of anyplace to eat around Plaza D'Espana, which is a 10 minute walk from the hotel, and he knew exactly where it was, he could not name one place. When my wife's ATM card was not returned from a local bank machine, my wife asked if he could call the bank to speak with them in Spanish to make sure they didn't do anything reckless with the card -- he refused (my wife asked a woman on another shift to do the same thing, and she couldn't have been more happier to do it).

I work in Hotel business myself and to be honest I don't like to complain , but my complaint fell in deaf ears and even I asked for the Manager (Mr. Gonzales) to contact me, he was not bother. On my second night there at about 05.45 am I was woken up by a couple coming into my room. When they realized that the room is occupied they left, leaving the door wide open. To be honest I was afraid for my safety, I moved the table against the door and I rang Reception asking for an explanation. The girl in Reception was very rude and abrupt saying that she can't explain anything and what I was telling her is not possible. You can imagine that I could not get any sleep after that. I went down to Reception at about 09.00 am on 22nd March asking the Receptionist ( a man this time) to speak to the Manager. He told me that the Manager is not there and he is not going to be in till next day. I asked for the Duty Manager or someone else in charge and I was told there is no Duty Manager. He was fully aware of the situation, as the night Receptionist informed him about my complaint. He was absolutely not interested telling me that he can't do anything. I told him that using the card-keys he can print a report to check what key was used to open my room at 05.45 am and I offered myself to show him how to do it in case he did not know, because this is a general system used by the all hotels and as I mentioned before I work in Hotels for more then 9 years. Then he said that is not possible. At this point I was very frustrated and I asked him '' do you really think that I am telling you lies'' and I could not believe it when he answered '' YES''. I was fuming and I was on the verge of punching him. I told him that I would like to be contacted by the Manager as soon as he will be in the building. No manager contacted me. The same Receptionist was on duty when I checked out and again he showed a dreadful customer service, talking to a taxi driver during the whole check-out process, not even ''have a nice day'' or just ''good by''. It was appalling. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced.

This hotel was quite small, it didnt have a bar but a couple of doors down was a pub - this was a perfect meeting place for us girlies, as we were on a Hen Weekend. The hotel was situated in the business district of Madrid, it was right on top of all the shops - Zara, Mango etc. To walk to Sol sqaure it took a good half an hour stroll, however there is an excellent metro service (so my friends told me, I didnt get the chance to use it) and I think it costs 1 euro for an all day ticket. Sol has a lovely square to visit with a cosmpolitan feel, I would recommend it for lunch and a beer after shopping, sightseeing. For the evening I would go to other parts of Madrid - we made the mistake of eating in Sol, and I thought it was over priced. We ate in Seville, we found a restaurant picked from the Lonley Planet Guide to Madrid - which is an excellent resource. From the airport, it cost all of us girlies different prices to get to the hotel, so maybe ask the driver \"how much\" before you ride. I think it was around 30 Euro. My friends used the Metro which only cost 1 Euro, and apparantly it goes directly from the airport and stops just around the corner from the hotel. Anyway, Ive digressed. This hotel is extremely good, good value for money, a cold buffet breakfast was included, which was very fresh. If I had to moan about anything it would be, the coffee out of the machine was yuk, a twix was \u00a32 and our air conditioning in our room didnt work, but apart from that it was cool. Oh just as a by the by - as a tourist do not take for granted that the Spanish speak English, most spanish people did not, so read up on your phrases befor you go.

It's about 25 mins (30 euros with luggage) from the airport though you can catch the Metro easily, it's the last stop on the brown line - Arguelle (pronounced Argwell). The rooms were spacious, clean, bright, stylishly colourful and comfortable. We had a balcony with a street view and a spacious bathroom with a window looking out onto the balcony for a wonderfully cooling breeze. The hotel itself is well placed for the shopping, in fact we spent all saturday (and more money than I could really have afforded) merely walking less than 50 metres up one street. I'm told we barely scratched the surface, so if you stay here, be prepared to leave with your purse lightened! There are several Zaras on the Martin de los Heros street to the left of the cross roads that Hotel Tirol sits on and apparently all are slightly different. If you walk up this road be sure to pop into the shop under the arch on the right hand side if the road - it looks like it might house a museum or gallery but as our last shop and the most cheap and most stylish we wished we'd found it first! I'm told there are shops up every road on the crossroads, and also a great place in the shopping centre on the corner which houses a mixture of expensive designer and cheap chic. I don't know what the food was like at the hotel, though friends were a tad annoyed to find the breakfast was not included and incurred a 10 euro charge which they didn't feel was worth it. Just 5 doors down from Tirol is an irish styled pub sometimes with live bands, and almost next door is a cash machine which was very handy. I didn't have much call to speak to the staff much but when I did he was helpful (knowing my room number without me having spoken to him before) and english speaking. There are many bars and restaurants nearby or catch a cab (about 6 euros) to the livelier part of town. Of the other places nearby friends were disappointed by the nearest cafe/restaurant futher down the Calle del Marques de Urquijo. The food was apparently mediocre and they paid well over the odds for it. There was a fabulous argentinian steak restaurant further along the road right near the park which we ate at one evening, though we suspect it is more popular with the locals as you wouldn't necessarily notice it during the day and as a british hen party we attracted some curiosity. A friend from Jersey claims they are the best steaks anywhere though. And a meal for 10 people including 8-10 bottles of cava and more food than we could shake a stick at came to 35 euros each! Take an open top bus tour if you want to see a bit more of Madrid but don't expect the headphones to be very informative or to work all the time. They are temperamental to say the least. We also went to several clubs in the lively part of town, the name of which I don't know but according to a card I have much of it is on La Escalinata (road). The best club was by far was The Palace, which has to be seen to be believed. Drinks were expensive (9 euros each for a spirit + free mixer) We then bar-hopped down the road taking advantage of the cheap drinks and entry offered by the touts. At least two I don't know the name of but we had a wonderful time in all of them. Make sure you have enough for a cab back though as it is a long walk home to Tirol! On the second night we were booked to see a flamenco show at a tapas bar in the flamenco part of town. The taxi driver informed us that the show was performed by the local gypsies and was the best in town (Casa Patas) and that after midnight the gypsies are all out dancing in the street. The show was wonderful, and the atmosphere brilliant so do try and go. Tickets priced around 30 euros for entry and a drink, food and drinks gets a bit expensive after that and the whole hour and a half experience cost about 55 euros in total which seemed a bit steep though worth it. We would recommend eating elsewhere before or after. Around that part of town also apparently is a massive street market which sounded wonderful but we didn't have time to go unfortunately. Basically, we had a wonderful time and felt that the hotel was well placed for everything. We could have taken the Metro had we wanted to save cash but with 9 of us it made sense to catch taxis and share the cost. If I go back to Madrid I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "September 19, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel T3 Tirol", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d232809-Reviews-Hotel_T3_Tirol-Madrid.html", "Price": "$83 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Marques de Urquijo 4</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232809", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/58/32/58325ba80756604c4a90d38a39baff6d5large.jpg"}}
