{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Love IT! Convenience! My family took an Airbus from Hong Kong International Airport to Hotel Benito in Tsim Sha Tsui. It was just a 40min trip that cost us around HKD $33. We then took about 5mins to locate the hotel along Cameron Road. The hotel is very near the busstop!We then travelled around Hong Kong on the MTR for our entire stay there as Hotel Benito is 5 to 10mins walk from the MTR. At times, we would cross the sea by boat. Getting to the harbour took us about 15 mins by foot. We planned for a day trip to Macau and had to get tickets at the Hong Kong - China Ferry Terminal which is also not far away from our hotel - 15 mins walk.Shopping!There are MANY boutique shops around our hotel. It is a shopping haven! We managed to grab some cheap bargains and sale items around the area :)Clean Rooms!The hotel is new and most importantly, clean and comfortable.Though hotel rooms are relatively small, my 2 sisters and I manage to stay comfortably in a standard double room. An added value of this hotel is the lounge at level 2 where there is free wireless internet service. There are 2 laptops around for you to serve the net or play games or do whatever you want to do. If you would like a hot drink, there is a drink dispenser machine that serves coffee and hot chocolate. Or if you are feeling hot and want a cold drink instead, there are a variety of juices to choose from. :) We actually exploit the service by going there for a breakfast drink. Our stay in Hong Kong was pleasant because of the hotel. I personally enjoyed my stay with Hotel Benito a lot for the price that i am paying for. On side note, I find booking with a website is cheaper than booking directly with the hotel. Definitely will go back to stay with them again.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR581725776", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "HJtraveller"}, {"Content": "Nice botique hotel.

It is very modern, super clean, and less than a minute away away from Nathan Road, a taxi stand, the MTA and is easy walking distance to the Star Ferry. It does not serve food but there is a 24 hour Chinese restaurant on the next street and if you really must there is a 24 hour McDonald's less than a minute away plus many other restaurants. It has a nice lounge with juices, hot drinks and cookies as well as two laptops connected to the internet. The rooms are clean, have internet access, flat screen TV's and are very modern. The only negative may be the size of the bedroom. It is small, but the bathroom is good size and has a heated mirror which is a good thing to have in humid Hong Kong. We booked through asiatravel.com and paid HK$770 and HK$800 for Saturday night.", "Date": "Nov 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR908001760", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Ira-7"}, {"Content": "Good Hotel, Great Location       The lounge", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR757746196", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "industry_killer"}, {"Content": "Location Location! Nice botique hotel. MTR is only 20 meters away and this makes it easy to travel anywhere. I booked directly with hotel and found that cheaper. My room was small but cozy. The washroom however was a decent size and very clean. For the price and location it is an excellent choice. I speak chinese so the staff were not rude to me nor were they friendly either. Lots of shopping and eating close by and bars at night near by. TST area has it all...highend shopping and cheap stuff too. I would stay here again in a heartbeat but if you are use to north american size rooms then this is not the place for you.

MTR is near by, less than 2mins walk, food is abundant even at night. But expect nothing more than that1) Internet is available/ They have no wireless and go through wired. But they do not have LAN wire!2) The room looks big in the photo, but very deceiving. For those who have stayed in a hostel, right beside the door, it is the bed, and there is less than a 2 AO sized of walking space. 3) Bed is real hard, and no amenities. Very hostel, bunk room feel.4) Room service did not clear up in proper5) Hotel service , u can take it as none.
