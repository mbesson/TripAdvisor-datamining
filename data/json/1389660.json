Pros: The room was nice, quiet, with good A/C, nice bathroom, comfortable bed with good quality bedding, everything was clean. Restaurant makes passable Italian and a very good breakfast spread. The sauna was ok, pool had a bit too much chlorine. Very secure parking. Very close to several shopping malls, including an outlet mall. The staff is very professional and very Turkish. Small aside: What does \"very Turkish\" mean? For Turks, professionalism is not how many times you smile, but how efficient you are at the job. So yes, they don't smile, but it's just their culture. Also, in Turkish culture, if something is wrong and you want something reimbursed, you have a looong conversation with a person who is responsible for the money. Better yet, before starting this conversation you should become friends with someone who can advise this person responsible for the money. It's their culture. They won't reimburse you if you just state something is wrong or aren't polite. Cons: It's fast to get into the hotel as the entrance is just off the highway ramp. However, to get back out onto the highway, since the hotel is on a one-way street, you must do a fairly big loop around the neighbourhood. Together with the rest of Istanbul population. Google estimated 10 min, but it took us 20 min of agressive lane shuffling just to get out onto the highway. Once on the highway, it was an easy 5 min drive to the airport. Don't expect to walk around the hotel as there isn't much except the highway and a lot of cars. Slippers given in the spa are VERY slippery on their floors. So much, as to be dangerous. Take your own, or walk barefoot - much safer, even with an occasional desease you may catch ;) We saw shuttles day and night around the hotel, but can't say anything about them as we had a car.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Goteborg, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel close to the airport\u201d", "Author": "Collberg", "ReviewID": "UR128152475", "Content": "We used the Courtyard for a stopover inbetween flight.

Excellent service.\u201d", "Author": "Firefool", "ReviewID": "UR77522766", "Content": "We just stayed one night on our way back from our holiday and found the hotel much better than expected. Easily spotted at a distance by the distinctive round tower. Clean, modern, good sized room with 2 double beds, flat screen TV, Wi fi., great shower and our room was very quiet. Security scanner at the door! The food at dinner was excellent and there was a good choice at breakfast. Coffee not so good in common with many establishments in Istanbul. Drinks and meals (as to be expected) a little more expensive than in town. Cozy bar. Nice swimming pool and spa. Approx 3km from Istanbul airport (15-20 min drive), convenient free comfy shuttle service, helpful, friendly staff. Seems popular with business people. Approx 45 min hair raising taxi drive (40 lira) from central Istanbul, although they also run a shuttle into town. Near an outlet type shopping centre (which we didn't try out). The complimentary water is in the fridge!", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona", "Title": "\u201cVery good but bad check-in\u201d", "Author": "Vidalson", "ReviewID": "UR77457264", "Content": "Very good hotel if you need to be near the airport (10 euros for the taxi max., but you can use the free shuttle, although there's only one per hour).

Taxis cost around TL8, although it seems few taxi drivers know of the hotel. Check in fast and efficient with friendly staff. Rooms clean and reasonably spacious for the standard of the hotel. The hotel is located directly under an airport flight path, however the rooms are very well sound proofed so that there is virtually no noise. There is a \"Market\" available to buy drinks and snacks such as sandwiches. There is also a decent bar with happy hour in the evening. The restaurant provides reasonable quality and well priced food and drink. The hotel provides shuttles to the airport as well as to Sultanahment for the tourist attractions, providing the opportunity for some sight seeing if time allows.
