Lots of people staying here are returning guests and the reason is that the staff are just all amazing. friendly, helpful and generally lovely people. The beach is used by locals especially at weekends, which i like - what's the point of travelling otherwise! But, further down (5 mins walk) it's more for torists and so a little cleaner if you prefer(raked sand etc).Great wave breakers with sun huts on to sit on and watch the sun rise. Lovely beach bar to drink at - although take a torch if coming back in at night as it's not always very well lit up. Hotel pool is really nice with a shallow kids end and beautiful gardens. Food is really great too I recomment the sea food kebab, fresh and tasty!I know i'll go again as soon and can't wait!Tip - if you are staying 1-2 weeks or more ask for a special rate discount", "Date": "Aug 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR352160236", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "baliblossom"}, {"Content": "Beatiful gardens with       at the pool", "Date": "Jul 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR325491348", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BaliGroves"}, {"Content": "Not the best 'beach' location I stayed at the LBI for 3 nights having spent the previous 5 up in Ubud. My room here immediately fell into the 3 D's category....dingy....dark and depressing with so little light that I had to keep the doors open just to see what I was doing. The internal decor was in need of some TLC and there was dirt/dust evident behind the bedside cabinets. The air-con was so powerful that I had to sometimes turn it off or otherwise freeze. The bathroom lacked lacked any form of ventilation, nor did it have a fan. I had to put a towel on the floor to mop up excess water which didn't drain properlyBreakfast was quite amazing particularly as 2 of my 3 orders were wrong and the service was poor. (and remember this is low season)On the first day, I had to wait over 10 mins for just 1 more jam by which time both coffee and toast were cold and it was a long time before both of these arrived. Day 2 was OK . On day 3 I specifically asked for coffee to come with the eggs/toast and yes, coffee arrived well before anything else did resulting in my asking for some hot coffee again. The few of us who had breakfast had to ask for the fan to be turned on and the dining area was within metres of the main road. You could have breakfast on your terrace or in your room.Having hired a bike, I was able to cycle along the prom and see lots of other hotels with significantly superior beach settings, most of which had their dining areas facing the sea. There was some sort of beach cafe at the end of a long dark path leading from the hotel grounds but the beach here is not particularly attractive and again this area was quite dark. The gardens are very pretty and there is a lovely well maintained pool, towels are provided.I booked this hotel on the basis of it's 'beach' location but anyone hoping to see the beach has a trek to find it and then another trek to find a decent bit of beach worth your towel. I was disappointed both by the service and the location and if you just want a room for a base for few days, then fine but you can do much better for a very similar price.", "Date": "Apr 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR465513733", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "lavasso"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d650341-r19032156-Laghawa_Beach_Inn-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "650341", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
