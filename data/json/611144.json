There were plenty of neighbourhood shops; restaurants, bakers, supermarkets etc. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Even though we both speak a little Spanish and some French, the receptionist was lovely and spoke excellent English. The bedroom although basic, was tidy and clean. My wife and I were impressed that, even though it is a hostel, our bed linen was tidied and remade each day. The air conditioning I had asked for in our bedroom worked and was a real plus. The ensuite toilet and shower were fine, hot and cold water. The kitchen facilities were excellent. Other guests were friendly and it was great to mix and talk with other nationalities in the kitchen. My wife and I felt safe and secure. The nearest metro stop is Muntaner, five minute walk away. My wife and I would recommend Hotel Alogar without hestitation if you want a room in a quiet area, but close enough to the centre to sightsee every day..", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Starnberg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cA fabulous hostel! :)\u201d", "Author": "Melinda M", "ReviewID": "UR125089103", "Content": "We loved Hostal Alogar. It was unlike any hostel I've stayed at before as our rooms were made up each day and we were even left clean towels after our 3rd night. The beds were comfortable and the hostel staff were very friendly and helpful. We felt very safe here and had no worries leaving our personal belongings in our room while we were out all day. The only downside of Hostal Alogar, however, are the super thin walls. We had a coughing neighbour who kept us up a bit during the nights. That being said, we were also the first room closest to the reception desk and were not bothered by the TV or lounge room sounds. We were not, however, affected by the school behind us that has been commented on before - the kids do not show up until after 9am and are gone by 4:30pm. We really enjoyed our stay here and would certainly recommend this to anyone wanting a quiet, cheap stay in Barcelona! :)", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cVery good place to stay for a few days\u201d", "Author": "Papagena3", "ReviewID": "UR124917417", "Content": "I was here for 5 days.

Excellent location (5 mins to the metro or bus, 20 mins to Rambla, 10 mins to Corte Inglese supermarket). The neighbourhoods are full of small bars full of locals (we preffered Marcel Santalo one to have a breakfast). Rooms (with private bathroom) are small but pretty spacious. Firstly we had one #105 with double bad, sofa and table (for 4 nights); on our way back we had very small room #104 with only wardrobe (for 2 nights). All the rooms were with ordinary windows (rather big) and air conditioners. The room, bathroom, toilet and bed were clean and cleaning service was good. The only weakness of this hostal is poor soondproofing and school outside. Kids started to play football and shout at about 9 a.m. This makes your alarm clock useless!", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cFor tghe holidaymaker, not the partier\u201d", "Author": "TheCalenderGuy", "ReviewID": "UR77117594", "Content": "Don't get confused, this is a budget hostel, and in this regard it is fantastic. Most negative reviews of this hostel seem to have mistaken it for a hotel, which it is not. The rooms are small but comfortable and airconditioned, and cleaned thoroughly every day. The bathrooms are shared but this rarely presented a problem. It is a fair way out of the city but there are two bus lines around the corner, one straight to the Placa De Catalunya and Las Ramblas and the other to the beach. There is also a train station 5 minutes walk up the road. There is a fresh produce market and a supermarket in the next street as well as a well kitted out kitchen so all your cooking needs are covered (but there are no tea and coffee things except a kettle). It could do with an outdoor area but otherwise iy is perfectly servicible as a peaceful, cheap and comfortable base from which to explore barcelona.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cVery tidy and practical hostel\u201d", "Author": "apprendrelemonde", "ReviewID": "UR62938976", "Content": "Very nice staff, tidy rooms and bathrooms, practical kitchen facilities - worth stayingif lower budget!", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hostal Alogar", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d611144-Reviews-Hostal_Alogar-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$61 - $75*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Laforja 98-100</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08021</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "611144", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/19/f8/37/habitacion-doble-con.jpg"}}
