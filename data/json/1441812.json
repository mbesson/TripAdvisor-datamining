Yakup, the main recepion person, looked after every detail of our stay. eg.

He also said to have 1 serving of the main meat but as much of the wonderful buffet veggies as needed.The dinning area was decorated uniquely. The rooms were small but well furnished, comfortable bed, dressing table w/ mirror,TV,bar fridge, couple of chairs, well supplied clean washroom. The Breakfast Room was located on the top floor with views to the Sea of Marmara. Large choice of items (hot or cold) for breakfast. Yakup provided storage of 4 large bags for 1 night as we took a side trip with only our small bags. When we returned the following evening, we were taken to our rooms and our large bags appeared in minutes from the storage area. The location is very convenient, there is a walking street full of restaurants 1/2 block away. 3 short blocks to the seashore and the fish markets.About 5 blocks up the hill is the Grand Bazzar & the tram line that takes you to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapki Palace & The Cisterns.

We never saw anyone use it during our stay. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was also clean and there was an excellent shower. However, the room was tiny; I mean that you had to turn sideways to squeeze round from one side of the bed to the other. The window looked out over the rubbish strewn roofs surrounding you. The walls are paper thin which allows you to share the joy of your neighbours with the crying child with astonishing clarity. On top of which you can hear the busy street outside with cars honking etc We slept badly every night even with earplugs. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty with a reasonable view of the surrounding area. There is also good wifi throughout the hotel. But the place annoys in every detail. The sheets didn't cover the bed fully so they couldn't be tucked in and rucked up under you at night. They wouldn't give me a receipt when I checked out even though i asked. Nor would they give me a receipt for the bags I wanted to leave while we toured the city. Apparently I was just supposed to trust them. Perhaps if I was just a businessman needing a place to bed down for the night this hotel would be alright. There was, after all, nothing fundamentally wrong with it.

If you are travelling under your own steam, then the hotel would be very very difficult to find and taxi drivers do tend to charge what they like, unless you lock them down.

ALWAYS ask for prices in advance when ordering food or drink. We were ripped off in nearly every restaurant we ate in. Istanbul is a beautiful city, we were just unlucky as regards to where we ate. Bit of advice....avoid tourist cafes and restaurants! The food was not fresh, processed and poor value. Opt for local smaller eateries, street vendors and back street kebab shops! Much tastier and cheaper! The street kebab we ate on the last night at 4TL was ten times tastier than the steak we ate in a 5star roof top restaurant!

The rooms were a bit small but bearable as we were out all day. The breakfast was quite basic but plentiful. Would definately stay there again but would request a room at the back of the hotel. Good location, 20 mins walk to Blue Mosque, Ayia Sofia, Grand Bazaar. Great Memories.
