The hotel layout is a little confusing with all the additions and extra doorways & hallways. Our room was clean, a good size and we were pleasantly surprised to find that we had a fridge & microwave in our room. The only problem with our room was the noisy heat/ac unit but we were so tired after our long days in the city that it didn't bother us too much. The breakfast that was included with our stay was very good (eggs, waffles, cereals, fruit, yoghurt, muffins).

The second room was a good location, clean, and with comfortable beds. The layout of the hotel was very confusing. It was time to leave before I was comfortable that I could locate the front lobby by myself. I was very disappointed in the area and did not feel comfortable walking at night.

We stayed here on September 27, 2010 before a flight on the 28th. When we first walked in, there was a hole the size of a softball in the carpet. Another three very worn places near the sink. I'm not sure the last time a vacuum was used in this room. I made sure I always had my shoes on and never bare footed. I needed to recharge my I Pad and was going to unplug a lamp. The grease and grime on the plug was so dirty I decided to recharge at the airport. In the bathroom, the tile around the base was filthy.

At the end of the hall at room 175 there is an open door that you can open from the outside without any security at all--just walk in. The real kicker in our room was at 9:30 p.m. when we were watching tv, someone opened our door. The chain was on, but it was only attached with one screw. It wouldn't take much of a push to tear it off the door. The real problem was that the dead bolt was in place, but it opened also. The front desk had given a card to our room to someone else. Just an hour before we had been at dinner. What would have happened if we had still been gone?? THEN the front desk told my husband they would refund $50 from the room charge. We are now home...I just checked the credit card statement, and they charged us DOUBLE for the room then deducted the $50. I will not be staying at this or any other Ramadas again.

We also used this everyday to get to the T and the shuttle drivers were generally helpful and informative. Breakfast was also surprisingly good - there were eggs, bagels, muffins and waffles everyday and this was all complimentary. The rooms were sizable but were quite outdated in their decor. We also found the locks on the door were a bit dubious. However they were clean and offered everything we needed. The only downside was the area the hotel was based in. There were quite a few facilities in the complex - there is a bowling alley which did reasonable food. There's also the Freeport tavern which does dinners and brunch, but we did find this to be quite expensive and preferred the food in the bowling alley. There was a supermarket, pharmacy and bank in walking distance which were useful also. In regard to other dining places and bars, there were no others which meant our nightlife was somewhat limited.

We got a weekly pass for $15 which allows you to transfer from train to bus and vice versa and ferry and you don't have to wait 16 min to use the pass like we do in NYC.

That's okay since it's hotel's policy that the check in time is 3:00. I asked her if there was a nearby place we could stay for 30 min before we came back. She shrugged and didn't say anything. Then just before I left, she called me back and told me actually we could check in. I asked her if it's possible to get a room not facing Rt. 93 (a very busy and noisy highway which is just a few yards away). She told me that our room was good. During that period of 10-15 min, she never smiled. On the way to the room, we became very disappointed. The rug we stepped on was very watering and our shoes got very wet. The room was at the end of the building and right underneath the highway. The AC was very loud. Thought this would be a horrible room to stay for two nights, I went back to the front desk to ask the lady there if we could be moved to the 2nd floor. While I was waiting, there were two other guests before me. The lady was quite friendly to them. She explained to them how they could take the shuttle to subway station which left me wondering why she didn't told me the info. When it's my turn, I told her we wanted to change the room. She looked at the computer in front of her for a few seconds before told me it's not possible since all room were booked. I asked her one more time and got the same answer.

Didn't want to deal with such strange guy, we decided to drive our car instead. The next day, while eating breakfast, the shuttle driver came into the dinning room and started chatting with someone. A boy came to him to ask him when he would leave and he told him to wait. While he was chatting, I noticed more and more people gathering outside and waiting, some with very little kids. Finally the driver left the dinning room and told those waiting for him that he could not pick all of them up... (It took only a few min to go to the subway station and he could easily take care all people by one or two extra trips. To me what he did was to discourage people to use the shuttle service.) Though the hotel is just a few yards from Rt. 93, it takes about 10 min to get there after left the highway if you drive.

There are hotel coupons in almost every rest stop in the highways to Boston. However, it was peak season (summer) so we decided to reserve in advance. LOCATION The location is South Boston, but it was still convenient. There was free scheduled shuttle to the JFK/UMass subway station (MBTA) and the airport. There are restaurants on site, the Phillips candy/chocolate store and a family entertainment complex that had bowling, arcade, pool and more. Stores such as CVS, National Wholesale Liquidator and other stuff, are just across the street. The location is the best asset of this property, but that was it. PREMISES The place had ample parking and seating in the lobby. The hotel layout was very poorly planned. Other reviewers complained that the hotel was a maze, and it was. Even the front desk staff got confused. To go to one side of the hotel, you will have to go through at least 3 doors. STAFF The staff were friendly, but they need to be more knowledgeable. We had to switch rooms because the first rooms we had were too far from the exit and we had a handicapped kid with us. A staff gave us wrong directions to get to the rooms, but he was apologetic. The keys to one of the rooms weren't working and I had to go back to front desk twice. The front desk didn't have a map of the area, only downtown Boston and Cambridge. ROOMS There was a strong smell in the rooms. It looked like housekeeping sprayed too much air deodorizer to mask other smells. I didn't think the rooms were too clean. One of the rooms we booked (handicapped) had poop in the toilet. The other room was alright, but when we tried to use the extra pillows in the 'closet', they smelled like sweat. We think housekeeping just stocked them in the closet without cleaning them. The closets weren't really closets, they were just a separate space with clothes rack and hangers. One of the rooms had a desk, a small round table, two chairs, a tiny bathroom (with a tub), and the sink right outside the bathroom. The handicapped room didn't have the small round table. It had a bigger bathroom, but with no tub. The sink was inside the bathroom. Air-conditioner was great, but it made some noise which didn't really bother us. AMENITIES Pool The pool was very small and goes from 4 to 9 ft deep. I saw the lifeguard check the quality of the water every morning which was good. Breakfast Continental breakfast was included with the rate and was served from 6am-10am. At the two days we were there, they didn't serve the same 'entree'. The first morning, we had waffles which were delicious. You could make your own waffle, but this wonderful lady (staff) offered to make them for those who want them. The second morning, we had scrambled eggs. On both days, there were bagels, bread, toasts, muffins, fruits, cereals, yogurt, juices, coffee. Internet There was free wireless internet access and the speed was good. You would need to ask front desk for a password to access it. If you plan to access the internet, take your laptop with you. To use the hotel's own computer to access the internet is not free.

I am fairly tolerant about these things but if you like a place that has been well cleaned so that previous occupants are no longer in evidence you may not feel comfortable here. The toilet malfunctioned in such a way that it flooded the bathroom and some of the rest of the room in the middle of the night. When we reported this the following day the receptionist said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153room?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. No apology no surprise.

The breakfast offered was decent, but the room it was held in was very loud with the TV blaring and the staff all visiting there. The hotel could be a nice place to stay if they spent some money and did some updating and hired some new staff, who were more people friendly. Had a very tired look about it. The shuttle was handy and worked well for us. We ate in the Freeport Tavern one night and wouldn't go back as the service was poor and our server never came back after taking our order.

This deal allows you to stay one night and park your car for up to 14 nights for flights from Logan airport. There is a shuttle that runs every hour on the hour to Logan ( 24 hours a day). The hotel is pretty basic and somewhat old but the personnel were very friendly and helpful. The shuttle takes about 20 minutes to get to Logan so there is a bit of a wait on your return to Boston because you need to call for the shuttle after you collect your luggage. The breakfast buffet looked good but our flight left too early for us to do much except grab a cup of coffee. We paid $149 plus tax so, all in all, for about the same price as parking at Logan, we got to sleep over in Boston and arrive for our flight without having had to make the two hour drive from Maine on the day of our flight.

Occasionally the bus arrived full (from the nearby Holiday Inn i think) and so there could be quite a wait, but on the whole the bus drivers tried to solve this by making extra trips. The bus stops at 11 pm, but apparantly you can call and they will pick you up, but since Boston seems not to be a particularly heavy partying town, this is less likely to be a problem.

Place looked and sounded great by the websites I looked at and by the pictures, but when we got our room, we were very disappointed. Room was so incredibly small and had 2 double beds which left such little room for more than one person moving around. The heater in the room blew cool air (in 30+ degree weather) and blew so hard aross the room, we had to take a drawer out of the desk to stand it up on end to block the force of the air. The bathroom was also teeny tiny. Toilet paper was across from you so far away that you had to be very tall to reach it. Outside the room in the hallway was like being outside - literally. All windows in the hallway overlooking the pool which I am sure is great for summer, but for winter, with the walls coming down and stopping 6 inches from the floor, the cold air coming in from outside made the hallways as cold as outside. Of course, this cold also got in your room if your bed was close to the wall. Left the heat on 68 when we left so it would be somewhat warm when we returned only to find the maid turned it down to 60 even knowing that we were there another night. We were not too happy about that. They did nothing about the ice on the sidewalks around the hotel and my 7 year old daughter took a terrible fall outside one of the doors after we had dinner. The complimentary continental breakfast was nothing more than cereal, juice, coffee, bagels and toast. If you got there past 9:15, everything was gone and you were out of luck. The people running the breakfast were very rude and short to everyone I saw ask for a toasted bagel or toast. Boston Bowl, right next door was poor. The game room's games were mostly broken and did not add up scores properly to give you the right number of tickets for you to give your kids. Bowling candlestick was pretty good except parents of younger children did not keep them off the lanes no matter how nicely you asked. Sometimes there were 6 young kids (4 and under) in my lane. The pool tables were fantastic though. The Tavern in the building next door affiliated with Ramada was fantastic for dinner and we were all extremely pleased with the very tasty and well presented food. Service was very good. I would not stay at this hotel again. With there being so many hotels in the whole Boston vicinity, I have no doubt that we could find something the same price with nicer and more importantly larger rooms and better breakfasts.
