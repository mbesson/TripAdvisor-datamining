And for some reason there was only free wifi in the lobby. The good points: The bed was comfy and the location is handy for the MTR and the old trams. I was quite glad to only be staying for one night.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "penang", "Title": "\u201cGood Tourist Hotel\u201d", "Author": "travelkid88", "ReviewID": "UR87022586", "Content": "what can i say about this place... Location wise its a few steps to mrt, airport bus A11, North Point Tram station, Ferry to Kowloon from North Point Harbour, virtually you get all form of transportation at your door step, trust me with me and wife plus two under 5 years old it is really a convenient place to be. Surrounding wise, as it is more to a neighbourhood feel, things are very much cheaper from dining to shopping and of course the morning market is just across one street fronting the hotel. I was surprise to be able to buy a few pieces of local buns for just HKD13. (5 pieces) Than there is this wonderful 'tai pai tong' on the 1st floor of the market on the left side of the hotel (take the elevator). It consist of more than 10 proprietors, so go in and walk around and get to the one with plenty of people waiting for their table. Room wise, just sufficient for two person and as we got two kids with us, its a bit cramp but yet manageable... unlike those hotel in tst or mongkok which is just a bed and a tv. Toilet is well kept and i did my bath on the tub for two nights early winter. Breakfast, wow.... thou we miss the 1st breakfast as we arrive 9.45am which is closing time for breakfast but were very amazed when we went there on the 2nd day. A spread of noodles, baked beans, scramble egg, ham, fat sausages, wide type of breads, instant noodles, two type of juices, coffee and tea and some fruits as well. Overall, very happy with our stay and the only back side is the huge number of chinese tourist in this hotel but yet again if you know the right time to avoid them...you'll have a great time here.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "KL", "Title": "\u201cFor the price, this is good\u201d", "Author": "geekonweed", "ReviewID": "UR28730651", "Content": "Take the bus from airport, will drop you directly at hotel doorstep (second last stop). The room is small, well compared to other HK hotel for this price is okay. There are 5 of us in this trip so is rather waste to rent another room all by myself, we added a bed which cost 200 per night but when the time we check out (3 day later) it only charge me for one night....haha", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The South China Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d309411-Reviews-The_South_China_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$89 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.67-75 Java Road, North Point</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "309411", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/bc/c0/70/the-south-china-hotel.jpg"}}
