The rooms are comfortable. Great amenities in each room, tremendous beds, available I-Pad uses for 13$ a day (I-Pad and 3G internet connection incl), I-Pod station, kettle and nespresso machine. In it's first year of opening, prices were much more reasonable; as of late, the price increases seem to be a little much but the quality of rooms & service still makes it one of the best values in this part of Paris. \u00a0 The off-putting things about this property are that room service comes from the in-house restaurant and a next door's one. However the breakfast is great if you enjoy healthy food and fresh products. \u00a0 The property sits next to L\u2019Etoile Nightclub which is known for their nice parties with wellknown DJ\u2019s all week long. 5 min away from the hotel, I also recommend the excellent 3 stars restaurant Guy Savoy: try the \u201cSoup d\u2019artichaud a la truffe noire\u201d, an experience you will never ever forget. \u00a0 Since it's opening the hotel has done an excellent job in keeping it's cleanliness; increasing their amenities and level of service at every guest demand. \u00a0 Overall, the best times to truly enjoy this property is on the weekend day nights when the hotel is not full; walking through the dark coridors provides a plush but eerie feeling of being transported to a different time and place where you'll be more than satisfied that you have this place to yourself for the night.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNope nope nope\u201d", "Author": "Joanna B", "ReviewID": "UR125873899", "Content": "I stayed here in September after purchasing an offer through JetSetter for a two night stay. By no means was the sale rate cheap ($180 a night), but it was an amount I was willing to \"splurge\" on for a couple of nights in a more luxurious hotel. Anyway, my friend and I arrive, we check in, everything looks nice, they tell us \"breakfast is served until ___ through that doorway.\" Cool. The next day we went down for breakfast, not a large selection but it was free, so we ate a couple of hardboiled eggs and nutella sandwiches. That evening we chatted with a couple also staying there that informed us that they hadn't known the breakfast was 20 euros a day. We hoped that perhaps our first night had come with free breakfast\u2014but no, we go charged 40 euros. Moreover, had we not heard from our friends about this issue, we may have ended up eating there twice and been charged 80 euros for a breakfast that was worth maybe $4. I was upset because I felt as though we had been misled, when I told the receptionist the day of our departure about the predicament (that we were led to believe it was free) he showed no sympathy at all and said \"with the gilt offer no... no breakfast included.\" First of all, this made me feel as though we were being treated as \"secondary\" guests because we booked the hotel through an offer. Secondly, the memory of being conned out of 20 euros when I could have had a lavish brunch or dinner elsewhere really stains my memory of the Mon Hotel, didn't they realize this means I would never go back or refer my friends to it? Perhaps they figured we were unlikely to return because we used a deal site. Otherwise, the room was nice but small, the hallways were seriously creepy\u2014painted all black, they always made me feel like I was in a murder movie. The location, while close to the Arc de Triumpf and champs de elysee wasn't that great because it was a strange combination of touristy and desolate (on the other side of the arc de triumpf near a bunch of motorcycle shops).

Seriously.\u201d", "Author": "plusfour", "ReviewID": "UR121317230", "Content": "OK, I admit it - I'm not a big fan of Paris. It's probably my own fault because I don't speak the French or know the city very well, but when I was asked to arrange my own hotels for a 3-day business trip to Paris I wasn't entirely optimistic - I had no idea where was a good place to say and the 2 worst hotel experiences I've ever had were both in Paris. Hmm. So after some research, I booked Mon Hotel - reviews and the website looked good, but for \u20ac130/night, honestly, I didn't hold out a lot of hope. But, happily, I was quite wrong... On arrival, the location was great. 2 minutes from the Arc de Triomphe and 5 minutes from Champs Elysee. OK, it was a 45-minute, \u20ac50 cab ride from Gare du Nord (I arrived on Eurostar from London), but hey, this is Paris traffic we're talking about... Check-in was great too - a low-lit lobby with appropriately cool furnishing started things off well and superb service and a friendly feeling from the start completed the picture nicely - they even correctly guessed who I was. Getting into my room didn't disappoint either. I was in a Superior and it was excellent - cool decor (B&W photos on the grey suede walls - nice), an Eames chair (reproduction, presumably) at the desk, a very clean, big comfy bed, Loewe TV, JBL iPod dock and a funky, clean, big bathroom complete with fluffy bathrobes and slippers behind the door. It was relatively small, but this is how hotel rooms in Paris are - perfectly reasonable though in terms of size (better than I expected), and even space for my suitcase (a rarity in cities that have small hotel rooms). Free WiFi too. All good. Outside the room, things were equally superb - the bar was cool, vibey and served great drinks with good, friendly service. Bossanova versions of 80's hits as the background music? Yes please. From start to finish, the service here was excellent - the small (numbers, not size!) staff gave the attention and quality of service that really makes a boutique hotel stand out from a nicely decorated hotel, with everything from helping book cars and cabs to offering advice on where to go being done with a touch that made me feel they actually cared. In my experience, this is rare - and good. I have only 3 minor-ish negatives: first, the AC in my room was a challenge - I never managed to get it below hot; second, breakfast was good but expensive (\u20ac22), but again - it's Paris; and third, despite leaving the 'do not disturb' sign on my door when I left the first day, I got back and my room had been serviced. Not the end of the world, but worth knowing... A final note regarding location - if you want the dead centre of Paris tourist spots, maybe this isn't ideal (it's kind of on the edge of the busy stuff). But it's 5-minutes walk from the Champs Elysee and Arc de Triomphe and in an extremely pleasant, quiet street. Personally, exactly what I want - close enough, but not in the middle of it all. And to get to CDG airport was easy - 30 minutes and \u20ac60 (leaving at 5:30am). Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again when I have to come back to Paris. This is a very, very good hotel at a reasonable price somewhere it's easy to book a very, very bad hotel at a high price. Area, rooms, service, vibe, price - all excellent. Don't be fooled by it's low ranking on TripAdvisor - it's fantastic.

I hate almost everything about that vapid city. Unfortunately, I work in TV so that necessitates travel to Paris several times a year. Double unfortunately, we mostly have to stay in the right bank.

The hotel itself is trendy and super designy but not in an obnoxious way. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful making us feel right at home.

Not so at Mon. It's just a super cool, low key (for now) place to call home when you are in Paris. The food at MonBar's is awesome too. While the drinks are expensive, they are delicious. I highly recommend their Bellini. I miss it. We also managed to get a corporate rate, which I hope will not change much for our future travels.

The rooms are small but I think you have to expect this with such a central location and I understand that this is not unusual for Paris. Our room had an iPOD dock (more of those later) but lacked tea or coffee making facilities which would have been nice. Staff were all very friendly and mostly very helpful.

The next morning I enquired if the same people would be in that room that night and if they were if we could be moved. I was told they would be there but that they would be spoken to and the situation would be dealt with. Unfortunately I left the matter at that. One quiet night was had but then on the next night there was again shouting and music which started at about 6am. Again I phoned reception to complain. This time however they phoned the room rather than visit and the noise continued. I phoned reception again. The noise continued. Yet again I phone reception and the receptionist informed me that our neighbours were not answering their phone. I had to insist that he personally visit, which he did 20 minutes or so later after a further phone call. The next day I asked to see the manager who was very understanding and offered to cancel the costs of the breakfasts as a goodwill gesture. Given that the breakfasts are outrageously overpriced at 22 Euros per head per day for a cold buffet this was welcome but somehow didn't seem to address the issue and left me unsatisfied as well as tired. This is basically a nice hotel but the prime purpose of a hotel is to allow it's guests to have an uninterrupted restful nights sleep. Hotel Mon unfortunately failed in this regard and their response to the problem that developed was inadequate. If you are a light sleeper or particularly bothered by the noise of others I would think carefully before staying here.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Haven, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cHelpful friendly staff, great location, comfortable beds, pleasant stay.\u201d", "Author": "andiamoTD", "ReviewID": "UR97627916", "Content": "The staff was outstandingly helpful.

The furnishings are modern and minimalist. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was large with a separate tub and shower. The tub came in handy each night as I relaxed after walking the streets of Paris all day! Some reviews mention the garbage trucks that come by early in the morning. This was noticeable but not troublesome. I either used it as an alarm clock or quickly fell back to sleep. Other reviews mention the small elevator and the dark spiral staircase. I was on the first floor (second floor to us Americans) and only used the elevator when I was checking out. It was small but typical for older buildings. Normally I took the stairs and, yes, they are rather dark. The location of the hotel is great. I actually grew to like it more each day. Within a 2 minute walk to the Argentine Metro it was easy to use the subway. Coming back to the hotel in the evening I would be welcomed into a quiet safe neighborhood that seemed far away from the Champs Elysee that is literally just minutes away by foot. I only used the restaurant/bar one night for a champagne and dessert. Try the Molten Chocolate Cake. Tres Bon! I didn't use many of the hotel services (fitness room, spa, etc) as I was out and about all day but everyone I met was very nice and helpful. I would stay there again.

When we complained the staff were quick to turn it down but we had to complain every day (and we were there for several days). Why they would play music so close to the rooms is a mystery and why they couldn\u2019t disconnect the speaker on our floor was another mystery. Some nights the music was turned off after about 10pm but on many it ran well into the wee hours (hearing it at 2am was really annoying but it was also annoying during the afternoon when one wanted a quick nap as it prevented a good sleep). It also plays in the restaurant but here too when we complained it was turned down quickly. I don\u2019t think guests should have to complain about the same thing repeatedly \u2013 when staff know that there is a problem it should be given a more permanent fix. - The room and bathroom were tiny but we expected that \u2013 this is Paris after all. However, there should be storage. The closet was extremely tiny and there wasn\u2019t a single drawer in the room. In spite of being very limited on space, we had to leave one suitcase out to hold things that should have been in drawers. - Breakfast is in addition to the room rate at a charge of 19 Euros per person. That seems to be very high. We walked up the Avenue to a little place called Bert\u2019s where we could get coffee, a pastry and a large fresh juice for 5.70 Euros. Other things: - Bring your own slippers if your feet are any bigger than a lady\u2019s size 8 - Bring all of your own soaps, etc. as what is provided is highly scented - It would be great if the spiral staircase had better lighting \u2013 the black d\u00e9cor is okay but not when it makes it hard to navigate the stairs - Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Metro. The hotel is close to the Argentine Metro and the trains are very frequent and easy to use. But given the location of the hotel we found we spent a lot of time on the Metro getting to the main sites. This is the trade-off for the reasonable hotel room rate (for a 4 star). Given all of this, please ignore my numerical ratings \u2013 I had to pick average to balance out the good and the bad.

It was the sort of personal service that I\u2019ve only encountered in well-known 5* hotels before. We sat at the reception desk while check in took place then we were asked about our plans and given lots of info about travelling round and how to get to places. The receptionist even looked up the weather forecast unprompted on the internet. It was also a nice touch that she didn\u2019t once try to speak to us in English even though our French is quite rusty and all the staff speak fluent English. Our luggage was also taken up to our room while we were checking in. The public areas are quite dramatic \u2013 walls in black or purple with low lighting, chandeliers and flowers. It was quite reminiscent of a Malmaison hotel. The corridor on each floor is a different colour \u2013 ours was red, which matched the red padded leather lining of the lifts. Note - the passenger lift by reception is tiny (2 persons with no luggage) but there is a second one round the corner. Our room was on the 5th floor with the benefit of a walk-out balcony overlooking buildings opposite. Light and airy but without doubt small, the room was decorated in a modern style with suede wallcoverings and a marble bathroom, all in neutral colours. The aircon was efficient and silent and the bed very comfortable with a memory foam mattress. The only downside was the showerhead which was hopeless and sprayed water in every direction which was a shame as the water pressure was good. Toiletries (Compagnie de Provence), slippers, robes were the amenities in the bathroom. Breakfast in the black/purple restaurant was a simple affair again with very friendly staff. The food / drink was of good quality but maybe pricy if not already included in the room rate. Nearest metro only 2 mins\u2019 walk away \u2013 the hotel is in a safe, residential area, but the Arc de Triomphe is only 5 mins on foot.

As the first cab arrived both the other guest and I went to get in (I assumed that since I had been waiting nearly 40 minutes at this point that I was entitled to the first cab). This is when the woman from the front desk had the audacity to run outside yelling at me that I must wait and the first cab was for the other guest who had just called! How does that work?!

It wasnt too bad when you kept the lid closed and the bathroom door shut and we actually managed to sort things out in the sistene ourselves. The staff here were lovely. There is a particularly helpful gentleman - I'm gutted i forgot to ask his name, but he's tall and has dark hair and complexion. He was BRILLIANT! We didn't have breakfast at the hotel - there is a little bakery across the road, where we went every day for fresh croissants, pastries and freshly squeezed orange juice! Much more Parisian! Also teher is a supermarche just around the corner too, we got loads of staples for picnic lunches from there in the mornings. If you would like a recommendation for a decent local restaurant in the evening we went to Le Grand Armee, on the right, towards the Arc De Triomphe. We went there for our extra special anniversary dinner - if you like steak, it's the best I've had in my life! Not a cheap place to dine but for a extra special treat we took a venture on reccommendation from the staff at the hotel.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for my proposal trip...\u201d", "Author": "Larph", "ReviewID": "UR19535515", "Content": "I was looking for somewhere in central Paris for our 3 night stay. Neither my fiancee or myself had been to Paris before, and I was a little nervous as this was the trip I was planning on proposing on - I wanted everything to run as smooth and hitch-free as possible. We found the hotel very easily, coming off of Eurostar and onto the metro. It is very close to Agentine metro station, and a stone's throw from Arc de Triumphe and Champs Elysee, not to mention a walkable distance to the Eiffel Tower and the Seine river. There are many great restaurants close to the hotel as well as a few cheaper places to stop for lunch and bakeries to grab some fresh breakfast goods - we couldn't hav efound a bette rplace for our budget, I am sure. The hotel itself is tucked away a little, but in a lovely neighbourhood and not too hard to find. It is quite small and 'confined' but for central Paris it's more than adequate. The room was small, but again the bed was lovely, bathroom was modern, all very clean and lots of nice little modern extras like free wifi, large flat screen tv and ipod dock. We loved it and would be more than happy to stay again. Oh, did I mention how helpful the staff were?

The double bed was huge and very comfortable. Room had an i-pod dock which was great to listen to our own music while we were there. The decor of the hotel is fab, the reception areas were beautiful and always smelled gorgeous! The Reception staff were really friendly and helpful (especially Francis!) and recommended some great bars and restaurants. The only downside was that our shower head was broken and didnt stay on the holder but the room was so comfortable we didnt bother asking to move.

Very small room but comfortable bed. Annoying music in the public rooms eventually turned off at 10 pm but if you wanted a nap in your room in the afternoon......... The good news is Parius has too much to offer for that. Bathroom ok although again quite pokey. Standard fare on the bathroom products, no robes. TV advertises 900 channels, but only a couple of English channels worked. No DVD player, but curiously an ipod docking station. I gave up on the wifi and went to a cafe. No instructions etc in the room and no wired internet alternative despite advertising it was available. As other reviewers have said, but sadly I ignored, go elsewhere for brekfast. 15 Euro gets you orange juice, coco pops or corn flakes and baguettes with jam or processed cheese. The reception is pretty cool, but it takes more than that to run a boutique hotel. Perhaps it was better just after the refurb. I have enjoyed better in Paris and for a cheap hotel why not save some money and stay in a TimHotel ?

We booked it after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and were not disappointed. It is a small friendly hotel which is ideal for a short stay in Paris. The rooms are small, decorated with a contemparary feel and are very clean. We loved the complementary toiletries & magazines and the tiny Parisian balcony was adorable. The major problem for us was the lack of tea/coffee facilities; none in the rooms and unavailable elsewhere in the hotel except for breakfast time. The public areas were again nicely decorated apart from the dark austere corridors. The breakfast room was a bit of a let down; a tiny basement room with minimal seating, however if you like continental type breakfasts the food is okay. The staff seemed friendly enough, but not all of them spoke English; we didn't see this as a problem though, as it gave us chance to practise our limited French! The main problem with the hotel was the absence of a bar, we were led to believe on the website that we booked the hotel through, that the bar would be complete for the end of March 2008; however this was not the case and there was no evidence of a bar being completed in the near future. This said, there were bars/bistros in the vicinity of the hotel. The location is great, near to Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elysees, with a Metro station 2 mins walking distance away. The Hotel is tucked away in a quiet street, so the only noise is from the dustbin men (who are noisy!). We would definately stay here again despite it being a little overpriced, however given a choice we would probably stay on the left bank; Latin Quarter, St Germain areas, as there is a better nightime atmosphere.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walsall, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIt's great mon\u201d", "Author": "jim1664", "ReviewID": "UR15104988", "Content": "Lovely little hotel close to the Arc de Triomph.
