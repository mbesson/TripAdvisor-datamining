Breakfast was not extravagant, but there were many choices available to satisfy everyone in our party of four. The rooms and common areas were clean. Generally, the La Quinta brand is a click below the Residence Inn (breakfast, amenities, extra chair in the room, for example), and that's true for this one, too. Several restaurants and other shopping are within walking distance, although you certainly need a car to get around this area. The pool seemed small and was oddly located behind a locked metal fence and gate. The outdoor perimeter lighting is extremely bright and shone through the curtains. Staff were great: the fellow at the front desk when we checked in was very helpful with restaurant suggestions; the woman in charge of breakfast ran it well.

I usually avoid casino/hotel lodging and the hospitality at this particular LQ will bring you back.

The hotel is set well back off the road in an expensive looking neighborhood. The room was quite large and well appointed, as was the tv. Everything seemed spotless. The breakfast was amazing. If this was continental, I can't imagine what a full breakfast would be like. They even had hard-boiled eggs and sausage rolls in addition to make your own waffles. Short of a full breakfast buffet, I've never seen a breakfast so good. The staff was obliging, upgrading our room when we were unhappy with what we received. Booking on the hotel's own website is important if there's a mistake. I've found this at other hotels too - they are not thrilled with you if you use a secondary site and the prices aren't necessarily cheaper.

The room had a full kitchen, sofa and a comfortable bed. For the same price of a standard room on the strip, you get a nice studio apartment. They offered free pastries and juices to guests of the hotel in the lounge area. As far as location goes, the hotel is located within a mile of the Red Rock, Suncoast and Rampart casinos. It's right near an art museum and movie theatre, so plenty of family fun nearby. The strip is about 15 minutes away by car. If you are Jewish, the hotel is located right next to the Young Israel of Las Vegas. So this is a great place to stay for Shabbat.

The longest was for four nights when I was moving to California and had a friend and my three cats with me. The cats loved the windows because the sills were wide enough for them to sit in and watch the world go by. The rooms are nice, large, and well equipped. The free internet is a definite plus. They've always been clean and I especially like the rooms that come with a full kitchen. Only complaint I have is the most recent trip when I reserved a room with two beds. When we arrived in Las Vegas I called the LQ to let them know we were in town but wouldn't be able to check in until midnight as we were going to a show. I didn't want them to give my room away because they thought I wasn't coming. And by the way, it was a free room because I was using my LQ points to pay for it. When we arrived at midnight and checked in, there was only one bed in the room. We called down and he said the sofa was a pull-out and they were sorry there were no rooms with two beds we could move to. Okay, it was after midnight, and it was a free room so we could make do. However, the sofa wasn't a pull-out. It was just a sofa. Fortunately, my friend said she slept on her sofa all the time, usually in the company of a dalmation, so having it all to herself would be fine. The next morning she said it was very comfortable. It would have been nice to have the room I reserved, but it all worked out fine.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cGreat shabbat hotel in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "hankn", "ReviewID": "UR8084850", "Content": "The La Quinta is a very nice facility.

There are two synagogues right next door - the Young Israel and a newer one lead by Rabbi Ever, which is in an office building in front of the LaQuinta.

Had a nice big room with kitchen/living area/king bed on the first floor, which was very convenient as we had a dog. Everything was new, clean and in great shape! The kitchen was well-stocked. I liked the fact they gave us 4 towels in the room (where most other places in this price range tend to give you only 2, which is a pain!)(the La Quinta website for this location has accurate pictures of what this place looks like--if anything, I think it looks better in person.) The staff was very helpful & accommodating during check-in. Includes a breakfast which is more than continental & very well run and stocked. Free internet access! It's in a good part of town (unlike our last stay where we were near the L.V. convention center. Scary!) BUT it is NOT close to the gambling/Strip if that's what you're there for. It's a good 9 miles west of the Strip down a very busy main street. But if I were in Las Vegas to gamble I would probably still stay here again because it's nice to be away from all \"action\" after a while. Cost us $107 (incl tax) which I thought was very reasonable for what you got.
