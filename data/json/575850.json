The taxi station is just on the other side of the street and you can reach the bus stop walking (about 15 minutes). The docks from where boats can bring you to the Golden Horn and the asian side of Istanbul are very close to the Hotel. We appreciated the little private gym at the upper floor.

The kitchenette was fully equipped .. The dressing room was handy .. The air conditioning was cool ( neither hot nor cold). The bed was comfortable and we asked for extra pillows .. The hotel is near a small supermarket where we can buy most of our staff . Its near something like downtown where there are lots of shops and restaurants .. The location of the hotel in a very high standard street! it has an amazing view at night .. Oh I forgot about the free wifi! it was the BEST thing .. And the response time for our inquires was so fast .. The Rani restaurant was pleasant as well .. we loved the organic breakfast .. all food came from the farms as we asked!! They played a classic Turkish music which gave us a great Turkish feeling!! There is only one bad thing about the location of the hotel, as we were walking not taking any transportation, it is over a hill so we had to walk up the hill which was very tiring for us specially after walking the hole day and holding our shopping bags ! but it is a good exercise though! There is a great park nearby, you can go there and forget the whole world behind you! amazing greenery and birds sounds! Transportation is not far from the location, there is a bus station nearby, and you can walk down to the streets, little bit a head then you will find a tram station. The general atmosphere of both the hotel and the restaurant was excellent..

They were well equipped, silent and had excellent beds (no footboards so our length (son is 6.6, daughter 6.2) was not a problem). The shower could hardly have been better. Plenty of water, big shower head an a hand sprayer. Large cabin. Internet was old fashioned and only allows one user at any time. Login through a slow and imprecise site. The airco was more of a problem, though. We tried to cool the room but even selecting 15 degreed Celsius did not yield a cool room for the night. We paid 150,= a room per night, including breakfast.

Ask for one in the back, or bring good ear plugs (can also be bought at the pharmacy across the street) ; as for breakfast, I would not mind having some juice (they served a good fresh orange juice, but at an extra cost) and good coffee (espresso or other; again, espresso was at extra cost). The coffee served tastes a bit like instant coffee. As for location, it is walking distance to the beautiful Dolmabahce Palace, and to the ferry at Besiktas, from where you can cross the Bosphorus to the asian side and to the Princes Islands.

Nice room, nice size desk to do real work at, sofa and chair for comfortable reading, nice bed, bathroom, even a mini kitchen. The restaurant downstairs was nice for breakfast, and the staff were really excellent. Be clear, this hotel is not to be confused with the Swissotel Bosphorus - it doesn't have the size or the shopping or extensive views, etc. But I was not in Istanbul for all of that, I was there to work and attend the meetings, and Housez was a great solution I would recommend to anyone. I had broken my hip weeks earlier and was going to require a wheelchair. The staff found one and rented it for me, met me at the airport and helped me with my luggage both ways. I asked them several times for help with requests for help and local knowledge, and they were always exceptional. Exceptional service - that is something I have never written in a review before.
