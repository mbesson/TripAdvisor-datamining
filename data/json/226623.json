We picked this hotel for the price primarily and the location secondarily. The price really cannot be beat. The location is great; for those driving from any of the rental agencies at the airport, it is about 5 minutes when no traffic. I was able to drive anywhere I went in San Diego in under 10 minutes (zoo, Coronado, Gaslamp District). The onramp to the I-5, which gets you just about anyplace else, is only a couple blocks away. The rooms are adquate. They seem dated, but not dirty. There is a room with shower/toilet and the sink is in the main sleeping area. The linens were clean, but there was a mold smell in my sink. That was my only complaint with the room. I slept well in the bed and was not terribly bothered by sleeping with the windows open at night. Re: outside noise...as others have mentioned this hotel is on the landing path of the airport. If you stand on the roof you could probably hit the planes by tossing tennis balls at them easily, they are about 10 seconds from landing when they pass over. But, the plane traffic stops around 11-11:30 at night and I didn't hear much before 6 a.m. This hotel also seems to attract nightlight/party lovers, who come in late and are loud. That happened two nights. But otherwise, I heard no traffic noise outside. There is no parking lot but that said, we had no problem finding an on-street space any night when we returned after 6 p.m. (when you no longer have to feed the parking meters). Yes, breakfast is included but it left a lot to be desired. We ate elsewhere the second two days because it sort of felt like a hostel. I'd stay here again if cutting costs was the only way I'd get to San Diego. It wasn't horrible, but not the best hotel experience I've had.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cDoesn't try to be what it's not\u201d", "Author": "Jenks19", "ReviewID": "UR126186333", "Content": "This hotel is centrally located near Old Town and the Gas Lamp districts.

Our last night there we had a couple going into a full fledged argument that woke us up.

The hotel is a short 15-minute walk from the Gaslamp Quarter, about 20 minutes from the Santa Fe Depot (uphill, ouch!) and less than 10 minutes from the restaurants of Little Italy. Also close to Balboa Park and bus stop. I checked in an hour earlier and was given the key to my room right away which was nice. If you're like me and LOVE aviation, you will love this hotel. San Diego has an airport almost right in downtown and you can see a variety of colorful airplanes land right from your window (ask for a high-floor room with windows facing North) which is very cool. On a lazy day, I would just open the window and take pictures! If you intend to sleep during the day, however, the airplane noise will probably bother you... but did you really come to San Diego to sleep your stay off? Last flights land shortly after midnight so noise won't bother most people. On this stay, I was given room 505, which is a small, recently-renovated single room with all the amenities (good A/C system, fridge, coffee maker, ironing board, etc.). The room is much smaller than what you expect in a hotel room, but I didn't need much more space anyways (solo traveler). Room service was efficient although I only used it once during my stay. I left the \"do not disturb\" card on the door and wasn't bothered. Bathoom has shower and toilet; sink is located in the room itself in the \"kitchenette area\". Would have liked the shower head to be adjustable so I could wash better. Daily breakfast is rather poor (would have liked one or two hot items) but replenished multiple times. It consists of orange juice, ice tea, coffee, milk, bottled water, commercial breakfast cereal, sweet buns, grape jam, peanut butter, bagels, toasts, Philadelphia cheese, apples, oranges. There were butter croissants on my last day. Hotel guests generally consist of international leisure travelers. I saw 3 women from France, 4 Indian women, a couple from the UK. Also encountered a Swiss student who was staying there for 3 months. Weekend had some young adult couples partying but nothing too bothersome. Yes, there are homeless people down the street... never bothered me so it's a non-issue. The check-out was smooth as well but I found the Hispanic reception lady very incompetent. I had just stayed at the hotel for a week and wanted to book an extra night in 2 days. I enquired about their best rate but she did not offer me anything close to their best rate (or even a good rate) and I almost had to argue to get the 15% discount given to their frequent-guest programme members about which she clearly had no clue. In the end, she just told me to book on Expedia. Pretty incompetent and clueless to me! PROS: Good value (price/location) for San Diego, clean recently-renovated (but small) room, cool interior court. CONS: Poor customer service makes guests feel unwelcomed (the reception lady doesn't seem to care at all and some maids will leave their service carts in the middle of the hall, preventing guests with luggage to access their rooms), breakfast is very basic and plain, interior court is NOT smoke-free.
