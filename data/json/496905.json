The best word for this very old hotel is \"quaint\"!! If you are looking for luxury then you might want to look elsewhere...I do love being pampered at hotels but when I go to Ocean City I just want a place to sleep, without paying an arm and a leg, so I can just enjoy the beach...and this is what you have right out the door of the Lankford....the beach.... I am very picky about cleanliness and the Lankford definitely meets my expectations. The rooms are very small but again, they are fine for either my daughter and myself or my husband and myself...The beds are just ok. The one thing I wish they would upgrade are the comforters and the blankets....They aren't as nice as I would like...If you watch alot of tv while away, you might be dissappointed...the tv's are about a 13 inch I believe...we don't watch much tv at the beach therefore these tv's are absolutely fine for us... I love the morning compimentary breakfast...the variety is small but sufficient for me. They have bagels, muffins, pastries, toast, coffee, and juices. There are no elevators so be prepared to go up and down steps.. Again, this is not a problem for me and my family. Sisters, Mary and Sara, are the owners... they are very accomodating and become like family when you go as often as I do....their children are always around being helpful as well.... The location is the best part of staying at the Lankford!!! It is located on the boardwalk, on 8th street....therefore, you literally walk out the front door, cross over the boards, and you are on the beach....I love that!!! If you are looking for a place at the beach to visit often, without going bankrupt, the Lankford is the perfect place!! I come here many times thoughout the spring and summer seasons and I am NEVER DISSAPPOINTERD....", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cCharming\u201d", "Author": "travelcruzer99", "ReviewID": "UR125133933", "Content": "Great place to relax in Ocean City.

The family that owns and runs it was there all the time, or so it seemed, and they were very helpful. I stayed there Friday and Saturday of Labor Day weekend (the traditional end of the beach season), and the rates were surprisingly low. I had a room for two nights. It was a bit on the smallish side and sparsely furnished (no desk), but clean and comfortable. There was a ceiling fan, which was nice, and the shower had a liquid-soap dispenser in it, which was also a nice touch. A continental breakfast (toast, bagels, danishes, coffee, tea and juices) is included each morning. Did I mention that it's right on the Ocean City boardwalk and steps away from the beach? And that it has a front porch and second-floor balcony overlooking the boardwalk from which you can watch the legions of passers-by? On-site parking meant not having to feed the voracious Ocean City meters, and my car never left the lot the entire time I was there. By the way, the hotel is 80-plus years old, so there's no elevator (at least not in the building I stayed in), and the free WiFi was only available in the lobby, but if those aren't issues for you, I can heartily recommend the Lankford.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pa", "Title": "\u201cBasic motel but great location\u201d", "Author": "April109", "ReviewID": "UR115935368", "Content": "The location was perfect since it is right on the boardwalk.

There's a large front porch with rockers right on the boardwalk. A great location. On Cruisers' weekend, we had solos, couples and a group staying here. The group was composed of ladies who were into needle work. They gathered in the parlor twice a day and were having a merry old time. They were from the Delaware Valley and stay at the Lankford every year. Rates are reasonable. Plenty of towels and soap, but bring your shampoo, conditioner and hair dryer.

I was truly shocked-canceling for a medical emergency should really be an exception to the rule! when i called to make a new reservations, i was told by the owner that the room was only rented for one night so NO REFUND! sorry to say, but this made me think, \"What would Betty and Warren Frame have done in this situation?\"!", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lock Haven, PA", "Title": "\u201cClassic Beachfront\u201d", "Author": "Bolinins", "ReviewID": "UR34523093", "Content": "Our family has stayed in a couple of different rooms of this old beauty. No elevator so be prepared for the long hike to the third floor if you take one of these rooms-dark paneling throughout, not very modern, but quiet and comfortable. A huge front porch at boardwalk level and another upstairs with rocking chairs-perfect for watching the sunrise over the ocean. The AC in our room would freeze us out when left on. We rented the Robins Nest apartment (lower unit) just off the ramp behind Thrasher's French Fries on 8th Street. Front porch, close to bike rentals and anything else you could want (no pool, sorry!) This apartment is very modern and extremely well kept. The free continental breakfast in the Hotel's main lobby is just a short walk across their parking lot. Yes, they have private parking and it's right there near the apartment so no long walks, plus there is a convenience store for milk, bread, etc... right down the alley out back. The staff is great, plus they seem to bring over guys and girls from Ireland with the greatest accent and best manner's we encountered anywhere on our trips. The price is right, location is great and we felt right at home the minute we arrived. If you don't like old paneling & plumbing, then make sure to get an apartment (yes, they will set up a time to tour it if you ask!) We've stayed many times and always come back for more.

I have recommended it to my parents and friends and they enjoyed it too. Basically whenever a family member is coming to OC, I recommend they stay here--it's like an old timey Waltons family beach cottage--the sun shines in during the breakfast time and you can sit on the porch to eat which IS LITERALLY FIVE STEPS FROM THE BOARDWALK AND BEACH! That was the real draw for me initially, plus the tall white porch columns and the rocking chairs. As a single woman, I always felt safe and could just luxuriate in the beach experience. There is a great 2nd/3rd floor balcony with rocking chairs too to watch the sunset. During off season, the prices are especially reasonable--cheaper than most modern chain motels in a typical non-beach city elsewhere; even during summer peak, it's the best deal on the BOARDWALK! It's not fancy or \"high end,\" but an old fashioned, antiques-in-the-hall, creaky stairs, beachfront sunset, travel back in time with your grandma kind of place at grandma's prices.

The staff was extremely friendly and when my BF asked about fishing spots, one of the staff members hopped on his personal cell and made a call to a good friend of his to ask questions. That's service!! They had a warm breakfast first thing in the morning which included coffee, doughnuts, oj, and croissants. Don't expect to spend all day at the hotel as there really isn't a lot of amenities there for you, but it's just perfect for a place to rest your head after a day on the beach and the price and view were excellent during peak season. My parents' favorite thing to do while there was sit on the porch and people watch.
