We stayed for three nights in the brand new rooms on the 4th floor (5th for us Americans). The room recently added/remodeled with wood floors and tasteful convenient furniture/lighting. Although it wasn't as large as some of the other rooms seem to be, the high ceilings, brand new fixtures and lighting,and wood floors more than made up for it. It was decorated in a very modern style with nice recessed fluorescent lighting over the bed and around the bathroom mirror. They kept it immaculately clean daily, replacing all the sheets and towels. The king-size bed had a comfortable mattress. The entrance is small (I think to make more space for their very large restaurant), but once you're inside it opens up into classic Mexico city style with walkways along the sides of a courtyard with the doors all opening up onto walkways lining the courtyard. The weather was a little chilly while we were there, but the glass roof on the courtyard kept it a little warmer, yet still open feeling and bright. The one possible negative mentioned in the other reviews here was noise from other guests. It was generally quiet, but one night (a Friday) my wife was woken up by the sound of someone loudly having sex. She was more amused than anything else, and I sleep through pretty much anything so it didn't bother us much. Notably they gave us a discount and the room only cost us a little over $20 per night. I was reminded of a couple of years ago when I stayed in a much smaller, but similarly centrally located and appointed room in el Barri Gotic in Barcelona for more than 10 times that amount. My wife and I plan on coming back. Cleanliness, and a decent bathroom/shower are probably the two most important things to my wife and I in a hotel, and the Hotel Principal exceeded our expectations for far less then we have paid in other places in Mexico City (where my wife is from). One other note, they advertise free WiFi access, but the signal was week and access spotty in our room, to the point of being almost unusable. They had a computer in the lobby you could use, and the access might have been better in another room or in the restaurant.

If you book a room at this hotel, be sure to insist on having an end room - the rooms on either end of the building facing the street are enormous, with great bathroom facilities, high ceilings and comfortable beds. The rooms on the interior of the hotel are dorm-style hostel rooms in which the shower in the bathroom proper and the beds have thin pillows. Additionally, the noise from the hallway into the interior rooms is vastly more intrusive than the street noise in the end rooms. The location of this hotel is a major selling point. It is in the Centro Historico with one block walk to the Bellas Artes area and two blocks to the Central Zocalo and major historical landmarks. Mexico City is hugely spread out geographically, so you can book a private car (priced slightly higher than a taxi but still reasonably) from the man at the front desk - it is a 15-minute ride to Zona Rosa, Roma and a bit further to Polanco. There is a great Metro station three blocks away, and charming places to eat breakfast or go dancing, and great bakeries all in the neighborhood. An additional selling point at this hotel is the hospitable front desk help who, though they spoke little English, muddle through our medicore Spanish to change hotel rooms, pay our bills, book cars and get directions. Also, there is a restaurant next door that, although it caters mainly to tourists, has sangria that will knock your socks off.

When I arrived I was told it was a problem as those rooms were not available. This hotel has always been loud at night but it is much worse than in the past. I realize a hotel for $20.00 US nightly is not going to attract the highest class individuals as a rule but there are some truely low class people using this place. People returned all hours of the night and were clearly drunk, making a lot of noice, group singing (3am) and slamming doors, laughing very loud. They thought nothing of it. There was one drunk going from room to room asking for sex. I heard a lady in another room come out into the hall area and demand that everyone just \"shut up as she has been trying to sleep for hours\". I spoke to the front desk clerk and the owner and neither did anything about it. The least the can do is to ask people to hold down the noice when they return after about 11pm but this never crosses their minds. Secondly, about 5am each morning a hotel employee or an employee of the restaurant (overpriced food, not very good ) begins to slam metal doors while emptying trash. This happened each morning.

On the other side is a restaurant that opens at 8 AM, where you can get breakfast. My room was on the third floor and well back from the street, so street noise was not a problem. A large youth group checked-in just before me, so it was a little noisy at night. I was able to sleep decently, given that I do not normally sleep well in hotels. The room was not air-conditioned, but did have windows that open and a vent over the door. It was stuffy during the day, but not too bad at night. The room was made up daily and was acceptably clean. It contained a safe, but I could not figure out the locking mechanism and never used it. I had trouble figuring out how to unlock my room, but once I did, I did not have problems. There were a few things I wasn't crazy about. My shower did not drain well, so I showered piecemeal. The water pressure was poor, but the shower got hot fairly quickly. On my first morning, I observed (dead) cockroaches on the stairwell. Thankfully, by evening they were gone, and I didn't see anymore during my stay. Overall, for what I paid for my stay, the hotel more than met my expectations. I was five minutes from the Zocalo and the Palacio de Belles Artes, which was really convenient.
