Although it is on a main road and being a light a sleeper this was something that I struggled with but the rest of my party did not. The hotel is based in what we considered to be quite a residential area and because of this there were not many restaurants located in the area although the ones we found were excellent although for more choice would recomend possibly eating closer to the center if none take your fancy.(Although bear in mind that after 9pm the Line A closes). The staff were very friendly and even though we spoke little Italian we were able to communicate with them well. They were very attentive and when we encountered a problem with our room they were able to move us very quickly with no problem whatsoever. The rooms were basic but did offer television and mini bar and realistically we spent little time in them because we were exploring the city. The breakfast was good and offered a varied selection but not the greatest Like other reviews we were also asked to pay a city tax which is something we were unaware of so that's something to bear in mind it was apparently 2 euros each day per person.

The room was comfortable, had the much-needed air conditioning, and was fairly priced at 70E. The breakfast was worthless, just bread (of various types), tea, and coffee. Someone had to get you what you wanted to drink, which was annoying. Sometimes I wonder why hotels even bother, other than they can advertise they have \"breakfast.\" No real complaint, though, as we had no great expectation for their breakfast and therefore were not disappointed. But don't be fooled by the \"free breakfast\" advertised. What was disappointing - and this is where Hotel Laura gets a complete and total \"Zero\" - was the rudeness of one of the employees. My friend and I had checked out, but left our bags at the hotel for a few hours, collecting them later. No problem there.The hotel is on the fourth floor of the building. We needed to rearrange some of the items in our luggage, and since we had already checked out, we did this in a discreet corner of the street level lobby. (There is nothing in this lobby, it's merely an entrance.) We were not even in view of the front door. One of the Hotel Laura employees came in from the street and immediately yelled at us. I mean YELLED. He was screaming about how we have no respect for the hotel. (Please recall that this is not a hotel lobby; the hotel is four floors away.) He asked us if we understood him, as he was speaking Italian. Yes, we speak Italian too, but the man would not stop shouting for us to even answer! So, Hotel Laura, I will agree to never disrespect you again. And you will agree to never have my business again.

The breakfast is limited to orange juce, coffee, cereals, croissants, marmelade and milk. The staff is helpful and kind.

The room was comfortable and in great order, and even included a little refrigerator with water, soft drinks, and beer that didn't cost much more than buying them at the store. It was a small room, but that is fairly standard in Europe so as an American one just has to adjust to that characteristic. At the price we paid (September 07) of 80 Euros/night, we thought it was an excellent value. While it would have been nice for the breakfast to include something other than croissants, cereal, bread and coffee, it was enough food to get us started in the morning. As for the location, the other reviews are accurate, you walk out the front door and the steps down to the metro are literally right there. From there, it's a matter of minutes to the city center, as well as numerous tourist sites across central Rome (e.g., The Vatican, Spanish Steps, the Pantheon, the Colloseum, and many more).

There is also a taxi stand very close by. There are no good restaurants within walking distance, ditto for shopping. The staff consisted of one man and one woman. The man was pleasant and is helpful if you can converse with him in italian. The woman is very rude and border line iignorant. I bit my tongue numerous times at her tone. We were advised not to use an iron in the room in a very irritating way. Also the wait for our room to be ready was made as uncomfortable as possible. No help with storing luggage while we waited, so we had to stand by our luggage and wait the two hours or lug it all with us. The elevator is very small. It will hold one person and one piece of luggage or two people. So beware if travelling with luggage. The rooms are very small and the TV is tiny and only shows italian stations.

We contacted the hotel directly, they speak good English, but it helped that my mum is Italian. Hotel is situated on the 4th and 5th floors of the building (there is a lift). It's fantastic that the hotel is literally 10 steps from the entrance to Bologna Metro. Great after a long day queuing and walking in the centre of Rome (which is easy access via Line B from the hotel, or changing to Line A from Termini). You get bus and train tickets (same thing) from the little tobacco shops (there is one a few yards to the left of the hotel entrance. 1 euro for a single, 2 euros for a return (each single ticket lasts 75 mins once you put it through the machines on the buses and trains so you can travel anywhere in that time, the return is a seperate ticket again lasting 75 mins). Rooms are very nice, great value for money. If you can, get a room which isn't facing the street, as Rome comes alive after 11pm and they are up very early, so you might be woken by traffic if you are not a heavy sleeper. Rooms are all pretty similar other than that. If you need extra pillows, ask at reception. Bathrooms are a decent size with a huge sink, and double bed is a nice size too. Everytime you leave the hotel, leave your key at reception, it is 24 hours and when the front door is closed just buzz in and they will open the door for you. The only disappointing part was the breakfast. Just croissants, bread, spreads and coffees. The restaurants around this hotel are fantastic, tastes just like my mum's home cooked food. The person on reception will recommend them to you if you ask. There were at lest three that were superb and all within 2 minutes walking distance from the hotel. A tip though, if you are sightseeing or exploring the centre of Rome, please don't go to any of the restaurants near the attractions as the food is so bad, and so expensive, unless you've been recommended by someone you know. Don't listen to any well dressed men on the streets promoting restaurants and home cooked food as it is a lie - we were duped by this. Best to get a light lunch in a pizzeria and have a decent meal near the hotel in the evening. Get a taxi to and from the airport as the Metro gets so packced it's worse than London tubes, so lugging suitcases may be a problem. Also watch your bags, pick pockets are rife in Rome and on the Metro.
