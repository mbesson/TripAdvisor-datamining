During the room requisitions, we specifically requested that we did not want adjoining rooms. When we arrived at the hotel, we realized that all our rooms were adjoining even though our request was clearly stated that on our sheet. They told us that it must have been an error with the reservation department, but nothing was done to fix it. On our first night, in inspecting the mattress, we found a suspicious bag in one of the rooms. With further inspection and from the smell on opening, it appeared to be marijuana. In approaching the desk with it the next morning, we were greeted with a response that insinuated that someone in our group had brought it. This is was infuriating! During my second night, before I was about to get into bed, I noticed a black bug crawly on my bed sheet. I briefly examined the mattress and since I couldn't visually see anything, and it didn't look like a bedbug, I decided that it may have been a single bug that had come in on my shoe, or something. The next morning, I saw another bug crawling out from under my sheet. I was disgusted at this point thinking of how many more there might have been. Since it had been our last night, I simply informed the front desk and they said they would let housekeeping know. When packing, I looked underneath the bed to make sure I hadn't left anything behind. In doing so, I found an old used cup, an article of clothing (not mine), and wrappers. Overall, I would NEVER stay at this hotel again! The amount of cleanliness issues that we encountered was disgusting. The front desk seemed to brush everything off as being no big deal, and on top of that insinuated that we had brought drugs!

I was expecting worse after reading previous reviews of this place. The bed was comfy, tv worked, and wifi was strong. The bathrooms are very tiny.

An entrance to the underground mall is also close by. Parking was $25 (valet only), but we thought it was worth it knowing that our car was safe. This hotel seems like a party hotel for anyone attending bachelor/bachelorette parties, hockey games, or US college kids.

The location of the hotel is great. The swimming pool was very nice, and the hotel has a good gym facilities but the jacuzzi had hair and nails in. There is a sauna and wet steam room in the change areas. Complimentary WiFi is great to have, but slow. The hotel have a very odd voucher system for breakfast. I received 5 breakfast vouchers - one per night for me and my partner. On the first morning, we were advised that the coupon is for continental breakfast , and that a coupon is for one person only. I indicated that I had booked a room for two people. The waiter only shrugged his shoulders and said that I need to sort it out with the hotel. (Afterwards I realised that the restaurant is run and managed separately from the hotel.) Continental breakfast is very poor and wouldn't fill a child, let alone an adult, consists of coffee/tea and juice and 2 of a small selection of choices. ie croissant; pain au chocolat; oatmeal toast and one or two other goods. I had to leave my partner; go to the room - on the 15th floor to get the booking confirmation - to sort the voucher issue. The receptionist was quick to sort out the 'error' and gave new breakfast vouchers to the value of $20 per day for 2 people or $10 for one. (Breakfast prices start from $9.45 excl all the taxes up to $18+) Any expense more than $20 had to be paid by ourselves. I was a bit surprised and annoyed that nowhere on the web-site or confirmation does it indicate that breakfast vouchers are issued and that any excess has to be paid for. I have never encountered this odd system when staying with Holiday Inn before! The standard of breakfast was not worth it. We paid a tip/gratitude every morning - about 15%. On the last day the waiter entered her own tip, which I thought was exceedingly rude! On the second day I mentioned that I was a Holiday Inn Premier Club Elite member, and was given an upgrade. I thought that, as the hotel was virtually empty, they would have done so without being prompted. The man who sorted it did it in a very professional manner, but feel it should been allocated automatic at the time of check in During the stay I developed a skin rash - not sure if it was from the jacuzzi, but a local pharmacist was able to give me medication to treat it. Other reviews have mentioned bedbugs. On the morning of our departure a hotel cleaner, who left her trolley outside our room, was quick to ask what time we were checking out.

Once you see it you will know what I mean. My major criteria for room comfort is this. Can I leave the AC on at night and still sleep and the answer here is YES - just. The Restaurant and the Coffee vendor in the lobby are both Concessions and as such independent businesses, that mean no consistency in service and it shows. The Coffee Vendor is solid gold and deserve accolades. The Restaurant is marginal, the attached bar is better thanks to his great staff. This is the hotel's business model and that is their choice but it detracts from the overall rating of the hotel. The whole French thing is a problem. This is downtown Montreal and us Anglophones can't help but think we are being despised by the Front Desk staff. I am not sure they even realize it is happening but........ guess what!!!! I am not Canadian, I am not British, I had nothing to do with the Plains of Abraham so don't take it our on me OK.

She apologized and said that she thought the room was vacant. That was shocking, as I thought they knocked before entering. Anyways, we headed out for the day. The next morning, we headed to the pool for a swim, and found the pool attendant (I use this term loosely) was sitting by the pool totally focused on his i-phone and texting and with two ear buds in his ears. He never looked up once during our swim. This was his break time I guess!!!!!!!!!!! Meanwhile, the pool was full of kids and he was suppposed to be a lifeguard. WOW. I would had to see the lawsuits that hotel would get if something happened to one of the children. We went back to our room to shower, and noticed we didn't have any towels - and we didn't use any the previous day. So, we called and asked for some, and waited and waited and waited. Finally after about 45 minutes, we got our towels. Then, we headed to the lobby for some assistance at the front desk. We asked for a dinner recommendation in the area. The girl at the front desk was short with us - and literally pointed left and told us to walk that way to find a restaurant. No mention of a name of a restaurant, nothing. We walked and walked and guessed on a restaurant. We found one, but the food was horrible. A special night for us was ruined by the lack of care and attention by the front desk. What would it take for them to give me a lousy minute of their time to provide a simple request - a restaurant that they would recommend. This level of service (or lack thereof) is disgraceful.

The pool looks clean and nice but we didn't have time to enjoy it. The staff spoke well in both languages but weren't necessarily the kindest people.

Room 1917 was pleasantly large with a king sized bed, flat screen TV, coffee maker, iron and board, safe, a desk table and wing chair.

There are several table lamps as well as a floor lamp for reading in the comfy wing chair. The TV has the usual cable channels and the required pay for view. Never mind, the WiFi is free and no access code is required, so I'm up and running in several seconds. Sadly the hotel service directory has all the pages missing. The front desk apologize and explain that due to the logo change, it is being re-printed. The top 6 floors are the executive floors and require a key card in the elevator.

If you read the fine print carefully on a door handle card, you notice that a free continental breakfast is offered. I'm not sure if is just on the executive floors. It consists of decent coffee, a slice of toast, a chocolate brioche and a plain croissant. It comes with required condiments.

The concierges were very helpful and a great asset. They made my stay a better one to be sure. The location was great. Just a 5 minute walk to the metro or underground shopping. We preferred to use the McGill Metro due to there not being a steep incline to go up to the hotel as from the Place des Arts Metro. It was easy to orient ourselves as well as we just had to head upwards, as the hotel is on a slight hill. We took the 747 from the airport, transferred at Berry UQAM to a metro and got off at McGill. You can buy a $7 ticket that gives you unlimited travel on buses and metro for 24 hours from time of purchase, or a $14 ticket that gives you 3 days of unlimited travel as of the date of purchase and till midnight on the 3rd day. One problem I had was that my local calls were free on our floor but I couldn't make phonecalls due to the phones (2 in our room) being blocked and giving me busy signals upon dialing out.

They then understood the lines were blocked and at that point it was a quick fix. My second problem was that I was unable to lower the heat in our room. The thermostat wasn't functioning and was reading 25 when we so desperately wanted to have it cooler. It had a mind of it's own and gave us a cool room when it wanted. This may have been in part due to the extreme heat/humidity during our stay in Montreal and didn't take away from our enjoyment of our room. I would definitely stay here again but only if I could get a corner suite on the executive floor. Our 2nd stay was much better. I do seem to recall hearing pipes from other rooms when in a middle suite on a lower floor, back in 2006.

It was marked as a 3.5 star but we really think it was more of a 3 star (with reasons to follow). To park at the location, you must use their valet parking. It's all good and stuff minus the convenience of dropping stuff at your car after (prepare to line up if you need to do it during the day time), and the fact that when they pull a Tokyo drift when getting your car to you (We heard tire screeches as they maneuvered the parking lot in our car). It's also $22 after taxes per day. It does have in/out privileges so that's a plus! The luxury look kind of stops at the lobby. We got a limited access floor (you need your key card in elevator to access the floor), and when we got into our room, it was pretty small. We had a 2 double bed room and there were no real desks; just a tall table and 2 sofas. If you need to do work; go back to the lobby. But WiFi was free throughout the hotel :) There's no complimentary breakfast but maybe that's the norm for that location. There is a restaurant downstairs where you can get two eggs, toast, a choice of meat and coffee for only $6.95 + taxes. In terms of cleanliness / service, we asked house cleaning to help us clean the tub because we made a mess, but even after they cleaned it, it still smelled kind of bad. It's obvious that they simply just rinsed it with water and that's it. We even tipped them $10 in advance too... I'm not saying it's their fault that the place was dirty but I'm saying they didn't put up too much effort in cleaning it even when we provided incentives.

They will bring the food up to your room as well which is nice.

The lobby was pretty huge and very clean. There is a dine-in restaurant upon entry that served great food, as well as a cafe stand on the adjacent side that served ice cream, coffee, and snacks. It was a great place to go during the morning to pick up a quick bit to eat. There is also a business centre at the back of the lobby with 4 computers! It was very useful since I was able to print directions going home and did not need to wait. The rooms are very spacious and clean. One thing I found very odd about the room was that the sink was located outside of the washroom. I found it very inconvenient as the washroom was very cramped and I had little space to put my shampoo and soap on the bathtub ledge. Moreover, the walls of the room weren't soundproof. You could hear people talking in the halls as well as the flushing of toilets in the middle of the night. I wasn't really irritated by it, but for those who are light sleepers this could potentially pose a problem. Overall, I think that Holiday Inn was a decent stay. Although I would've liked a bit more peace and quiet during the night, I think it was tolerable. I can't really argue with the price I paid (around 70$), and plus it's right in the heart of Montreal so moving around was very easy.

The room lighting was too dim, and not in the right places, so while I appreciated the free newspaper, it was too dark and uncomfortable to read it at night on the sofa. We received a voucher for free continental breakfast in the first floor restaurant, The waitstaff was very friendly and helpful, and the food was fine but not too plentiful.

I booked through Hotwire, and our rate was good, but Hotwire classifies this hotel as 3.5 stars - and it doesn't meet that expectation in my opinion. Hotwire doesn't tell you where you are staying until you've booked - and when I found out I was staying at the Holiday Inn I wasn't sure what to expect - but considering they rated this hotel as a 3.5 star property, I figured it would be more than adequate for service and amenities. The lobby was nice, and the room was large and decent enough, but the noise filtering through from the hallway was the worst I've experienced in a hotel. You could hear the guests in the room below us every time they flushed their toilet. In room amenities consisted of one tiny bar of soap and a tiny bottle of shampoo. There wasn't even a hotel directory in the room. There was hair in our sheets, and my spouse cut his finger on a small piece of glass embedded in the bed cover. The parking situation was terrible. Being Halloween, we didn't want to park our vehicle on the street, so we used the hotel's parking facilities. Valet parking is mandatory at this hotel, which we weren't happy about, considering the risk of damages and us not having easy access to our vehicle. In the evening we had dinner reservations outside the hotel, and waited 25 minutes for valet to bring us our truck as the attendant was too busy parking cars for a wedding party that had arrived - it appeared we were at the bottom of the priority list. And we had tipped them well beforehand! The doorman wouldn't call down to find out what was causing the delay - he simply passed the phone over to us and had us call down to valet to inquire. Needless to say we were late for our reservation and were rather frustrated. In the morning the express check-out service was not working, so I had to stand in line at the front desk for what seemed like forever - since there was only one staff member working on a Sunday morning. I've stayed at the Delta Montreal next door a number of times and found it to be a much better hotel all around, for the same price.

For those who know me, you know that the most important thing for me in a hotel other than location is the 'sleepability' of the hotel. Meaning, I don't care if the carpet is stained as long as I can sleep here and be comfortable. That being said, I have to start off with the worst thing about this hotel: the noise. As I lay in bed, I can hear the occupants on either side of me. I also hear the toilet's flushing, and as brash as it sounds, I can also hear people urinating into said toilets. It seems that the walls are made of a very thin material. In addition, one night I went to bed a bit earlier and heard vacumming at around 10pm which emulated a bizarre buzzing sound into my room. I also wonder what others could hear coming from my room. One morning I even tip toed around as I was up very early and didnt want to disturb my neighbours - how bizarre is that ? :) Therefore, I cannot recommend this hotel and would not stay here again. Sleep is very important to me, and on numerous occasions I would awake to a flushing toilet or someone coughing. One more thing, and this may also sound bizarre of me to say, but I think that room service is a little too punctual. Since I was here on leisure, I would sleep in until 9am and leisurely start my morning and had room service knocking on my door at 9:30am the first morning. Because of that, I used the 'do not disturb' sign every day until I was ready to leave the room. I've never really had to do that before until this hotel. Gee, this complaining stuff doesn't really sound like me, so below are some pros for the optimist in me!

Great Downtown location on Sherbrooke West. Crisp, clean towels and bedsheets. BUT - all else was horror!!! Our travel agent booked us two nights at the HIMM as part of a two-week tour itinerary of eastern Canada. After a week travelling independently in the rural wilds of east Quebec staying in low-budget motels, we were excited about our final two nights in a big-name hotel. How wrong we were. This is a fur coat, no knickers hotel if ever there was one: hi-gloss lobby, shocking rooms. We were allocated Room 228. Among its many delights were: crumbs from previous occupants on table, sticky spots on the floor tiles, grubby carpet, low-power shower that swerved from scalding to icy, long black hairs in the bath, nasty unidentified stains on the wall next to the toilet, a toilet that required you to lean your full body weight on the lever to flush, chipped washbasin, dirt-encrusted hairdryer, stained carpet, chipped veneer on the furniture, curtains broken free from their track that not only didn't close properly but had large horizontal tears (to get a full night's sleep, we had to secure the gaps with the tent-pegs - lucky we packed them, no?) I could go on and on and on, but you get the picture.... Sadly, the horror doesn't end there. No sirree. As we checked in, a gang of school children burst screaming and yelling through the lobby. I turned to the receptionist and said - jokingly - 'we aren't on the same corridor, are we?' No of course not, said the receptionist without blinking. Guess what........? First thing we knew about it was returning from dinner, emerging from the lift to be confronted with two security guards. Our corridor was full of screaming boys, their teachers trying to herd them into rooms. I went straight downstairs and asked reception very politely if they could move us immediately. Receptionist - sneery - said that the hotel was very full and that there were only five unoccupied rooms. I smiled and said that any one of those five rooms that wasn't on a floor with the school party would do us just fine. Receptionist - glacial - said we could take that up with the hotel manager in the morning. Oh what fun we had! It took the teachers from 2200-2300 to round up the little darlings, secure them in their rooms and do a door-by-door final check. And then the routine started up next morning, from 0715-0800, this time accompanied by running down the corridors yelling and banging on doors. My partner bribed me with promise of a blow-out final dinner not to waste our last full day in Canada faffing around changing hotel rooms (assuming that the manager would have oh-so-generously allowed it). Instead, we made a point of staying away from the hotel for as much of the day as possible and not spending a cent on any of its additional facilities. I travel on business in the Middle East and some of my favourite properties are Holiday Inns. No Holiday Inn in that developing region would offer such shabby facilities or be so dismissive of a guest's complaints. I used to be a huge fan of the Holiday Inn brand. Not any more.

I suspect that many of them are 18- to 20-year-old Americans who can drink in Canada but not in the US. To get around this, you can request one of the private floors towards the top of the hotel. I stayed on one of these floors and had no noise problem the whole time I was there. The rooms are not the most modern, but everything in the room worked. The hotel had two very strong points: free, wired internet in all the rooms, and a good restaurant with reasonable prices. You can rent ethernet cables from the front desk for a $25, refundable deposit. I found the restaurants around the hotel to be on the expensive side, but the restaurant at the hotel was pretty good for pretty cheap.", "Date": "June 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford Ct", "Title": "\u201cnot what I expected\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5343624", "Content": "I went and stayed at this hotel for one weekend in March. It was not what I expected at all. When I first got there I tried to check in but I had problems with the front desk. They did not speak very good english and I do not know any french which caused a very long time for me to check in , I waited for almost an hour. On the other hand the hotel's restaurant is very good and has a nice bar. It is also very close to all the nightlife and shopping.Warning! when I stayed there , their was so many high school and college students all over the hotel. At night they are all loud and drunk. At one point I was sleeping and I was awakened by a knock on the door by a drunk man trying to come in, who I had to call security to get away. At another point the door that seperates two rooms was opened by the room next door and two drunk strangers walked into my room at 1 am.

I have to say I STRONGLY DISAGREE with most of the reviews. I had a great experience, and it is hard to impress a new yorker! The service was impecable! Extra pillows, concierge, money exhange, room service, operator I can go on and on - all were great. The complimentary breakfast is not WOW but it is free and it does the trick - OJ coffee toast and croissants what else do you want? The pool is nice, hottub a little small but it is nice. I got a wonderful massage by their massage therapist at a reasonable rate. The bar and restaurant were definitely amongst the cheapest and best that we found (have the ribs - very good)....We also got put on the executive floor and didnt have to pay for it..very nice room- ac worked fine - the walls are somewhat thin when it comes to plumbing but hey so are mine at home. The location also cannot be beat - it is about 4 blocks from St Catherines street - lots of restaurants, shopping, museums and more shopping, a couple of blocks from both the underground and the metro. Old Montreal is a nice walk but on a beautiful day - very nice. Taxi to the casino 15 CAD, airport 35 CAD.
