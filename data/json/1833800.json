It was literally less than 100 yards from the Vatican. Shopping was a couple blocks down the street for boutiques and a grocery store. A couple quaint cafes are nearby- I recommend going to the one across from the Vatican wall just across the street and to the left. Rooms were nice- all have a hair dryer, lots of hanging space and drawers with modern bathrooms. We stayed in Room 102 that did not have a fridge in the room but had one just outside the door with a stove and cabinets full of dishes we could use. Fabio at the front desk was very accommodating. He was able to get us a van on the last day to take us to the airport. He furnished us with a simple map and gave recommendations for shopping & dining. Clean towels, 2 waters, and croissants were provided everyday (specify still water or soda water). We did not have a/c (not a/c season yet) and had to keep the windows. It was comfortable but hard to sleep with the city noise. The upstairs terrace was wonderful and furnished with outdoor patio furniture sets.

It was also well located for my business meetings in the Prati district and for the restaurants and nightlife of Trastevere. The hotel appears to be a recently refurbished apartment building and has kitchenettes on each floor and a roof terrace at the top. Our room was lovely - very spacious with plenty of storage space, and beautiful, if quirky, furnishings. It was roasting hot during our stay but the room stayed nice and cool and we had a lovely view of the bussling street life from our large, white shuttered windows. The bathroom was very small, but had modern fittings and a good shower. The hotel does not have a restaurant or bar, the reception is in the next door building and guests are given keys to the building in which the rooms are situated. The advantage of this is that you can come and go as you please, even late at night. There is no breakfast, but the rooms have tea and coffee making facilities and mineral water, biscuits and croissants are provided free of charge. In many ways, the set up is similar to an \"apart-hotel\". I do think that the Vatican View could make more of this, perhaps by providing more extensive facilities for guests to prepare their own breakfasts and by installing mini-bars in the rooms. I also think that the roof terrace is something of a missed opportunity - in-room mini bars or a small roof-top bar (even an honesty bar) would be nice. All in all, perfect for a romantic weekend break in Rome, but maybe not ideal for business travellers.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cExpectations met, and more!\u201d", "Author": "RustyRazor", "ReviewID": "UR121502412", "Content": "From my initial email exchanges with the front desk via email after I'd made the reservation (inquired re. wi-fi, etc.) to the check-out after my two-day stay, I was fully satisfied, and more.

The renovation must be very recent as everything looked very new and clean. We found the rooms to be very comfortable. The bathrooms are large and nicely appointed. The beds at first felt quite firm but proved to be very comfortable. The bedrooms are a little on the small side but the overall design of the rooms is well thought out to make the best use of the available space. The service we received was first rate. We arrived for check in 1 hour after the office officially closed. This was no issue and we received a cheerful greeting despite the inconvenience caused for the manager. He was also extremely helpful in booking us a taxi to catch an early morning flight It is interesting to have read so many reviews about the location. It is certainly true that it would be hard to find a location with better proximity to the Vatican. Further, the location is quite a convenient base in which to explore the city. For shopaholics there is excellent shopping available several streets away. During our holiday in Rome we also spent some time based in an apartment near Campo De' Fiori. Comparing the two locations we felt that the later location was more family orientated, offered a better range of restaurants and never ceased to throw up interesting surprises as we explored the multitude of back streets away form the more touristy parts of the city.

Very modern facilities, with hair dryer, stand up shower and even wi-fi in your room.

The Vatican is less than a 3 minute walk with great views from the upstairs terrace, and all major sites are less than 15-20 minutes from the hotel. You can easily find taxis outside the front door if you don't want to walk. The only thing I would say is that the restaurants around the hotel seem to be tourist traps.

LOCATION: Difficult to find at first as it is not a standalone building and no big sign; just a large door on the street and a plague- clearly the hotel used to be apartments. For a young couple like ourselves, it was a perfect base to see the sites of Rome. If your primary interest is Renaissance art and sculpture, the Vatican museum is very close by. St. Peter's Basilica is a stones throw away also. The others sites of Rome, however, are across the Tiber and require a Metro (10 mins walk to nearest station) or a 20 to 30 min walk across the city- something to keep in mind for elderly, families and disabled. You could argue that you're going to want to see the Vatican anyway and on that morning, you only have to roll out of bed and you're there. HOTEL & ROOM The first thing that strikes you is the facade of the hotel. It's just a door with the \"Relais Vatican View\" engraved on a plague. There is a buzzer with which to identify yourself when you arrive first. It becomes clear very quickly that the hotel has recently been renovated from apartments as you make your up narrow staircases, into a tiny lift and up to reception. The greeting at reception was friendly and we arrived late. The rooms are fantastically modern and impressively clean. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels on business and never have I come across a room as clean & modern. Bed sheets changed every day no matter what time we left. Bathroom was small but again to the highest standard of cleanliness. PRICE Probably the best part for us. We booked six months in advance and got 4 nights for just over 200 euro. Incredible when you think one of those nights was NYE. OTHER BONUSES Free Wifi- an absolute godsend. Got a lovely card left in our room on NYE wishing us a Happy New Year- a great touch! Pros- Impeccably clean and modern, great value, very comfortable Cons- Narrow apartment complex-like staircase, halls & lift. Location may be a problem if you like to be closer to the action. No breakfast but plenty of cafes around the corner. Overall very impressed and would definitely recommend to young couples.

Spanish Steps Piazza Venezia San Pietro Castel Sant' Angelo bars and clubs are just a few steps from the hotel.

No works were performed there at all at Vatican View, but there were undoubtedly other rooms available on the same site via which we booked, same level as ours, but 2 to 3 times the price we paid. Such behaviour from an hotel is unacceptable, hence I would never recommend such hotel. To get the same level 2 days in advance cost us double the price (...).

So ..... firstly ..... no view of the vatican but yes it is incredibly close and i mean about a 30 sec walk until you are in st peters square. This is great except there isnt much else around the immediate area apart from the vatican. The location is good but you will either need to walk for about 25 mins to get to the main city area or a ten min walk and then a cheap metro instead. Not a major issue but it might be for elderly couples or parents. The hotel itself is very hard to find , just a black door and a tiny sign !! Very small lift and a tight staircase to reception on the 4th floor (while they have some issues sorted). Staff are all very friendly and helpful though. Room was a good size , comfy bed , big tv but only bbc world news in english. Bathroom is lovely but very small. No breakfast available but there is a little kitchen area and lots of cafes nearby.
