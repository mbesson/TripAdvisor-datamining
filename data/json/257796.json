It was then I realised that the loud rumbling was caused by trains arriving into the station located right by & under the hotel. They stopped at about 11pm but restarted about 5am - hardly condusive to a good nights sleep. Room service dinner was excellent. I rarely eat breakfast at my hotel as I refuse to pay the ridiculous amounts charged - at $30 Harbour View was no different.

This is our second stay. We stayed in March last year for our 1st anni, and we decided to return to this hotel for our 2nd anni because of our fond memories. I cannot recommend highly enough this package, it is such great value! Wine, choc dipped strawberries, lindt chocs, 3 course meal, buffet breakfast, drink vouchers, late checkout and parking incl. all for under $400. The location of this hotel is amazing, just down the road from the beautiful Blues Point Reserve which has panoramic views of the harbour! The hotel is very easy to find. I think there was a private event on that wkend as the underground carpark was full, but luckily we got a spot right at the main entrance. The hotel kindly allowed us to reserve our spot with cones when we drove out to Blues Point at midnight. Check-in felt personal, professional and friendly. We were greeted with a 'welcome back' from the staff. We were in the deluxe room 1301, with the chocs, strawberries, and champagne flutes presented tastefully on the table on arrival. We also had a lovely 'welcome back' greeting card! The room was fresh and kept very clean. Yep, postcard views of the harbour! The hotel bed was exactly how we remembered it: like sleeping on a cloud! We were slightly disappointed with the rainshower (for which we were eager to use again lol), because the pressure was weak. Maybe it's due to the fact there were so many guests, I think there was a wedding on that night. LB's restaurant for dinner was amazing! We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. Their menu has changed a bit and our mains were of an amazing quality. Breakfast at 9am in LB's was full, so we were given the choice to sit on the comfortable chair and tables in Blues Bar. I honestly prefered this, as the restaurant was so full, it seemed chaotic, and the bar was away from all the noise! And the lounge chair was really comfortable! Breakfast was great, I missed their bircher muesli! I highly recommend this hotel and the premium romance package to couples.

It is a 1970-80s hotel that has been renovated, so the layout of the rooms is slightly old fashioned (small bathrooms).

Our room was directly above the train line, which was noisy even on the 8th floor. I found the bed too soft for my liking and the pillows were not comfortable (I am used to very firm pillows and bed...) The bathrooms were small, but had enough bench space to leave personal items. The bathrooms were renovated and quite nice. Room service was the price you would expect and the food was good. We did not have breakfast included, but felt that $30 was on the high side of what we wanted to pay (for the amount I eat).

Upon check in the place had a good atmosphere, there was a small band playing in the bar and it seemed fresh and alive. Arriving in my room I found a very modern and updated room, with all facilities and amenities one would expect. The cleanliness, appearance and quality was a step above Rydges. Staff service was of a high service. There is a concierge and a bell boy, something non existent at Rydges. I had to change rooms during my stay, something I was aware of at the time of booking, this was facilitated by the staff including moving my luggage. A similar experience at Rydges was the opposite, no moving of luggage etc. The food quality and choices are high. The breakfast buffet is high quality. The F&B staff are plentiful and helpful. Room service has wide array of choices and is prompt. All the opposite of Rydges down the road, where they always seem to be understaffed and room service orders regularly disappear or get lost,,,, A simple comparison to Rydges - here at Harbourview the TV channels include all the new freeview free to air channels, at Rydges they still only have the old basic free to air channels. The pricing for this stay worked out less than a comparable Rydges stay The only downside is the occasional dep noise and rumble from the train station below.

Upon arrival I was told that yes, my request had been 'entered in the system' but that the room allocated to me had not yet been vacated, and that I could either wait in the lobby/restaurant or take one of the other rooms that was free. When I asked if I was being offered a similar room to the one I had paid for, the receptionist admitted it was not as nice, as it looked out on the other side (kind of defeating the point of the Harbour View) but it was all they had at the time. Tired as I was, I specifically asked if I could use the other room 'for the time being' so that I could just have a shower and step out into the city. At this point I was told it would be okay, IF the other room had been vacated and cleaned out by the time I wanted to shift rooms. Seemed reasonable, so I went ahead and had a shower in the 'substitute' room, but having noticed how loudly I could hear the trains thundering past 13 floors below (!!!!!!!!) I was determined to be moved to the other side, where my original allotted room was. Before I headed to reception, I checked on the room that had been pointed out to me as 'the one marked for you' (I think it was 1310 but my memory is foggy now, given how little sleep I had in the end!) and saw that it was being cleaned. I left my keys at reception, told them I had left everything packed and ready to be moved, and that I would be very grateful if they could change my rooms especially as the noise from the trains would make sleep impossible in the substitute room. When I got back in the evening, though, I found that the staff at reception had changed - but my room had not!! Worse I was told that there was 'no question' of their giving me a different room since I had used another room, and so they would have had to pay for it to be cleaned twice!! Needless to add, even the substitute room that I had used had not been cleaned, the towels not replaced, the water not refilled... and of course, the trains still thundered past!! Next morning at breakfast, I met a gentleman who was also travelling for business and struck up conversation with me by asking what I thought about the trains crashing past every 15 mins! Clearly I wasn't the only one to have found it hard to fall asleep in this hotel! I suppose the hotel cannot help the location, nor the train schedule - but what they can do is perhaps improve the soundproofing of their rooms? And certainly they can change the behaviour of the staff at reception, because as a business traveller paying nearly $200 for a room I certainly expect to be treated with a little more respect, and yes, a clean set of towels at the very least!!", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiesbaden, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood short stay\u201d", "Author": "jo1970Singapore", "ReviewID": "UR67380374", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights for a work trip.

The check-in was hassle-free (and our room was actually ready when we arrrived two and a half hours before check-in time which was an unexpected bonus). The room was clean, obviously newly refurbished and the view was amazing even from the third floor. I quite liked the little window from the bathroom because I could see the kids in the bath while sitting on the bed, and you can just pull the blind down if you want privacy. The beds were very comfortable and we all had a great sleep. You could hear the rumble of the trains underneath the hotel but this didn't bother us at all. The proximity to North Sydney station is great, it meant our 3 year old didn't have to trudge around - so easy. We loved the location, we walked down to Luna Park and the area is great. The service was excellent and I can't imagine you could get better value in Sydney. We had breakfast in the morning and it was great. We did have to pay for parking ($15 per day) but the accommodation was such great value we didn't think this was unreasonable at all. So much nicer than being in the middle of the city. Overall, it exceeded our expectations and we will definitely stay again.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat view, clean and convenient to rail station\u201d", "Author": "MarkK4", "ReviewID": "UR55527659", "Content": "Stayed in Sydney for a week and must say that the view from this hotel was amazing!

The hotel is located on the other side of the harbour from the main Sydeny downtown (or CBD as they call it), but the metro is so easy to use and only 100 yards from the hotel that it was never an issue getting to and from CBD. It is 2 stops from the hotel to the CBD. The area itself is full of businesses and offices, so at the weekend it is dead, but during the week it is buzzing. There is an ALDI nearby if you need cheap supplies. Also a few nice restaurants around the corner (5 to 10 mins stroll). Personally we loved the Blue Lavendar - lovely food and nice staff. The hotel had really friendly staff, to whom nothing was too much effort. Even of the 11th florr you can hear the rumble of the trains, but I don't think they are too disturbing and I am a really light sleeper. The room was spacious and clean and as for the bathroom design - yes it is quirky, but when you pulled the blind you couldn't see into it - not sure what more privacy a couple would need from each other.

I wasn't disappointed at all. In fact, I am so happy with my stay here that I will come back again. The view was amazing. We were on the 9th floor and every morning, you wake up with the harbour bridge right in front of you. Not surprisingly, we kept our blinds open till very late at night 'cos we just can't get enough of the view. The room is standard hotel room size but they went through a multi million dollar refurb in 2008 so the room is very modern and nice. The hotel exterior and lifts still look a little dated but inside of the room, fabulous. The staff were great too. Great service, very friendly, understanding and knew the area well.

Built above busy North Sydney rail station, it started out as a Travelodge, then was rebadged as a Centra business hotel, passed through some independent operators and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Harbour View, part of the fledgling View chain of properties in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Up front, let's be honest about its position. The hotel was built right above the train tracks on the busy northern metro line. That does make for some background noise and the occasional rumble but it's not overly intrusive. Now the positives. The hotel has been completely refurbished. It needed it. Prior to the total makeover, it was extremely tired and sad. The refurb has been an outstanding success. Tasteful, warm tones with a pleasing mix of timber, marble and modern finishes. When this hotel was constructed, the Australian hotel industry was going through its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmall is good\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 period. Guest rooms are on the small side. I recommend paying a little extra for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbayview\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rooms. There is one on either end of the hotel. They are larger and feature a king rather than queen bed. The additional space is worth it. Most rooms boast outstanding views of the prettiest harbour in the world. The hotel was designed in a U-shape which maximises exposure to Sydney Harbour, its famous bridge and a dynamic cityscape. In fact, the view kept the property going through its lean times. There are few like it from other Sydney hotels, even those that cheekily but not always accurately sell themselves as having harbour views. Room interiors are very pleasing, especially for guests who remember the depressing, basic, concrete box that used to greet them in years past. Use of timber and soft fabric highlights is both clever and welcoming. These earthy touches complement the funky chocolate carpet and red highlights in lamp shades, pillows and the bed cover. In our end-room, there was a writing desk, as well as a small dining table and several comfortable chairs. Quite generous, really. The bed was superb \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that rare combination of luxurious softness with the right amount of support. The bathrooms are small but elegant and functional. Almost all the kit is there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hair dryer, generous stocks of toiletries - and interestingly, toothpaste but no complimentary toothbrush. The mini-bar is adequate and not overpriced by in-room standards. We also sampled room service on two occasions. It was quick, the food reasonably priced and tasty. There is a good sized and friendly bar on the ground floor, along with a very pleasant all-day dining venue which serves quality food at upper-mid prices. Again, the view is terrific. On-site parking is limited and costs $15 per day, unless you can negotiate it in an all-inclusive rate. What was particularly pleasing during our stay was the consistently good service at this hotel. I think it comes from the Harbour View knowing exactly what it is: a non-pretentious 4-star hotel located in a Monday-to-Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsatellite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business district that relies on repeat business to survive. All of the staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from reception to bar to restaurant to room service to housekeeping \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were generously pleasant and helpful without overdoing it. The management team at the Harbour View are clearly doing something right because their people seem happy, confident and willing to put themselves out for their guests. Sadly, these are qualities that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly abundant in the Australian hospitality industry. So, it comes as a refreshing surprise. Overall, the Harbour View at North Sydney is a terrific short-stay business hotel that would double, very satisfactorily, for interstate and overseas visitors who are seeking out (a) a great view of fabulous Sydney Harbour, (b) better value than luxury CBD hotels can offer, and (c) an upmarket hotel in close proximity to the city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a 5 minute train ride away and there is a cab rank, right outside the hotel.

LOCATION: The hotel was close to his office, and to mine, so I was able to drop in and say hello to some fellow coworkers in my company too. The hotel is located above the North Sydney train station, two stops away from the Central Business District, and close to 3 ferry stops (Kirribilli, Milson's McMahon) so it was extremely easy to get around the city from this location. The hotel is also close to a taxi \"rank\" so transportation was no issue at all. It does get quiet in this area at night, but there are places to go like the Rag and Famish for pub food, and the Lavender Blue restaurant for incredible dinners (the latter is wonderful). Also, the Crow's Nest area was just a quick taxi ride away for additional food choices. There were many services in the area, like post, chemist, food market, take-away, and retail shopping. ACCOMMODATIONS: The hotel itself was fine - even under construction. I rate it \"above average\" because the management and staff were so helpful, friendly, warm, and empowered. Our room was one of the upgraded ones, our views were lovely any time of day or night, even in wintry weather. We felt the train rumble by occasionally, and coming from California, we initially thought \"earthquake!\" but soon it became unnoticeable.

We ordered room service several nights - 24-hour service was great since our internal clocks weren't always on local time. STAFF: All of the hotel staff was friendly and helpful, even the construction workers, but the person who made our stay most memorable and enjoyable was Johnny, who worked in food and beverage. His warmth and attentiveness made us feel like VIPs our entire stay. Thanks, Johnny, for all of your help and service!

I spent some time getting excellent city night photos from the lift lobby in the hotel. Only thing you can't see is the Opera House thanks to the Samsung building being in the way. However, once you're over the view and it comes to living in your room, things start to deteriorate. My first impression was an 80's looking card reader system on the door, which didn't always work. Once I got the door open, it hit the doorstop before it was open even 90 degrees. This was due to the entrance way being quite narrow. So not a great start. Once in the room, it was adequately and attractively furnished - the bed and bedhead in particular were quite nice, although it was a double bed (as was advertised) not a queen which would be normal for a room of this status. I guess the biggest problem is that the space available for each room is pretty small, so they've had to do the best they can with limited space. Therefore, double bed rather than queen. Bathroom has a standing area of about 1m x 1m, plus toilet space and shower/bath, which is OK for one person, but two would be getting a bit cosy. The entrance way would be less than 1m wide due to the hanging space being there, presumably to allow more space in the main part of the room, which is fair enough. Room was clean and neat and had all the facilities one would expect, but with a few rough edges here and there. The desktop and vanity unit had the look of marble, but in fact were just plastic, though done quite well. The A/C control system looks 70's - 80's; the temperature dial (yes, dial) seems to be in Fahrenheit, though the system still works OK. There were a few other little issues; staff were quick to do the best they could to rectify but the fact they happened took the shine off a little: * One of the chairs had a screw which came through the cushion and gave me quite a surprise - was replaced quickly by maintenance * A night shirt went missing without a trace when the sheets were changed one day - was compensated for With respect to the A/C system mentioned by another reviewer, apparently their system is a bit old (my comments would agree), and when the system is switched from heating to cooling or back the other way, there's about a week when it doesn't work too well. However when I was there I had no problems at all. Restaurant menu was very good, staff were friendly. All in all, I think they do the best they can to provide good service and a good experience but are limited by physical space. Therefore the cost is less than that of other hotels in the area. If you love a good view and can put up with a few rough edges for the sake of saving yourself a few dollars, you'll have a generally satisfying stay, as did I.", "Date": "November 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copacabana", "Title": "\u201cWeekend from hell \u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3927239", "Content": "We had the weekend from hell at the Harbour View Hotel.
