Every staff member I encountered was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Check in was speedy and efficient and we were greeted very warmly. Room service was delicious and very fairly priced and all our needs were met with staff members going above and beyond in all areas. At one point we called downstairs to ask for forks for a late night meal we had brought in with us - just moments later a hotel employee showed up with our forks and, anticipating what other needs we might have, had brought warmed plates in case we needed them. We had not even thought to ask and, as it turned out, we did need them! The room itself was neat, clean, very new looking, with elegant furnishings and the beds were soooo comfortable! Tons of pillows and plush bedding. The halls were nice and quiet. The hotel is in a great spot and the on-site parking is very convenient.

Hotel Deca is really convenient for touring the UW -- tours begin at Schmizt Hall which is literally a few blocks from the hotel. Instead of searching for parking at the campus, the front desk allowed us leave our car in the Hotel Deca parking lot even though we had checked out of the hotel. I opted to upgrade our room to the city view, 2 queen room since we were going to be in Seattle a few days and I wanted a larger space to hang out with our teenage son. The room was very spacious and included a sofa and sitting area with a desk. At the time of our booking, there were specials on the website which basically included free parking and one free breakfast for the regular price of our room. I thought it was such a good deal! I gave my husband, who likes a big breakfast and gets up early, the breakfast voucher and my son and I bought some groceries at Trader Joes which was close by. The room had a nice size refrigerator and microwave oven which was an added convenience. While I was checking out of the hotel, I struck up a conversation with one of the front desk clerks named Jimmy. He was very personable and he gave me directions, lunch recommendations and a lot of information about UW. He was very excited that my son is interested in attending UW, especially since he would be coming from Los Angeles. Jimmy stored our luggage while we toured UW and when we returned to the hotel to pick up our luggage, Jimmy had a gift for me and my husband. He had gone to the UW bookstore and purchased two mugs, \"UW Mom\" and \"UW Dad!\" That was the most thoughtful thing any hotel staff member has ever done for me!!! I really hope that my son goes to UW so that I can return frequently to the lovely Hotel Deca with the nice, welcoming staff. Thank you, Jimmy, for your sweet gesture!", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cClass Act All The Way\u201d", "Author": "CreativeSpark", "ReviewID": "UR126825189", "Content": "If you've seen the photos of this hotel, it's exactly that.

The windows opened, which I always think is nice, and tea and pods for the coffee maker got replaced every day. The only thing we were missing was a fridge. The great thing about staying here is that it's a block from University Ave, where you'll find lots of indi cafes, restaurants ranging from vegan pizza to spicy ramen and an eclectic mix of stores (vintage clothing, books, sports etc) catering to the university population. Lots of cheap eats and great coffee. It's also a short walk to an arthouse cinema, a mainstream cinema and a massive art supply shop.

Our first choice, the Silver Cloud Inn-University District, was fully booked. The place is nicely decorated, and the beds are comfortable. However, amenities like a fridge and a coffee maker (standard even in budget hotels) are lacking here. During our stay, this facility demonstrated a number of peculiar (and irritating) inconsistencies. An iron and ironing board were provided, for instance, in a large closet, but it had no light. So it was necessary to grope to find it or to hang or retrieve clothes. Further, that was the ONLY place to store clothing because there were no dressers. Although they offer WiFi, and it was easy to access, there was only one chair at a glass table filling in for a desk. Unfortunately, a mouse doesn't function on such surfaces. The bathroom had lovely deco fixtures and hardware, but the stopper in the basin didn't work. A narrow, sloping shelf with a gap behind it couldn't accommodate toiletries for two (or one, for that matter, because they kept slipping off). Re: the rest of the hotel: the restaurant had a very limited menu with nothing we could eat (we're vegan). Consequently, we had to trek several blocks to find breakfast. And, while there are plenty of good restaurants in the area, it's nice not to have to search for one first thing in morning. (Again, a small refrigerator and microwave would have allowed us to eat in the room.) Style definitely trumps substance at the Deca. Important practical considerations have been ignored, and maintenance could also be improved.

The sound insulation between the rooms and the hallways is very poor. I would not suggest this for a family unless you prefer multiple rooms. Likewise, the rooms are a tight fit for a couple.

The beds were very comfortable and clean - what a great night's sleep! I also appreciated the detail of the complementary earplugs they provided \u2013 too bad I didn\u2019t need them. The bathroom was elegant. The tv was very cool. They provided a wine opener, hair dryer, and iron/ironing board. I'm so glad we had access to wi-fi in the room. The walk-in closet was a pleasant surprise. The view was FABULOUS! The staff was SO accommodating! I have never, ever had such a pleasant experience with hotel staff anywhere! Most special was the surprise gift basket that Tanya sent up to the room with a card wishing me luck on my interview at UW the following day, a box of chamomile tea (my favorite!!), a print out of interview tips, and some chocolate candies. They provide a complementary shuttle service anywhere within a 5 mile radius of the hotel. That service was excellent - very timely, clean, and with safe drivers. It was a pleasant surprise to have this service available, especially since it transported me to my interview in the rain - I don't know what I would've done if I had to walk! Also, I really enjoyed the fitness facility (the treadmill and tv were great; very clean; great to have water, towels, and clorox wipes) and wished I could've taken advantage of the passes to go to the outside gym, too...Next time! ;) I had an interview at UW until about 3:30pm and our flight wasn't until 10pm on the night of the day we checked out. Staff was so accommodating - they let us have a late check out, store our bags, access our bags when we accidentally forgot to unpack/pack something, and hang out in the lobby and have a light dinner while we waited for our (non-hotel) airport shuttle.

We made reservations for 4 (two adults, two children). We arrived in the late afternoon (so not too late, but not too early). We had a junior suite reserved which has a king bed and a pull out couch. The gentleman at the desk asked us if we wanted to have the pull out made up or if we could do it ourselves. We are easy going and said we could handle it. We went to our room. Changed and went to a wedding. We got back at about 11:30 at night. We went into the closet and found one pillow and a comforter. No sheets. Opening the bed we found the most lumpy, disgusting mattress. It was just plain gross. I went down and asked for sheets and something to cover the mattress. They sent it up promptly. We were only there for one night, so we didn't notice until the end, but there was only one wash cloth, two hand towels, and two bath towels. A couple other things - they give you ear plugs - something I've never seen in a hotel room. They must have known that we would be able to hear our neighbors - even their snoring. My guess is the walls are thin, not that we had particularly loud neighbors. On the plus side, they gave us free parking (we changed our reservations, so we were paying the maximum - not their fault - so I thought it was nice that he gave us the parking for free). They promptly resolved our problem as much as they could, but nothing could make up for that horrible mattress. The people who worked there were very nice. Three stars might be a bit harsh, but if you are traveling with children, I wanted you to know about the completely sub-standard bed.

The dead roses really should have been the signal to find accommodations elsewhere but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Bad decision..... Getting off the freeway, the hotel looms tall, old and tired (it was probably nice in the 80's). The lobby, though very dark, gives one hope that the rooms will be equally as decent. Not even close. This is a rundown facility in need of major renovation. A flat screen TV does not make the place modern and upgraded. The carpets in the hallway and room are filthy. The room and bathroom are small. There was interesting patchwork done to the wallpaper in the bathroom. The bathroom ceiling and windowsill have lovely peeling paint. The towels are one step above threadbare. The smell is odd throughout. Quite musty. On the pro side: the bed is comfortable and sheets are soft. Just don't look too closely at the cloth headboard...anyone who is a bit of a clean freak and has a vivid imagination may lose some sleep wondering about what the stains are. If you have any electronic devices, good luck charging them. It takes an enormous talent and creativity. There are two outlets (lower than knee level) on either side of the room. They are so old that the chargers constantly fall out. Try the outlet in the bathroom - it is slightly better. One would think that there might be an outlet near the desk - not the case here. They boast free wifi. Service and reliability are spotty. You get what you pay for, right? Skip the \"restaurant\" in the basement if your frat/sorority days are well behind you.

The hotel is also in very poor repair. The vending machine beside our room was so loud that it woke our kids up...but since nobody answered at the front desk, we just unplugged it ourselves.

At the end of all of this they announced they had no room for us. They said they would try to find an equivalent room in a nearby hotel, and came up with what was obviously a third-rate hotel (the room would cost about 1/3 their rate and include breakfast) which was a mile away from their desirable location, or anything else. When we pointed out that this fell far short of an equivalent room nearby they \"went back to the drawing board.\" After spending a total of just under two hours in their lobby I went to the counter and told the desk clerk to please get the manager as we were tired of waiting.

It is an older hotel which has been renovated in which they have tried to keep the \"boutique\" feel. The entrance, lobby and other common areas therefore are appealing because of interesting design or furniture elements. A drawback of this approach however is that a number of less attractive or convenient features were also kept. I stayed with colleagues on a business trip and we had a number of rooms in the hotel. The rooms were relatively small,somehat too small for some, and the bathrooms tiny. So you might want to check on the size of the room before you accept it. My room still kept it's old sink, which was cracked and chipped. The very thin shower curtain was insufficient and couldn't keep the whole bathroom from getting wet during showering. Views varied. Some were great with a view of Mt Rainier on a clear day. My room viewed the rather unappealing University of Washington district area. An absolutely big plus for this hotel is the very friendly and attentive staff. Check-in and check-out were very efficient. The manager was very present and attended to our needs. The free internet worked well. The restaurant was again fairly small and the breakfast below average. Don't even try the 'fresh'OJ. However, this was made up by the great Tully's Coffee store which can be directly accessed from the hotel.

DVD player in the room was nice as was iPod dock, however, I had no microwave or fridge which would've been convenient. If you miss \"record\" stores go across the street to a great little basement dive of a music store to browse like pre-iTunes days. Also, there's a bunch of little restaurants nearby and a Trader Joe's grocery store a few blocks away (cut through the adjoining parking lots and it's really close). I wouldn't say that this is the fanciest neighborhood but I never felt afraid or uncomfortable. The hotel does have a security staff that patrols at night. Plus, there's a free shuttle that will take you within 4 miles of the property. This is great because downtown Seattle driving and parking is a nightmare. It'll get you to Pike Place market and downtown shopping plus to the UW campus (which is gorgeous btw).

I actually like the layout better as the the room is for sleeping and not for storage when on a trip which for travelers knows exactly what I am referring to ~ limited room storage and leaving clothes/luggages on the floors. Hotel DECA may not be the top hotel chain with the limited facilities (e.g., pool), but the location has easy access to everywhere. The Hotel Complementary Shuttle ~ within 4 miles radius can get you to most of the tourist places ~ including the Northgate Mall or Downtown ~ job well done! Only wished it was complimentary parking or included in the hotel price. However, once I parked, the hotel shuttle took me everywhere I needed to be ~ as suggested or as the staff recommended I drive and enjoy the best of Seattle has to offer ~ scenic view. I had my roof off my Jeep Wrangler and with clear sky ~ what better way to see Seattle! The best part... the staff were all amazingly helpful since this was my first time to Seattle. They printed me maps even with other guest standing behind me which they immediately call someone in the back or one of the Shuttle drivers to assist me while they helped the other people in the line-up...that's service! You see ~ lots of time I feel annoyed when the hotel reps don't care to help but needs to which you can see it on their faces while the people in the line up gets annoyed.

I tend to search out boutique hotels wherever I go. Funky can be very nice. There is a lot to like about the the place. The decor was whimsical and fun. The bed was comfortable with plush bedding and clean crisp sheets. The bathroom was very cute with a true art deco throwback theme. The staff were super helpful and polite. The view was superb. The location awesome. But there was a gaping fault: cutting corners in maintenance that gave the place a \"cheapness factor.\" Under the exterior window in my room was significant water damage. I don't know if the window had been left open during a previous rainstorm (or a few storms) because the wall underneath it was disintegrating. The drywall was crumbling and I could see deep into the wall. It really looked bad. I could say it started to spoil the stunning view out the window. It wasn't a small spot that could be overlooked. The damage covered several feet, the whole wall sagged and there was damage to the window sill as well. I can't imagine this had just happened (it wasn't wet) or that the management didn't know about it. This sort of dilapidation is something you find in a roach motel not a 3.5 star $150 dollar room. The thing that was most incongruous was the fact other parts of the room were very nice and well maintained. Why the blinders to this gaping fault? Was it cheapness? Some other things that might drive customers away. The upholstered furniture in the common areas of the lobby should be shampooed more often because there were darkish dirt spots on the top of chairs where people's hands often touched (you know... those pink squarish chairs in the lobby photos). Again... gives an impression of cheapness and isn't that tough to make right! Exterior paint on older wood-framed windows of basement bar was rotten and looked bad... Repeat... cheapness factor. (To give the hotel credit on this one... they mentioned on the website that there is a future 5 million dollar exterior renovation scheduled!) Having said all this, I would like to emphasize that with a little attention to detail this hotel was just inches from being an EXCELLENT experience.

Seriously - the staff DOES call us by name. Yes, we've stayed far too many nights in Seattle in the last year (medical issues) - but we are always pleasantly surrpised to be treated like old friends when we check in again and again. Our first stay in this hotel was with a Hotwire purchase -- but since then they've always matched those rates for us without question (unless it was a peak day and they anticipated being 100% full). This is an old hotel that has been restored. It's LOVELY Art-Deco style -- so well done, with such fine pieces of art and functional furnishings! The theme is carried through all the rooms, as well. We just enjoy walking around, enjoying the ambiance. It's quiet and clean and leisurely. * The adjoining coffee shop is great. * There's a couple of computers available for use (free), and they'll print anything you need through the network at the front desk. * Free shuttle to nearby places -- hospitals, shopping centers, restaurants, doctors, etc. Book ahead to be guaranteed you'll be there on time -- shuttle is busy and punctual. * The beds are awesome! * Sometimes we had free parking vouchers -- sometimes we had to pay for parking -- never could figure out why it was not always the same. * Close to University of WA hospitals and medical centers, and coliseum * Wonderful little restaurants everywhere -- reasonable and great food easily available. Our only problem ever experienced in all our stays was the heat in the winter. All the rooms face an outside wall (extraordinary views from every room ) - and it can be cold and windy in Seattle. The thermostats are poorly located in the room -- the heat vents runs inside the wall behind the thermostats, so when the heat blows, the thermostat picks up that warmth and shuts off. Arghh! Maintainence did their best by adding insulation behind the thermostat - but we found the only way we could resolve the problem on several below-freezing windy nights was to unscrew the thermostat from the wall and leave it dangling where it didn't pick up the duct heat. Worked perfectly then! They need to relocate all the thermostats. Maybe they've resolved the problem by now -- this was a year ago. Our daughter had some complex surgeries, and they were very accommodating while she was covered with bandages and greasy ointments, providing extra towels and linens. We could see that their hearts went out to her -- all the staff was so kind to her.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington", "Title": "\u201cI'd stay anywhere with this kind of service!\u201d", "Author": "Dustinb", "ReviewID": "UR87813535", "Content": "I was so impressed by the staff and ease of staying at this hotel I could care less if I could sometimes hear a shower in the next room (per other reviews).

Previous to our stay we asked to speak to someone about catering a rehearsal dinner didn't hear back from anybody until the day before the wedding. Several of our guests did not get the discounted room that we had blocked out specifically for our guests. Actually several of our guests when making reservations contacted us because they were told that they had no records of our wedding and the the arrangements we had already made. We stayed in the penthouse which is beautiful but garbage from the previous guests was still in the room we called the front desk 3 times to have the garbage removed but they never did it. None of our guests were able to come to our room because their elevator key wouldn't work for the 16th floor. In some circumstances that would be nice but when you have numerous people from all parts of the country staying in the same hotel it would be nice if they could come to your room. The kicker of disappointment came after our wedding, we were opening a bottle of wine, it slipped and fell onto the glass counter top of the bar. You would think the bottle would break well it didn't the countertop did. My new wife cut herself on the broken glass and we called the front desk to tell them about it and they acted very non-chalant \"Oh we will have our engineer look at it when he's in.\" OK, having broken glass all over your room is ordinary and not having anybody come look at it or even come and clean it up is that customary hotel service. Anyways nobody came to look at it, we checked out and 2 days later I notice that they had taken $1500 out of my acct for the damage without approval, without an invoice and without even contacting me. I had a great wedding and Hotel Deca is well decorated, but the people who manage that place do not know how to communicate or make guests feel very welcome. We made that hotel a lot of money by staying there and inviting all our guests to stay there, but they did nothing for us, I mean they didn't even clean the penthouse properly and they basically stole money out of my pocket.

If my budget would have allowed it, I would have done something closer to the heart of Downtown Seattle, but the Hotel Deca was a good compromise. It was about a 10 minute drive (or $18 taxi fare, but I'll get to that later) to downtown Seattle. Now I'm not normally a fan of \"modern\" decor, but the Hotel Deca pulls it off. Their property is clean and comfortable with some rooms that offer good views of the Seattle Skyline. Our room was a corner studio with a flat screen TV, but oddly, no microwave or refrigerator. Free Wi-Fi is also available, but very weak in the location I was in. They also offer a complimentary shuttle which we decided to use the second day we were there. We had them drop us off at Pikes Place Market at 9am and the driver said, \"Be sure to give us a call by 10pm if you would like a ride back\". We spent the rest of the day enjoying Seattle, and even stumbling on a great little blues bar (Hwy 99 Blues). At around 9:52pm, I called the hotel for the shuttle back, but was denied simply with \"I don't think we can do that for you\" (verbatim). When I asked why, their response was, \"Well it's getting close to 10pm\" (once again, verbatim). We went back and forth with this, with both of us highlighting the fact that it WASN'T EVEN 10pm YET! The strange part about it was the fact that at no time did they ever give me a reason that they wouldn't pick me up.. just an almost robotic \"I just don't think we can do that for you\". The conversation ended with them telling me to get a cab. Without any other options, my wife and I got a cab back to the hotel, an $18 fare that I didn't have cash for. I almost asked the desk to reimburse me, but I didn't want to push the issue with someone who obviously didn't care.

You get shampoo and conditioner and bar soap for showering, but no lotion. We had to ask for lotion, of which they had but apparently don't put it in the bathroom. There is a coffee pot and coffe, but no mini fridge or microwave! The walls are paper thin and you can hear others next to you showering and such. this hotel is NOT worth the money and I will NEVER stay here again!

We were dropping our daughter off to UW, so the location was perfect. It was within walking distance to everything related to the university. For the price we paid, it was very comparable to other like hotels. The price also included free parking and a continental breakfast. The breakfast was mainly breads, cereals, some fruits, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, juices, coffee, etc. Just the basics, but presented in a very nice room that had both small tables and sofa areas. Attached to the lobby is a Tullys coffee shop. In the lobby are two computers that you can use to get on the internet for free. You can print five pages for free and additional pages for fifteen cents each. They were a bit slow, but, hey... it was free. Overall, the service was very very good. The front desk workers were all nice and competent. Even the people in Tullys were very good. When we arrived, our toilet was clogged. They immediately sent up someone with a plunger. He fixed the problem quickly, but left the floor totally wet. We had to call him back to dry it. Our room was very tiny with a queen bed. The bathroom was tiny, also, but clean. Because the room is so small, the bed is pushed up against one wall. Some people don't like to sleep up against a wall. The climate control seemed fine, but better yet, there were two small windows that you could open for fresh air. The only real complaint that we had was the low quality linens. The sheets were thin and felt like a blend. If you like the luxury of nice cotton sheets and towels, then these won't do. The thin blanket seemed rather cheap, too. At least the mattress was comfortable. It looked as if either the management or, at least, the name of the hotel is about to change soon. Hopefully, they improve the linens at that time, too.", "Date": "September 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel but noisy A/C was a problem\u201d", "Author": "zwilliams", "ReviewID": "UR5791513", "Content": "This hotel has a very cool art deco feel.

We're in our 20s and we like the university district. The hotel looks plain from the outside but once you step inside, you'll pleasantly discover a stylish lobby and lounge. The staff was extremely friendly and there is free internet access for guests in the lobby and your first 5 printouts are free. There is also a Tully's coffee right next to the reception area. There is a sizeable parking lot for guests and parking is complimentary. We paid $179US for a Deluxe guestroom and after seeing it, we decided we wanted to pay for an upgrade on their Premier Floor (these are the best rooms with the soaker tubs, all other rooms don't have them). There was nothing wrong with our original room but we decided we wanted something more spacious. They initially told us there was a room available but when they realized it was booked, they gave us a free upgrade to a Premium guestroom (a step down from the best). The new room was spacious, had a lounge chair and a larger bathroom. Loved it! The staff felt bad and even gave us a complimentary movie. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. Unfortunately, there isn't counter space for your toiletries but a narrow shelf above the sink. The main door had an air vent that let a lot of noise in and our room was right across the elevator. I was awoken by people coming out of their rooms who were talking somewhat loudly while waiting for their elevator. Try to get a room away from the elevator! Aside from that, everything else was great. If you're into vegetarian/vegan food, there is an awesome cafe down the street called Chaco Canyon Cafe. The mocha smoothie is a must and the pesto sandwich is to die for! There is a Starbucks and Walgreens a block away, a movie theatre, great little cafes, a great Thai restaurant called Araya (closed Sundays) a few blocks down.

The decor reminded me a lot of what you would find in a Kimpton Hotel and had a boutique feel. Unfortunately the location is not all that great if you do not have a car with you and want to be in downtown Seattle; although the drive is only about 5 minutes. There is however a bus stop a block away you can take downtown. Also another great thing about the University Hotel is that they have a binder filled with take-out menus, from which you can order from local eateries and have it delivered to your room to satisfy whatever cuisine you crave. I would definitely recommend the University Hotel for the great rate I got, which I think is a lot nicer than a hotel you would get at $129/night in downtown Seattle.
