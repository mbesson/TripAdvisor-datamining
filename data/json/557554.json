{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very Welcoming We stayed 2 nights at the Sumisho Hotel and found it a very friendly place. The level of English at the Hotel was quite sufficient for our requirements. They staff made every effort to understand and accomodate us. We opted for the Japanese Style accommodation, just for the experience. This entailed rolling out your Futon mattress each night - this can be somewhat hard on the hips unless you have ample padding. The rates were quite reasonable. We didn't get to use their Japanese Baths, nor did we use the restaurant, so can't comment on these aspects. Getting there from Tokyo Airport was not as difficult as I had imagined. We caught a Limousine Coach to the Tokyo City Air Terminal (TCAT) and a Taxi from there. We had a very enjoyable stay and would recommend it.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR614373574", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "okbyme"}, {"Content": "Good base to visit Tokyo The room was clean, but we made the mistake to take the smallest western style room (12,9 m2 - seemed to be measured including bath ;-)). As there was no cupboard, there was no space at all to store our stuff, but we had a look into the bigger rooms and they were very nice. Fridge in the room.Internet was for free (but you need to stand whilest surfing). Unfortunately we didn' t use the tub as we were too tired because of our sightseeing program. The staff was very friendly. All main metros are close (about 5 minutes away) and many small supermarkets are around the corner. Only restaurants are not that many in this area.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR447868730", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KatscheNL"}, {"Content": "A great Tokyo Experience       The street of the hotel", "Date": "Jan 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR938006348", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PearlSydney"}, {"Content": "Sumisho is a very Japanese experience Sumisho Hotel is very conveniently located and the room rates are very reasonable. We stayed in a Japanese style room, which I think is more spacious than their western style rooms, but it does entail sleeping on a futon. Sumisho offers traditional Japanese baths, which are a wonderful way to wind down after a busy day. The staff is friendly and helpful. Their English is limited, but communication is possible with a bit of effort. We stayed for five nights and were totally pleased. If you are looking for a spacious western style hotel room you might feel cramped, but if you are looking for a more Japanese experience this hotel is a find.", "Date": "Aug 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR750648708", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "DKB-LA"}, {"Content": "Real hospitality at the Sumisho Hotel I'm from The Netherlands and I stayed 4 days at the Sumisho hotel end of March and although it was a very small hotel with tiny rooms, it still has all the necessary basics including very friendly and helpful staff. Only a few of the receptionists spoke sufficient English but the hotel is aimed at the local and business guests so you can't expact too much. But with some hand- and food work so to say, everything can be arranged. Sumisho hotel is tidy and clean, there's a washing machine and drying machine available in which you have to throw coins in it and although the manuel is in Japanese, with some logic thinking you'll easily figure out how the machines will work. (if the staff haven't helped you already that is)On one cold night, my best friend and I were waiting in the open corridor where the washing machine was situated and a cook walked past us a few times, greeted us and came back to offer us with something that resembles an egg custard dessert. Judging to the freshness of the delicacy, we think he'd just made it and this is a small gesture that made a big impact on us. This was just one of the many positive examples we had on our 4 nights stay at the Sumisho hotel. They also have seperated bathrooms for men and women if you want to experience an authentic Japanese bath but I haven't tried it myself as we only came back late at night and too tired for this. Furthermore, close to the hotel is a subway station and witin a few minutes you're at Tokyo Central station and in the district of the hotel are also some nice small restaurants and a covenient store. (7eleven) So, despite the really tiny rooms and small reception area I certainly would go back there if only for the friendly staff.", "Date": "Dec 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR572813488", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Nieda"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d557554-r21121267-Sumisho_Hotel-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "557554", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
