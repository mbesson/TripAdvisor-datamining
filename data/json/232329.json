The price was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac125 which is expensive but among the cheapest acceptable alternatives in Amsterdam during the high season. The hotel is situated in a quiet area in the inner city about 10 minutes by foot from the Dam Square. The hotel is close to the tram stop Elandsgracht where trams 7,10 and 17 stop. The hotel has a laid back atmosphere with a cat sleeping in the corridors. There was absolutely no smell of anybody smoking any dodgy cigarettes which is very nice if that's not your thing. The room was big enough with a double and a single bed. However the door to the bathroom didn't open completely as the bed stood to close to it. The bathroom itself was quite small and had a shower. The rooms was very clean and had a TV-set but no remote control. The breakfast was nice with cold meats, cereals, two different sorts of bread, cheese, jam and sponge cake. The breakfast staff was OK however they started to remove the various breakfast items a couple of minutes to 10 even though the breakfast was supposed to end at 10 which made you feel uncomfortable, stressed and unwanted there. The reception staff was indifferent. All in all a satisfactory yet overpriced alternative.", "Date": "September 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "AussieSimon", "ReviewID": "UR5526785", "Content": "The hotel was generally quite good and is located on a quiet street. The room was spacious and clean, and the bathroom was good. It was very hot (middle of a heatwave) but the staff were very helpful and actually purchased a fan for us! The breakfast was very good compared to other 3-star hotel breakfasts. Perhaps the only drawback is its distance from the city centre - it is about a 20 minute walk from Amsterdam Central Station, although the walk goes through some very nice streets including the antiques shops. It is, however, possible to take the tram.", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cGood Choice\u201d", "Author": "Melbsteve", "ReviewID": "UR5225495", "Content": "This was my second stay at this hotel and I was not dissapointed.The hotel is well located and is only 5mins walk from my favourite square in Amsterdam, Leidesplein, which is full of open air cafes, restaurants and within walking distance of the museums and boat cruise stations.

The hotel is in a nice and quiet side street facing the canal in the antique quarter so is surrounded by small antique shops and a couple of quiet bars, the staff are very friendly and helpful, the rooms neat and tidy with ensuite facilities and the buffet breakfast excellant with the usual mix of boiled eggs, meats, pastries and toasts.
