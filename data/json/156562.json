The views and location make it a solid 4 for sure! Pros: -Location! So close to the beach and Stanley Park and countless amazing restaurants. -Super comfortable beds! -Spacious suite (we had a 2 bedroom on 32nd floor). It even had 1.5 bathrooms! -Amazing views from 2 balconies! Ocean, Stanley Park, and Lion's Gate Bridge views.....beautiful day or night. -Full kitchen in our suite -Free Wireless Cons: -Outdated decor throughout mixed with a few newer pieces. Bathrooms and kitchen were super dated! -Kitchen not properly equipped. Bare minimum of dishes, etc. Tiny coffee pot. Old, loud dishwasher and an old microwave (took more than 3 minutes for popcorn and burnt bag before popping all the kernals!) -No pool towels. Had to bring towels from the room. Room had just 4 bathtowels in it. -Parking $25/day (though this is not uncommon in the area). -Tiny TV in the massive livingroom. -Small dining table with only 2 chairs. Seemed a bit strange for a large 2 bdrm suite with a full kitchen. -Basic and minimal single use toiletry items. Large refillable bottles of lotion and bath gel in both bathrooms might be good from a enviromnental point of view, but from a safety and cleanliness point of view, not good at all. Overall, the views and location probably outweigh the list of cons, but if you are fairly picky and like updated rooms, you may be a little disappointed.

First off I want to mention that this was a Priceline reservation and prior to the reservation I went in and requested a Upper Floor room. Of course the people in reservation were quick to advise me that with this type of reservation nothing is guarranteed. Of course with me being a frequent priceline/hotwire user this did not phase me. We arrived at the hotel around 4:00 p.m. Pulled into the parking garage, no parking attendant on duty with a sign that says \"will return in 15 minutes\". Well what to do? Well we went ahead and went on in and checked in. Everything was fine with the parking, just remember to bring your license plate number to the front desk. Checkin process was smooth, except he proceeded to tell us that the highest floor we can obtain with a priceline reservation was the 10th floor. Wasn't to thrilled about that considering there are about 34 floors of rooms in this hotel. But, the 10th floor was acceptable. Of course, he was willing to upgrade us for $20. a night to a higher floor. No special occassion for this trip so \"no thanks\". But at the very end of the process he said he will put us on the 17th floor. \"Score!\" It pays to be nice. Parking: $25.00 per night. Ouch!!! (Never understood why hotels charge for parking for their guests, but we all know the word \"GREED\" don't we). HINT: If you self park your car on the otherside of the hotel off of Nelson Street and use the automated machines it is only $20.00 a night and it is still the hotel parking garage. I mentioned this to the front desk and they had no idea about it. Go Figure. Pets: $25.00 per night which is about standard to Vancouver hotels. However, this hotel is the best for pets as it is only a few blocks from the park. HINT: There is a offleash dog park South on Comox street about 8 blocks. Elevators: We had no problem with the elevators except when we checked out. Took us forever to get an elevator down as everyone was leaving at the same time. Otherwise, I felt they were acceptable. Room: I thought our room was very clean and the view nice. They now have LCD TV's in the rooms which I don't remember them ever having before. We had a full kitchen which was nice. One of the floor lamps was very wabble and all I had to do was re-tighten it up. Not sure why housekeeping had never done that. Bathroom was pink and clean. How cool is that!!! Overlall even though furniture and fixtures were a little outdated, I was happy with my room. It was very quiet at night. It was even missing a can opener and the promptly brought one to our room. Pool/Gym: They have free access to the gym next door, they won't tell you this when you have a priceline reservation, but I have stayed there before and the gym is nice. The pool and jacuizzi area was nice and the jacuizzi was hot and the locker room with sauna was clean. Check out: Automated check out from the television which I always like. Well that pretty much sums it up. Overall I was happy with this trip. I don't think I would care to pay full price for this hotel especially in the summer months, but for a priceline/hotwire reservation it is very nice.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting!\u201d", "Author": "HollsZ", "ReviewID": "UR121327681", "Content": "My room was not clean.

We checked in about 2 hours early, and were given a room right away, which was in a fairly quiet corner on the 17th floor. For a standard/basic room, it had a great view of the mountains, highrises and a sliver of English Bay. My first impression of the staff was great. The bell staff are extremely amiable and friendly. They helped us with finding a taxi and directing us to a few tour stops we did on the trip. The front desk clerks were very kind and helpful during the entire trip. I was a bit apprehensive at first to stay at this hotel, after reading that this is a converted residential apartment block built in the late 1960's or early 1970's and converted into a mixed-use commercial hotel. The beds were brand new and very comfortable. The duvets and bedding were also brand new. However, the 1980's Dynasty crystal lamps and chintzy curtains didn't compliment the great bedding. The bathroom is another story. You kind of walk three decades into the past as you walk toward the bathroom. The bedding and television (flatscreen) seem to be from this actual decade, the furniture and curtains are from the 1980's, and the fridge seems to be from the 1970's. The bathroom is very outdated. Hopefully, they are doing remodeling and upgrades in phases, starting with the bedding and television sets. The tub is one of those old ceramic larger tubs from the 1960's, and the toilet is purple. The wallpaper seems to have been changed in the 1980's. A classic Honeywell thermostat sits on the wall, and mirrors our outdated one from our 1950's home. Even with the ecclectic hodgepodge of furnishings and styles, the room was fairly quiet and comfortable (even with a large convention taking place in the hotel during our stay). The swimming pool was in the basement, and it was very large and clean. One problem is the very cramped and slow elevators. We waited for an elevator for 7 minutes before giving up and sojurning up the stairs. And when you do get an elevator, it barely will accommodate 5 people comfortably. Try that with lots of luggage. All in all, the hotel does need some more work, but I think they are heading in the right direction. This location can boast a convenient trek to Stanley Park and Robson Street, as well as a short journey to a built in mall downstairs in case you forgot to pack that must-needed amenity, such as a portable umbrella, to weather a rainy November Vancouver day.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery Disappointing for a Coast\u201d", "Author": "Fate_tw", "ReviewID": "UR120173094", "Content": "Where to begin...this is an old building, and it shows.

For me, the important features of accommodations are that I am greeted with a warm and efficient attitude. Staff should be trained to always remember who pays their wages. As far as the accommodations are concerned, I have stayed in many hotels in various countries, from Europe to Asia and here at home and my main expectations are that the room is CLEAN. Otherwise I am not demanding since I mainly stay in budget hotels. Now, to my review of the Coast Plaza Hotel; I attended a conference for two days, Sept 30 / Oct.01 with my wife. The booking was pre arranged. We arrived at approximately 4p.m. and were greeted by Shannon at the desk. I asked her if it was possible to get a view room and although the hotel was apparently booked quite full, she could give us a choice of a room with a king bed on the 7th floor or a room with two double beds on the 19th floor which we chose. You see, it's all about service. Thank you Shannon. Both my wife and I were happy with the accommodations. The room was a good size, approximately 18 ft. square not including the hallway or bathroom. The fact that it had a rather long hallway made the room seem larger since you did not walk into the room directly. There were three closets; one in the bathroom, one in the hallway and one in the room proper. (never seen that before!) As mentioned in many reviews, the furniture was dated, but I don't stay in the room for the furniture. It was perfectly o.k. and in good condition. As I mentioned above, I look for cleanliness and this room was that. The bathroom was interesting in that it had a fore room with a sink vanity and another sink vanity in the bathroom proper which makes it convenient for two persons using two sinks at the same time. The bathroom was clean and had all the required amenities including plenty of towels. The room had a refrigerator and a coffee maker, a flat screen t.v. which was a little far from the bed due to the size of the room but no big issue. There is a portable air con, and, although we did not use it because of the time of year, I did turn it on momentarily to test for noise. It was acceptable in my opinion. Both my wife and I agree the bed was great; like sleeping on a cloud (if that were possible) and of course, clean linen. There is a beautiful view from the balcony partially facing English Bay and The North Shore. The hotel is situated in a very convenient and pleasant location of the west end with many shops and restaurants on Denman and Davie Streets. We walked along English Bay to the little ferry boat which we took to Granville Island. There, we roamed around the overpriced shops and listened to some wonderful pan floutist from Peru in the square. Wonderful and memorable. A buffet breakfast was provided in the conference room on the upper floor (The Horizon Room) which was tasty, consisting of scrambled eggs, hash brown potatoes, sausage, bacon, fresh fruit, fruit juices, coffee, tea and buns. For our coffee breaks we were provided with Nanaimo bars, brownies, cookies and more fresh fruit with coffee and tea, altogether, very good. Did I have any negatives? Yes, I will mention a few issues that I saw. A couple of resin chairs on the balcony would have been nice. I did not want to take the inside wooden chairs onto the balcony due to possible damage from weather. A microwave would have been nice, and also an iron and ironing board. Perhaps you can get an iron if you ask at the desk. I did not try, so I don't know. Another thing, I did not see any robes in the closets, since the hotel has a pool, it would make sense to provide robes so that one can go to the pool via the elevator in a robe. Again, perhaps robes are available upon request, I did not ask. These are not complaints, only observations and suggestions. The only complaint I have is the cost of parking. $25.00 per day to park a car, in my opinion, is outrageous!!! Although my parking was paid for by the conference I would find it very difficult to stay in this hotel for this reason alone. You are pretty much held hostage to pay that if you book at this hotel and drive there from out of town. I think that guests should get a break with a lower parking rate since the rooms are already priced at a premium rate.

The TV would go fuzzy from time to time depending on where it was positioned between the bed and the living room. One of the more interesting features were the pink porcelain toilet and bathtub (again, looked like out of the early 90's). Food was great - especially the 30% off for all orders from hotel guests. As well, internet was free though could be very slow depending how many people were on at a time. Access to a full fitness club was a nice touch. The pool was okay, but located in the basement and had no natural light. The conference rooms were hot and stuffy most of the time. Also, this hotel attempted to charge me $70 when my travel plans changed and I needed to check out a day earlier. I was not aware of this and was also told by the staff the night before that this would not be an issue. Ultimately, the fee was waved. My stay was okay, but I expected more from the Coast name.

This high rise hotel has a distant and obstructed view of Vancouver's world famous park, but it is actually closer to English Bay and the cafe culture of Denman and Davie Streets. The hotel was built in 1969 as the Denman Street Inn, and includes a small shopping centre and cinema at the street level. In the past 42 years, it has changed hands and brands twice, and has been part of the reputable Coast chain for over twenty years. Large signs in the lobby proclaim its history and outline some multi-million dollar upgrades that are forthcoming (and, in many areas, badly needed). My wife and I arrived at the Coast at the four o'clock check-in time, but were informed that the room was not yet ready (fortunately, we were permitted to park in the underground parkade). We walked around the area, enjoyed the sunshine, ocean views, and crowds at English Bay, and returned at least twice to be informed that the room wasn't quite ready yet. When it finally was, we were given two drink vouchers to reward us for our patience. The room was on the twenty-sixth floor, overlooking the park, bay, and many high rise apartments and condos. Our first impression was not good: two double beds rather than the queen-size we were expecting. However, when we checked our (on-line) reservation details, it did in fact say \"Superior Room 2 doubles or 1 Queen\". Seeing as how we had waited so long to finally get our room, we chose to put up with it. The room itself was just okay--older carpet, spreads, etc., but clean and in good repair. A free-standing air conditioner was wedged inbetween the curtains and what turned out to be my bed. Considering the hotel was rather old, we assumed this was an afterthought, and at night, it was a toss up between the noise of the conditioner and the traffic noise (even on the 26th floor!) if we opened the patio doors. A large but empty-of-seats balcony was an unusual feature (although not a surprise as we had stayed at this hotel some years ago). The bathroom was a mixture of figure colors (dusty rose toilet) and styles, but functional. We didn't eat in the large, bright restuarant, but it looked fine, and the prices were reasonable. The pub (Comox Street Long Bar) was bright and roomy: we enjoyed great nachos and our free drinks as we watched our beloved football team (Edmonton Eskimos) on one of the many TVs. The English Bay area is a great place to enjoy the west end of downtown Vancouver: lots of interesting and diverse cafes, bars, shops, etc. The Coast, as the anchor hotel, is an okay place to stay, with friendly, accomodating staff, but hopefully, upgrades will actually happen.

First, the location cannot be beat, on the West side near the water and not far from Stanley Park. The front desk people are very nice and efficient, not the greatest, but very good. The parking garage in under the hotel and is a little pricy, mine was picked up by work, but factor in about $20 per day. Easy access to the hotel from the parking garage. The first level of the hotel is retail and includes a grocery store and a drug store. The grocery store is not very good and over priced, but nice to have access to. The rest of the retail is not very useful. Room is dated, older rugs (pulling up some at the seams) and air conditioning units are portable and only cools the living area. The bedroom has a fan, which worked fine but is strange for a hotel. All room have a small kitchen, which is nice to make some breakfast and a night time snack. Bathroom is nicely sized and clean, nothing special, just solid. Be careful to not get a room anywhere near the elevators if you get a middle floors room. They are very active and noisy at night and some of our work party had issues. I was on the 27th floor and although I noticed the sound, they rarely came up that high so I was not bothered. On the lobby level is two restaurants, one is a pub with a very limited eating menu and the other is a full service eatery that is, IMHO, overpriced for the food and service. Better off going into the neighborhood which has an endless supply of food and drink. Even a liquor store less than a block away. Overall, a solid hotel in a nice area of town.

The main area of the spacious room has a desk with two chairs, two sofa style chairs, a television that separates the jacuzzi area from the bed. The furniture and decor is older, but is classy and well-kept enough to not look out-dated. The king bed was very comfortable, with an assortment of pillows and night tables on each side. The closet is decent enough for hanging your wares on their wood hangers. The bathroom is a little small, but you'll be enjoying the jacuzzi anyway. The hotel provides standard toiletries (shampoo, shower gel, lotion) in larger pumps bottles for green practices, as well as smaller-sized service items for you to take with you. Breakfast was excellent. We ordered a Coast breakfast, as well as an Eggs Benedict (our voucher covered two Coast breakfasts but the only charge the additional $1 difference) plus coffee and OJ. It was excellent. The only downer was the morning we were leaving the maid knocked on our door well before check-out three separate times. It was a little annoying in the middle of breakfast, but we could have put out our privacy sign too. If she was wondering if we had already checked out, she should contact the front desk instead of bothering us so many times. But it probably an isolated incident, and wasn't a deterrent to the stay. We bought a Stay, Play and Gourmet package that included a $75 voucher for The Boathouse (excellent resto and walkable), free parking ($25/day normally), and free breakfasts ($30 value).

We wanted something near Stanley Park but not too far from the downtown core. Also, we got a good rate (less that $150 per night) at this place. The hotel is located in a residential area about 5 blocks from the entrance to Stanley Park. Its also about 4 blocks to English Bay (?) which has a beach and boardwalk. It is part of a larger complex with a movie theater, grocery store, and drug store on the ground floor. There are tons of restaurants and cafes right there.

It had 1 3/4 bathrooms, a living room, 2 bedrooms, 2 balconies, a full kitchen (stove/oven, microwave, dishes, dish washer, a full sized fridge), and a large living room. The couch in the living room pulled out into a bed. Drawbacks: We are pretty sure we heard the people above us using the bathroom. Icky! I thought $25 per night for parking was a little steep. We ordered breakfast from room service which wasn't too expensive, but wasn't very good. Even though everything else in the kitchen is full sized, the coffee pot was a little 4 cup'er. Also, the swimming pool is in the basement/parking garage. We didn't use it.

With recommendation from Reservations, we booked in a 1 bedroom suite with my Coast Rewards and were looking forward to staying at the hotel due to it having a separate bedroom with a king sized bed. Our 4 year old daughter sleeps with us while we travel and it's nice if we can have a separate bedroom after she's gone to bed. To sum up: We will never stay at this hotel again and will book at the Coast Tsawwassen Inn in the future. Saving grace for this stay was the service staff who were exceptional and the front desk staff very courteous and accommodating. They quickly reversed the parking ticket we received (we weren't supposed to be ticketed for a paid spot!). Parking was okay and be mindful if you need assistance with stairs as there is a set of stairs down to the hotel level after you've parked your car. Not an issue for us, but I am cognizant of accessibility issues and tend to notice these things. Parking is expensive (again, another plus for the Coast Tsawwassen as it's free there) at $25.00 per day. Once we went into the room, I felt it was in desperate need of an upgrade, however, for the deal we got for the room ($119 per night), I was pleased with the space and layout. Kitchen was functional, if not a lot older in decor. The balcony was very nice to have, but when my 4 year old went outside, she found a large deposit of cigarette butts! ACK! When I went to go complain to the front desk (I do not normally fuss when I am in a hotel), I noticed the box spring on the mattress was HORRENDOUS. There was some kind of red stain on it and I was SO turned off. I realize it was likely a spilled glass of wine, but good grief... HIDE IT at least from view! We called the front desk and they moved us to another room immediately, which was very much the same as the previous one, however, clean balcony (and cleaner box spring). We were happy with how quiet it was from road noise and really enjoyed the city/water views from the balcony/windows. Then came night. My 4 year old and my husband will sleep through anything and I am usually pretty good, however, I could not sleep a wink in this room due to the noise from the elevator!!! Just as I'd drift off, that elevator would rumble and grind. It was not quiet in the slightest. I phoned the front desk around 2 AM after giving up trying to sleep and they apologized and explained that ALL the suites run beside the elevator shafts and that the elevator was particularly busy that night due to some teams checking in late. She did say that they'd get the elevator close to our room shut off for the rest of the night, but that it would resume at 6 AM. And it did. I managed about 3 hours sleep that night. Shame really, because the room was more than suitable. In the morning, the front desk moved us to a Jr. Suite that was removed from the elevator shaft and offered us to look at a 2 bedroom suite that was also removed from the elevators (thought all suites ran alongside the elevator???) and had a remarkable view from two balconies! Those two rooms were far more updated than the two we had been in. We settled on the Jr. Suite as the 2 bedroom would be much too much room for us. It was absolutely perfect and lovely. The beds were not that comfortable (two doubles, no king), but it was quiet. There wasn't a sep. bedroom, but the room was rather large with a sep. sitting area. The pool was nice and hot tub decent, however, we were totally grossed out by someone's leftover, rather awfully stained, underwear right by the stairs to the hot tub. One thing I didn't like was that we had to pay more money for the Jr. Suite; I felt the hotel should have absorbed that cost due to the fact that when I initially called to book the suite, I mentioned that it must be quiet and we didn't care if it was away from any views as long as we'd get a good night's rest. When I complained about the elevator noise, they said they'd had LOTS of complaints about that. Oh well, lessons learned. We won't be back there again - for us, the Tsawwassen Inn wins hands down in price, amenities, and quality of room. Worth it, even with the drive! Restaurant was exceptional. Food was more than delicious and proximity to the mall underground and popular Vancouver streets was excellent. I highly recommend eating breakfast at the restaurant or down the street at Milestones. Room service was good too and quick. I do not think I'd recommend this hotel and the only reason my rating will be higher than it should is because the service was great and the location superb.

There are two sides to every story and it would be interesting to have the hotel's version of the events he describes. I could not fault the hotel or the staff. From the moment I arrived everyone I encountered was most courteous and helpful. Firstly let's deal with the work taking place at the hotel. This was absolutely no problem at all. As it took place between 8.00 and 4.30 it did not disturb me. I usually got back to the hotel around 3.00 most days and never heard anything. The hotel is in a great location. It is only a stones throw from English Bay. Getting into the heart of downtown is not a problem in view of the frequent bus service. It was great to have a walk round the bay at night in view of the atmosphere. A lot of people seem to go there to chill out and watch the sunset. Wonderful! There is a good bar attached to the hotel and several others in the location. Most of the popular bars etc seem to be in Yaletown. Again, very easy to get to in view of the good bus service. I had a room on the 32nd floor. I am obsessed with getting a good nights sleep and I never heard a sound! The view over the City was magnificent. The receptionist apologised for not giving me a room overlooking English Bay. Frankly, I prefered the city view which, at night, was stunning. The room was large, clean and I cannot think of any issues worthy of comment. Other reviewers have mentioned the need for some renovation of the rooms. This was not a problem for me. There were two double beds and plenty of space for a sitting area. There was also a fridge and coffee making facilities. Large patio windows opened out onto a balcony. Unfortunately I never ventured on to it in view of my fear of heights! The complimentary Wi Fi was fine. The speed was always above 1Mb and I was able to Skype without any problem. There was no safe in the room but I was allocated a complimentary deposit box at reception. Getting access to it was not a problem. A continental breakfast was included in the price I paid for the room. Whilst there was also a full breakfast menu I found the continental breakfast to be perfectly adequeate. Cereal, cooked meats, cheeses, yoghurt, pastries etc plus the usual juices and coffee. Servers continually circulated with coffee refills. I had to queue for a table on a couple of days in view of a large party staying at the hotel who all seemed to want breakfast together. I only had to wait a few minutes for a table. Transferring from the airport was a doddle. I took the Canada Line to Yaletown Roundhouse and the C23 bus from outside the station to Bidwell St. It was only a short walk to the hotel. A lot cheaper than a taxi and probably as quick. The taxi may, however, be the better option if there are a couple of people with heavy cases. I had an excellent stay at the hotel and cannot think of anything adverse to comment on.

Arrived at hotel and was told that I could not park on the street without a residential permit; advised this by parking attendant. So, parked in underground parking ($27.00 a night). Took bags upstairs to register. Asked front desk clerk if they would comp me the parking fee (normal request; rarely denied - in my experience). Clerk immediately went on the attack and assumed a haughty tone, \"What's the problem?\" she demanded. I told her there wasn't a problem, I was simply making a request. She then told me that \"everyone\" pays for parking and I should have parked on the street if I didn't want to pay for the parking. I advised her that I had been informed that I could not park on the street without a permit. She said that it was my \"choice\" to park downstairs so I would have to pay for the parking and it wasn't the hotel's garage so it wasn't their problem. I responded by telling her that if guests who \"choose\" to park there are doing so on the basis of being misinformed about the parking permit situation, the hotel should be very concerned. She then reluctantly, and rudely, agreed to comp my parking and made a big deal out of telling me very loudly what a great favour she was doing me. She then gave me a room key and told me there was \"some\" construction going on at the hotel. After some discussion she gave me keys to 02 rooms; one on the 9th floor, one on the 11th floor. I went to the 9th floor and found a room that smelled stale and that was located DIRECTLY ABOVE the construction site. So, I went to check out the room on the 11th floor. That room had a run down kitchen area attached and was above and adjacent to yet another construction area. So I went down to the front desk and asked for another room. She initally told me she had no other room, then when I challenged her and said, you have 33 floors of rooms and you don't have a SINGLE ROOM available that isn't above or beside the construction area? She finally gave in and called the concierge. Still, she refused to give me another key, instead, calling over the concierge to ESCORT me to a 3rd room and then, before I had even left the front desk area, she was on the phone with someone - speaking loudly and making sure all guests heard her comments - telling this person at the other end of the phone to CHECK THE ROOMS I had been in to make sure that they were \"still okay\". Really? Really? Like what would I have done in the less than 5 minutes I was gone? Destroyed the rooms? It seemed clear to me that her intent was to humilate me and embarrass me and punish me for asking for a decent room. I went to the room on the 10th floor which was marginally better than the one the 9th floor. Still, hair in the tub and sticky spill stains on the table and a TV a great distance from the bed. Toilet that ran almost all night (stopping spontaneously at about 4 a.m.). Horrible. Absolutely horrible. Unbelievable. Shameful. Shame on Coast Hotels and this site in particular.

The rooms are fabulous - if you appreciate early 90's decor - so if you're looking for something modern and posh this may not be the hotel for you. However, it was perfect for us travelling with a five year old. The room was kept clean and my husband was in love with the turn down service, who brought ice nightly. Also, the pool was good as was free wifi. The other notable about the rooms were the views. We were on the 29th floor and the views we had were amazing. In fact, we were able to watch the PNE Parade from our patio. Currently, they are working on the patios and windows so during the week we often had company on our patios but usually we were gone during the day, so no biggie.

If you drive a higher vehicle (we have a Ford Expedition) you may want to park in another lot they have on the other side (accessed off Nelson St).

My husband and daughter tagged along and my daughter loved the space to run around in. The hotel seems to be mid-renovations where the windows are being replaced (thank goodness b/c the sirens sound like they could be directly outside our window even 18 stories up), the carpet is newer, and some of the furniture also looked relatively new. The bathrooms are older but very clean so I can't really complain. The kitchen was large but was missing utensils. We had free internet, and the pool according to my family was good too. There are separate saunas in each locker room which was different and I got a chuckle out of the sign that said, \"Clothes must be worn at all times\" outside the sauna door. What I really liked about this hotel is that there is a tiny mall underneath the hotel that has a small no frills grocery store and a drugstore. I think this would be handy for anyone staying here wanting to cut costs. There are also lots of restaurants up and down the road in front of the hotel. One thing that I didn't care for was the sound of the elevators going up and down while in the bedroom. At first I thought it was a plane overhead but then realized it had to be the elevators since we were not near the airport and virtually stopped in the middle of the night. Lastly, the squirrels stealing nuts left out by I imagine the workers at the hotel was very entertaining while waiting for a taxi in the morning. Oh, I didn't use the gym myself but I checked it out. The gym is privately owned/run by someone other than the hotel but guests get free use of the gym. If I had time I would have loved to use it or take a class.

They offered to put us up at a sister hotel for the weekend but instead we decided to rent a car for the weekend so we can make sure we are not here during the repairs. (They have to shut the power off while they are fixing the problem only during the day) They upgraded our room at their expense to make up for the issue and offered to pay the $23 parking for the rental. Which made me quite happy because we would have not needed the rental if it hadn't been for the power issue. Never the less, they have more then made up for it.

The first leg of our trip was in Victoria and we were pleasantly surprised with another Coast hotel that we stayed at. But the Coast Plaza Hotel in Vancouver was much more than a disappointment. The front desk staff was unfriendly and rude. The 1-bedroom suite that we were given had 2 double beds instead of the king bed that we specifically requested. The room was extremly outdated, with blue carpeting throughout, a tiny bathroom with zero space for even a shaving kit. The \"full-sized\" kitchen was also a let down. The large living room area had a corner dining area with a wooden table that was 4' x 4', and barely a step-up from a card table. The floor air conditioning did not work in either the living room or bedroom. In the living room, a portable air conditioning unit had been placed in a corner. The large unit was way too loud to run even on a warm day like the one we had there. And the bedroom had a small oscillating fan place on the dresser, with no other air conditioning. Worst of all, there were flies all over the room. The staff refused to move us to a king suite - without flies when I called and voiced my concern. When I went to the desk to complain to the manager, they finally agreed to move us. The new room had a king bed and no flies, but it smelled like raid, and the rest of the outdated and sub-par furnishings listed above were the same in the new room. This hotel sucked, and the staff was equivallent to the rest of the place. This was the first time on any trip that we made extra efforts to stay away from the hotel, except to sleep and shower. We tried (through our travel agency) to transfer to another hotel, but all of the hotels in the city were booked. We were stuck in this dump for two nights. When I asked about the hotel shuttle that was advertised, they said that advance reservations were required and that all 4 shuttle departures were booked. When I complained about the flies to one of the managers, he told me, \"That's Vancouver. Flies are normal here.\" On the day of our check-out, we had six hours between our check-out time and the departure of our train to Seattle. I asked if we could have a 2pm or 3pm check-out and was told that the latest they could give me is 12:30 - a half hour past the posted check-out. So we ended up checking out of the dump at 8am and leaving our luggage with the concierge while we took a trolley tour of the town and saw the sights.

The hotel's schtick seems to be that they have loads of grey squirrels (tree rats!) nearby, which are fed by the doorman and are actually quite cute. Last time I stayed it was twice in one 2 week trip, on the way out of and back into Vancouver. We got a lovely welcome back, the same 2 bed suite for the 3 of us, a plate of fruit and cookies - nice little touches.

The sports bar had great and cheap cocktails and we got absolutely ratted on our last night. All in all a very nice stay! This time was 6 years later, and the hotel is starting to show its age (as am I, I suspect, having acquired a husband and baby in the interim!). The rooms are a good size and the in-room amenities are fine, but nothing special. We had asked for a travel cot and were disappointed that they couldn't guarantee one - I actually found it quite stressful traveling for 20 hours not being sure there would be a cot for our 13 month-old baby at the end of the journey.

Breakfast was fine, but not worth the high price - thank goodness we were still in UK price mode so weren't too fussed!

At night, we were able to just go out with the babies in the stroller versus packing up the car and driving some where. This is the MAIN reason we selected this hotel. Having returned, we would book this hotel on our next stay because of it's inherent conveniences. Restaurants are everywhere on Denman street. The hotel elevator takes you directly to the mall level which has a Shoppers drug mart that opens 8am - 12pm, and a grocery store (Extra foods, like Loblaws, that opens 8am - 10pm). The rooms are reasonable large. We had a 1 bedroom premium room. There were some postings about the rooms having a musty odour, but no, there wasn't anything smelly. The reusable toiletries, are just in a pump and you can use them or use the single-use ones they have provided (probably because of the complaints). The kitchen is OK. Yes, the appliances are dated, vintage, 1980s or something, but we didn't really cook, just warmed things in the microwave and stored food/fruit in the fridge. The carpet was a bit dirty looking but OK again. The bathrooms were tidy, but dated. The linens were a beige colour and were clean but they were not the typical hotel crisp white. If you cannot handle a little dingy and maybe a little short-comings in the updated department, this hotel is not for you. If you want to have a hotel that is decent, tidy and a good location to actually do things in walking distance, then this is the hotel for you. I spent hours and hours researching hotels and really debated over the hotel, but fortunately for us, this hotel worked out. The other hotels I looked into would have been so inconvenient.

Check-in took approximately 10 minutes with a minimum of fuss. Parking is available at ~$18 / day. The hotel itself has a fairly decent lobby is situated just steps away from Robson Street (just a word of warning though - it's at the BOTTOM of the hill leading to most of Robson :P). The room we stayed in was on the 12th floor -- it had a decent view of the skyline and harbour. It also had a microwave, dishes, and a refridgerator. We found the decor and the linens to be quite dated and in need of replacement. We attempted to extend our stay to a fourth day, and were told fairly bluntly that the lowest rate possible at the hotel was $209 / night, almost double what we were paying. When we asked if we would have more luck on hotwire, we were told by the night manager that we probably wouldn't, since his hotel was very busy. That said, we tried anyway and rebooked on hotwire for $99 (actually LESS than what we paid originally). At times, we found the condition of the room to be somewhat unsettling. The maid had long black hair that we constantly found in the bathtub, on the bathroom floor and in the sink. That was exacerbated by the bathtub backing up during the first night of our stay. We should point out that this maintenance issue was dealt with promptly. We also found a used rag on our counter during the second night of our stay, and dirty pillow cases under the bed during the third night. Wireless internet is offered by the hotel, but is unfortunately unsecured (all one needs is a room number -- pick any number between 700 - 1900....).

But, please keep in mind that Vancouver is a very walkable city and public transportation is great. Tired of cooking don't want to eat out? Great room service menu. I've never seen on a room service menu Lamb Shank with all the trimmings for $19.00 and Bumble Berry pie Alamode. Wonderful!

All the staff were very knowledgable in relation to locations that we enquired after and even arranged for a couple of our trips. The complimentary breafast was more than adequate with excellent service considering the number of guests due to quick turn round guests going on cruises etc. We thought the location was fantastic being between Stanley Park and the Bay and the range of eateries on Denman Street was just amazing. Having scoured reviews of other hotels in the area and reading of clients seeing beggars in hallways etc in some establishments I was impressed with the security of the hotel.

The furniture was very tired, the dining room table and chairs only had two chairs and we were a family of four, their was only enough cutlery for three people to eat at once. There were hangers in the wardrobes with cards on inviting you to use the robes, but the robes were missing, controller missing for one of the TVs etc..

This couldn't happen until the following day due to a massive firwork festival in Vancouver and no available rooms. After a day out the following day we returned to the hotel to find we had been moved to the 32nd floor. Same style room however this one was much better. Furniture was of similar style but newer and overall the room had a better appeal, we still had to ask for an extra two chairs to enable us to seat four at the dining table. The location of the hotel is fabulous, Two minutes walk to English Bay or ten minutes in the opposite direction to Stanley Park. Plenty of places to eat offering massive variety.

What made it so nice, was all these shops and eateries were not your typical places...they were unique and not your ordinary boring everyday places...they were very nice and different. Food could be had for a bargain in many places...and just about anything you could think of. It only runs about 5 blocks, but it is one of the most unique and affordable stretches in the city...I know think of it as my favorite little \"unknown\" section I have yet to experience. I give it it a 5 star rating here, because of it's uniqueness and how peaceful and quiet the area was....yet was only just blocks from Robson Street shopping and such. I didn't have a SINGLE bad experience during my stay there...well other than paying $11 for a movie in my room that was simply a really bad choice on my part...not the hotels. Anyone seen Jackass 2 yet??? For those that have, you know why it sucked to pay $11 to see it!! I loved this place, and will be back regardless of what I will have to pay next time. Not many places I am willing to say that about...so far only the Westin Bayshore and the Rosellen have that distinction in my opinion. I highly recommend giving this place a shot.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cSuite was renovated but still outdated\u201d", "Author": "Mary-Natalie", "ReviewID": "UR6588226", "Content": "I stayed with my husband and our 5 month old son for 1 night only (back in Nov. 06) and then switched to the Mariott Vancouver.

Recommendations: In my opinion, anything that you might want, or need during your stay is within walking distance. The Doorman has an incredible knowledge of the area, and will recommend places to eat, etc. There is a mini-mall attached to the hotel, that includes a grocery store.... and a coffee and sandwich store. Must stop at Cupcake. It is a few blocks from the coast. All they sell is cupcakes, but they are to die for. I tried their weekly special... which was strawberry kiwi with key lime icing... yum! Down Denman from there is Delaney's Coffee shop. Great coffee.... fun people watching... and great ambience. Down from there is Milestone. Chain restaurant, but I have had their chicken portabello... and it is worth it!!!! Also, at the hotel, watch out for Stanley. The bellmen feed the squirrels bags of hazelnuts every year. The squirrels... (all of them named Stanley, of course) come up and \"squirrel away\" their treasures... Stop groaning, you could see that one coming!!!!

We only had breakfast in the hotel but it is served from 8am to 11am which allowed a morning swim and spa in the very quiet hotel pool. Breakfast really will last you until dinner, they don't believe in scrimping.

(If you are considering the Century Plaza, please read my review as it was by far the worse hotel experience I have ever had). A friend took me to the Coast, saying she had a good experience there in the past, and we went to the front counter. What a difference from the last hotel! The people at the desk were kind and friendly, and my friend explained to them what had happened to us and the service we had received. They were appalled, and went out of their way in every way to make us feel better. They booked us in for the two nights, and gave us a discount because I was so worried about money (having lost my other night's payment at the other hotel because they would not refund me) which I know they absolutely didn't have to do. The second night we were there, they booked us into a Jacuzzi suite, which was AMAZING! The gave us vouchers for a free breakfast, which was served to us in our rooms and was a real breakfast that was *delicious* and also some free drinks in their bar/restaurant. I cannot say enough for the desk staff, who made me feel so much better when I was near tears thinking that my anniversary weekend with my spouse had been ruined. She even gave me a little felt flower to \"make me feel better\". :-) The rooms were lovely. They were very clean, and the beds were so comfortable! Even the first night was so enjoyable! Between 6-9 they deliver free cookies and milk to your room, for the \"comforts of home\". The second night, in the Jacuzzi suite, WOW! Really, wow! The bed was huge, and extremely comfortable, the view over Vancouver city and the water was GORGEOUS and then there was the jacuzzi... Fit two people perfectly to sit and cuddle and watch the city at night time. It was so romantic and lovely, I wish I was still in there! We were also leaving the hotel on the day of the \"Sun Run\" in Vancouver, where several streets are closed due to the runners. The front desk staff was very helpful in giving us alternate routes to get home, and it ended up being a breeze! We were also impressed that they have dog friendly rooms, as we often travel with our dog and the hotel was still very quiet, and clean. I am so very glad that I was recommended the hotel, it made our weekend just perfect. All the bad feelings I had when I walked in quickly melted away because of the warm reception and lovely facilities.

This hotel was, overall, excellent in terms of staff service, room and location- equating overall with excellent value for money. First of all the service - our room was upgraded two levels on check-in when I asked for a rooom on a higher floor with a good view and wireless net access. So instead of a one bedroom suite, we were given a two bedroom corner suite with fabulous ocean and mountain views. Though the decor in the room is rather dated, it was huge (over 600 square feet) - and, with a family, space is better than a new desk in my view. There were many nice touches - staff remembered our children's names (Jenny in particular) and gave them toys on arrival. Nothing was too much trouble. Maids brought chocolates and water every evening - which was a nice touch. The location was good, close to a main shopping and restuarant distict. A grocery store in the mall below will cater for your everyday food needs. The kitchen in the rooms have the necessitites. And the price was very good - I paid around $C135 for our suite per night. Overall, the quality of the staff here was better than I have had in many more expensive and supposedly higher status hotels. The staff really are an asset to the company - and I am sure that with a family, you would be delighted with this great hotel.
