The first room we had faced a concrete wall and the A/C didn't work for the entire building. We were moved the next day with no complications. The rooms are small, dark and dated. The beds were extremely uncomfortable; my hips and back felt like they were bruised. Bathrooms were updated; again very small but functional. After every shower there was a large puddle of water on the floor. Talked to the management about it, they sent someone to check on it but he just said don't worry about it, turn the nozzle against the wall. Okay, it's not my home! The location is noisy with lots of street and people traffic. On a few occasions there was loud music and noise coming from the street in the middle of the night. Breakfast was ok with exactly the same items every day. They close at 10:15am and I do mean promptly. First a verbal warning \"breakfast is now finished!\" and then they clear everything out in 5 minutes! Germir is very near Taksim Square and the Taksim funicular so it is very easy to get around. However, most of the sightseeing is around Sultanahmet area so if we were to go to Istanbul again we would choose a different area. Thanks to the gentleman at reception in the evenings. (Sorry, I've forgotten your name.) He was very friendly and helpful. I think there is better quality for the price out there so I can say I would not return to Germir Palas.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria", "Title": "\u201cCleanliness & lights\u201d", "Author": "Bassent F Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR127064478", "Content": "The clerks were nice welcoming, however the room wasn't clean I.E bed sheets weren't clean in addition to the lack of lights.

Very pleasant and attentive staff, one took our shopping up to the rooms while we were having a drink, no fuss, just superb, caring service. I can endorse the other positive comments wholeheartedly: supurb convenience, the airport shuttle is directly across the road; Taksim, Istiklal Street and its' shops, restaurants and atmosphere are a very short walk away. The hotel itself is just as the photos portray. TV had several non-Turkish channels, of particular interest to me were the English language ones and these included BBC World and Entertainment. The free internet signal in my 6th floor room was very strong and easy to use. I was there in February and the nights were very cold but the hotel was cosy and warm the minute you stepped inside. The room temperature was too hot for me at first but was easily controllable in-room. Lots of hot water, all the usual toiletries are provided. The free room safe was easy to set. Well stocked mini-bar. Lavender bag by the pillows. Excellent breakfast. Attention to detail is what makes the difference between a good hotel and one which is remarkable, Germir Palas is remarkable. There was even an umberella in the wardrobe. The staff were the icing on the cake, no corporate robots here, warm human beings with a smile and a personality, and this was true from the room cleaner to the reception staff. The staff were brilliant. Istanbul is a wonderful city and this hotel is a wonderful home-from-home in this city. I live in the south of Turkey now and come to Istanbul several times a year.

Pros: Clean Central in Taksim near the square (but also a con) Decent sized room Good breakfast Nice roof terrace Cons: TV from 1981 Bed that felt it had been dry-rotted out. The bed was flat-out awful Very old style furnishings and dark in the room. Felt like an old person's bedroom. Not the type of old-style furnishings that feel luxurious or chic. Staff that knew very little about anything (transportation, how to fix the internet, things in the area, etc...although they were generally nice) Windows had ZERO soundproofing and the street this hotel is on is beyond super busy. Beyond. It is the only hotel on this street in the area. There are many hotels on side streets a 1-2 minute walk away that are out of the extreme noise. I don't mind some noise either but it is amazingly noisy till late hours. Also, there are people lined up to take bus transportation right outside the hotel. So often, there is a line formed that is very long that goes in front of the hotel and you have to battle to get in the door. Very frustrating. All in all, it is in a safe area, but you would be wise to stay @ one of the places literally down the street. It will be 10 times more pleasant with noise. That is unless you find a deal you can't refuse. This is not a bad place at all, just not charming like it looks on the website.

Breakfast was generally excellent but monotonous - eggs, cold cuts, wide variety of breads, pastries, cheeses, and nice produce - tomatoes, onions and amazing olives, tea/coffee, milk and cereals. I guess by mixing it around it's not too bad. The location is fantastic. Around a quarter mile or so is the pedestrian boulevard that is filled with wonderful and inexpensive places to eat. The staff was uniformly friendly and nice. A case in point - I purchased an \"Akbil\" or prepaid refundable metro card. On checkout day, the bellhop offered to \"buy\" it from me at whatever I said was the value on it plus deposit - saving me the trip and wait as well as the loss of unused value (the authorities will only refund the deposit). The only two negatives - they have no irons in the rooms, none are available and laundry charges are expensive. Also, they have a fantastic terrace lounge where we often dropped in for the city view (including a view of the Bosphorus and the bridge) but a glass of white wine was 15 YTL (around 12 USD), a bit of a ripoff.
