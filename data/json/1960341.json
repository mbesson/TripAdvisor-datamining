Our trip to Italy was centered around a week in Tuscany. To end our trip, we planned three nights in Rome, and for those nights we reserved rooms at the Fabio Massimo Hotel. When by chance we checked email in Tuscany we found a message from Fabio that they had cancelled our reservations in error, and they offered to find us rooms at a similar hotel (the Excel). Here they made another error, for we got to Excel St Peter's only to learn that our reservations there were for one night only. The man on duty very calmly got to the heart of the problem, and invited us to enjoy orange juice and pastries while he arranged for yet another hotel for two nights, until they had a room available., So it was only our final night in Rome that we actually stated at the Excel. We were most appreciative of their professionalism and courtesy. And - the breakfast is wondeful. We loved, in Tuscany, strolling down to the piazza for cappacino and pastry each morning, but we eventually missed the healthier breakfast we are used to, so to find at the Excel St Peters fresh fruit and yogurt and granola-type cereal (in additon, of course, to the usual deadly delicious Italian treats) was a real treat.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manama, Bahrain", "Title": "\u201cclose to vatican!\u201d", "Author": "Eranda_11", "ReviewID": "UR118003693", "Content": "superb location! close to metro & vatican. would not hesitate to stay again!", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colombo, Sri Lanka", "Title": "\u201cLoved it! really enjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "makusu", "ReviewID": "UR117944004", "Content": "We selected this hotel because it was close to the metro and close to the vatican. we read the reviews on trip advisor and booking,com and it was spot on. great location! its about 500m from the metro. about 5-10mins walk from the vatican and castle st angelo. really nice area to stay. close to some nice cafes and some nice shopping too.

Just like everyone else has said, don't judge the hotel by the appearance of the outside building. It's quite pleasant and modern on the inside. Our room was very small (room 126)!! If you can avoid this room, do so. It's the size of some people's closets. My husband and I didn't complain because we weren't there to enjoy the room, we were there to enjoy the sites of Rome; but if you are a person that needs your space, then avoid that room (plus the view outside the window is bad too). But the room itself was clean. Nice wood floors, tv, eco-friendly. The bed was not too comfy. The bathroom was nice and an added bonus for Americans...there is a 110 outlet in the bathroom!! This was a God-sent because for some odd reason our outlet converter and transformer wouldn't work with our camera charger, but my husband found the outlet in the bathroom so we could charge our camera. Problem solved. Thank you Hotel Excel!! There was free Internet as well (which is a plus). We didn't eat the breakfast at the hotel, though it was included with our room stay. The staff were very nice. Whenever we needed directions some place or a suggestion for a nice restaurant, they were more than willing to help. It's proximity to the Vatican can't be beat (about a 5 minute walk). And my husband and I walked from the hotel to the Coliseum, about a 40 minute walk...we love to walk. Rome is definitely a walkable city, so bring your walking shoes. Also the hotel has lots of little cafes close by and ladies, tons of little boutiques and stores for shopping! If you don't want to walk to the Coliseum or other historic sites the metro station is two blocks away.

The only negative was the airport pick up arranged by the hotel. We had been offered a transfer and advised the hotel that there were 4 people and 4 suitcases. The pick up was about a half an hour late and we had to ring to find out if it was coming. Also the car used was too small and one suitcase had to be nursed which made for an uncomfortable journey.

The entry to the \"Excel\" is on the ground floor and once through their door it\u00b4s clean, modern and with a friendly welcome. All the staff were lovely - I think i counted 4 different receptionists on duty at different times and also 2 girls who service the breakfast bar and various people working on housekeeping - all very pleasant and efficient at their jobs. The room we were in \"123\" was spacious (even for the 3 of us) with modern fixtures - No view (other than the sky) through the windows/skylights but we were out and about during the day and sleepy at night so this was not a problem. The only thing missing (in my opinion) was tea & coffee making facilities in the rooms. I liked the breakfast and also appreciated the fact that it was available until 1030am - the red orange juice was delicious and the pastries always fresh and the other buffet items were constantly replaced by the busy waitress who also brings hot drinks to your table.
