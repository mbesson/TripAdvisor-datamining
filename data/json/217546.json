It was also nice to have real mugs and glasses provided instead of plastic or styrofoam.

Lots of food choices nearby: Starbucks, Au Bon Pain, pizza, bars, etc. We didn't walk too far since it was pouring rain, but it looked on a map as though it was a good place from which to get most anywhere in Boston, either by T or on foot.

We chose this hotel because it was within walking distnce through a lovely park and area; it was adjacent to Whole Foods, where they offer breakfast, lunch, and evening meals and a place to sit and eat. This saved us loads of money, since we were already here since Dec. 2nd and now it was several weeks later. The bathroom was a real letdown with it's tiny space and ceiling that looked like it had water damage, but who's to complain when the rate was reasonable for us? The wonderful thing was that we could walk to restaurants in the evenings when we just needed a break from the hospital and medical overload of information. The North End is trendy and close to Mass General and the T near the Liberty Hotel, a former Suffolk County Jail. We also could walk to a store where my husband would find boots for the wet conditions we experienced in December. There was also a green line a few blocks away that could take us to the Cambridge Galleria Mall, but we walked everywhere, even across the Charles River. I loved this area! I wished I lived here, in fact. The one surprise we got was having dinner down in the hotel's restaurant one evening. I ate the roasted duck and my husband had fish. There were few people in the restaurant, too. We enjoyed meal as much as the atmosphere. There is also an adjacent area with a bar for early evening cheer. This restaurant was one of the few open on Christmas Eve, which we thought we would have to use if our daughter was still at the hospital. In the end, we had a very nice stay here. There was a laundry room with two of everything, next to a computer room with a few PC's and a printer, which we easily used. An exercise room also afforded people something to do while waiting for laundry. Most floors had a vending machine offering pop, but down on the second level, where the laundry, and other facilities were, there was a snack machine, too. The back door on that level was very convenient access to the Whole Foods, CVS and other stores such as AU BON PAIN and a frozen yogurt shop. This parking and shopping area tended to be warmer and less windy than the front of the hotel and streets. It was convenient to have an eyeglass store close by when we needed a screw for our glasses and new cleaning cloths. Several streets to the east, there are more fast food places and restaurants, but we ate at two places right on Cambridge Street. Lovely area! It picked up our spirits to stay here.

After several moments of silence and a very confused look on her face, someone standing nearby mentioned how close we were to Quincy Market area.

The young girl at the reception desk, really knows the area and I'm glad I took her advice about several restaurants in the area. She told us where to go, where not go and the best way to get there. The hostess at the restaurant also deserves a compliment, she was very nice to my young daughter, going above and beyond her hosting duties.The only complaint that I had was when I went to the restaurant for a late night snack for the kids. The bartender showed me the dessert menu and the pictures of the pieces of cake looked huge. When I opened the container, I couldn't believe that the pieces that they gave me were small thin slivers. Barely enough for one person. I spent $22 on two tiny pieces of cake and 2 teas (that I could have made in my room for free except I needed decaf). I told the lady at the front desk, who agreed with my complaint, but told me she could do nothing about it. I still think they should have reimbursed me. It wasn't right.

Please check my credentials, I am not on here to rant. The Holiday Inn at Beacon Hill is engaged in some questionable and borderline illegal business practices and I suggest that you strongly reconsider if you are thinking of booking here. I stayed at this hotel for one night in September of 2011. I found the rooms to be acceptable and the location is excellent. Our stay went over without a problem however, after we checked out of the hotel, our account was charged $400 for a smoking fee when we were NOT smoking in the room. We immediately took action, calling the hotel manager to correct the erroneous charge. I am a business professional and was traveling to Boston with another family and no one was smoking in the room. This was made clear to the hotel manager and he was specifically asked what prompted him to charge $400 for the smoking fee. His response was that, although he could not confirm any specific damages had been done to the room, his staff noted to charge the smoking fee and 'if they say it's a blue car, it's a blue car\" (his exact words). First of all, I have no clue what that means and secondly, if no damage is done to the room and it turns into a 'he said, she said' situation, the ethical thing to do would be to admit one's mistake, apologize and credit the charges back to the guest's account. This was not done, which essentially means that Holiday Inn at Beacon Hill STOLE $400 which will be used to pad it's pockets, not to clean up any damages. My only hope is that some one reads this review and decides to book their lodging elsewhere. Given the abundance of nice hotels in the area, there is absolutely no reason to stay in a location which makes it's business preying on innocent patrons. If you stay here, you run the risk of significant charges to your account on the word of some questionable hotel employee and you will have no recourse except to dispute the charge with your financial institution.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "nw indiana", "Title": "\u201cGood location for sightseeing\u201d", "Author": "mjm59", "ReviewID": "UR118290963", "Content": "We stayed here for a sightseeing trip to Boston.

The bedding was new and comfortable, and I got a very good rate on short notice. The disappointments, however, were significant.

It was a combination business/ pleasure trip, as I was doing research for a book I'm writing, plus it was our anniversary weekend. We grabbed a taxi at Logan Airport, and our cabbie congratulated us on our choice of hotels, saying that it was \"near everything.\" We took this to be a good sign. Check-in was a breeze. A pleasant young woman named Sam made us feel very much welcome. She answered our questions before we even asked them, giving us the info we needed to connect to the hotel's wireless network. We requested a mini-fridge in our room. She cheerfully told us that she'd charge us just $20 for our whole stay, not per day. (The fridge arrived about 15 minutes later.) We stayed in Room 1008. From our 10th floor window, we could see the Charles River far in the distance, but mostly our view was of buildings and traffic. The window itself was quite dirty. Our room featured a good-sized closet with a sliding mirrored door. Ironing board, iron, plus an extra pillow inside. Bathroom was small, but clean and functional. Hair dryer was kind of chintzy; I had to hold the \"on\" button for it to stay on. We had two double beds in our room, which were neatly made and inviting-looking, with four plump pillows a piece. Other furnishings included a writing desk, nightstand, large dresser, armchair, TV, Nintendo Game Cube and four lamps. The desk and dresser were worn-looking; they looked maybe twenty years old. Housekeeping took good care of our needs straightening up our mess and replacing towels and toiletries in a timely fashion. Some minor complaints... our room door was messed up. We had to practically break into our own room to open it. Our beds were too soft. Both of us woke up with achy backs and necks. The hotel restaurant was way too expensive. We got our daily breakfasts at Au Bon Pain (this is housed in the same building as the hotel, although you have to exit the hotel and walk outside to enter the restaurant) every morning. Also, the walls in this Holiday Inn aren't well insulated to keep sound out. You might want to bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. We were supposed to get a free newspaper every morning, but only got it one day. Checkout was easy, and again we dealt with friendly hotel staff. This hotel does not offer free shuttle service to the airport, but there are always taxis parked outside. (This will cost you between $16 and $25, depending on the cab company.) Or you can take the trolley and save even more money. Next time we're in Boston, we probably will try a different hotel.

It is absolutely nothing special, but no major shortcomings either. I was surprised to note that on Tripadvisor, it was ranked as 60th out of 75 hotels reviewed in Boston at the time I booked. This suggests this hotel is pretty awful, or the other 59 are really good. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come across to me as deserving this lowly position. It certainly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t awful! I found the staff to be helpful with everything asked of them. I had emailed the hotel telling them we would be arriving late (midnight) and what were the prospects of a light meal at that time. They replied quickly and stated that while Room Service closes at 10pm, they could arrange for a pizza or something similar to be delivered from a nearby restaurant. The location of this hotel was great, and we found ourselves walking everywhere. If you fancy a bus tour of the city, the Gray Line hop on hop off service stops right outside. We were given a room on the Executive Floor (12th floor). The room was fine, although showing some signs of wear and tear, but not to the extent of crying out for a refurb. The important aspects of a clean room, a comfortable bed with everything working was totally met, and the provision of a fridge was welcome. We found that it was quiet, despite being in close proximity to the busy Cambridge Street. The only intrusions were occasional ambulance and fire engine sirens, there being a hospital and fire station close by. The bathroom was a reasonable size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is no bath, but the walk-in shower formed the length of a bath. However, we prefer showers to baths so we were happy with this. Meals in chain hotels tend to be lacklustre, and this was no exception. We ate in once (room service) only because we were too tired to go out, but regretted it. The meal took one hour to be delivered, although in fairness we did get a call to inform us there was a delay. When it came, one of our meals was wrong, as was the bill. I consider an 18% service charge, a room delivery charge of $4 plus an admin fee of 3 (or 4)% on top to be a bit excessive especially given the circumstances. The hotel deducted $10 off the bill without argument. If you like Italian, I can recommend the Grotto in Bowdoin St \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about a 5 min walk from the hotel. Excellent. However, I have to say the breakfasts were fine, with plenty of choice of both cooked, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchealthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 option. Service at breakfast was good. As a visitor from the UK, I find it hard to assess whether this hotel represents good value or not what with exchange rates being what they are at present. I cashed in Reward Points for this stay so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cost anything other than extras; a really nice touch was for Platinum Members receiving free breakfasts. I noted that had I paid, the price would have been $185 per night for the time we were there, which seems expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on a par with London UK.

It was worth it. It normally runs $300 a night but I would not pay that. It really is not that classy. It is clean, efficient, close to Faneuil Hall and the T and in a very nice area. We drove to the Alewife Station and parked (cheaper). There are not as many stops and is quicker than using the Riverside station, which we usually do to get to Boston. The attendant at the station however, with the toothpick in his mouth and sun glasses on (we were in a building why(?) sun glasses) and big belly, was rude and unprofessional. Pay attention Mass Transit Authority. When you go there be sure to purchase a 7 day pass at the CORRECT machine, so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up purchasing by each trip. This will save you money in the long run if you plan on visiting many places in Boston during your stay, even for a weekend. When we stood at the machine to purchase our tickets, with many people behind us, the attendant approached us and informed us we could not buy a 7 Day Trip. We wanted to ask him more questions, but there were many people that we would hold up and he was being short with us for asking. After all was said and done, I noticed a sign that said we could purchase one day or 7 day pass, which we also read on Trip Advisor. So, I approached him and asked again, he said he never said that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. I can understand the confusion and would not been bothered by it if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for his lack of courtesy and honesty.

Since I knew that we would not arrive until around 2pm, leave for the wedding at 5:30 pm, come back at midnight, and check out at 8:30am to beat the traffic going home, all I wanted was a clean and comfortable place to stay. I got a great discount through Hotwire, and was happy with the selection. The staff was polite and courteous, and checkout and checkin were painless. There were always plenty of cabs in front of the hotel. There is a public parking garage next door (the hotel has no onsite parking) that is not owned by the hotel, but is physically connected to it. I recommend that you park your car yourself if you drive rather than have valet parking. That way you will know exactly where your car is, and you pretty much have 24 hour access to your car in case you need to get something or put something in it. Parking was $32 for 24 hours (and indeed if you were parked for more than four hours). There was free wireless internet in the room, which had aging furniture (chipped and peeling, like you might see at a garage sale), but the beds were very comfortable, the room was a nice size, and it was very quiet, so we got a good night's sleep. We spent about half an hour at the outdoor pool area, which is not large, but had plenty of lounge chairs and a glass enclosure that blocked out most of the street noise, so it was relaxing to sit there. There is a small lobby, but it is not the kind of place that you would want to sit for any length of time. For the price I paid, and the purpose I had, this place was great. It was within a couple of blocks of stores like CVS, Whole Foods, Starbucks, and a really good pizzeria where we had lunch. A few blocks away is a really nice park that we passed in a cab on our way to the wedding. And the Charles Street T is only a 5 minute walk. Beacon Hill itself is a very nice section of Boston (the equivalent of Central Park West and Sutton Place in NYC). If you want a nice place to sleep that is conveniently located when you visit Boston, and don't plan on spending much time at the hotel, then this place is fine.

The only other hotel as close to the hospital is a very expensive boutique hotel. The distance from Logan International is surprisingly short; if traffic and construction are in your favor (I arrived after 10:30pm on a Tuesday), the cab fare can add up to $20 plus tip (I was astonished). The hotel is located between two stops on the T (subway), so getting to Cambridge or downtown Boston is easy, as well as other places accessible by mass transit. The staff is friendly at check in, there is a restaurant on-site (didn't get a chance to try it), and a wide variety of restaurants nearby, as well as a grocery store. They have a small fitness center that's free for guests, and a nearby athletic club will offer a $10 day pass with your room key. The rooms are serviced by a below average speed wireless connection, however it is free. Like all Boston hotels, the room prices here are higher than you'd get elsewhere, so I hold back complaints on price knowing that its just the nature of the city (and, as a business traveler, that wasn't my issue). The rooms are not in great shape. Mine was a mish-mash of old and new, mostly old. Lets get the good out of the way: the mattress and linens were good, so was the climate control. The rest of the room was in a state of neglect. The room has clearly been renovated several times, as fixtures and wall molding don't necessarily match the present furniture. The wallpaper was peeling in many places and the furniture was all worn and seriously scratched. The TV was an aging Zenith box. If you're staying at this hotel because you have someone who's at the adjacent hospital, the room will probably not do a good job of cheering you up. On the night I arrived they informed me that the water was being taken offline from 11pm to 5am to fix a problem --again, if you have sensitive health (and this location clearly gets a lot of people visiting the famous hospital), this was not a positive sign. However the hotel was good enough to provide free bottles of water. The poor state of the hotel rooms made me feel the hotel is resting on its location to generate business without any pressure to compete, as most nearby hotels are in a much higher price/luxury class.

But for me, a number of problems far outweighed those factors. Most serious of which was that, due to severe mobility problems, I had requested a handicapped accessible room. It turned out to be located at the far end of a corridor and a great distance from the elevators. Hence after a very long, very painful walk, I was essentially trapped in the room until checkout. It was simply too daunting a prospect to even try visiting the restaurant or other facilities. Usually, special needs accommodations are situated quite close to elevators/lifts, for what should be obvious reasons. So, it was a shock to be informed that if I needed that proximity, it was up to me to have requested it at the time of booking. Never in my experience in any hotel had I encountered such a situation. Also, while less serious, there were other problems. First of all, although I'd specifically asked for and was promised a mini-fridge at a slight additional charge, none was provided. Then there was the free internet service which, on several attempts to get my my laptop going, kept coming up as having \"little or no connectivity.\" Actually, it was none. Finally, Foster's Restaurant, located within the hotel and from which Room Service originates, was closed for lunch until the 6th of January, in observance of the Holidays. Guests wishing to have lunch had to either leave the hotel for a restaurant or find one which would deliver. Also, the menu was strictly of the meat or seafood variety; any other types of dishes, including vegetarian, had to be special ordered.

It is also in a good location...lots of options within walking distance, such as Boston Commons and Quincy Market. When we arrived, the desk clerk was very helpful in making sure we knew where we were going and had maps and such to go with us. We were also surprised to find out we were upgraded to a suite! We still have no idea why, but we definitely weren't complaining. Although the suite was bigger, it was not updated any more than the other rooms. The bathroom was tiny and the bathroom door actually hit the toilet when you opened it which was kind of annoying. Although the entrance and lobby seemed to be updated, the rooms weren't so much. They were perfectly fine with the amount we paid, but would have probably be disappointed had we paid much more.

The elevators are older but have been face-lifted (they're still very slow, though). The hallways are fine -- dressed up but still narrow and low. And the room, which was comfortably appointed enough, feels like an older, smaller room with nicer finishes. The bathroom was, however, eensy -- which made the whole thing feel small for a family of four when it came time to get ready in the morning. A couple minor glitches in our particular room: The TV cable was out altogether, the wireless connection seemed to bounce randomly, and the beds (which were on the harder side of firm) weren't attached to the headboard, so if two people sat on the foot of the bed at once (we did, several times), the whole bed tips up alarmingly.

The other people in my party were not bothered much by it, but I tend to be a light sleeper. The other nights seemed to be less crowded and the noise at night was not bad at all.

This was the hotel we happened to get through a website that allows you to name your own price. The hotel itself was great. The facilities are newly renovated, and everything was clean. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. Even though it wasn't right in the heart of downtown, the T Red Line (subway) was just a short walk away. There's free wireless internet in every room, and a \"business center\" allows you to surf the web and print things out for free. This was a Godsend, since we didn't really do a lot of pre-planning for the trip... we were able to plot out places we wanted to see, and print the necessary Google Maps (and look up stuff like hours, admission fees, and so forth). I had only two minor complaints and one major complaint. Minor complaint #1 - for being such a ritzy-looking hotel, I was surprised to learn the pool is outdoors, and therefore, seasonal. Seems like a hotel that would have an indoor pool. Minor complaint #2 - the windows aren't very energy-efficient. We had to crank up the heat to 75 degrees in order to make up for the coldness near the windows. Only major complaint about this place is that they don't own their own parking facilities. Valets are available to take your car to a nearby private lot, which is a jaw-dropping $36 a day. As nice as this hotel is, it's still not the Ritz Carlton. Who ever expects to pay for parking at a Holiday Inn? I've never been to a hotel where you pay for parking, even at \"better\" chains like the Radisson or even at Disney World. Thanks to TripAdvisor, I was warned this parking fee by checking the hotel's \"amenity\" listing, but there weren't really any reviews to point it out, so I wanted to draw attention to it. If you're flying into town and NOT planning to leave Boston at all (ie. don't \"need\" to rent a car), I suggest taking the T from the airport to the hotel. It's very easy to get around the city if you have an unlimited pass to ride the T, or if you don't mind walking. Take the airport shuttle to South Station... then get the red line to \"Charles/MGH.\" (Yes, if you're looking at Google... the blue line \"Bowdoin\" station is just as close as the red line, but the blue line doesn't stop there on weekends.) Even if you're driving in like we did, find an outlying T station and ride the train in. Usually the stops at the end of the line have the largest parking facilities. In this case, we parked at Alewife, the station at the western end of the Red Line. It was just a short 6-stop ride to \"Charles/MGH,\" the stop closest to this hotel... and the parking was just $5 a day. So instead of paying $72 for 2 days of parking, we paid just $10. Not to mention, you get to avoid driving in the heavy, hectic city traffic! When you buy a T pass, I suggest the 7-day pass... even if you're only there for a weekend, it's cheaper than buying two 1-day passes. Unlimited rides on any subway or bus, which makes it easy to jump around town without constantly wondering if you've got the right change for fare. The T is pretty clean (though some of the stations are in the midst of much-needed renovatons). We had no problems with it, even at night. Of course, if you've got a big family and lots of luggage... taking the T might not be so convenient. Even for a family of 4, taking the car in and out everywhere might be cheaper than getting 7-day T passes for everyone.", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "ringwood", "Title": "\u201cNot much to talk about\u201d", "Author": "lhs1", "ReviewID": "UR10518122", "Content": "Tired looking although its been renovated.

There was a notice posted in the elevator saying that the hotel is undergoing a five-month, very thorough, renovation. We saw no evidence of that, so it may be just beginning, or it may be on floors that we did not see, which is entirely possible.

While this review is specifically for the Jan '07 stay, both stays were comparable, Fri+Sat nights, and both were at a nightly rate of $55 via an opaque, prepaid, online booking service (I named my own price). The hotel's own website states: \" Please note the hotel will be undergoing renovations from Nov. 1, 2006 until Mar. 30, 2007.\" My advice is: Do not pay rack rate here until after renovations are complete! On the upside, the room was well-furnished, with two double beds, attractive wall coverings, TV, ironing board and steam iron, free wireless & wired internet (more important than TV!), a small desk, and adequate lighting. There were nice soaps and shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, along with clean towels, washcloths, and a coffee maker. As noted by others, the elevators were functional and fast. Climate control in the room was adequate. I also appreciated ceramic coffee mugs and glass tumblers (rather than plastic). And there was a sliding-door closet, with hangars and plenty of storage for luggage, etc. I was annoyed that there was not a luggage rack, however. On the downside... the bathroom ceiling was absolutely filthy with mould and peeling plaster, the grout was mouldy, and the floors stained. I'll stop there, because as noted by the many flyers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to replace all guest bathrooms \"from the studs out\". The worn carpeting and shabby draperies are also set to be replaced. I can only hope that the hard and uncomfortable mattresses will be replaced too. As noted by others, the rooms facing the hospital do experience sirens and road noise all night long, and I don't think the renovations will fix that. And renovating the tiny bathrooms won't make them any larger. I had little interaction with the desk clerk; however, I was pleased that my advance phone call at 10 PM the day of check in was sufficient for them to hold my room until my very late arrival of 12:30 AM. (Prepaid bookings are sometimes cancelled with no refund if you don't check in before midnight of the arrival date. Fortunately that did not happen to me.) Aside from the items noted above which will be rectified by renovations, my stay was satsifactory, and the price was terrific. The outdoor pool was closed. Others seemed to be enjoying the restaurant, though I ate elsewhere. There isn't a lot of late-night dining in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, other than a pizzeria. There seemed to be a security guard out-and-about, so I always felt safe. Yes, there is a Red Line \"T\" subway station about two blocks away; the hotel has no self-parking and the adjacent garage charges $36/day with no in/out. (So if you're going to park, use the hotel's valet parking, which is the same price but allows in/out). There is no on-street parking available. I would stay at this hotel again, though I'd really want to find a cheaper parking option.

Staff at check-in was quite friendly. Booked through easyclicktravel and got the requested 2-bed-room. Was expecting 2 doubles, but when I mentioned my Priority Club No., we got upgraded to the Priority Club floor with 2 queens in the room. The guy at the check-in even gave us coupons for free continental breakfast every morning - really nice! The rooms had a good size, were cozy and absolutely clean! If you don`t mind a little walking you barely have to use the T. Faneuil Hall, Downtown, North End, TD Banknorth Garden, the Freedom Trail and much more are in walking distance. But there are also 2 T-Stations close by!

However, if you're driving to Boston beware: hotel parking is an additional $35 per night & if you're using Priceline you don't find out about this until after your Priceline reservation is complete. After learning this, we modified our travel plans & decided not to drive our own car to Boston, thus saving us $105 in hotel parking fees. The front desk staff could use a refresher course in customer service, when I requested 2 double beds upon check-in (there were 4 of us staying) I was told that only king sized beds were available (this seems to be a common theme when booking through Priceline so if you have more then 2 in your party I would NOT recommend using Priceline). I nicely requested a cot & was told that one would be sent one to our room, after 30 minutes the cot still hadn't arrived so on our way out to dinner I stopped by the front desk to check on the cot. This time I was snidely told by a different front desk rep that a cot could be sent to our room but it will cost an additional $20 per night! Since we needed a cot I said fine & continued on to dinner feeling very disappointed that Holiday Inn would charge an additional $20 a night to provide their guests with a cot, as they are complimentary in most hotels (I was just glad that we decided not to drive our own car because $35 for parking plus $20 for a cot would have added an extra $55 a night to our bill - we could have stayed at a better hotel for that price!). Aside from my poor customer service experience, I found the hotel to meet our needs. The room was a nice size & clean, complimentary high speed internet access is available in the room if you have a laptop. The location is decent but its in the Financial District which caters more towards business people, then tourists so you'll have to walk about a mile or so to get to any attractions /subway stops. I probably wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel due to the location but other then that it was fine. On our last day, when I went to check out, I was surprised to find that there actually was no additional $20 a night charge for the cot, it was complimentary. I guess the front desk rep was just in a foul mood & wanted to try & put a damper other people's fun.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "spain", "Title": "\u201cIt's ok, very good location\u201d", "Author": "anonima", "ReviewID": "UR3756916", "Content": "The bathroom is very good, the shower is fantastic and there are lots of amenities.

The hotel lobby was small, non descript. Staff helpful, but seemed disinterested. The \"Beantown Trolley\", the hop off and on tour bus, stopped just outside the hotel, very convienent. The restaurant was way overpriced [tuna sandwich for $10], and but a few places nearby. There was a sandwich place, chinese restaurant, middle east and of course starbucks across the street, and a local grocery store. The area is a little run down, and with TWO liquor stores nearby, some unsavory characters milling about. The room was large for hotel standards, and the housekeeping was excellent, but there was a large painting missing from over the bed, complete with hanging screws. The room was quiet, the bed comfortable, great a/c, bathroom on the small side. The outdoor pool on the second floor was nice, plently of towels and chairs, and opened to 9pm...nice for a dip after a long day of walking boston. We did not spend much time in the room itself, and for the hotwire price of $86 a night [vs the usual price of $175], it was a bargain. Do not think we would pay full price, though. I would only recommend it only if you can get it deeply discounted, as it is only very ordinary, nothing special.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Boston at Beacon Hill", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d217546-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Boston_at_Beacon_Hill-Boston_Massachusetts.html", "Price": "$218 - $388*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5 Blossom Street at Cambridge Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Boston</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">02114</span></span> (Formerly Holiday Inn Select Boston - Government Center)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "217546", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a7/55/a75520b2c2378e75dfdfdd89b3c784ce11large.jpg"}}
