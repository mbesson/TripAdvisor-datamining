The room we've booked was very big with huge bathroom. According to the hotel map we have probably booked the biggest room- (premium) which is at the second floor, no.236 but we have paid accordingly (prepare 210 Euro per night, without breakfast). The toiletries in the bathroom are very good, absolutely loved them, especially the body lotion. They should put more every day. The towels are puffy, big and lovely. The bed was huge and very comfy together with 5-6 pillows. Be aware though of the mini bar: it is very expensive...4.5 Euro per 33 cl water. Go and get your water from the supermarket on the corner- 4 min walk. The room was cleaned very well every day. As I said the breakfast wasn't included and we didn't feel like paying 25 Euro per person when there were plenty of bakeries and nice bars on the same road to chose from. The staff was very friendly and they speak good English and Italian. They have given us all the info we've wanted, pointing us on the map how to get there, where to shop, where to eat , where to have good\" macarrons\". The only thing which definitely has annoyed me was the guys who want to take your luggage. They brought our luggage to the room then he was really taking his time in showing us where the TV was, how to use it, then the air conditioning, the lights, etc...I have never experienced that and I didn't like it at all. He should bring your luggage and \"bye\". You have to tip him, otherwise he won't leave, would stay there with you all night. This thing has repeated when we left the hotel ,although I told him I can take myself luggage. He absolutely grabbed it from my hand and carried all the way to the taxi.

The entrance walking up to the front door of the hotel is as beautiful as the photos. The lobby was well lit, nicely decorated, unassuming (for Louis XIV style) and cozy. We were promptly greeted by a smiling member of the hotel staff at the front desk to check in, and as we began talking he seemed as excited about our visit to the city as we were. He handed us a very good tourist map, gave some pointers about how to navigate the city and after a few minutes we were all checked in. We mentioned we wanted to see a cabaret while we were in town to which they were able to provide some detail about the different shows, and even better we were able to buy our tickets right at the front desk. We were told about breakfast at the hotel, but we really wanted to be out in the city's cafes and the breakfast room wasn't extraordinary, so we never went for it. Another member of staff helped us with our bags as we made or way up the two man elevator to our Superior Room on the 2nd floor. I read a few comments on here about the rooms being small with a bad view, but our room was a good size with an amazing view looking out onto the courtyard of the hotel entrance and onto the neighboring building. So I can't comment on the smaller rooms, but I would suggest booking Superior and asking for a room on the upper floors. For windows, the room had these beautiful french doors that opened up onto the courtyard view, this was probably the best feature of the room. The bathroom was great as well, filled with reddish marble and gold colored fittings, perhaps the best was the peculiar misshapen brass fittings in the tub, beautiful, unique and still completely functional. The bed was comfortable and was always freshly made with chocolates on the pillow when we returned from a day out. Finally the location of the hotel was great, a 5 minute walk to the Notre Dame and three different metro stations, not to mention endless cafe's, shops etc. The best is just walking around the neighborhood, which always felt safe at any time of night. The only downside of the hotel was that there was no wireless internet in the rooms, which I'm told is not uncommon for Paris, but none the less it's the only reason why Melia Colbert didn't receive 5 stars. This place doesn't break the piggy bank, but it's not as cheap as it gets either, for us it was just right, a great value and a fantastic stay.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous!\u201d", "Author": "StephanieW92", "ReviewID": "UR123796028", "Content": "My boyfriend booked this hotel for my birthday, because of its central location.

The hotel is right around the corner from Notre Dame and within 2 blocks from public transportation. The entire experience of Paris changed by simply staying at Melia Colbert.

And, in fact, the location is great, just across the river from Notre Dame and a block from the Place Saint Michel. The room I was in (2nd floor front) was clean (not the usual musty Paris hotel smell) and, while not super spacious, I didn't have to climb over the bed to get into the bathroom as I've had to do in some tiny Paris rooms. Despite these positive aspects, I can't recommend this hotel for anyone who uses a macbook air or ipad to stay in touch with business, home, or local events while traveling. The hotel advertises broadband internet access, but it requires that you plug their cable into your computer; if your laptop or ipad doesn't have a LAN port, the best they can offer you is a wired terminal in the bar or wireless access in lobby and bar, and that requires a card with username and password doled out in 30-minute increments by the front desk. When I was there, they ran out of these cards (\"Normally we have cards, but as it is the weekend, we cannot get any more\", they explained, as if the weekend had come along unexpectedly.) This presented a real barrier to doing the work I needed to do while in Paris, and I overheard other guests at the front desk with the same problem. Instead of shrugging their shoulders and saying \"Yes, wi-fi is very bad in Paris\", a hotel that charges the rates of this one should--at minimum--have wireless routers that can be borrowed and used in each room by guests who can't connect to the LAN cable.

It was the most frustrating experience!!! Since it is a boutique hotel there is no official concierge which made it difficult to get information about transportation, tours, and restaurants that were not in the immediate area etc. They are very short staffed at the check-in desk and the continual problem with the internet not working was annoying.

First, location, the hotel is just footsteps from Notredame, close to everything in Paris. The property is beautiful and romantic. The rooms are clean, nice, and comfortable. The rooms have all the nice toiletries that you expect from a Melia such as toothbrush, combs, shampoo, conditioner, etc. . I stayed at a superior room and sincerely it was significantly larger and cozier than an equivalent such as the Arc du Triomphe Hilton. The room had windows that actually open to the outside and in our case there were 2 sets, one of which opened to the street and the other to the courtyard. If you like fresh air and waking up to the smell of fresh croissants, this might be the hotel for you. Also, please disregard a previous review that states that the rooms have no air conditioning, they do and it works quite well. Keep in mind, you are paying 250 Euros which is less than average for this type of hotel in Paris. The negatives... Well, there is generally only one attendant at the front desk most of the time, so check-in and check out may be cumbersome if by chance several parties arrive at the same time. These attendants are nice and charming people, they also serve as concierge and really go the extra mile to make you feel at home. The bell service has to be called and can take 5 minutes or so which is beyond what you would wait at a Leading Hotel of the World, but once more, for 250 Euros in Paris, this is outstanding. Bottom-line: I would stay here again without any questions. I found my new home in Paris.

The hotel was not full, so they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite. Also, we signed up as Melia frequent guest members and got our breakfast at half price. The upgraded room included free internet. Without the upgrade, the internet was 7 euro per hour--a price I thought was ridiculously high. The rooms were fine. I would not call them spacious, but they were not overly small either. There were no dressers and my friend and I both had to live out of our suitcases, unfortunately. The beds were rock hard, but we were so exhausted at the end of the day that we slept well anyway. The bathrooms look nice, but on close examination, the \"marble\" on the floor and walls was made of laminate. The rooms were very clean. I would rate the rooms a \"3\" star. This is what I expected, so I was fine with it. The breakfast was tasty and fresh. We just had the continental breakfast each day as the hot breakfast selections were limited and did not seem worth the extra cost. The cappuccinos were delicious!

I think it's important to realize when reading other reviews that what you are really paying for in this hotel is the location...because I agree that is was a little shabby for its 4 star designation. My experience with the customer service was mostly positive. I arrived very early in the morning since I flew direct from the East Coast of the US and yet I was promptly checked in and shown to my room since they had one available. I even let the guy convince me to upgrade to a Superior Room since I wanted constant internet access and it came for free at this level of room.

I didn't come to Paris to be able to relieve myself in a palace. Also, all commenters are right about the breakfast: it's good but horrifically overpriced considering the wealth of other options in the neighborhood. Another curious thing about the hotel is that most of the staff and many of the patrons when I was there were Spanish speaking...I'm not sure if this is because it's owned by a Spanish company or if it's just happenstance....certainly didn't bother me as the staff also spoke french and english...For spanish tourists or spanish speaking tourists, this would be a great place to stay.

Not in the last 5 years it hasn't! We booked and paid for a Superior Room but were told on arrival that there were no Superior rooms available.

We were told that breakfast would be 28E per person and I do remember from the first visit that breakfast was ok but certainly not worth well over \u00a350 for two!

We paid 250 Euros per night without breakfast thinking that the hotel would worth it. We arrived at the hotel late at night and as other people say, nobody came out to help us with the luggage. We thought something wasn't right from the very beginning. The reception area looks old but charming in a way, the lift was a minimal cage that nearly couldn't fit my partner and me with luggage. The carpets at the corridos were half gone and the whole hotel had the typical smell of a low backpacker. When we entered the room, I couldn't believe it. Dark, super small bed, very dirty and with terrible humidity spots wall paper. It was so dissapointing. We were hoping to spend 3 days in a beautiful hotel and that was much worse than some motels I've been. We didn't even wait to see the bathroom or open our luggage and we came down to reception to ask if that was a joke. The kind o teenager at reception told us the hotel was fully booked and could give us another room. We only stayed there because it was 1am and we didn't want to spend our honeymoon wondering around the streets. Next morning the manager called us to our room and said the hotel was being slowly renovated, but because it is an old historic building they needed special permits for that and it was all very expensive. He changed our room and gave us breakfast for free. The new room was very small, but at least it looked like we were in Paris, not in a road motel in deep Rusia. The bathroom was spotless and had loads of those silly toiletries. Breakfast was just ok and served in a cave at the cellar. I prefer natural light, but I have to recognize that for those with an interest in old historic buildings it had an atmosphere. The whole hotel had a special atmosphere really. The building is beautifull, but it really needs a complete renovation. The manager was nice with us, but the staff at reception wasn't very professional. They all looked more like students in practice. Our expectations very high on this hotel, because of what we had heard, so we were vey dissaponted when we got there. The location is perfect, and the hotel is quite cheap for a \"4 star\" in the center of Paris. But this shouldn't be a 4 star in my opinion and doesn't worth the money it costs.

It is on a quiet side street, but only 3 blocks from the St. Michel Metro station, which has connections to other subway lines and the RER, so you can take the train directly to and from Charles de Gaulle Airport (one-way fare was 25 euros for the three of us, versus at least 60 euros for a taxi). For breakfast (if you don't want to pay 25 euros per person in the hotel) a little grocery store and bakery with fresh croissants is only a block away behid the hotel. You can store food in the minibar refrigerator. I have had the best night's sleep in Europe at the Melia Colbert, both in 1999 and 2009. In fact, I still dream of sleeping at the Colbert, it's so wonderful!

At the Colbert, the shower is totally enclosed. The bathrooms also have a towel-warmer rack, which not only makes the towels nice and warm, it's also very handy for drying laundry! It can be hard finding a hotel in Paris that can accomodate 3 people in a room for a reasonable price, but the Colbert managed it for us in 1999 with a rollaway cot in a large double room, and in 2009 with a junior suite that had a bedroom and living room with a day bed on the fourth floor under the eaves. It was very cosy and charming, plus you can see the towers of Notre Dame out the window (and hear the bells)! The price at the Melia Colbert is $100-$200 higher per night than the large chain hotels on the wide, noisy Blvd. St. Germain, but it is quiet and tucked away, with genuine Parisian charm. Just pay the extra money and enjoy this wonderful hotel experience, it is well worth it.", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery Solid Hotel\u201d", "Author": "closetrat", "ReviewID": "UR45342008", "Content": "Very nice staff.

At the price of 300 Euros (U.S. $430 at the current exchange) for what was billed as a \u201csuperior\u201d room, especially, it was more than a disappointment: it was really, well, a ripoff. This is the only honest way to put it. Some of the specific things we found unacceptable and frankly distasteful include burned lampshades in the bar, threadbare carpets on the stairs and throughout the hotel. All the guest room and common area furniture was old, worn and the upholstery was often even dirty. The carpet in the breakfast room was absolutely filthy, and was worn down to threads even in the lobby and bar areas. The fabric and padding were entirely torn from the arm of an ornamented sofa in the lobby, and there was a huge tear in the rather dirty fabric. As for conditions in our room, we could not even read our tourist guides at night given the tiny lamps (and dust-covered bulbs) and resulting dim lighting. The wallpaper in our guest room was gouged in places and speckled with what looked like plaster patching stains. Our \"queen\" bed was really just two beds pushed together, but without the \"joiner,\" and there were literally two sets of linen so that my wife and I couldn't actually share the bed. Not exactly a romantic arrangement for a Paris holiday. The tiny, 19-inch TV\u2019s very presence was absurd for Anglos, as the hotel does not subscribe to any English-language programming, which I found incredible in a Paris hotel generally, and especially one patronized by lots of English and American visitors. It also contrasted notably with a friend\u2019s two-star hotel that included a flat-screen TV and BBC with CNN International programming. The bathroom looked nice, as other reviewers have noted, but was a disaster to use and the tub (with no shower curtain and hence a flooded room every morning and evening) was two feet off the floor, making it difficult and even unsafe to enter or exit. This hotel has a good location on the Left Bank, in the shadow of the Cathedral of Notre Dame. That is about the only positive aspect; except for one gentleman at the front desk, ironically of Spanish descent, the staff was not friendly or helpful. For example, we did not get our wakeup call the first morning, with no apology or explanation. The Colbert has no concierge, so we asked the haughty \u201cgentleman\u201d at the front desk to make two restaurant reservations, arrange a trip to Versailles, and arrange a dinner at one of the famous Paris \u201crevues\u201d Either he did nothing or didn\u2019t leave any note of it, as he was off the next day, requiring us to ask for all the same arrangements over again with the next person on duty. This hotel, remarkably, has a 4-star rating, but probably deserves a 2-star rating at best. It is reminiscent of many 2-star hotels I stayed in to save money when I was a student, 20 years before. It badly needs a major investment in furniture, carpet, wall coverings and general furnishings, and frankly a good cleaning and a management that cares. This one does not.

Make sure you ask the wonderful staff for recommendations on restaurants, but insist that you want the type of restaurant they go to, not tourist places.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPack some earplugs\u201d", "Author": "timffm", "ReviewID": "UR6809239", "Content": "The positives - v friendly staff, great location. However. This is a hotel done on the cheap. We went for a romantic break, which was ruined by a lack of sleep - we could hear the people in the next room talking (ie what they were saying), there are loud delivery lorries delivering to the front of the hotel at least twice a night, and the front door closing shook the whole room. We were even woken on the 1st morning by another couple \"getting to know each other\" intimately. This type of thing is fine in a cheap 2 star near Gare du Nord, but when you pay 4 star prices, I expect more - sleep is the most basic requisite of any hotel. Also, the bathroom was frankly shabby, and the decor over chinzy (but then you may like that) We made a mistake staying there, and regret it", "Date": "February 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chichester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c\"Perfection in every way!\"\u201d", "Author": "chillichesca", "ReviewID": "UR6805368", "Content": "My boyfriend and I decided to chose Paris as our little Valentines getaway. As always when trying to find a good hotel, the process took some months, owing to our very particular expectations. It felt like we were going round in circles until I came across the Hotel Le Colbert. This hotel was superb in every possible way. Here are a few reasons why: The Location: Situated a stones throw from Notre Dame and the river. The delightful streets surrounding the hotel are dotted with quaint book shops and informal, friendly cafes. The architecture in this area is perfectly Parisian. Saint Michel metro stop is a 5 minute walk along the river with excellent links to the Gard Du Nord. It is also very worth taking the reasonably priced 'hop on hop off' boat service that will stop off at attractions along the river banks such as the Lourve, Musee d'orsay and the Eiffel Tower, as well as Notre Dame. The Hotel: The website pictures of this hotel made it look very romantic and charming. When we arrived, in the grey drizzle, the hotel looked even better. Spotlessly clean and well manicured. Checking in at reception went like a dream with the staff geniunely wishing you a pleasent stay, with no quams about helping out with any enquiries or issues you may have. In most 4* hotels, the staff have to offer friendly and proffesional service, but at the Colbert, you really felt like they mean it. We booked a superior room due to the very good prices found on their website. The room was truly lovely with decadent furnishings, a genenrous wardrobe and superb bathroom. The bathrobes were a great touch, as was the extensive literature on what to do in Paris. Everything from the comfort of the bed to the water pressure in the shower was spot on. The rooms were cleaned and tidied to a very high standard each day. The bar cum reception room off the lobby was so cosy. Plush furniture and typically french decor ensured an authentic afternoon or early evening drink. We opted not to take breakfast in favour of sampling the local cafes and patisseries. However, we had a sneaky peek at the adorable cellar based breakfast room and it would certainly be a great way to start your day! In a nut shell, this hotel was thoroughly enjoybale, and we both feel almost priviledged to have found and stayed in it. You will not find a better stay in this wonderful city! Little Tips: - EAT: Le Petit Chatelet. We had a little moment trying to get up the nerve to enter this sweet little restaurant just 2 mins from our hotel. But it was Valentines and we wanted something a little special. Once inside we were glad to have taken the plunge. The atmosphere was cosey, friendly and the food was a faultless, melt-in-the-mouth treat! Although a few euros more expensive then the surrounding touristy establishments (the clientelle was in the majority french and had booked in advance, we felt a good sign!), we would have paid double and although we were lucky to get squeezed in, it was well worth the effort to discover this little gem. We can't recommend this place enough. We hope you take the plunge! (They speak good english if you get stuck with the gorgeous and extensive menu of delights!) Starters 8-12 euros, Mains 13 - 25 euros, Drinks around 14 euros for a caraffe of wine. - NIGHTLIFE: Lively - Georges Bar. A funky little club cum bar with a young clientelle although so varied that anyone would blend in just fine and be up dancing in no time! This place is situated down the backstreets of Saint Michel and is great for an early evening cocktail (happy hour is from 5-9pm!) or a great after-meal wind down. Cocktails 11 euros Quirky and Unforgettable- La Caveau de la Hauchette (Jazz Club) Just opposite Georges Bar this club is amazing. One of the last original Jazz Clubs anywhere, for 11 euros during the week you are treated to the best in up-beat jazz from a live guest band. The atmosphere is so informal and friendly you don't want to leave. We had much fun watching over 10 couples strutting their jazzy stuff with huge smiles. It seemed to us this realy was a place for anyone to come let their hair-down and really indulge their love of jazz. So realaxing and unique we can't recommend this bar highly enough. So please visit while it stills remains so perfect!

The kingsize bedroom was spacious with plenty of closet space and the bathroom was clad in beautiful reddish marble. The public areas were elegant and inviting and would have been the place to entertain our friends if we were in a standard room. Breakfast would make either an American or European visitor happy...eggs, bacon, traditional french pastries and bread, fresh fruit and delicious coffee.

I had prepared myself to have low expectations of the hotel because I've heard horror stories about European hotels but I found my expectations weren't low enough. Just to name a few of the problems we had: 1) we had to wait 25 minutes in the lobby to be checked in b/c the hotel reception was on the phone with other hotels trying to find a room for a couple whose reservations got screwed up (we finally got fed up and put our foot down and demanded we be checked in immediately) 2) the air conditioning broke.. TWICE and it was about 90 degreed outside!! 3) we found a condom wrapper left in our room next to the bed which the maid miraculously missed the entire 4 days we were there 4) the maid never picked up our champagne and glasses that we were obviously finished with as the ice had all melted and the champange had gone flat 5) there was construction going on in the hotel so it was very loud 6) there was a foul odor in the hotel lobby/hall area (never figured out what it was... smelled like sewage??) 7) the reception was very unsympathetic and lame when it came to reponding to our needs regarding broken air conditioning and heat. 8) we think the maid took one of our hotel keys as we left one in the hotel room in the morning and when we came back it was gone. Overall, this place is a MESS. The people working there are young and inexperienced. I'm very sorry we spent so much for such an awful hotel.

The location is amazing - very close to Notre Dame. I got the room for ~US$230/night on lastminute, and given where the Euro is these days that is a good price for a nice hotel in Paris! I would not pay the rack rate of Euro 400-500/ night - that is too much. But for US$200-250, this is a nice hotel. The rooms are small by American standards, medium by Parisian standards. We were in room #28, which was bright and sunny with two big windows. Some of the rooms were darker because they only had one window, FYI. The decor is classic French, done in tasteful French blue and white. The bathrooms are all red-brown marble, and have nice amenities like a heated towel rack and a powerful hairdryer. Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper, as there is noise from loud pedestrians and garbage trucks in the AM - this is a problem in almost any small Parisian hotel. Please note that the 4th floor is the non-smooking floor, and you need to request a non-smoking room in advance if this is important to you. Be sure to call the hotel directly during the daytime in Paris to make this request. I called and got the night clerk, who told me the request was in the system and would be taken care of. When I got to the hotel, I was told there was no record of this request. When I told them I called and spoke to the night clerk, I got rolled eyes, and was told that he is not reliable, and that I need to call during the day next time. The staff at the front desk were very capable, and spoke good English. They got us into a smoking room that did not smell too bad, so we were fine in the end. The breakfast at the hotel is ridiculously overpriced. Instead, get fruit, yogurt, etc. at the gorcery stores nearby, and pasteries at one of the bakeries. Or for the same amount you would be charged at the hotel go to Laduree for an amazing breakfast in a beautiful tea shop instead (Laduree is on rue Bonoparte in the 6th). Don't miss the macaroons here. Also, we bought huge 1.5L waters at the grocery store for Euro 0.50, much better deal than the minibar! For dinner, try Altilier Matrie Albert, a more casual Guy Savoy restaurant a few streets over. Book in advance. They serve roast chicken (the house specialty) and other roasted/grilled stuff. Delicious! The decor is dark, with a huge fireplace at one end. Perfect in the wintertime for a cozy, romantic meal.
