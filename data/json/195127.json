{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Pension 45 - A Grim Hovel If you want a night's sleep in this hotel, make sure to get blind drunk. Otherwise, either the noise in the street will keep you awake, or the owner's dog, barking all night in reception, will do the trick.Don't complain to the proprietor about his dog though, unless you can converse in fluent Spanish. He won't speak a word of English to you, and even the normal courtesies are not high on his agenda. He demanded a euro from me for calling a taxi, which I know is not a lot, but indicates the contempt this establishment has for its customers.If you want a shower, buy your own towel. The handkerchief-sized specimens supplied wouldn't dry a small mouse. Oh, and watch out for the shower head. It's inclined to fall off the wall without warning. Never was the expression dirt cheap more appropriate.Can I think of any positive points?Yes. You can always check out of this hotel and go somewhere decent.", "Date": "Oct 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR261344444", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BockTheRobber"}, {"Content": "La cucaracha, la cucaracha... ya no puede caminar! Excellent location! BUT... my nephew stayed in a room infested with cockroaches. They were everywhere... on the floor, on the walls, and even in the closet. The room I stayed in was very very noisy. The balcony doors did not close all the way so you could hear the crowded street right below. The walls were so thin that we could here everything from the reception area to the people in the rooms nearby. The third room we reserved was the best room because it was on the other side of the building and not that many people were in the rooms on that side. This also happened to be the room without the bathroom. Without a doubt, the only reason that people stay at this hostel is because of it's location.", "Date": "May 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR421841117", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "catuxa66"}, {"Content": "Not so bad We stayed here for 3 nights,besides the bad reviews we read about this hostel, there was nowhere else to book so cheaper, near the city center and with a private bathroom.Positive aspects: great location(2 minutes from Plaza de Catalunia), price, very quiet (the street is traffic free), the room was clean and the towels changed every day.Negative aspects: the staff is not very friendly and the rooms are only to sleep, there's no tv ou telephone.

I'm an italian girl and I was in Barcellona this summer for the first time with a friend of mine.I arrived in Barcellona just with my baggage and without reservation. I looked for a room and I was in a lot of hostels but finally I chosed one: Pension 45, the best I found in Barcellona!It is located in a strategical place: you can reach rambla in just 2 minutes by walking and plaza catalunya in maybe 3 minutes.The hostel is very clean and at the price of 25euro for person in a double you have included breakfast too (Abdel prepare a wonderful napoletan coff\u732b!) until 12 in the morning. The most important aspect as regard as the hostel is its staff: the receptionist man is the best of all the world: friendly, fanny, and very serious!I will never forget barcelona, pension 45 and the staff of the pension of course.Thank you A.

Tallers, 45 in the El Raval section of Barcelona, a longish block away from La Rambla (next to Hosteria Grau). They have 24-hr reception and a mix of small, private double/twin rooms, some with bath and others with a sink. The location is terrific, off the Ramblas so you don't have all the street noise (Tallers is a pedestrian lane), but close enough so you can get to the action in a 5-minute walk. The price is right too: we paid 45 euro for a double with bath, and 27 euro for a single-occupancy twin (they didn't have triples for us). The staff was really nice to us--we arrived too early for our rooms after taking an overnight bus from Bilbao, but they let us take showers in the shared bathrooms. They make you prepay for the night, and speak mostly Spanish (but are really friendly even if you don't). There is free coffee/tea in the TV lounge.
