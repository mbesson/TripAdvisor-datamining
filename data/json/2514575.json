I haven't been to NY before, so i took the opportunity to extend my stay for a 4 days long weekend. Since i was travelling with 3 other people, we were all on a tight budget but also needed somewhere safe, clean and convenient. Despite my other friend's discouragement on the location, i booked 3 nights at Sylan Guest house anyway. Julio, own of the apartment was super nice, we arrived 7am friday morning and Julio geneously let us check in early. We checked in at around 8am and were able to have a quick nap and wash up. Subway station was 2 mins away, just around the cornor and train ride to downtown takes around 20-30min. I didn't find the area to be dangerous as described by my other friends, i felt safe walking from subway to the apartment at 1-2am at night.. In general, the place is good, if you don't mind a little bit of commute back and forth, we ended up paying less then those downtown shall hotel sharing bathroom with dozens of strangers on the floor...", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cToo far from the heart of New York\u201d", "Author": "koalaEGG", "ReviewID": "UR45716288", "Content": "The main issue we have with this place is that it's not a motel / hotel set up - it's run by private owners and basically there are only 3 rooms spread throughout the terrace (not the entire terrace like what we thought was the case). Problem with that is there's no internet or phone facilties which is a real nightmare when it comes to travellers. no doubt the owners will be more than happy to help when we ask for assistance but when you are out early and back late it's not convenient to knock on their doors when you need to book that train /bus tickets late at night. Location is too far from heart of new york. While i wouldn't say it's dangerous, it's a silent brisk walk back from the train station each night and a sigh of relief when we finally get into the room. It's a 20 min train (at least) to Times Sq as it's on a non-express train. Personally i think it's a waste of time travelling up and down each day esp when you are a tourist. With this in mind the price is rather steep for such a neighbourhood. Rooms and facilities are still ok - but of course sans housekeeping so you will be better off getting a lower class hotel in the city with about the same price. Bear in mind also their cancellation policy. overall i think it's not too bad but just not my cup of tea and definitely not deserving of the reviews/ranking it has so far. i don't mind staying here if i am on a working stint but not as a tourist strap for time and needing the basic internet.", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "detje", "Title": "\u201ca perfect place to stay\u201d", "Author": "detje", "ReviewID": "UR36776649", "Content": "It was a very nice and peaceful place to stay.

We never felt unsafe at any moment, we came back late in the evening, walked through the neighbourhood, did our shopping and had nice contacts with the people.
