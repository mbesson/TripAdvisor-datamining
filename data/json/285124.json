This is NO WAY a four star establishment. We stopped here for 3 nights as part of a group tour and the sentiment I'm about to express was shared by all 36 members of the party. The place is nothing but a facade. It looks like it has undergone considerable upgrading recently - ultra-swish and modern reception area complete with piano, and rooms which are eye-wateringly contemporary yet sadly lacking in anything remotely practical. There was nowhere to put clothes - no drawers, no wardrobe, only 4 coathangers for 2 people. The air-con was incomprehensible and didn't work. The achingly modern bathroom looked impressive but the overhead 'rain' shower unfortunately didn't rain, but rather piddled, and you had to run round under it to get wet. It was clean, though. The money spent on the renovations however, must have run out by the time it got to the staff. They were indifferent to the point of being rude and ignorant. Mealtimes were nothing but a joke. The food itself was barely edible. The breakfast consisted of the previous evening's stale rolls, plastic cheese, dodgy ham, questionable juice (powder and water?) and machine-generated tea and coffee. Our substandard evening meals were brought to our tables on metal trollies - giving the impression we were in some sort of work canteen. Plates were thrust at the table by a miserable woman in jeans who looked liked she had been dragged in off the street to help out against her will. The mystery continued outside - what looked like was once a considerably-sized pool, was just a sea of green turf with an odd tiled platform poking out which may have housed a diving board in a previous life. The one redeeming feature of the hotel was its proximity to Venice Mestre train station, which was very handy. It would be ok for an overnight stopover for a businessman/woman with minimal luggage but for anyone considering it as holiday accommodation, look elsewhere!", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cUnpleasant staff, no room service!

They have clearly spent a great deal of money making it look nice, and providing some interesting technology with way in which room doors are opened. Upon arrival, however, they did not greet us (not even a 'hello!) or say welcome, they asked for our passports and gave us our room card, but did not explain hwo it works, assuming we are meant to understand that we must flash the card in front of a panel on the wall next to the door? I do not regard myself as technologically backwards, but I was both impressed at the innovation and unimpressed at their failing to tell us the smallest detail. We could not work out how the controls for the air conditioning/heating were set, as it was -4C outside and the air was coming out cold. When we asked at reception the response was 'it IS winter, sir'... And that's why I have to be cold? because it's winter? The first night we were very tired and decided to have room service, only to be told that there was not any, and we had to come downstairs to have a coffee... from a machine!! in ITALY!! c'mon! The breakfast... best not to get into details... consisted of boiled eggs, some questionable bits of meat, and cheese slices in their plastic laid out on trays, plus the abovementioned coffee from a machine. I have since then reported we left a pair of trousers in the room, which we know we did, as we realised upon exit but didn't have time to collect due to our plane leaving. After 2 attempts finally they confirmed they had them, and asked me for my address details. That was 2 weeks ago. I have since written to them 3 times asking them for confirmation and they have not responded, so I am treating this as theft, and I have let them know as much... Still no answer... begs the questions, why a 4* hotel?!", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cOK hotel but ...\u201d", "Author": "Jensen63", "ReviewID": "UR118079142", "Content": "Close to bus/train to Venice and reasonable prices.

Upon entering the room, was so clean with brand new bedsheets which were changed daily. New towels given everyday. Room had AC which could be kept on all day/night which was great due to the heat (34 degrees). There was a small mini fridge which kept the food fresh (tv in italian) but was ok as i understand. Water in the shower stayed constantly hot unlike many other places i have stayed. Breakfast was also included (not amazing but no where near bad) had a lot of variety even if you are vegetarian and was actually tasty,especially the croissants. The bus link was excellent, bascially outside the hotel door, and straight into venice centre foe less than 1.50 ! The same for the journey back, it dropped you outside the hotel door. This was very important to me the bus link, buses ran till midnight and then also a night time bus. If you travel to venice marco polo best to get the (ALTO) bus which is 5euros one way, to venice mestre train station, turn left, and walk to train station, which is 2 min walk, from there go under into the station, down some steps and walk on, and when you walk out the other side of the train tunnel, there is the hotel basically in front of you. no need to take taxi to the hotel as you can walk there within 5 minutes. The same way to go back to the airport. Downside, swimming pool was not working , had work done to it which was not said and the toilet is beautifully modern but there is a small strip on the window to protet the toilet which means people can see you in the room. but thats the only downside.

So, we were in southern Austria and decided due to lack of snow to head to Venice for two days.

They said the rooms would be tight if we had the kids in the room and sheesh were they right. The beds, all four, were tiny singles unfit for a 6' 2\" adult like me. They are under renovation but put us far from the construction which was a plus. The lobby is clean but unbelievably tacky. One of the buildings in the photos is no longer there, thus my amusement. The staff was multi-lingual and helpful and the breakfast staff was top-notch, though the food was just \"good\".
