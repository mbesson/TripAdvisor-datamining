If it wasn't for the fact that I went to London only for three days [November 2002], I would have taken my stuff and moved to another hotel. Justification: 1/ the worst of all - I booked the room via Internet and received no acceptance for two days, so called them again asking for any feedback - they said that my room was booked and that everything was ok. Mind you, I particularly wanted a single en suite. When I came to the hotel, the reception desk was closed although they knew the time of my arrival. Then a little boy came out and said that I was to take the room at Cedar Hotel, which was a part of Annexe. I went there and they told me that the room is ready; however, it was a double room with a sink, not the suite I booked. 2/ the room was quite shabby and the window did not close [thank god it was warm] 3/ the staff was very unfriendly 4/ the other guests were mostly youths from different countries - so I guess if you want to party, you may have a try, but otherwise don't.", "Date": "February 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cGood place for location and price\u201d", "Author": "oilslick", "ReviewID": "UR6640199", "Content": "My boyfriend and I originally booked at the Cedar Guest House through its web site for January 5-8 2007, but it turns out all the small hotels on this street are actually connected. Upon arrival, we were transferred to the Annexe Hotel. We had an ensuite double room. The room was tiny, the decor was ugly, and there wasn't any kind of customer service. But it was clean enough (not sparkling though) - as in there weren't bed bugs or any other creatures, breakfast was provided (although we didnt take advantage of this), we got it at an excellent price (40 pounds/night), and the location was close to public transportation and popular tourist sites (right off of Victoria Station).

We were greeted by a voice on the intercom who asked us our names, on answering his question we were then told that our room had been taken as we had given him the wrong credit card details and there were no available rooms left for the evening. Fortunately, as i had read some bad reveiws about this hotel and the way it conducts buisness, i had on my person the reservation details that i had printed from the internet. these had all my credit card details on them and woe and behold they were correct. He then proceded to try and tell me that he had tried to email me to let me know. which also happened to be a blatant lie. We had phoned twice to confirm our reservation and were twice told everything was fine. We then had a confrontation with him out the front of his hotel and were then told he had another hotel around the corner that we could stay at . what a shambles that hotel turned out to be. all in all our experience with the hotel annexe got our holiday of to a bad start and if this can stop other travellers from going through the same rubbish we had to then job done.", "Date": "November 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWell worth the money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4314731", "Content": "The hotel is just okay but for the price it is well worth it.

When we finally got inside to the reception desk we were told that the Hotel had cancelled our reservation and had informed us of this via email and telephone. This was far from being true, as we were never informed of this. So after being told of this we simply asked for another room, no problem the sign hanging up said Rooms Available. The nice man behind the reception said this was not possible because they were holding this for other customers.(at 23:00???) Anyways finally we left, what can you do if they say they cancelled our reservation without informing us. We proceeded to the Comfort Inn around the corner where they told us that people were turned away constantly from Annexe Hotel with the same problem.... \u00c2\u00a8thanks Annexe Hotel for a great London stay\u00c2\u00a8", "Date": "December 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBad! will not stay again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3315406", "Content": "the room is small with bad smell, even though i booked the ensuit room but actually i have not take bath in the bathroom as it make me feeling not well. the price is not expensive but next time, it is better pay a little more to other B&B rather than stay in here.", "Date": "March 31, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Annexe Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d313038-Reviews-Annexe_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$71 - $206*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">34 Hugh Street, Victoria</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW1V 1RP</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "313038", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8d/9e/8d9e598138a7bab80ce7e86b155fcce31large.jpg"}}
