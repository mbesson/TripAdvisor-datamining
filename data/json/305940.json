Only bad thing was that I was given a room right next to the elevator so it was pretty noisy. However, I was very happy with my room - it wasn't as outdated as I had expected - there was an ipod speaker/charger on my nightstand, and the wifi connection was great. The room felt surprisingly spacious and I was a fan of the bed (as mentioned in previous reviews, the mattresses are hard). Also had dim sum at Golden Valley (the one-star Michelin restaurant on the first floor) and it was very good although a bit on the pricey side. As for the location of the hotel, it's very ideal. The Emperor Hotel offers a free shuttle bus every hour or so that takes you to some of the key places on the island (times square, lee gardens, IFC, etc.) You can also walk a couple blocks down and catch the tram that runs on the main road for 2.30HKD. Additionally, there's a public shuttle bus that stops right next to the hotel that can take you to Causeway/Times Square. That runs more frequently than the hotel shuttle. All in all, if you can put up with a little noise and a hard mattress, this is a great place to stay.

Communication with the hotel by email prior to arrival was answered promptly and efficiently and all requests I made were attended to. We arrived very early in the morning from an overnight flight and were able to store our bags while we went off for the day. On return, the receptionist was very polite and handled everything efficiently. We were upgraded to an Executive room which was a welcome suprise. The room was very clean, spacious and had everything we neededed. There was not much of a view other than other apartment blocks, some of which were so close you could actually see people cooking, however we were there only really to sleep anyway. The beds were the hard Chinese variety but that seems to pretty much the norm in hotels in Hong Kong that are not Western Chain owned. There was free internet which worked very well. Breakfast was included in our rate and whilst the restaurant was very small, the selection was good and the staff pleasant and efficient. Location wise, it is in a mainly residential area, close to the racecourse, there is a 24 hour Mcdonalds which is walkable, and a supermarket and other shops close by. There is a tram to North Point, Causeway Bay and most of Hong Kong Island just five minutes away, otherwise taxis are plentiful and we never had to wait more than a few minutes to find one. Just make sure you keep the hotel key card with you to show the taxi driver as not all of them speak English and it can be challenging to get them to understand where you want to go. There is a free hotel shuttle bus which takes you to Times Square Mall in Causeway Bay, we found this very useful.

Walk to the race track. Paid the same to stay at the butterfly boutique hotel on Morrison rd. butterfly is way more modern, chic and cool and closer to causeway bay.

We haven't had a lot of time to stay and evaluate the hotel basically because we were all around hong kong during the days and too tired to do anything in the hotel when we get back but sleep. So here goes my review: PROS. 1. Staff were very helpful, initially we had problem with our payment because our credit card was expired and we can only withdraw a certain maximum amount of HKD per day on the ATM. ( I think it was only 3,000+ HKD/day and we need cash to shop, eat and do sight seeing!) and there's no bank open cos it was the holidays! They agreed that we will pay on a per day basis until banks were open. 2. Location is very accessible, however if you were to ride a taxi and you don't speak chinese, make sure to bring with you the hotel's calling card and they will know exactly where to drop you ( you can get this upon arrival in the airport at the hotel assistance desk). near to mini bus stop #30C which will only take you to about 5-10 minutes to causebay station/times square. 3. Room and CR was clean and average in size. 4. They have a FREE shuttle bus service. however, it is with schedule so we chose to ride the mini bus for the experience and also convenience of our own time. CONS. 1. We arrived about 3am on our 3rd night because we went to Macau, and the front desk was being rude when we ask him about our bill and all that. (maybe because we woke him up at 3am! but it is his job.) He was the only rude and male staff in the front desk.. That was the only con thing I have to say.

When told he immediately fished out an adaptor from his pocket and handed it to me I asked if I should return it to reception at the end of my stay. I asked if he needed my room number. He flashed a huge smile and told me (in Cantonese) to just leave it in the room. How tremendously seamless and hassle-free. Wow! I asked for directions for the different destinations. The reception staff took pains to show me the way with map and all. I asked how to get to a particular Michelin star restaurant. Unfazed, they photocopied a map which was shown on a newpaper write-up on the outlet. This is all the more amazing as they have their own Michelin star restaurant (Golden Valley - must try the titilating experience) on the 2nd floor of the hotel! Yahoo!

They have a shuttle bus which takes you to Times Square, however it's not expensive to take a taxi (ca.20 HKD). It has a very good chinese resturant on the 1st floor. It's always crowded with locals (a good sign for good food). We are certain to return to this hotel.

It was a long way from the airport and not ideally situated for a one night stopover. However the rooms were good and clean. A little small and the beds were hard but this is apparently normal in Hong Kong. We took the airport express to Hong Kong Central and then the MTR to Causeway Bay and then a taxis to the hotel. On the return the hotel provides a free shuttle to Hong Kong Central which has a Cathay Pacific check in desk, which was great for getting rid of suitcases to allow for stress free site seeing. Although the hotel was not convenient for us it would be great for going to see the Horse racing as it was walking distance to the race track. The staff were all polite and the Hotel was very nice.", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Emperor Happy Valley Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d305940-Reviews-The_Emperor_Happy_Valley_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$97 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.1 Wang Tak Street, Happy Valley</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "305940", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7b/bf/7bbfbb3373dd9433af81c82395901eeb5large.jpg"}}
