Admittedly, it is not in the most famous areas but actually the location is a plus. At Plaza Universidad in the Del Valle area it is a nice and relatively safe location. The hotel itself is really worth the money. I had a very attractive weekend deal at an average per night way under 100 US$ which included breakfast and reduction vouchers for SixFlags (not that I needed that, but may be nice to know for families). I had a Junior Suite, which is great and I can recommend it. Very spacious, very clean, a good bed, a separate sitting area, a separate and generous working desk, lighting almost everywhere, a safety locker that actually works, a very spacious bathroom area with a great jacuzzi. It takes a second to find out how to fill it (close the two airvalves first, and open them later on after the water is above the outlet points). The breakfast restaurant serves local food and also continental and lots of choices. If there was a minus, it was the coffee, but I am maybe too demanding on that point. Anyway, next time I will stay there again.", "Date": "Apr 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR653998361", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d185403-r5417281-Royal_Plaza-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "185403", "Price": "$99"}}
