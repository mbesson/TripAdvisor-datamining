Highfield Hotel offers you the experience of traveling in a third world country (without the ordeal of going through customs) at familiar first world prices.

My prime consideration was price - the airfare has already made me run out of my trip budget. The hotel is situated in quite nice district of Sydney. I think it is especially nice place during summer when all the trees around are green. But anyway - many small eateries around, nice building and flights of parrots. You can catch subway to go to the center or walk (40-50 minutes walk to the Circular Quays) First, what I liked about the hotel. It is very clean, common shower and WC are just perfect. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The owners are swedes, that is why many nordic tourists are staying here. What I did not like. It was awfully cold. The room does not have heating and has ventilation holes straight to the outside (at +5-7C/41-45F night temperature in Jul). The only way to heat the rooms is to use some small heating fan. But it automatically stops after 5 minutes of working. So, the first night when I did not have suplementary blankets I was getting up each 30-40 minutes to heat the room. Afterwards they showed me a wardrobe with blankets, I took 3 and was more less fine. You can imagine that having shower at such temperature was not great pleasure too. Another problem, much more minor, was that there were small construction works in the garden under my windows, but I'm sure they are finished by now. So my conclusion: nice place to stay when it is not too cold or if you are used to it (as probably these nordic guys are). Small note: there is a nice food cart in 5 min walk: just descend to Woolloomooloo bay.
