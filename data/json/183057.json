The room service menu was impressive and there was a good selection of information. Location for us was perfect with many great eateries and bars around. They have a good laundry room which I utilised to clean nearly 3 weeks of dirties from Cuba for $7. Imagine what this would have cost if using standard hotel cleaning services. During the 1 hour dry cycle I did a lightning zip tour up the CN Tower-wow! Ryan at the front desk helped me with this, he was very helpful. later that night Joan was helpful in recommending a good bar nearby, the King Edward (Eddie to the locals). Later we returned to the Suites and dropped in to the Portico bar for a drink which is very comfortable and has nice lighting. The bartender Richard and his helper Cheryl were lovely and great to chat with. We met a couple of regular residents and stayed up far too late and paid for this the next morning.

The biggest negative was the bathroom. It is very dated and the shower has mould in the door area and the grout is stained. Flooring in bathroom has cracked tiles. Not appealing at all and would be the main reason for not staying here again. Also, the bathroom lighting is annoying as both the toilet area and sink areas lighting turn on at the same time and if some one goes to the toilet in the middle of the night, the door opens directly into the bedroom and the lighting is disturbingly bright. Also, the sink area stone counter has water stains that give the area an unclean appearance. At least I am assuming they were permanent stains. Beds are very comfortable. We travel a lot, and not having courtesy bottles of water looks cheap and is inconvenient. I will not pay $5 for a bottle of water. Giving bottles of water daily is so cheap to do and is appreciated by the customer, why not do it--it is the small things like this that distinguish an ok hotel from a very good hotel. Another nice touch we found in New Zealand, was fresh milk provided for coffee. Here you get the long life type and it is just not as good. With a fridge in the room already, this would be a nice touch. The main room was quite nice. A bit dull in decor but certainly fine. But that said, the room was not adequately lit. We found it quite dark. Service was adequate, but at better hotels, the service is friendlier. The front desk staff were fine, aside from some misinformation we received about the \"PATH\", but they did not go out of their way for the quests. I have stayed in one hotel, that within a few minutes, the staff were greeting us by our names and even knew our room number. We were here for four nights and I doubt staff recognized us at all and certainly never asked us if our room was satisfactory. They just don't make an effort to notice, greet and welcome customers. That said, when we were looking for some milk for coffee, the bar was very nice about giving us some to take to our room. The amenities are fine in the bathroom, but I would like to see the soap placed in the bathroom. Coffee was not great and of course, I mentioned the lack of fresh milk. Also, only one green tea and one regular tea was provided. What if both guests like the same kind of tea? We had to ask for some regular tea so that the two of us could each have a cup.

For a longer stay, it is hard to beat the Cambridge Suites. To begin with, you have a suite with a separate bedroom and living area, making it feel much more like a small apartment. There is a mini fridge and microwave if you want to do some in-room dining. One of the best features, particularly if you are travelling with someone, is the separation of the toilet and tub/shower from the sink/dressing area. Two of us were able to get ready for meetings in the morning in much less time than it would normally take. The bed(s) were very comfortable, there was plenty of storage, and while the rooms are a little tired, they are clean and quiet, even when you are right across from the elevators. The lobby is elegant and quiet (for anyone who has stayed at the Delta Chelsea as often as I have, you will understand what a blessing this really is), and the service was friendly and prompt. The cityscape suite came with included Wifi, although you have to get a code from the operator to use it. It also came with a really good continental breakfast in Portico. There were a couple of hot choices (scrambled eggs and oatmeal) and the usual fruit, bagels, toast, juices, and hot beverages. The cityscape suite is not a lot different in layout than the deluxe suite, although you do get more space, a little foyer with table, and a nicer dining area. There are also upgraded amenities, and those along with breakfast are enough to make it worth upgrading if you can. This hotel is really well located for both downtown business meetings and for shopping. There are lots of good restaurants nearby, and as long as you don't mind being locked out occasionally (always take a coat with you), you will generally have good access to the PATH network. The only problem is the building across the driveway from the hotel (which is the access point for the PATH) closes on Sundays and evenings with no warning, which means you may find yourself having to come back outside with no warning.

Given we planned to barely be in the room, we decided to share the room - there was a king bedroom and a pull our sofa. Although happy about saving money, I did worry that upon arrival it would possibly be too small - regardless, I booked it. The hotel is very central, near shopping, restaurants, etc. The staff was friendly, the lobby welcoming. Our room was on the 12th floor, with basically just a view of an office building. However, it was very bright which was nice, as both the main room (where the sofa bed was) along with the king bedroom both had large windows. The bathroom toiletries were all eco which I very much appreciated. Internet was $12 per day so we passed, although they did say the business centre floor had free internet usage (possibly not for standard rooms; I can't remember, but for a king suite it was free). We had great sleeps, and the hotel really wasn't noisy at all. However, our room was on a corner which I am sure helped. The room was nice and fairly modern, and one thing I liked was that the sofa bed blanket was a nice white modern duvet, vs those ugly hotel blankets you usually get. The hotel bar was a bit dated, and the bathroom was wheelchair friendly so felt a bit odd with push up handles near the toilet, and roll in access for the shower, etc but happy they have that for those who need it. Overall we had a great stay, and for the price, I would definitely return. I couldn't believe how expensive Toronto hotels are, and this was one of the few that was nice, central and affordable.

The vanity area is a woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream, providing lots of room to get ready for a day out on the town. I wish I had that kind of vanity in my home. Cambridge Suites Hotel Upon turn down request the maid brings up 2 bottles of water, chocolate and pulls the curtains shut. This is a really nice touch.

Traveling with my wife and young daughter. First, the good: Front desk staff was very friendly. Self-parking with in-out privileges was reasonably priced. Our room was a two doubles room on the 21st floor, across from the elevator. The room was fairly well insulated, as we heard very few sounds from the corridor. The room itself was decent size, with a bedroom separated by french doors, kitchenette, and bath with sink area separate from toilet/bath. We liked the large safe provided in the bathroom (unique to Cityscape suites), which was plenty large enough to put in our netbook bag, my wife's purse, and our portable DVD player, which we didn't need because the bedroom had its own player provided. High speed internet (provided free in the cityscape suite) was fast and easy to use with the code obtained from the desk. The Keurig coffee maker in the room was a nice bonus. View was not bad, esp. given that we were wedged between a few large buildings (the view from the 22nd floor fitness center is even better). Shower had good temperature and water pressure. The towels offered were the largest I've ever seen -- very comfy! Included breakfast was adequate, if uninspiring. Cereal, muffins, bagels, yogurt, cheese, fruit -- standard fare. Hotel is in a great location, walking distance to Eaton Center and connected to the Path via the parking garage. The cons: The parking garage is very compact. The spaces are narrow, there isn't a lot of room to get in and out of the spaces, and the entrance & exit is very tight. Upon returning to the garage one day, someone parked in front of a sign that clearly said \"NO PARKING AT ANY TIME\", essentially cutting off the proper angle for entering the garage, causing us to scrape our fender on the guard on the way in. After a few days of the exact same menu, the breakfast was, frankly, boring. The hotel would do well to mix up the offerings a little. As for the room itself, a few simple things stood out. First, almost all of the doors stuck. The two french doors leading into the bedroom didn't match (the windows on one were longer than the other). Also, the bedroom was a bit cramped with two doubles; almost wished we had booked a king and shared with our daughter. Tile on the bathroom floor was scuffed, and the tub itself was very obviously patched. The furniture in the lounge area was a little too big -- we couldn't get the refrigerator door open fully because of the large round end-table. About half of the refrigerator space is taken up by minibar items, which reduces its usefulness. We also had one day where we left our room by 9:30am and didn't return until after 4, and yet the room hadn't been cleaned. The front desk explained that it is not uncommon for room cleaning to take until 5:30pm (maybe because checkout time is so late -- 1pm?) None of the above interfered with our stay, but just stood out as odd, or perhaps a lack of attention to detail. Speaking of lack of attention to detail, we encountered a VERY serious oversight on the part of housekeeping when turning over our room from the previous guests. Fortunately, the front desk staff was as shocked as we were, and the head of housekeeping personally came up to correct the problem and further inspect our suite. Upon returning to our room that night, there was a very kind note and a small gift from the assistant manager apologizing for the incident. We felt this was VERY appropriately handled by the hotel staff -- not too flippant, not too excessive. Well done! All in all, despite its flaws, we had a very good stay, and enjoyed the location very much. I would definitely return to Cambridge Suites the next time I am in Toronto, and I would recommend it to others.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cU Can't Beat this Hotel for Price and Value\u201d", "Author": "ILUVFOOD", "ReviewID": "UR118673925", "Content": "We felt this was an amazing value for Toronto.

The fan speed adjusted by itself to regulate the temperature, but also did not shut down completely, so the white noise level was quite consistent. So many other hotels have noisy systems that wake up the kids as they cycle on and off overnight. This made a big difference in allowing all 4 of us to sleep soundly in our respective rooms. + The king bed in the bedroom was excellent, being firm but with a soft layer on top. We didn't sink toward the middle at all. The pillows were allergen-free, another rare find (I have severe dust allergies), and were supportive at the neck while still allowing the head to sink ergonomically down. + All surfaces had been wiped clean, which is quite unusual. Usually, there is some stickiness or greasiness . . . somewhere. + The layout allowed us to put our boys to bed in the living room, while enjoying some quiet evening time in the bedroom afterward The bathroom could be entered directly from the bedroom or the living room, so we didn't have to walk through and wake them up every time we needed the bathroom. + The fitness room on the top floor has a sauna, beautiful whirlpool, recumbent bike, treadmill, free weights, and exercise balls. + The location was an easy walking distance for small children from the TTC subway, several street car lines, Union Station, and St. Lawrence Market.

A nice touch - the bathroom is equipped with assist bars and the barrier at the bottom of the large stall shower can be removed for wheelchair access. Our quibbles about the room itself are minor. For a fairly new place, some of the cabinetry seems cheap and is already showing wear; the bedroom and closet doors were always getting in each other's way; and the lamps on either side of the sofa are not very practical - it was hard to find a good reading position. Several days we would come back in late afternoon to find our room not yet made up. We would have to cool our heels in the bar to get out of the maid's way, but we were not unduly inconvenienced. There are a suana, hot tub, and exercise machines on the top floor. There are a bar and restaurant on the ground floor. We did not try the restaurant, but overheard many favorable comments. Parking is $22. per night - by my research, the cheapest around. WIFI is charged by the day or week. The hotel is conveniently located for most business and pleasure travelers.

Cambridge Suites is right in the heart of downtown Toronto, within walking distance of Yonge and Queen, in fact, if you like walking, you can cover most of downtown on foot even to Chinatown to the northwest, Harbourfront in the south, Jarvis on the east and a good stretch of Yonge on the north. Cambridge Suites has got one of the friendliest people around - always helpful and polite. Service is excellent, and you will always see a big smile no matter if it was early in the morning or late in the evening. The suites are large enough to easily cater to 4 adults. The business centre, though small, is sufficient to check emails or browse the web for more interesting things to do in Toronto! There is a small gym right at the top-floor which you can see Toronto beautiful skyline - especially during the night. It also comes with a restaurant on the ground floor, and a coin-operated laundry room in the basement - great that you need not bring that much clothes when you can wash and dry them within 2 hours!! Food? Well, there's a convenience store just right opposite which opens late - great if you need to grab some munchies for the late night, or there's a Subway across the hotel. Tim Hortons, McDonalds and a bunch of quick-eats are just round the corner on Yonge, or if you rather the food court at Eaton Centre. For us, breakfast was at the Sunset Grill just up the street on Richmond. The staff is very friendly and accommodating but it can get pretty busy!! As for transport, Queens subway is just below Eaton Centre, accessible through the Hudson Bay building ... but when you have so much to see, who needs the subway!

Cambridge Suites is in a superb location. The weather was nice, at a balmy 35 F and no snow or rain that weekend, so walking long distances was not a problem for us. The Eaton Centre is about a half a mile away, and there are a variety of other little shops and restaurants on the way. Queen Street E.

Also the farmer's market, which is heavily advertised in the brochures throughout the hotel, is so-so. Kind of cramped and busy on a Saturday.

Pros: Great bed, spacious suite (with two flat screen TVs), location and more location (it is really in the center of everything), clean, large bath. Cons: Restaurant is super pricey - we did not eat or even order drinks from here, and you must pay for parking. SPA is just o.k., it would be nice if they had a pool, but that is just my preference. **Tip the hotel is on a one-way street so as you are coming down Richmond, the hotel will be located on your left.

We chose the Cambridge Suites hotel due to its fantastic rating on TripAdvisor along with a great rate on their web site. They are also mentioned in Frommers. They had parking under the hotel which was convenient since we drove to Toronto, and also several of the sites were wanted to visit (Toronto Zoo, Canada's Wonderland, Ontario Science Center,) were visited by car. We booked a king bed/sofabed suite. The suite itself was very spacious (?550 sq feet) and had 3 rooms that were connected like a tripod. The living area had a pull out sofa, a chair, coffee table, desk and table. There was a minibar wall with a microwave, sink, and refrigerator. The living room was connected to the bedroom by French doors with opaque glass. The bathroom had 2 doors - one to the living area and one to the bedroom. The suite furnishings and bathroom were up to date. There were two flat screen tvs, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. Having a microwave and refrigerator were invaluable. The kids had popcorn every night, and we ate breakfast in the room every morning. We had debated getting two doubles instead of the king bed, but the opportunity for privacy (having our own bedroom and the children on the sofabed) and slight cost savings outweighed the possibility of a parent having to sleeping on the sofabed. I am happy to report that the sofabed was surprisingly comfortable. The king bed was extremely comfortable. The room was well cleaned every day. The front desk staff was very polite and helpful.

We were given a $25 food voucher for the on-site restaurant Portico and the food was absolutely fantastic. We had it delivered to our room for a reasonable fee as we were tired from a day touring Toronto. Dinner arrived for three of us in less than 30 minutes! Continental breakfast the following morning was wonderful with scrambled eggs, warm oatmeal, bagels, muffins, yogurt and fruit but the best thing was the banana smoothie that was offerred along with several other juices/coffee. What a nice treat in the morning! Rooms are clean, comfortable and reasonably spacious. We had a room with two double beds and the living area had a comfortable pull out couch for my son. Each room had its own flat screen TV, mini bar, more than ample size bathroom and dining table that fit four but was easily prepped for business as a desk (plugs, etc.) It fit The only drawbacks is that it doesn't have a pool (although a fitness center w/ jacuzzi is available) and the in-room movies are expensive ($15.)

SO : 205$ per night plus taxes for my room PLUS 59$ per night plus taxes for my meals (just supper without beverage, without mini-bar or extra of course) = $894.96 CAD When I arrived in Toronto on April 28th 2011 at night, the service was fantastic, everybody was nice, the front manager was very helpful. The only thing, but it is also my fault, is that I did ask if there was a hotel parking (because I saw that there was a public one quite expensive for 19$ just beside the hotel) and she said, \"of course, just turn on the right, I will give you this little card, I will take your licence plate and as long as you stay with us, your are fine to stay there.\" So I thought it was free!!! I would NEVER park my vehicule there for 20$ a day (there was one half price 1 minute away) or at least, she should have mentionned it or there should be a discount. There is no point to take the licence plate and all that for nothing. I could have take the ticket for the exact same price. So I felt a bit frustrated there. Then, my room... so beautiful, small but very cozy. My tea was there, with milk in the fridge. The cookies was part of the usual room package but anyway, it was good cookies! I loved the hair and skin products! I did appreciate that the internet was free of charge... thank you!!!! That is very nice, something that we do appreciated. Anyway, I did spend the money in candy in the mini-bar (but I'll talk about that in 1 minute). And the extra-blanket was ON the bed! : ) The second day, The cleaning lady even left the drawer open to show me that there was ANOTHER BIG FLUFFY BLANKET available if I wanted one! And I slept very good, thank you Want to talk now about the food, this is, by far with the confortable bed and pillow that I wanted to bring back home, what I liked the most. Don't want to say that I fell head over heel for everything but almost.... and I did eat out a lot once and I am from Montreal (restaurants capital of the world). The Salmon was WOW, the steak was good, the risotto was good BUT the CHOCOLATE POT DU CREME -in fact, to let you know it is \"pot DE creme au chocolat\" - (it is like a chocolate pudding but 1 million times better) OH my GOD, I ate that on my last night, I was sorry it was because I would have ordered that over and over and over again, even at 9$... The second thing that frustrated me is that when I checked in I asked the front manager if I could eat my pre-paid menu in my room instead of in the dining room even if there was the regular charge of room service, she said, I think that i would be ok, but let me check with the restaurant and I will call could in a minute or 2. She did, there was no prob. So I ordered the salmon, etc. They came in and I had the surprise to sign a bill of 93$!!! What the hell.... I just added a diet coke to the order, so the server said, \"well if you already paid, it is probably an error, just sign it and you would be able to verify it at the end....\" BUT NO COPY FOR ME!!!!!!!! AND I WAS VERY MAD by the fact that there is an addition of 20% of gratuity on my bill. Which I find a bit over the top. I usually give that anyway, but I hate when it is already on my room service bill (and it is room service, not dining room, I mean, the lady is not serving me for 45 minutes here!!) And there is already a fee for room service and the 20% is calculated AFTER all the addition, so it is a lot of money. Anyway. I found that it is kind of stealing my money and I don't have anything to prove it (the server left with the unique copy -all hotel I've been always gave me a copy in the room). So it as been like that for 3 days, which I've been said the same thing by three different persons : well talk to the manager at the end of your stay to arrange thing out. Sincerely, usually, I am the kind of girl the talk right away up front, but I was too busy (I left at 4 AM and came back exhausted at 7-8PM at night). One last thing that I have to give you credit for : some crazy kids started smoking some ... and it smelled quite strong everywhere (your windows can open, it is a good thing, but some people think that they can smoke and nobody will smell it because of that : WRONG!!) anyway, you did an excellent and fast job, it was late and you knocked on the door and managed the situation very professionally. I thank you for that. Finally, here what I do have to say and the reason why I would probably think twice before going back to your place: My trip was done, I looked at the bill under my door : 1200$ , ouch!!!! with an almost 50$ bill of minibar! (I ate 2 box of cookies, 2 diet coke and 1 bottle of evian, that was it!) and I took my three \"59$\" meals plus 1 diet coke and 1 glass of milk and 1 extra appetizer at 13$ and the first day I didn't realized that the gratuity was included so I gave her (lucky her) 15$ tip extra on top of what she already have. SO, I went downstairs, pretty shocked. The first thing the front manager told me when I said that I would like to review my bill because it was a bit more elevated than what I expected and that my minibar bill was too high he said: \" you had quite a party!\" !?!?!?!?! I said excuse me? He said, \"well you had that kind of a bill because of the red wine, the scotch, 2 vodkas, ...\" then i interrupted him and said that I didn't even drink... this bill was not mine, etc etc, He did not believe me, Then asked me if I had company and maybe he had a drink without me knowing... I was not happy! I was by myself, working hard, and this bill did not belong to me, I wanted to go, and it seemed like he had to have proof and take a blood test for my alcohol level. Anyway, we finally agreed to removed 17$ from the bill because I was tired of this discussion... this make my 3.50$ cookie boxes a bit more expensive! Then came the restaurant to discuss with the same guy....... Already a lost cause, to this day, I still don't know where my additionnal 200$ went, well, not true, I know that I did pay a 20$ each day for the parking (ouch-ouch-ouch = 60$) and that I did pay an additionnal 20% (after all taxes and room services fees included) for gratuities (I think that this is at least 40$ more than what I expected there) So at the end, the hotel expectations was met, that is for sure, but I think that , or I misread small characters or there is hidden fees or you should say to your client, \"for a nominal fee, you could use the hotel parking, it is so and so per day. Also, I do think that, and this is my traveler experience talking, that your gratuities % are elevated for room service (specifically because your price are high, it is a tough bill). But maybe it is hotel independant, I don't know, but the food is fantastic. For the minibar bill, I am sorry, but the front manager that early morning was rude. I was there to do the correction of the family physician exam for all the Canada for the College of Family Physician for all the weekend, I was exhausted, I was not there to party. For this guy to tell me \" you had quite a party\" and \" maybe it is your company who had a couple of drinks\" was not something to say. I don\"t know where the alcohol went, I don\"t drink, but I had to pay partially for it and I am mad.... please review that in the future so that it does not repeat again, thank you. SO AT THE END, WHY I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT : THERE IS OTHER HOTEL AS CONFORTABLE LESS EXPENSIVE.... nothing out of the extraordinary that worth 1200$ for 3 days!!!", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg Manitoba Canada", "Title": "\u201cConvinient, Friendly, Great Value\u201d", "Author": "fishr", "ReviewID": "UR107426191", "Content": "My wife and I stayed from April 28-May 1.

Loved the nice lobby with lemon and cucumber water coolers but the elevators were slow, an American we ran into said the same thing. My only major complaint would be about Portico, the restaurant. At the risk of sounding lazy, I don't feel like writing two reviews. Portico is rated in the top ten for restaurants in toronto on this site, something which I can only attribute to travelers and not locals doing most of the reviews. The menu looked good, even if a little spare on appetizing appetizers. We both had tomatoe soup to start, it was okay but for $9 a bowl it should have been great. I had the gnocchi, which was good, and my husband got the seabass, which was rubbery and came with SUPER bland steamed veggies. The portion was paltry, I understand it's a higher end restaurant and the portions are small, but this was much smaller than it should have been, especially considering it was lackluster in flavor.

Room was nice - cityscape room and the extras were as advertised. Internet was a little slow at times but expected due to heavy traffic. Had dinner at Porticos both nights and was well worth it. Wait staff/bartender was excellent and would like to give a big shout out to Elaine ( hope this is right) one of the friendliest and most professional staff I have ever met. We are very grateful for the strawberries that appeared later the evening and can give unconditional recommendations for the desserts. Had a great time listening to the impromptu concert that happened in the lounge as we settled for the evening before supper and Junos. Only slight things kept this from having the effortless feel of a five star - no creamers etc found for coffee in the fridge for the AM eyeopener and failure to replenish the coffee the next morning. Both dealt with efficiently by staff but would have been nice to have them just happen. Breakfast continental was nice but two of the three mornings it was hard to find a clean spot as staff seemed slow to clean up places - maybe a factor that most people weren't paying for breakfast and therefore not tipping? We walked to the Junos at the Air Canada Centre and the PATH made this a warm comfortable walk for the extensive distance ( 25 minutes) - window shopping made the time pass quickly. Eaton's Centre a block a way, easily accessed by the PATH also or a block on street level. Checkout easy and allowed us the courtesy of a slight extended stay as we were taking an early evening Porter flight. Kiosk in lobby that allows check in to numerous airlines much nicer that the single airline kiosk I have encountered elsewhere. As I stated had a great time and would go back. Had an accompanying spouse and the extra space afforded by the suite was great for loitering over a book or coffee while he waited breaks from the conference if he didn't go off visiting sites.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cWhy stay Anywhere else ?\u201d", "Author": "Haroula", "ReviewID": "UR102218830", "Content": "Don't bother staying anywhere else.

They also gave us complimentary breakfast vouchers for each day, which was not included in the room rate that we selected. When we got to the room they had placed chocolates, and bottle of champagne to greet us. The chocolates appeared on our bedisde table each day while we were there. The room was absolutely great, and in my opinion was what very hotel room should be. A good sized bedroom, with a king bed and city views, joined to the nicely sized, clean and modern bathroom, via a large carpeted powder room with full length mirror, closet, safe and ironing board and iron. The seperate living area was a good size, with dining table and lounge, fridge, microwave, sink, cutlery and crockery. Virtually a small apartment. We could easily and comfortably live there for some time. The living area also had large windows with a nice downtown view. A guest laundry was located at the basement level, with two washing machines ($1 to wash) and two dryers ($2 to dry). The bar and restaurant was well priced, the food was good and the saff were very cheerful and friendly. The hotel is also joined to Toronto's PATH system of underground walkways, with two entrances, so that you can leave hotel to go peruse the city and never have to go outside in the weather!

Upon arrival from the airport, we were immediately warmly welcomed by the front desk staff.

Even the breakfast room waitress was very pleasant, and she was completely surprised when I gave her a tip. In Miami and New York, I was challenged by the taxi drivers for not giving a big enough tip! Housekeeping supervisor was very visible, as were her staff. They were frendly and provided service with no hesitation. Without a doubt, this has to come from the top. I congratulate the general manager in achieving this level of service. As mentioned before, there are four elevators and they are always very available. I did not recall having to wait for one.... it's always there waiitng for me. One thing I've noticed... all the other guests in the elevator, or lobby, seem to be friendly and in a good mood. Does this reflect that they were all having a good time? From previous posts, not all rooms have equal configuration or furniture. For example, my room has a long rectangular bathroom, consists of double sinks, then a toilet flanked by bathtub on one side, and on the other side a shower large enough for two. My room did not have a dining table. Instead, it had a desk large enough to allow two people working, as there are two chairs across from each other. The two 42\" LG TV's , sofa, microwave, small fridge, bar sink are all pretty uniform. Besides service, room size, location has to be the third strong point of Cambridge suites. The PATH underground walkway actually has an exit to Cambridge suites. Mind you, it's not connected to the hotel. The entrance the underground walkway is right across the hotel, perhaps 30 ft?

My husband and I are not ones to complain and we thought that perhaps it would die down, but it didn't. My children couldn't get to sleep and the shouting and yelling coming from the next room was aggressive and there was a lot of obscene language (not stuff I care for my kids to overhear...). Yes, we should have complained. It reached a point where I actually feared confrontation and reluctantly decided to ride it out. I also fully expected hotel staff to discover and deal with the party which was obviously well out of control. I didn't sleep, but thankfully the rest of my family managed to nod off after awhile. We left a message with the manager and my husband followed-up with an email. We received an extensive apology and our assurance that this was an isolated and uncommon occurrence. Indeed, we should have called the front desk during the night we didn't have the presence of mind - I was trying desperately to avoid having my children witness a confrontation.

I travelled with my sister and we stayed for 3 nights in a 1 King & sofabed Cityscape suite (which included breakfast, a room on the higher floors and free wireless internet). - If you arrive by Airport Express, you'll get off at the Sheraton and walk a few blocks to the Cambridge Suites - Front desk personell is very friendly and have you checked-in in no time! - There are 3 or 4 elevators and they're fast, so you never have to wait long. - Our room was on the 18th floor (room 1801), next to the elevators. - Upon entrance, you step into the living area which has a kitchenette, large flatscreen, sofabed and a dinertable with 4 chairs. Everything is decorated in soft earth tones, very classy. - Through the french doors there is a good size bedroom with a comfortable Kingsize bed, another flatscreen and a desk - From the bedroom and the living room you can enter the roomy powderroom, which has a large closet (with free safe) and a sink. Bathrobes are provided (just 1 when we arrived, but they quickly sent up another one at our request but in the end we didn't use them). - From the powderroom you enter the rather small bathroom with toilet and shower. Ample towels, though .. and ' green' soaps, shampoos etc. - The kitchenette has a mini-bar & fridge for your own groceries, a microwave and a Keuring (?) coffeemaker. Coffee is replenished througout the day. - The hotel offers turn-down service (nice!) and leaves bottles of water, some chocolates and a card with the weather forecast. Free newspaper on the desk in front of the lift - Our room had a view down at Richmond Street, not a great sight. - We choose the 1 King/sofabed option because we both like to have our own space. The sofabed is just not that comfortable for an adult and in my opinion only suited for children. It was a pro though that you can get to the bathroom without disturbing the person in the bedroom! - Another pro: the room was very quiet (even with it's location next to the elevator): very little disturbing noise from outside. - Housekeeping deserves praise: they made up the sofabed (although we refolded it every morning) and refreshed the sheets. - Wireless internet is way to slow in my opinion: we couldn't even Skype with it! - Breakfast was great with a very large selection: hot oatmeal + scrambled eggs, 4 kinds of juice, bagels, white and rye bread, waffles, fresh fruits, yoghurts, milk, cereals, pastries and fruit salad. Topped off with good, strong coffee (just the way we like it) it made for a very good start of the day! - Good selection of in room pay-per view movies. - There is a roof-top hottub and sauna, but we didn't visit it. - Check-out was quick and easy and the billing was correct. - BUT MOST OFF ALL it is the location that makes this hotel worth visiting again: right across the street from The Bay & Eaton shopping Mall, close to entertainment (theatre, cinema's) and you can reach all that using the underground PATH system (we preffered walking outside and getting some fresh air, because shops and restaurant tend to be overheated in wintertime).

I was there for one night only, but thought I would nevertheless post a TA review, since I found the hotel on TA. I booked my stay over 22 days in advance for a conference I was attending, and I got a rate of $129 for a king suite, directly through the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. This was a pre-purchase, non-refundable rate, and I found it very reasonable at the time of booking, given the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing reviews and rank on TA. After a very short walk from Central Station to the hotel, I was greeted by a very, very friendly, cheerful and helpful young lady at the front desk (I unfortunately did not get her name), and was turning the key in the door to my room within about 6 to 7 minutes of setting foot in the lobby. The lobby is very inviting, albeit small, and very clean. I had asked at the time of the booking for a quiet room, as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a light sleeper, and they accommodated my request with a room on the 16th floor. I did not hear a peep all night, so the soundproofing is A1. The view was mainly of other office buildings, but that was fine. I had done my research before booking the room, but I was still very surprised by the size and layout of the suite. As indicated by the attached photos, there was a separate bedroom with a king bed, flat screen LCD, and small desk area. This opened to the bathroom via one side, and the living room part of the suite via double doors that can be shut for privacy. The living room area includes a second larger desk. There is another LCD flat screen in the living area, as well as a countertop with a sink and the minibar. Very spacious and incredible value for the money I paid. Also, the room was spotless. A few reviews I had read indicated that the furniture and rooms were in need of upgrading. I suppose I can understand the comment, if someone is used to more upscale and expensive hotels, but the cleanliness, in my opinion, overrides the furniture being a bit dated. And I would not even refer to it as that dated\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6certainly the bed is very modern, and the 2 LCD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the suite suggest a modern touch. At any rate, the furniture is not worn; I guess that is my point. It is clean, well-appointed, and the suite from top to bottom was very welcoming and inviting. In terms of service, I was only there for a single night, with a very early check-out, but I would definitely say that anyone I dealt with at CSH was extremely helpful, courteous and friendly, either on the phone when booking or during my stay. The check-in, as I mentioned, was very efficient and smooth, and so was the check-out. I would most certainly stay here again, and would not hesitate recommending CSH to anyone I know that needs a place to stay in Toronto (in fact I already have).

We arrived very late and the front desk person who checked us in did not inform us of the fact that we were entitled to breakfast.

The location is excellent as it is really central. We love having a separate bedroom when we stay in hotels as my husband gets up early to do work emails and I can sleep without being disturbed. The bed was really comfortable and we didn't get disturbed by any outside noise. The dressing room was a nice extra and we liked having two wardrobes - one by the front door for coats and boots. Being able to use the communal laundry facilities (as we were flying home from here after 3 weeks in Canada) made life much easier when we got home. Every member of staff we met couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. However, there were some weaknesses in the whole experience. The bathroom looked very dated - it was geared up for disabled access so I am not sure if this is the normal bathroom experience. The bathroom wall was immediately at the end of the (small) bath so this left no room to lie back and relax. Also if you wanted to wash your hair as well you had to get out of the bath and into the separate shower as there was no way of rinsing your hair in the bath - really annoying! The breakfast also left a lot to be desired. The food was not of particularly good quality and choice was limited. We didn't bother to eat there after our first morning even though the room price included breakfast - we preferred to pay extra and go elsewhere. Lastly the wi-fi access was a bit of a pain as between my husband and I we had a number of devices to log in. This involved getting a code for each device and logging each one on separately each time. We've never had this problem anywhere else so ended up using our own dongle to access the internet rather than use the wi-fi facility.

This visit was the first time we had our son with us and for the first time we requested a room with 2 doubles and due to the medical convention we were left with the choice of the city scape view deluxe suites @ $258/night. There wasn't much to look at even on the 20th floor and we had the corner suite facing the parking garage entrance and it's frankly no bigger than the deluxe suite we stayed in before at under $200/night. I loved this hotel which is the reason why we booked this hotel every time my husband had business in Toronto. The location is great, central and only 1/2 block to The Bay's subway station. I'd always loved the little perks even when we stayed at the \"regular\" deluxe rooms, such as complimentary bottled water, microwave popcorn and packages of chocolate chip cookies. Imagine my surprise when they were not waiting for us in the room upon check in! I called down to ask about the said complimentary items, I was told that when I'm in the city scape suties, the bottled water is still complimentary and will be available with the turn down service (along with the Lindt milk chocolates) but the popcorn and cookies are now a thing of the past. When I told the front desk that I had my son with me and I was looking forward to the treats for him, they promptly sent them up to the room. However, that was only the one time thing. When it's not broken, why change it? I absolutely loved the Kuerig Kcup coffee maker when we were there in December. Loved it so much that we bought a big one for our household use when we went home. I ran the machine for some hot water when we first checked in and imagine my surprise when the water came out brown! The machine doesn't use filters, it's just a Kcup holder where you fit in the little cup of coffee or tea container for the water to run through. I soaked the Kcup holder in hot water and after awhile, bits and pieces of brown gunk started to flow out. There was a thick layer of brown gunk built up in the bottom of the holder probably from months of use and no one bothered to clean it out. That was gross! When I called down to the desk, it took two tries for them to replace the machine. This is the first hotel I've ever stayed at that uses standard size double beds. They were pretty narrow for 2 people and apparently all the other hotels provide XL double beds (the kind I have at home for the kids' rooms) and the narrow beds are actually \"standard\". My fault for not asking before booking. The beds are extremely comfortable, bedding luxurious and pillows comfortable. No complaints there except if you try to get on the beds from the foot of the bed instead of the side, the springs make awfully loud noises. Bed springs need replacing perhaps? The bathroom is well set up. I've always loved having the vanity/sink separate from the tub/toilet room so we can all get ready separately. Lots of counter space! I can't say I'm happy about the condition of the bathtub and floor. I'd made a same complaint about the Halifax Cambridge Suites where we stayed a few days earlier and imagine my surprise to find the same condition at the Toronto property. The mildewy grouts and the tap chauking is no longer attached to the tiles/wall. The floor tiles has aged and looked uncleaned. The shower went stone cold for a good minute one morning, so cold that I had to step out of the tub. Not sure what happened but it only happened once during our 6 nights stay. Another nice touch is having 2 bathsheets in this city scape suite but when they're past their prime and no longer fluffy, it's time to retire them. I was quite happy with the smaller bath towels, they're of better and newer quality. The suite door stopped locking for us one morning as I was leaving for breakfast. Imagine my surprise when I double checked the door and it opened. I closed it a few more times and each time the door opened. I called the front desk and a maintanence man was sent up to check the door. I waited for him in the hall and he was surprised when he noticed I opened the door for him without a keycard. He mustered under his breath that may be he needed to change the battery but after a few tries with his master keycard, he was able to lock the door He then proceeded to lecture me on how to close the door and to wait 3 seconds for the door to lock. I wonder if he would give the same lecture to my husband if he was standing there with the same complaint when it was obvious that I was standing outside the closed door for a good 5 minutes waiting for him to show up. I even showed the bar guy in the hall how many times I could open my door without the keycard. By that time I was in no mood to agrue so I just asked him to replace the battery on the door lock. The complimentary breakfast is fairly good. It has fresh fruits, hard boiled eggs, \"real\" cheddar cheese slices, muffins, bagels, waffles, hot oatmeal, fresh juices and a large selection of good quality teabags. Loved that! We never watched TV in the bedroom until our last night at the hotel and found the remote control not working. I didn't bother to call down to the front desk. It's something that should be checked periodically or daily by housekeeping to save us the trouble of calling for service. There's no charge for Internet connection for city scape view suites but a small charge for deluxe rooms. Are you kidding? I stayed in 9 hotels during the month of August and this is the only hotel that charges for Internet. Providing Internet should be as common as having a phone in the room so they may want to rethink that charge. Parking is $22 a day, plenty of stalls if you go past P1. There are 2 sets of washer/dryer on the P1 hallway on the way to parking. $2 per load. My husband spoke with the management at this property due to my tripadvisor review on the Halifax property. They sent up a bottle of redwine and a $100 giftcard on behalf of the Halifax property which we applied to our account. That was a nice touch and I appreciated the gesture. With the exception of the maintenance man, the staff is helpful and friendly. I've always enjoyed my stay at this hotel but it's begiinning to look it's age and with the cut of perks, it's no longer as appealing to me as before. I give this hotel high rating because it has huge protential and they can certainly make it better if they so desired.

Compared with most hotel suites, this offers excellent accommodation (including first class service), great facilities and a central location just off downtown Yonge Street that is hard to better. And the price was very good with a significant discount for our extended stay. The actual suite - a CityScape on the 21st floor - in which we stayed in was comfortable, very well-equipped and the lines/towels were spotless and changed as regularly as we wished over our nine-day stay. The staff were particularly helpful, particularly in respect of flexibility over house-keeping, booking tours and providing general advice and assistance. The suite layout offers a very flexible accommodation solution, so that two people can share one suite but sleep in separate rooms (one using the very comfortable double sofa bed). The fact that the en-suite bathroom can be accessed independently from both the bedroom and the sitting room is another helpful feature. The restaurant facility on the ground floor - Portico - is excellent and a similar menu is available for in-room dining. This was not my first trip to Toronto, but I would definitely choose Cambridge Suites again with any hesitation.

We arrived in Toronto mid-morning on a Friday and left on Saturday before dinner. The hotel fit the bill as our base of operations to tour a few spots in the city with our two elementary-school-aged children. We got what I thought was a decent rate, $164 per night for a deluxe suit with 2 double beds (the least expensive type of room). The location was great, a few steps from Yonge Street, a block away from the nearest subway stop. I was disappointed with the size, layout and privacy of the suite. Now, it's important to keep in mind that this was our fourth hotel of our trip, and the third suite hotel. Our Embassy Suites suite in Niagara Falls was huge in comparison to this room, as was our suite at the Niagara Falls Great Wolf Lodge. Our suite in the Cambridge was, it seemed, the size of about 1.5 \"regular\" hotel rooms. That's fine, small is OK, especially in a hotel in a downtown location. But what was odd to me was the layout of the room and the relative lack of privacy. The bedroom and the living room are connected by double-doors. The doors are comprised of glass ... not totally clear glass like a regular window, it was different than that, but it was clear enough that it did not afford any privacy. I'm having difficulty describing it ... it wasn't like glass brick, where you can tell there is something there on the other side but can't tell what ... with this, you knew EXACTLY what's on the other side. [I wish I'd taken photos!] For example, were I a modest person, I would not want to get undressed in the bedroom if there was someone sitting on the living room sofa, as the person in the living room would be able to tell it was me and would be able to see me getting undressed, just through a sort-of gauzy distortion but still clear enough to tell me what I was still wearing (if anything) and whether or not I need to lose weight. :-) Now, don't get me wrong, it's not like my wife and I needed privacy for any sort of adult activity ... I slept in one bed with one child and my wife slept in the other bed with the other child, all in the same room ... but I post this just in case someone might WANT the privacy you'd expect in having a separate bedroom. An oddity was that there was no closet in the bedroom, and no dresser ANYWHERE. There were three dresser-sized drawers built into the vanity of the large bathroom, and there is a closet in there, as well. The vanity is more than large enough for 2 sinks, but there is only one ... not having the second sink allows for the location of the drawers. The toilet and tub shower are located in another small room adjacent to the outer bathroom. The outer bathroom is accessible by a door from the living room and a pocket door from the bedroom. There was no safe in the room. But the wet bar and supplied dishes, glassware and flatware was a nice touch. Through some miscommunication during the check-on process, I was led to believe that wireless Internet was available for free in the lobby and in the business center. I found out the hard way that it is available for $11.95 for a 24-hour period (in the room, it must be WIRED Internet, same charge). I was in the small lobby at 5:30 a.m., and nicely explained to the front desk clerk (after he told me the fee) that I needed the web for only 5-10 minutes to solidify some touring plans. He gave me a card with a complimentary wireless code that he said would be good for 30 minutes of wireless Internet (in the lobby). That was a nice touch, I must admit. It was on a pre-printed card (but he hand-printed the 6-character code in the provided blank space), so this must come up a lot. Parking was convenient ... $22 a day, unlimited in-and-out privileges, no need for a ticket or talking with a booth attendant, it's all reportedly done electronically with cameras keyed in on your vehicle's license plate. The complimentary breakfast was pleasant enough ... breads, fruits, pastries, hard-boiled eggs, sliced American cheese, beverages. I'd stay here again. It was a fine place to sleep. But beware about staying there if you need to share the suite with someone you're not intimate with (that is, someone you'd not want to share a regular hotel room with) as the glass doors between the bedroom and living room afford no privacy whatsoever.", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "PhucDong", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Hotel\u201d", "Author": "PhucDong", "ReviewID": "UR65790243", "Content": "Perhaps one of the most elegant and nicest hotels I have ever stayed in with awesome views of Toronto from downtown.

We booked a Cityscape suite and just as the website promised, this suite was located on one the upper floors (ours was on the 18th floor). Not only was the view enticing (especially at night) but we were also spared the sometimes deafening sounds of Toronto's traffic. Needless to say we slept well at night and woke up fresh in the morning to an adequate hotel b'fast on the second floor. I say adequate because it's a continental b'fast, but they had an array of different cereals, pastries, fruit and breads. More than ample I would think. I also absolutely loved their old-fashioned oatmeal...delicious! The room has a mini bar and a Keurig beverage maker which was really nice for that 11 0'clock cup of coffee or for an evening cup of tea. While their rooms are great (spacious and clean) and the location wonderful, it's the staff that is the hotel's true treasure.

My husband and I stayed in a suite that was not renovated, so there were minor flaws as reported by previous reviews - cracks in the bathroom tiles, marks on the wallpaper in the bathroom, etc. But that sort of thing doesn't bother me, and I wasn't surprised that we got an un-renovated room considering the lower rate we received when booking on the hotel website. However, what really bothered both my husband and me was the STRONG smell of cigarette smoke that permeated the suite. It was enough to make my eyes burn and water. Clearly someone had smoked in our room previously. It made the room feel dirty. We lit candles and opened the window in the bedroom for a little bit (it was a really cold night, so we couldn't leave it open), but even that didn't help much. This was definitely disappointing, as it became all I could focus on. Looking back, I should have requested a room change immediately, but we had already settled in and were too tired to make a fuss. Very disappointing and not a relaxing stay as a result. That being said, the bed was comfortable and the view over the city at night was great. Staff were pleasant and helpful. When I reported the cigarette smoke at the front desk upon checkout, the movie we watched was comped, and the staff person apologized, which we appreciated.

It has a refrigerator separate from the minibar and a microwave and sink as well as dishes and utensils. There is a large desk with a comfortable swivel desk chair, a nice sofa, two arm chairs. At the top floor there is a small fitness center with a hot tub that overlooks the entire city. But one of the best deals is that they will let you use a luxury fitness center that is two blocks away for FREE. The Adelaide Club would cost $25 a day if you were not a guest. The service is also excellent- they gave me a toaster, made up the room exactly when I wanted it done every day I was there, and gave me a special price for three days of high speed internet access. The food at their restaurant is also very good and they offer ten dollars off your first dinner entree. The hotel is also within two blocks of a drop off point for the Airport Express, a block from a 7-11, and one block from the Eaton Shopping Center. There is nothing not to like about this hotel. I highly recommend it. It is particularly good if you have a conference at a major conference hotel and want your money to go to the quality of the room and service instead of to the conference facilities overhead expenses.

The entrance to the hotel slightly sits to the side, on arrival we were pleasantly surprised, reception in modern and frsh, reception staff were very polite and helpful, we got checked in as soon as we arrived and it was a quick and easy process. the rooms themselves were very large, the bedroom was very spacious, the bed was very comfortable, the room had a small wardrope and a large flat screen tv, the living room had a sofa,a chair, another tv, a desk and chair and a small kitchen area. The kitchen comprised of a fridge microwave,sink etc. it was great having the extra space and the fridge was useful for storing drink etc, there is a 7/11 store round the corner from the hotel for room supplies. my boyfriend was a little unwell during our stay and we ended up spending a lot of time in the hotel, the tv has a large range of tv channels which was good.only negative i had about the hotel room was that it did not have a safe, but there was safety boxes at reception which could be used free of charge. the hotel location is great is 5min walk to the large shopping centre, the eaton centre which has lots of shops, a large food court and places where you can exchange currency. i would recommend a trip up the Cn tower for great views of the city. also we did a tour of the nirgara falls, witha tour company called chariots of fire, it was $60pp which is a lot cheaper than many of the other tour guides. the tour was fantastic, it includes the maid of the mist boat tour, you get 2hrs to spend at the niagra falls, i would recommend walking up the street which you pass on the way in, it was burger king, ripleys believe it or not, ghost houses,great sweet/candy shops, it is just really fun the kids will love it, my boyfriend said it was tacky but it was the highlight of the trip for me ;-) the tour also includes some time at the village of niagara on the lake, it is truely beautiful little village, with gorgeous little houses and colourful flowers and lovely little shops.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glenview, IL", "Title": "\u201cGood value and good location, would stay there again\u201d", "Author": "hedgehog61", "ReviewID": "UR38753774", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed in a nice suite and enjoyed our stay.

Very friendly and really helpful with maps and reservations. Only one gripe and it is a small one. We stayed in room 302 which faced the corner of Richmond and Yonge so it was mildly noisy.

When we travel, we tend to spend our time seeing the sights and not hanging out in the hotel, but we do like to have a pretty comfortable and spacious room where we can put the kids in one room and take the other for ourselves. The Cambridge Suites met our needs just about perfectly. The staff was unfailingly courteous and professional. With just 12 rooms per floor, it is quiet - from the sitting room we could hear doors opening and closing in the evening from time to time, but from the bedroom it was silent - no street noise, hallway noise, or noise from other suites whatsoever. We were very happy with the cleanliness, size and layout of the room, especially the large closets and the spacious sitting room. My older child was very comfortable on the pull-out couch; we brought a kiddie inflatable travel bed for our little one; we were very happy with the king bed. The bathroom is nothing special but was fine with both a shower and a tub, and a large dressing/sink room. The suite had two closets and a small kitchen area with a microwave, sink, and fridge - we had breakfast in the room most days to save a little money and hassle! Best of all is the location - perfect for our family since we could get to the subway and streetcar right around the corner or easily hop on the highway to get to the zoo and science center. There wasn't much to do in the hotel itself, but that was fine with us since we were pretty much just sleeping and eating breakfast there! We never tried the hotel in the restaurant, which didn't appear to be particularly family-oriented, but we found several family-friendly restaurants nearby. The only minor problem we encountered was that our room, due to be ready for check-in at 4, wasn't actually ready until almost 4:30 - a minor inconvenience, more than made up for by the excellent service the rest of our stay. The two times we asked for something to be sent up to the room, it arrived in under 5 minutes. The hotel guests seemed to be mainly business travelers, but there were other families there as well and we felt very comfortable and welcome.

Check-in was fast and the employee was very polite. Parking was easy to get into and well-worth the extra charge. We also opted for internet access (at $11.95/day). The internet was very fast, although it seemed the wifi signal wasn't very strong. (We ended up using the ethernet cable to connect instead.) Room layout is wonderful. - Entry hallway (with little coat closet). - Living room included a chair, couch, desk (with leather desk chair), large flat panel tv, and bar area that included a large fridge, two sets of plates/utensils, minibar, coffee pot and coffee, sink and glasses. Fridge was large enough to stand up a 2 liter of soda and still able to fit leftovers on a shelf above. Living room had glass french doors to the bedroom. - Bedroom included another large flat panel tv on a dresser, king size bed, chair, table, 2 night stands, and a closet. Our bedroom had 2 full walls that had windows. One of the windows also had a small window that could open. Bed was very comfortable. Linens were clean, although there was a little stain in one spot (but that's really be helped and it was very small, so it most likely was overlooked). - Bathroom was large. Shower was odd in that there's a little button under the handle to push that will turn on the shower portion. GREAT water pressure. We were on the 15th floor and couldn't hear much street noise, except for an ambulance and every so often a louder-than-normal car. (And note, although the hotel is near St Michael's hospital, we only heard maybe one siren a night before midnight and were not awakened by any sirens during the night, despite me being a very light sleeper.) Also, the curtains were very thick - no light came through. We asked for directions while we were there, the front desk staff was very friendly and gave us directions that were more accurate than Tom-Tom. Hotel is in an amazing location - very close to the Gardiner Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway. Also, it is connected to Toronto's 'PATH' underground walkways, near two subways and on a street car route. There is a Tim Horton's across the street (also with Taco Bell and KFC), a convenience store where we bought some drinks for the hotel room, and a block away from the Eaton Centre mall. There is a laundromat on the P1 level with coin-operated machines. I was telling my husband that I don't know if I could go to a traditional hotel room anymore - we enjoyed having the separate living and dining rooms so much. The only problem we encountered was when we got up on our departure day, there was no power. (Apparently this outage was city-wide.) There wasn't an emergency light in the room that I could tell, however, the light from the windows in the bedroom and living room were sufficient. The elevators also were working during the outage (thankfully!). Although the outage wasn't the hotel's fault and affected a large area, the hotel did offer to comp one night of our internet (after I asked). We were able to check out despite the electrical outage. Despite the outage, I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone who needs a place to stay in Toronto and wouldn't hesitate to go back there.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cGood Location But Just Average Room\u201d", "Author": "KibaChow", "ReviewID": "UR38161756", "Content": "We are a family of three, 2 adults and 1 child. This was one of 4 hotels we stayed in throughout our trip. We booked thru Expedia so the price was great for a downtown hotel. The location was good because it was close to alot of restraunts and to Eaton Center. But after having stayed at 3 other hotels, Hampton Inn, Marriott at Niagara falls and Residential Inn, I would have to say that this one was the least favorite. The issues I had with this hotel were: 1) Bed was hard as a rock. We slept on it for 1 night out of a 4 night stay. I had to ask for a foam mattress the next day and they did provide one. Bed was much better after that but I really shouldn't have needed to ask for it to begin with. 2) No Breakfast included. Again this was the 4th hotel I stayed at and it was not the cheapest one. All the other hotels provided free breakfast except this one. It was close to alot of restraunts so getting fed was not a problem but it is something for one to consider when comparing hotels. 3) The rooms are small. Mainly due to the way it's configured. Again been thru 4 other hotels. Two of which included my mother in law making it 4 people. It was difficult for my party of 3 to move around once the sofa bed was pulled out and even in the bedroom. 4) Had problems with the internet. They do charge for the internet, about $10 a day but the hardwire connection didn't seem to work for me. I had to go Wifi . Something to consider for those to don't do Wifi or don't like paying for it. 5) The upkeep of the room was o.k. but there were missing tiles in the bathroom walls. The housekeepers does not clean underneath the faucet of the sink so there was mold type stuff underneath the faucet. My bed sheet had some old permanent stains on it. The bedsheet should have been tossed. The cabinet where the fridge and microwave was not in the best of shape. 6) The front desk staff was very very nice but when I wanted to sign up for one of those hop on and hop off tour bus that takes you around toronto, I had specifically asked if it picked up at the hotel and if it had air conditioning. I was told that the one the hotel used did pick up at the hotel while the other ones didn't and had air conditioning. Well after I was picked up at the hotel by an air conditioned bus, I was brought to another location and was told that I had to wait for another bus. That bus did not have air conditioning and if I wanted to use their tour bus services for the next few days, I would have to walk to this location to pick up the bus. Felt quite misled by the Cambridge staff. Didn't trust what they told me afterwards. 7) They do have 1 restraunt on site. But I swear while I was there I didn't see 1 person eating there. I can't say why it was so empty. Could be the price or the food. We stayed away because it looked like no one else wanted to eat there. There was alot of choices in the area and those places were packed sometime. Alot of folks had great reviews of this hotel and that's why I went with it.

I didn't get a chance to use any equipment (a few treadmills, pilates ball, hand weights) but everything looked well-maintained. There is also a hot-tub in the fitness area but it was always occupied. Location is absolutely fantastic - we were right next to Eaton Centre & Yonge Street and very close to the great Queen St. West neighborhood. Cons: The only thing a little lacking was the service. My boyfriend and I are in our 20s and we look young and it didn't seem like we got the same kind of friendliness as a business person would. They did provide us with a map of Toronto when we asked, and were helpful at giving us directions for specific places. Another little nit-picky thing was that the ice bucket was dirty and it was difficult finding the ice machine which is inside the fitness area on the top floor. Lastly, the parking charge was $22 which was added to our bill, so just be aware.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cEverything I wanted\u201d", "Author": "DallasGal43", "ReviewID": "UR32580903", "Content": "Since I smoke, I wanted a smoking room and many hotels are totally smoke free.

We parked very close to the elevator, and always felt safe while inside. Parking is $20 per night, but the nice thing is, that on the day of your checkout, you can stay parked there until 6pm that day. That meant we could go shopping all day, then go to the car and depart. Check in was a breeze, and we were given a suite on a lower floor. My kid enjoyed the view from the window of the cars and people going by. Two big TV's and a seperate sleeping area made it nice to put the baby to sleep and then watch TV in the living area. There are several fast food places really close by, Tim Hortons, Subway is across the street, McDonalds around the corner, KFC/Taco Bell next to Tim Hortons. The Eaton Center is a very short walk. We walked there on the outside, and returned via the PATH which is completely underground, saving us the bitter cold walk back. The prices for room service seemed pretty high $17 for a tuna sandwich plus tax, gratuity and service charge, I'd expect the entire fish to arrive. We ate from local places instead. Contrary to other reviews, I found the wait for the elevators wasn't long at all. Maybe it was the fact we were on a lower floor, but we didn't wait long at all when we used them. Nice also was checkout was 1pm giving us time to relax, and pack at our pace. Really enjoyed the convenience of the coffee maker, fridge and microwave. We used them alot during our stay, and my kid enjoyed the popcorn (Orville Redenbacher, not some no name popcorn, nice touch!)

The rooms also have a small kitchen area with a microwave, sink and coffee-maker. The decor is elegant, although maybe a little tired but overall in very good condition. The bathroom was a good size, with a separate toilet and shower/bath area to the vanity area which was large and included a hairdryer, closet, iron and ironing board and lush aveda products to use.

My only other complaint was that internet access was $10 a day -- fine if you're traveling on a business expense account (as many of the guests clearly are), but steep for pleasure seekers like us who have gotten used to reading restaurant reviews while traveling, not beforehand. But the suite's layout was perfect -- two new wide-screen TVs, 70 cable channels, beautiful bathroom, comfortable living room area, fridge and microwave (with free popcorn). The king bed was oh so comfortable. The place was super quiet. I used the small gym's free weights every morning after a run. There's a whirlpool and sauna too. And the location is perfect -- not immediately next to anything of interest, but very close to pretty much everything you'd want to see. All in all, an experience somewhere between \"above average\" and \"excellent.\" We'd stay again and recommend it.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "northwest", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel for family, great location, wonderful and very helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "NorthwestStuffy", "ReviewID": "UR18823387", "Content": "our trip to toronto was in celebration of our grandson's 13 birthday. when asked if he would like us to take him somewhere his response was yes: canada, toronto to visit the hockey hall of fame.

After reading the great reviews and browsing the Cambridge Suites website a few times, we booked (at a rate of $160 per night). The hotel was extremely easy to find after getting off the Express Way. The location was not exactly what I had hoped for as the hotel was surrounded by empty lots and a bit of construction. Parking was available in a underground garage that was accessible from an elevator that exits straight into the hotel's front lobby. Parking was 17 dollars a day which is typical. There is no valet and no attendent to help you with your bags, so once you park you have to lug all your belongings up to the hotel's lobby. The front lobby was very small, but nice. Dimly lit with marble flooring, rich dark woods, and a small sitting area. The staff were okay, but I found the most helpful and friendly were the cleaning staff (who do evening cleaning which ended up being very useful for us). The room itself was nice. Every single suite is set up a little bit different, but they all have a sitting area with television, a desk, two closets, kitchenette/bar, bathroom sink with large marble counter, seperate bedroom with television and sliding doors. We were able to get a smoking room which is available upon request, but we were told when we were booking that if there wasn't a smoking room available when we checked in and we attempted to smoke in a non-smoking room a charge of at least 200 dollars would be made on our Credit Card. The hotel is extremely strict on the no smoking policy. It was nice having all the extra room, it was welcoming to come back to after a day in downtown Toronto...but the hotel could use an update in the appliances (the mircowave was clearly old and ready to die) furniture, and overall colour scheme. It was all very dull. The bathroom was a little cramped. I appreciated the large marble counter area for when I was primping for a night out, but I found that part of the room to be too much dead space. My boyfriend and I took full advantage of the gym (that closes nightly at 11:30pm). Disappointingly it offered only two treadmills, one elliptical, and one exercise bike. During busy times we would have to wait to use equipment. One plus was each piece of equipment came with a personal television, unfortunately if the person on the machine next to you tried to change their channel they could accidently change your channel as well with their remote. There was also a full weight set, a hot tub, and a sauna. No pool. One plus is the hotel gives you a complimentary basket of coffee and tea (higgins and burke brand), two bottles of water, a bag of microwaveable popcorn, and cookies which was nice. These were refilled daily by the cleaning staff. The products the hotel uses are all by Aveda (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, and soap) which was nice and of good quality. My biggest pet peeve was that when I would go to the frontdesk for directions or suggestions about where to eat I found their responses were generally uninformed and lacking. We had better help from our cab drivers. I liked my stay at the hotel, but will likely not plan on staying there in the future as the overall feel of the hotel just wasn't for me.", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "adelaide", "Title": "\u201cSublimely comfortable beds\u201d", "Author": "diggaa", "ReviewID": "UR12394412", "Content": "An excellent hotel.

There are two robes for your use as well. In business center, you can print things for free (off of a USB, but you pay for the internet). The staff were courteous, friendly, and helpful.

It was definitely enough to start your day. And even if you showed up 15 minutes before the breakfast ended, they still had a full selection (it was constantly replenished). I really liked the complimentary bottle of water they offered every night along with a card describing the weather conditions for the next day. Cons (all minor): The towels were not fluffy -- they were a bit on the rough side. Unlike other hotels, they don't provide complimentary shaving cream, razors, or toothbrushes through the front desk -- but that is available for purchase as part of the minibar selection.

I discovered the free popcorn which is promised - hidden in a smmall basket hidden behind the tea bags and one packet of free cookies. It was DIY style pop in the bag which you had to put in the microwave. Beware of the smell it makes. When I did it it absolutely stank the room out for hours.

Caveat about lounging in your skivvies: the staff are very eager to enter your room for various reasons (turn-down service, wash your coverlet). The 1st night, I'd just checked-in and was eating supper (not good) in bed at 8pm. The door flew open, the maid bustled in wanting to turn down my bed. Luckily, I was still half decently dressed. The next morning, at 8am, again the door opened without a knock and in marched another maid wanting to divest my bed of the coverlet to launder it. Uh, okay, but I was still using it... After the 2nd incident, I made sure to hang the Do Not Disturb sign every time I stepped in my room. Location is good, being only a block away from Yonge.

As a family of four with two nearly teenage children the extra room provided in the suite was wonderful. The bedroom area could be closed off to enable kids to sleep, while we relaxed with a beer and T.V. or books. (tip if you dont want to use the mini bar then go to the LCBO store on Dundass / Younge, and stock up your in room fridge.) This hotel is well situated we walked everywhere as we had not hired a car, nowhere was far to go, CN tower, ferry to Islands, shopping, St lawrence market (wonderfull fresh produce), street cars, subway, and Path all within easy reach. I picked this hotel after reading other reports on this site and was not dissapointed. the only very minor fault was there was no milk for coffee in the fridge, however one phone call and it soon arrived. A Little touch that made our stay, was the evening bed turn down,with chocolates and complmentary bottles of water, plus the next days weather forcast to help you plan your day. The breakfast was always fresh and constantly topped up, providing a good start to the day, we rarely had lunch as we were still full. the bathroom was lovely and clean and always had lots of hot water. The room was also very quiet we never heard any noise from the adjacent or overhead suites. the Staff were all helpful and polite, we also extended our check out time by an hour to 3pm which meant we arrived at the airport freshly showered and unflustered for our evening flight home. Other hotels i considered were the delta chelsea and the novotel, i definately made the right choice. If we go to toronto again we will stay here. Eating out was great so much choice our kids loved eating at the old spaghetti factory (the Esplanade near the Novotel) dont be put off by the outside, it is wonderfull inside great meals ,good value for money as well. they also enjoyed the Armadillo Grill on front street west super ribs and tex mex food and an in house magician who visited the table he was brilliant. we had a fantastic time in toronto and loved the cambridge", "Date": "June 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay at the Cambridge Suites Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3543059", "Content": "I decided to stay at the Cambridge Suites Hotel in Toronto based on the reviews here and I have to stay I was not dissappointed.

After being annoyed at the airport (immigration had a problem with me travelling with my children alone) I was in a foul mood but when I got to the hotel the genuine friendliness and helpfulness of the staff had me smiling. The suite was large CLEAN and comfortable. The air conditioning worked perfectly and my suite had plenty of light switches and lamps so the room was not dark at all. I was on the 12th floor and could see the top of the CN Tower from the windows. The minibar was always stocked (mainly because I didn't use it). The maid was thorough and friendly and always gave us extra towels. The evening turndown service was a nice touch especially the weather report for the next day.The complimentary breakfast in the suites was a blessing because the kids could eat whilst still in their PJs watching Teletoons on the TV whilst I was in the shower. Having 2 TVs with 2 kids was great and I came back to the UK with a full packet of headache pills. The location was fantastic (Richmond and Yonge) we were able to walk to most places within 10 minutes. We walked all the way down Yonge (took about 10-15 minutes) to Queen Quay and took the Ferry to Centre Island (stunning place). The path underground system which connects to the Eaton centre, Subway stations and numerous other buildings and shops is connected to the hotel. Lawrence Market is a couple or blocks away (we walked there practically everyday the Dominion Food Market across the road from there is a great place to get snacks fruit etc cheaper than the corner shops). We also walked to the CN Tower (a must for anyone visiting Toronto) and the Rogers Centre and took in the Toronto Blue Jays (another must family zone $9 a ticket for adults $6.30 for kids bargain very enjoyable and a safe atmosphere). The hotel is a gem believe me I walked past alot of hotels and the vast majority looked like dumps to me Hotel Victoria, Scrathcona, Sheraton and the Delta Chelsea to name a few. The great staff, appearance of Hotel and Suites as well as the location make this hotel a must stay for vistors to Toronto.

In the begining I made a mistake by not asking to change rooms but, I was staying such a short time and had so much that I wished to do that the thought of having to pack and change rooms seemed a greater inconvience... By the day of check out I realized what a mistake that decision had been. I was sooooo looking forward to the comfortable bed I had read about in the reviews!! At apperance level the bed looked wonderful! Both Myself and companion have back problems so when we woke stiff and sore after the first night, we made excuses saying 'perhaps we just need to get used to the mattress & maybe it was the pillows ...etc'. ( Though we haven't had that problem happen in other hotels we have stayed) We could bearly move the 4th morning, trying to pack for check out. Since I did not ask for another room it's not really fair to blame the Cambridge, but I thought I'd warn other's who wake from an uncomfortable nights sleep not to wait thinking it will get better. It won't! I'll also suggest if you run out of something in the room frig prior to the weekend, let them know before Friday afternoon because though there are several different people coming into the room to check on things daily, it seems the frig is not stocked daily and you will spend a dry thristy weekend! One last thing, if you have reason to use the spa you may want to be sure it is going to be in working order. After the pain and stiffness brought on by the mattress I was even more than looking forward to a nice long settle in the spa and enjoying that gorgious skyscape. But that last evening I was met with a sign saying the spa was closed. The room itself and the service offered by those employed was truly excellent! I did mention something about my problems upon leaving but I think the desk help thought I was looking for a discount or perhaps didn't understand my accent ( American) or something as he just shrugged it off.

I like to place valuables in a secure place and it was a real nuisance having to go to the front desk each time to get something out, whether it was cash or credit cards. Other things that could be improved upon were the lighting - we were on 11th floor so suite was quite dark, the pillows - I think that they could offer the option of feather ones & the bath towels which were small, although they did give us 2 each as well as hand towels & face cloths.

Fourth, the young lady at the concierge stand was very knowledgable and helpful. Thanks. Suggestions for Management to Turn it Up a Notch.... First, king bed is the smallest I have ever seen. Definitely a quasi-king bed about 9\" wider than a queen bed and not a full-size king. Bed was very hard. This alone made my wife want to change hotels. Second, house keeping should knock before entering - which they didn't. Luckily we were decent !! She did apologize though. Third, both tv's in our room faded from colour to dark purple and back again every minute or so. We asked staff on the first of three nights for replacement tv's. It never happened. Why ask again?? We shouldn't have to. Fourth, the very small lounge was always full so you could never get in. Finally, please deliver cold bottled water in the evening and not luke warm water! It will make all the difference. Oh yes, and if there are two guests in the room, you should deliver two bottles of water and not one. Otherwise, I would definitely give them another chance.
