Arriving about 90 min. prior to the standard check-in time, our room wasn\u2019t ready yet, but we were able to take care of the paperwork (inc. surrendering our lodging certificate), leave our car with the valet ($42 per night plus tax) and have them store our luggage while we went to walk along the Embarcadero. The front desk clerk assured us that we would be called as soon as the room was ready and that the 3 p.m. check-in time was guaranteed. We had a nice walk including a stop at the Ferry Building for some great clam chowder with Bay view at Ferry Plaza Seafood. But it became 3:30 and still no call from the Harbor Court, so we walked back to the hotel only to find that our room still wasn\u2019t ready (so much for the \u201cguaranteed\u201d check-in time). The reception clerk (a different one than had originally set up our account) asked for the lodging certificate that we had already given to the first clerk. He then went to check on things and disappeared for at least 15 min. He returned but didn\u2019t talk to us (odd), but had another clerk signal us that our room was ready. Once again we were asked for our lodging certificate! At that point I was thinking \u201cif one more person asks me about this, I\u2019m gonna slap them\u201d! I must say that all 3 clerks we dealt with were very congenial and polite, but the hotel really needs to train their staff a little more carefully about details. Fortunately, the rest of our experience at the Harbor Court turned out to be quite enjoyable. I\u2019d requested a high floor in a quiet area and our room (#726) was on the next to the highest floor in the building. Our King Bay View room was one door from the end of a long hallway and a distance from the elevators--which made it a very quiet location. 2 narrow windows provided a truly magnificent view directly out the Bay and the Bay Bridge. The view was so enchanting that we left the shades up at night so we could look out and see the lights of the Bridge. As expected in an historic building, the room was relatively small (about 200 sq. ft.) but with the far wall covered mostly by mirror, it was bright and had the illusion of being more spacious. Altho\u2019 the Embarcadero was directly below us, the traffic at night was minimal and the sounds were nearly eliminated by the double windows. No window screens were present to intrude upon the beautiful views. Our room\u2019s contemporary decor was attractive with colors of gold, chocolate and blue/grey. All was very clean and tidy. The king bed with cozy down comforter felt good, but I found that my back was fairly sore each morning. Room amenities included: (2) phones, clock radio/iPod dock, wall-mounted Philips flat panel TV, a small desk and chair (convenient outlets were located above the desktop), honor bar/frig. which doubled as an end table, ice bucket and 2 wine glasses, iron and ironing board, umbrella, (2) cool leopard-print robes (I was VERY tempted to buy one for $90), and free Wi-Fi if you join \u201cKimpton In-Touch Club\u201d (which is also free). Storage was pretty minimal with limited space for hanging clothes in the armoire and only 1 luggage rack. There were 2 built-in drawers under the bed. We had to leave some of our stuff on the floor under a window due to the lack of storage space. I never did figure out how to reprogram our room\u2019s thermostat, but the temperature remained comfortable throughout our stay with only the fan on. Our bath was small but efficiently laid out. It had polka dot wall paper (fun!), white tile flooring, a long narrow storage shelf, pedestal sink, and a large mirror. The lighting and ventilation were good. Water pressure and temperature control in the combo shower/tub (with adjustable showerhead spray) were both fine. I did miss having an in-room coffee maker altho\u2019 coffee was available in the guest lounge--a spacious and inviting area with fireplace and plenty of varied seating. A few negatives (other than the check-in difficulties): A small tear at the bottom of a sheet, a leaky coffee cup, disappointing low quality wine at the wine reception with the meager pretzels and snacks gone a half hour after the reception began and never replenished, and an empty dispenser of citrus water in the Lobby which had run out by early afternoon and hadn\u2019t been refilled. Again, more attention to details is warranted. It was exhilarating to walk out the doors from the hotel lounge and find ourselves right at the Embarcadero with the Bay just beyond it. The location of the Harbor Court was really ideal for us since we loved being able to leave our car and walk everywhere, exploring along the Embarcadero (inc. Embarcadero Center and the Ferry Building), the Financial District, historic Jackson Square area (which has some of the original Barbary Coast buildings), Chinatown and North Beach. These areas represent a photographer\u2019s paradise! Coit Tower was close enough too, but we didn\u2019t venture up there this time. Wonderful restaurants also abound, some literally just steps away: Ozumo (adjacent to the hotel), Perry\u2019s (good spot for hearty breakfasts), Waterfront Restaurant (lunch with a view), One Market, Boulevard (always excellent), and the Slanted Door (consistently great). We had dinner at the latter 2--restaurants I never, ever tire of. Following our 2 night stay at the Harbor Court and after absorbing as much of the wonderfully eclectic area as we could, we went home feeling content and rejuvenated!", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cHappiness on the Bay!\u201d", "Author": "rpb2654", "ReviewID": "UR126310168", "Content": "The Harbor Court Hotel is right across the street from the San Francisco Bay, and rooms on the Bay side of the property have amazing views of the San Francisco Bay Bridge, Treasure Island, and there is usually some cool Burning Man art also directly across the street along the embarcadero.

But it delivers on all Kimpton qualities: friendly and helpful service, fast check in/out, exceptionally clean rooms and facilities, and of course the free coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. Regardless if you use these extras, it is just great to have a warm and cozy lobby to mingle with fellow guests. The room itself was larger than I expected (it is narrow, but you have plenty of room at the foot of the bed), the bed extremely comfy, and you get free wi-fi on the loyalty program. And the Bay view rooms are really worth the extras, you could lie in bed and admire the lights at night. Priceless (trust me, I have paid way more for other views in SF!). One of the key reasons I chose to be here was location. It's easily accessible to public transportation, including the BART to SFO 3 blocks down (for the sake of clarity, the Griffon and Vitale are within a block too). It's literally 2 blocks from the Ferry Plaza, which has plenty of dining options for breakfast and lunch, and the best wine bar in town.

My room more than lived up to expectations--the views of the Bay and Bay Bridge were awesome, both day and night, and the room itself was extremely clean, comfortable and peaceful. It was so well laid out that, despite its compact size, it felt cozy in the best sense, and not at all cramped. The weather turned hot part-way through my stay, and the room's well-functioning A/C was much appreciated. The free wi-fi was really fast and reliable. The lobby was an attractive and inviting place to hang out in; the citrus-infused water available all day, and the coffee/tea available in the morning, were nice touches. I loved the Embarcadero location, just a block from the Ferry Building and near many top-notch restaurants--an area perfect for foodies, and with none of the tackiness so prevalent in Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf. It was great strolling over to the Ferry Building for breakfast every morning, and for the farmers markets 3 days of the week. The hotel is convenient to lots of useful bus lines, the F-streetcar, and the Embarcadero BART/Muni stations. Taking BART to and from the airport is really easy. The housekeeping staff did a phenomenal job keeping the hotel in tip-top shape and making me feel welcome. Marina, who is in charge of housekeeping, introduced herself to me as I was checking into my room, and encouraged me to contact her if I needed anything for my room. However, my room was always kept in such perfect condition that I never had any issues to report at all. And, every time I came across a member of the housekeeping dept. during my stay, I was met with a smile and a warm greeting. The bell staff was also great--really efficient in storing and retrieving luggage, and a few times when I was waiting by the front entrance for a friend to come pick me up, the bell staff always approached me promptly and courteously if I needed help with transportation or anything else. Sadly, the only thing that kept my experience at this hotel from being perfect was the front-desk staff. Most of them seemed young and somewhat unpolished, and I can't recall any that seemed particularly helpful, efficient or welcoming. Check-in was esp. frustrating, as I arrived when there was only one young man working behind the desk. He spent a lot of time helping the couple in front of me with a bunch of non-hotel-related issues, during which time my presence was never once acknowledged. Really, is it so much trouble to say \"I'll be with you in a moment\" or to call a colleague to come back you up at the front desk?! When my turn finally came, I received no greeting, no welcome; just a brusque \"Can I help you?\" Talk about an abysmal introduction to the hotel, and being made to feel like a third-class citizen! During check-in, he also failed to volunteer any information about the hotel's amenities, but only answered direct questions that I put to him. Fortunately, most of the front-desk staff seemed somewhat friendlier and more engaged in their jobs, and in any case, I didn't need to interact much with them for the rest of my stay, as I'm a frequent visitor to SF and didn't need help planning my activities or getting around town. Overall, I would give the front-desk staff a rating of 2.5 stars (the check-in guy gets zero stars!), while the housekeeping and bell staffs both merit 5 stars. These hiccups with sub-par front-desk service wouldn't prevent me from staying at this beautiful, well-located hotel again.

All in all there is a lot to commend the place and we may make this our regular San Fran hotel. LOCATION: The location is superb - near the water and the fabulous Ferry Building makes for cool breezes and affordable breakfasts and snacks. It was great to have the farmer's market across the street. It's away from the Ghiradelli Square area that gets noisy and sometimes unsavory. Also one of us had a knee injury so it was nice to be able to get out and walk places without immediately encountering hills. I've stayed at the Fairmont and boutique hotels downtown, and walking anywhere is definitely a chore from those places if you are temporarily or permanently disabled. Tons of buses come within two blocks, and BART and Muni are also right there, so we didn't rent a car and took public transport everywhere. ROOMS: Definitely spring for the bay view room - the view is spectacular. Since, as many of the reviews mention, the rooms are small, having that expansive view opens up the room in a really nice way. The bed was comfortable enough and the room was clean. The cleaning staff was actually great about accommodating our needs given that we were needing big bags of ice and strange room cleaning times. SERVICE AND AMENITIES: The service was good without being over the top. If you like fawning service, this may not be for you. But if you like friendliness and helpfulness from young, energetic people, this is a good fit. We enjoyed the little touches - flavored waters all day, coffee in the morning, the cookies in the evening, Aveda products in room, and they even brought up a bottle of wine for the birthday we were celebrating! I loved having the YMCA as the gym- so convenient and even though it's $10 a day it's totally worth it if you want to have real workouts (more than a treadmill and some 10 lb. weights) while you are away. I also liked having the little Japanese restaurant attached - it was convenient and decent food. VALUE: If you like a big room, you will find this to be pricey and disappointing. However, if your key components are location and service, then the price is right. Become a Klimpton program member and you don't have to pay the surcharge for wireless. I booked through the website and got as good of a deal as from any travel site.

Wifi is supposed to be an extra $10 a day but they provided this for free--they give you a print out with the monthly passcode so I suspect this is a general frieebie if you ask. Note that phone signal from my room (509) overlooking the airconditioning units and fire escape was very weak, so if you require calls to your mobile for business purposes you might want to upgrade to a harbor view room. The hotel has two computers in the lobby you can use to print out boarding passes (free) or surf the web (charge). The hotel doesn't have a healthclub but you can buy a pass for $10 a day to use at the YMCA next door (a door from the hotel lobby leads right into the YMCA). The YMCA isn't open 24 hours a day, but the benefit is you get to use a much better range of equipment than a hotel would normally have. I didn't do the cocktail reception, late night cookies or morning coffee, but did like the ice tea and orange and lemon water juice in the lobby, as well as the fire they had going there. Even in summer it gives a cozy touch. As others have mentioned, the Farmer's Market is a five minute walk and is a great place to get breakfast on Tuesday and Saturday and be part of the SF scene as you mingle with locals. Margaritaville is an SF institution and people line up for their freshly made Mexican food and eggs first thing in the morning because it gets too popular at lunch time. Opposite is an organic breakfast place that does great oatmeal and fresh fruit juices. There are loads of good restaurants around the hotel (the Embarcadero Towers boast several upscale Asian and Indian eateries) and it is a 20 minute walk to Union Square. The hotel has carved out a niche for itself by being pet friendly (they even offer guided dog walks!) and over the weekend, about 15% of guests have pets.

Need I say more? Our queen room on the 8th floor was surprisingly much more spacious than I was expecting from some of the reviews. Although we didn't splurge on a bay view, we had a terrific view of downtown. Both the room size and view were superior to the one we had at Monaco (another Kimpton property at Union Square) a few years back. The Harbor Court is my new favorite hotel in San Francisco. We loved coming back each day to the crackling fireplace in their wonderful lobby/living room - and the treats! Staff is professional and friendly, although a little reserved which may be why some reviewers seem to indicate they seem aloof or uncaring. But the fact that the coffee, wine, and cookies are served on time each day, rooms are spotless, and we got all of our questions answered at the front desk easily and promptly, shows that the staff is truly top notch. We met some wonderful staff members, including Brad at the front desk and Michael at wine hour, who clearly work hard to ensure the comfort of guests. Our stay was not without glitches, but the hotel handled these issues very well. Due to high winds and pouring rain, we returned our first night to find a power outage in the hotel. The staff more than made up for this issue by passing out glow sticks which was a lot of fun, and pouring more complimentary wine! In fact, the power outage turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. The atmosphere was very romantic sitting in the dark lobby in front of the fireplace, and as we made our way up the staircase to our room, we found that staff had lit the entire 8 floors with glow sticks which was very clever and pretty. In the AM we had lukewarm water to shower in, but PG&E did not get the power turned back on until 6:30 AM which was not the hotels fault. We also had a lamp that quit working during our stay, but a maintenance worker came immediately (at 10 PM none the less), assessed the problem and had it fixed for us - all in a span of about 20 minutes. If we have one complaint at all about the Harbor Court, it is that it is somewhat removed from the hustle and bustle of Union Square. BUT, we knew this before booking, and we chose the serene Embarcadero location instead as we wanted to be on the water. Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf and the other San Francisco attractions are all within walking distance, and/or less than 10 minutes away by either the F Line streetcars or BART. It is also right next to the Ferry Building which has a number of places to eat, Peet's Coffee and a farmers market on 3 days of the week. The quiet location also made for a wonderful nights rest. One tip on San Francisco in general. If you plan to do a cable car trip during the day, take the F Line to Fisherman's Wharf and catch it there. The lines at Powell/Market were close to 2 hours when we went at 11 AM. No wait at all at Taylor Street at Fisherman's Wharf. The California Street cable car (which starts a few blocks from the hotel) is currently not running due to work being done. To summarize, the Harbor Court is a wonderful hotel, with terrific \"extras,\" a great staff, and a peaceful location on the bay.

My only minor complaint is the hot water to make tea was not hot enough. It would have also been nice is if you could swivel the TV around so you can watch it whilst in the bath!

Though small, the rooms were equipped with Ipod dock/alarm clock, wardrobe to hang clothes, very small flat screen tv, cordless phones, and nice desks/night stands. Bathrooms are just as small but well decorated and with nice amenities. Housekeeping staff was very good and attentive. Ozuma and Perry restaurants are right next door (great japanese and american cuisine respectively - though I was a bit disappointed with Ozuma's Sushi --- its more like the place where yuppies gather for happy hour to mingle). Hotel is only an 8 block walk from Westfield Mall and the main downtown area. Only issue for me was the $10 daily use fee for the YMCA gym next door.

I treat myself often (3-4 times/annum) for two reasons: 1. I am worth it...and so are you, dear Reader. 2. Because I can afford it...and so can you, dear Reader. Pricing is more than reasonable, considering all of the value you receive. The hotel is always clean. The staff are super-friendly and always crisply dressed. I have been going there for two years (it's my only religion) and I always see the same staff--I love that. It means that employees are valued, because they have stayed. It shows. I am not a paid employee. Nor have I received any tips,profits or upgrades (did I mention the eUpgrade? Check it out.). This place is my kind of place. And I am picky.

The location on the Embarcadero is great: you can jog right out of the hotel and run on the Embarcadero on pavement, not in traffic, past the Ferry Building, the sightseeing cruise docks, Fisherman's Wharf, etc. depending on how far you want to go. Amazing scenery. The area has restaurants and cafes and of course, the Ferry Building is a foodie destination with 3 farmer's markets per week. We got takeout from the Japanese restaurant that is next door to the hotel (pricey but good) and ate one night at Perry's, also next door (lively scene, good food and not horribly expensive). A half mile north of the Ferry Building is Plant, an organic cafe right on the bay that we enjoyed very much at lunch one day. Not close to the hotel but good if you're in North Beach is Mario's Bohemian Cigar Store cafe, for the ambiance. Our favorite meal was probably at Nopalito (Broderick and Oak), southwestern but all fresh, homemade everything. We bought breakfast items at a little cafe across Steuart Street in the Rincon Center and brought them back to eat in the hotel which serves free morning coffee in the lobby. There's also wine in the evening and cookies/milk later on. The service is very good: most of the front desk staff knock themselves out to please. The room we stayed in had a king bed which took up pretty much the whole room, but we wanted a view and we got it, a spectacular view of the Bay Bridge. It was stunning at night. Many Muni lines begin just 2 blocks away at Market/Drumm, so if you are planning on using public transportation to sightsee, as we did, it is well located. The hotel shares a door with the Embarcadero YMCA, whose lap pool was one reason we decided to stay there, but unfortunately the Y was closed for most of our stay. It would have been good to have been made aware of that fact via the hotel website (since we later learned they always close at that time of the year). There are other gyms the hotel has privileges with, but the closest lap pool was quite a trek away and we didn't bother. There are so many things to see and do in San Francisco, but we enjoyed the California Academy of Sciences the most. Even though it was crowded due to the holiday, we got around to everything.

The Embarcadero waterfront is world-class beautiful and provides a serene walking (or running) path all the way from AT&T Park to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. The Ferry Building is two blocks away and offers incredible food and shopping options. Some of the best restaurants in the city are within a 2 block radius. This location is more quiet and peaceful than the Union Square area, just a short walk away. The hotel also hosts morning coffee, a wine reception early in the evening, and cookies and milk are served as late night snacks.

I have traveled in Europe, Canada, and Central America and have, purposely, experienced a wide variety of accommodations, from hostels to B&B\u2019s to four star hotels. What I have discovered in the course of my travels is that the staff makes or breaks it for the customer. While, yes, the Harbor Court is in an amazing location for a business or central San Francisco tourist stay; while it is absolutely impeccable in d\u00e9cor; while the room (admittedly small but well appointed\u2026great bed, bath, VIEW, quiet) was something to truly look forward to at the end of a strenuous day; while the whole facility is in pristine shape\u2026if it weren\u2019t for the staff truly being on top of their game in customer service and dedication to their work none of the rest would matter. Give me a cheerful hostel with the staff really into their work and engaging with the clientele over a 4 star which is just picking your pocket any day! It\u2019s obvious from the moment you step to the door that it is not simply a company or a paycheck but you, the client, that the staff of the hotel is working for. Francisco, at the door, meets you with a gracious smile and gets you to the desk. The desk staff are all engaging, Kevin was especially helpful in arranging our room\u2026there had been one small miscommunication precipitated by our arriving to check-in earlier than anticipated but he resolved it effortlessly. James, the shift manager, along with Kevin, was a font of local information and schlepped and checked our bags himself while the room was being prepared and we wandered out to begin our weekend. Judy, who cleaned and tidied our room, left us little notes and kept the room spotless (which is a challenge with me as a client--I am a master of chaos\u2026). One thing I really liked was the staff did not have their hand out. I practically had to chase the young man (whose name I didn\u2019t catch) who helped us get our bags to the taxi at the end of our stay to give him a tip. There is a wealth of helpful or charming touches: two computer terminals in the lobby with direct links to all airline online check-in and boarding pass services; a local wine reception in the lobby from 5-6 PM each evening; GOOD coffee and tea in the lobby in the mornings\u2026.Again all things that require the care and attention of the staff to keep going in a smooth, and inviting way. One thing you could not guess, it has been so transformed, is that the building was the YMCA residential facility! It has been so transformed as to be a totally new creation. Guests are welcome to use the athletic facilities of the Y which remain next door. Far superior to any \u201cworkout room\u201d and any hotel I\u2019ve ever been in! The building is solid and quiet. The windows, over The Embarcadero are double glazed with storm windows to boot! Thus our 6th floor corner room was absolutely quiet. Saturday morning there is a huge farmers market at the ferry terminal a block down the street. There must have been a continuous stream of traffic starting at 3 or 4 in the morning; neither my wife nor I heard a thing. There is central cooling in some of the building (though I did notice a window unit in a room down the hall) that was quiet and needed as the day time temps were well into the 80\u2019s while we were there (very odd; I got sunburned in San Francisco in July)! The rooms are of a size to admit only one (very comfortable) queen sized bed. And there is armoire rather than a closet. But there is a desk, high-speed internet, and a flat screen TV. The rooms are well laid out, charming, and make best use of the space. (The size was the only down tic in an otherwise perfect score.) Many come with a million dollar view of the Bay Bridge!

No hotel bar but there is one at the place next door that is very nice. Service was super, we were allowed an early check in and a late check out to accomodate our travel plans. Everything was very clean everywhere, very nice lobby as well. The real complaint is that none of the staff knew anything about the outside world, like where was the closest subway was, how to take a bus to the museum, etc. We asked if there was a laundrymat and was told that the nearest one was miles away, of course they reminded us that they had laundry service at the hotel (and that is always expensive) so we gave up. On Monday we saw that there was a new dry cleaner in the plaza RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET that had wash, dry and fold service. Had they told us that on Friday it would have made our life much easier. No one knew how to take a bus to a museum or anything.

This hotel offers a wine hour from 5-6, and also yummy cookies at 9pm. Since we were going to be out at that time, they were kind enough to hold us a few cookies that we got on our way back in.

What attracted us to this hotel was the price and location. The daily AAA rate was $151/night after taxes (~$110 before taxes). This special rate did not allow us to upgrade to include continental breakfast for an additional $1.00. A few days after our stay, Travelzoo published a special rate for the hotel: $89/night. The boutique hotel was elegant and more personal than the Hilton. The staff was very friendly. We were in room 416 despite requesting a room that was higher up. We didn't pay extra for a view , so we were stuck looking at what seemed to be a rooftop with some pipes and electrical units. The room was strikingly small -- more bed than walkable floor space. This did not bother us though since we were looking for an inexpensive, clean place to rest our heads. The tv was oddly off-center to the bed which made for an awkward viewing angle. The room was very nice and clean overall. The bathroom was spacious and stocked with Aveda products. We were amused that the bathroom seemed handicapped-friendly: raised toilet seat, handbars in bathtub, non-slip mat for bathtub. Our first gripe came at 6:30 AM when we were awakened by loud thumping sounds. Being city folk, we have a high tolerance for next-door-neighbor noise. However when the noise continued for 1.5 hrs, we realized that the noise was something else other than neighbors rustling around. We suspected the gym next door was the culprit.--noise was dropped weights, maybe? The front desk responded to my complaint immediately and placed us in room 816 which is on the top-most floor. Switching rooms at 8:00 AM due to disturbed sleep was the most annoying hotel experience we've ever had. Room 816 was almost identical to 416, though much quieter. We were able to sleep to well past noon undisturbed. The second gripe was a minor one. We were charged an extra $12. The mistake was easily cleared up with a phone call. The erroneous charge was apparently for the mini-bar. PROS: - Location -- waterfront, near Ferry Bdlg, ~4 blocks from BART, ~20 min walk to Alcatraz tour - Evening wine reception - Wii in lobby (though it was't there our second night) - Clean rooms - Friendly staff - Small and intimate CONS: - Early AM noise heard in room 416 (and possibly all of 4th Fl???) - Room pricing seemed arbitrary - Must sign up for an acct to access wifi The room size may be a dealbreaker for some.

I wanted to make it a great experience, and I love the bay view rooms at the hotel, so we were absolutely lucky to get a gorgeous, large windowed view on the top floor. I almost wish we hadn't been so busy running around the city so that we'd been able to enjoy just lounging around the room more. The decor is is tasteful, clean, and modern. Cleanliness has always been pretty spot on, and I was raised to be finicky about that kind of thing. The rooms can be tight, of course, and I usually go klutz into the bed frame corners more than once, but I've stayed in normal Hilton rooms in the past, and at the Stratford in Union Squre, and they were just as small (and not nearly as nice as I can recall). The location is superb, especially if you're bringing up a car, as there's a greater chance of finding meter street parking (some meters aren't enforced overnight either, if you get lucky!). And since it's a little farther away from some of the major areas, it seems quieter. The service was wonderful again. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and really do try to put extra care into things. Our room attendant left us a personalized note, and we would return to dim lighting and classical music (it's a little thing that makes a big difference, I appreciated it and haven't ever gotten something like that before).

So my whole experience at this boutique hotel was a first for me, and I often felt like a \"yahoo from the sticks\". Thank goodness the staff is so professional they didn't make me feel uncomfortable. I'm sure I didn't tip the right amounts, sorry. Your first impression of the hotel is quiet elegance. Then your stress level is greatly lowered when you see the famous brown lab Maverick sprawled out in his bed in the lobby. (he tolerates pats and picture taking). I asked for a quiet room so I was given one overlooking a central area instead of the street. The room was amazing, I don't know what others expected as to size, but I thought it was the same as any other hotel, although the bathroom is a little small. But that is all overcome by the sheer comfort and deluxe decor (although a wall of mirrors is a little retro). The bed was heaven, so plush you climb up into it. Nice reading chair, small desk, flat screen tv on the wall. They allow you to use the honor system mini bar as a refrigerator, which was helpful. I never heard another quest, no slamming doors, no loud a/c unit, just peace and quiet. Location was a little inconvenient if you wanted to go downtown to Union Square area or out to Golden Gate Park, took me my whole stay to figure out the buses. Hotel is at the Ferry Building, and the trolley up to Pier 39 runs close by. There really aren't any inexpensive eating places or mini marts nearby. What makes this hotel so unique is the staff. Dulce was on duty when I had an issue with an internet charge (I used the computer in the lobby and the directions were not clear as to how to get the 15 minutes free), she promptly reversed the charge and didn't make me feel like a cheat or liar. I asked about an airport shuttle, they arranged for the pick up (am I supposed to tip for that??) After I got home I completed an on line survey from the hotel and mentioned an error in my final bill of about $3.81, which I wasn't going to hassle with. The manager sent me an email saying he had investigated the charge and was crediting my charge card; now that is service.

The wine hour is a great kimpton staple and I really enjoyed the living room area of the Harbor court. It was pretty quiet and relaxing even though many guests were enjoying the wine hour. Definitely a difference with the other kimpton hotels union square hotels that seem to have too much traffic. Had dinner accross the street at sinbads and also a couple doors down at mexico df. both highly recommended. Satuday was able to go to the farmers marker right accross the street which was fun.

Now let me start by saying that I am not an inexperienced visitor to San Francisco. I think this is important only because the room rates tend to be expensive in this city and you tend to end up with a small amount of square footage for what you pay. My first problem with the hotelm began before I ever checked in. I had reserved a room for one night and my plans changed and I called to extend the stay. My rate was $135 so I called the hotel to check in one day earlier and was quoted a rate of $299. I immediately hoped onto expedia with whom I had originally made the review and they had a rate of $135 for the same room. I told this to the person on the phone and they indicated they would match it IF they could also find this rate. Ten minutes latter they honored the rate of $135. Moral of the story, although the Kimpton Website says they gaurentee the best rate....shop around. Upon arriving at the hotel no one was out front to offer to help with the bags, although this may seem like a nit, in San Francisco when traveling by yourself you need somone to get the bags and take the car so you can check in without getting a ticket. Upon checking in I was told that I would need to get new keys the nnext day as I had two seperate reservations...although not the end of the world, it was not convenient when staying more than one day since I have to expense all of travel back to my company I have twice the number of receipts that I needed. The room was nice (small, but again this is SF) but the view was amazing! If you stay her request the \"View room\" which has amazing views of the bay bridge and the Island! Service was luke warm the entire visit, depending on the website you look at they will give from 3.5 - 4 stars....my experience has been that service is better at some of the other Chain Hotel Properties. This hotel is good for business travel if your stay involves business SOMA or the financial district (near the embarcadero) any further than that and this property will be too far our of the way. Holiday visitors would be better to stay closer to Union Square or the warf as this is where you will most likely spend your time.

The staff was extremely friendly and very willing to point us in the right direction to any place that we wanted to go. In my opinion, the hotel is in a great location. It faces the Embarcadero Steet. It is very close to the Bay Bridge. (Not the Golden Gate Bridge). Harbor Court is within walking distance to public transportation and several attractions including Fisherman's Wharf, AT & T park, Pier 39, Chinatown (uphill). It was a long walk, but we walked from the Ghirardelli area back to the hotel. This took about 1/2 hour or so. Great excercise!!!! The hotel is beautifully decorated throughout. They have a wine receptions each night in their very large, open \"living room\" (for lack of a better word). I agree with the reviews that I read in that the guest rooms are a little on the small side. But they are beautiful. The beds are extremely comfortable. Other than that.....we loved the Harbor Court Hotel and would absolutely stay there again. As far as San Francisco goes....LOVED IT! If you are there for pleasure, you really have to do the touristy thing. Normally, I don't but here I had to. *Alcatraz was great! *Chinatown...loved it! *Ghirardelli was a dissapointment. Over rated! *The Cannery. Over rated! *Pier 39...tourist trap with shops and food. But alot of fun. Check out the sea lions while your there. *Fisherman's Wharf...yum! Do try the clam chowder or chili in a sourdough bread bowl!!!! Ride a Trolley Car. Yea...you have to! Your trip to San Fran would not be complete without it. Be prepared to wait in lines. It is best to try and catch it mid-route as opposed to waiting in line at the Fisherman's Wharf area. VERY crowded. Due to the limited amount of time that we had (3 days) and some cold, misty, foggy, rainy weather, etc.... We were unable to go or even see the Golden Gate Bridge. We will catch this on our next trip to San Fran as well as some other locations. We found a little bar called the 21st Amendment. Great beer and atmosphere!

I have seen bigger motel rooms. Me and my wife kept bumping into each other whenever we both walked around the room. We only came to view the fireworks and thank God that we didnt have to stay any longer than a day. We were able to see the entire show (fireworks)as the barge was directly in front of the hotel! This was the best thing about the hotel.The flat screen tv was off centered from the bed which was ackward and it didnt swivel. The ice holder was so small the only thing you could have put on chill was a 12 ounce soda. The internet was absolutely great as well as the view of the water and bridge. The only drawback here was that the windows were only about 32 inches wide which meant if you really wanted to enjoy the view, you had to stand in front of it. The hotel has no restaurant , but a contract with japanese restaurant next door.Restaurant next door caters to the hotel but don't expect full breakfast. Most places around hotel are closed on the weekends which puts you far from most of the city action. The hotel also doesn't have a gym so if you want to workout , you'll have to go next door to the YMCA which has a contract with the hotel.Upon trying the shower we found out that the water was just luke warm. The clock radio implied that everyone owns a ipod so you couldn't play cd's -I feel anything over $200 should have a cd player. Later in the night we started smelling cigarette smoke. Thats when I noticed that the door had a slight crack that let light and smoke inside my room. Room is so small that theres no room for a coffemaker even if they tried to provide one.

The welcome is warm and gracious, and staff make an attempt to satisfy your every need. I paid $224/night for a deluxe king bay view room (senior rate on the Kimpton website), and while not inexpensive the rate was better than the larger chain hotels in the city, especially the Hyatt Regency and Le Meridien that are close by. I'm normally a loyal Starwood guest, but this time I decided to try Kimpton, and the experience was gratifying. Pluses: 1) The location right on the Embarcadero is fantastic! Try for a bay view room. Over the years the Harbor Court's location has only become more advantageous as the Embarcadero has become increasingly people friendly. The Ferry Building with it's wide array of food and gift shops and restaurants is spectacular. The Harbor Court provides a jogging map with roundtrip mileage estimates from the Ferry Building to various points along the wharf. 2) Typical for Kimpton, wireless internet access is complimentary. There are two iMacs in the lobby connected to a printer. Under 15 minutes is free, and you start paying for anything over that. 3) Rooms are small, but beautifully and stylishly designed. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in, perhaps excelling over Westin's Heavenly Bed. A wall mounted LCD TV and Aveda bath amenities complete the room. 4) Morning coffee service and evening wine tasting (another Kimpton tradition) is delightful. 5) The Embarcadero YMCA is next door with complimentary access is to Harbor Court guests. Complete fitness facilities include a 25 meter six-lane pool. 6) The BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) Embarcadero stop is two blocks away; so, one can get from SFO to the Harbor Court in under 45 minutes, including walking time from the BART stop to the hotel front door. Fare is about $5 each way from SFO. The Harbor Court is also easily accessible from the Oakland Airport via the same BART stop. 7) Great restaurants within easy walking distance in the neighborhood: Ozumo (in the Harbor Court), Boulevard (at the end of the same block), Slanted Door (Ferry Building across the street), and One Market (two blocks away).

I was thrilled when Harbor Court left us a personal letter to wish me \"Happy Birthday\" along with a complimentary bottle of wine/glasses and chocolates for two. That was so thoughtful of them. Other unique items: free complimentary wine, cookies and milk at bedtime, options of turning down the cover/mints, Aveda bath products, umbrella for rainy day use, bath robes, LCD screen, Oxygen supply (w/ charge), Ipod dock station/radio/alarm, free complimentary limo service in the morning M-F to Financial district, complimentary newspapers, YMCA pass (where you can use free internet, this place is huge 4 stories, including an olympic size pool), sushi/sake room service (that was just awesome for a sushi lover like me), assistance with your bags and recommendations for sightseeing etc. The parking charges were extremely high, $38 not including tax, but we didn't mind it considering parking was just horrible in SF. You can't find parking anywhere, especially at peak hours. If you valet, Harbor Court will get your car anytime you like and you can call down 15 minutes ahead so you won't have to wait.

The hotel is not huge, in fact probably one of the smaller ones I've ever stayed at (not counting hotels in Europe), but it is beautifully decorated and the staff is very friendly and helpful. My room had one queen size bed (though it seemed a little smaller than a queen) and had a view of another building. The view really wasn't that important to me, I was just very impressed by how tastefully decorated the room was and how clean it was. Nothing looked worn down, everything looked new and straight out of Crate & Barrel. The bathroom was spacious and had Aveda bath products, which I love! Back to the bedroom - I'm not going to lie, it was tiny, but again made up for the fact by being so clean. There was a medium sized flat screen tv hanging over the desk and a large armoire that was used as a closet. My biggest complaint about the room was that I found the bed to be very uncomfortable. The mattress was a little too firm and the pillows a little too soft. I'm not joking, I prefer the mattress to be soft and the pillows a little more firm but that's just me. The hotel offered a hosted wine hour from 5-6 pm daily and they also offered fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and milk at nighttime. I checked out on Sunday morning and when I came down stairs they had a complimentary continental breakfast going on in the living room area. The hotel also offers complimentary wireless internet though I didn't make use of it.

Our stay at the Palomar was fantastic, sorry to say we did not like Harbor Court. Other reviews have stated that Harbor Court has small rooms. What they should have said is tiny. We booked a King Deluxe with view, $242 per night, which I believe is the best room available. We had Room 526, and when the maid was cleaning the room across the hall, that room looked just as small but had a \"window unit\" air conditioner. Ours at least had central air. True, this is a historic hotel and it is old, but when you have to turn sideways to pass your spouse at the end of the bed, it's too small. And neither of us is a large person. There is nowhere at all to put your suitcase so mine blocked the door and had to be moved to get out. There is a small wardrobe, which also housed the robes, iron, and ironing board, which didn't leave much room for clothes. The reason I chose this hotel is for the view of the Bay View bridge. The windows are old and small, and during our visit there was ugly metal scaffolding over that side of the building. Big disappointment. The bathroom is also very small, and there is only a small shelf to put personal items. The only good thing I can say is that the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. Thank goodness we only stayed there one night, it was very uncomfortable being crammed into such a small space. What bothered us most about this place was the staff. There were some bright spots, but they weren't as accomodating or professional as the other hotel we stayed at (Hotel Palomar). We heard some people making complaints (room size was one of them) and they really didn't seem to care. Our experience with the concierge and bell desk wasn't good. Since this hotel doesn't have a restaurant for breakfast, we asked for recommendations and was told there was a good one 3-4 blocks away. It was actually 8-9 blocks away, which would have been fine but we had to stop and ask someone else because we thought we had gone the wrong direction. Also, when we got ready to leave it took quite a while to get a taxi; the bellman kept trying to get us to take the towncar to the airport for $45. When a taxi finally came, it was an old guy wearing houseshoes, and we saw him pay the bellman money. So, maybe they only call taxi companies that will pay a tip to the bellman, and that's why it took so long. We had to tell the driver to step on it because he was driving so slowly that everyone was passing us like we were standing still. While we were waiting for the taxi, we heard the same bellman tell other guests that it would take 15-20 minutes to get their car because he had to get us into a taxi; guess he had to wait for his tip. But, if I had paid the high price for valet parking I would have been very upset (and they weren't too happy). Wouldn't stay at this hotel again, we didn't like it at all.

However there were 2 support beams (or pillars if you will) that made the wall jut out about 10 inches and was 12 inches wide. This made walking around the bed a toe-stubbing nuisance and the desk chair could not freely pull away from the desk. Tight manuevering to get seated. There was some paint chipping in the closet and doorway. On my second day there was a guy painting the hall outside my room. Luckily the fumes were faint. Also there was a bit of an electrical short in bathroom light switch. Had to flip switch a few times to get it to work properly.

My wife and I stayed there for three nights during the first week of September 2005. We made reservations through Priceline and obtained a room with a queen sized bed for a bargain price of $110.00 per night. Before we checked in, the hotel gave us the opportunity to look at a room with the queensized bed and one with a king sized bed. For an extra $20 per night we opted for the larger bed (and room). It was well worth it. The bed and sheets were excellent. The television is an about a 24\" LCD. Though the picture was fine, it was a little too small for the room. The desk staff was very kind and helpful. However, I am giving the hotel only an above average review instead of and excellent review, because of an event at check in. My wife and I arrived several hours before the normal check in time. I was suffering from a splitting migraine headache.

China town is a 20 minute walk away. You are just a couple of blocks from Market Street. In short, here are my suggestions: 1. Get a king sized bed. Splurge a little. The room is larger, and of course, the bed is bigger. 2. Don't forget to go downstairs at 5 pm for free beer and wine; or at 9 pm for milk and cookies. Our expericnece, over all, was above average.
