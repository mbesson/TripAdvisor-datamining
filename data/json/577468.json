{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Finally a review Ok. Finally a review. I booked it through a website called www.itripindo.com . Just called the number on the website and their helpful staff sorted it out. Paid only USD 24 for a suite. Did not expect much for this price but was very pleasantly surprised by what I got. The hotel has a good sized pool with a swim up bar. It is located a short walk from Ganesha beach, and a bunch of restaurants. The room was simply furnished but clean. A small TV and a fridge and a sofa. More than adequate.The AC worked and there was good pressure hot water in the shower. Breakfast had a choice of ABF or Indonesian. No buffet bfs though. NVM, for the price wepaid, we stayed longer than our initial one night only. As with all Bali hotels, friendly and helpful staff.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR152393132", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "craneboywill"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608486-d577468-r21729451-Taman_Rosani-Kerobokan_Bali.html", "HotelID": "577468", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
