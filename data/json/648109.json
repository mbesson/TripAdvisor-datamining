{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Exactly what we wanted Ourselves and another couple stayed at the Hotel Saint Vincent for two nights in December after arriving off a long flight from Hong Kong. Our room wasn't ready upon arrival but we arrived at 11am and they promised it would be by 1pm even though official check in is later still. We were able to use a clean, spacious bathroom to change out of our flight clothes and freshen up so that we could head out to lunch. Upon our return our rooms were ready and wonderful. Smallish but not what one would call compact, plenty of room for two suitcases and toiletries in the bathroom. The rooms are wonderfully and subtly decorated with a great heating system, wardrobe space, in room safe, desk, flat screen TV (great for 3am jetlag) and a very comfortable queen size bed (not 2 beds pushed together either!). The bathrooms are modern and spacious and the french doors that open out onto either the inner courtyard or the street for fresh, winter air are perfect. We had a room on the 2nd floor that overlooked the rue du Pre aux Clercs and it was completely quiet. Even when we crashed out at 4pm there was no outside street noise. The location is perfect, we walked EVERYWHERE, restaurants and bars literally around the corner and good ones at that. Breakfast is served in a quaint breakfast room off reception and is simple and delicious and served by a very accommodating waiter. To be honest our entire visit to Paris was wonderful and we encountered the friendliest and most helpful Parisians I have ever met considering all of my visits to Paris and this visit was made even better by the decision to stay at the Hotel Saint Vincent. One other point that I must mention is the helpfulness of the hotel's staff. From my initial inquiry to restaurant reservation requests all made via email prior to our arrival the staff could not have been more accommodating, so a very big Thank you to all of the staff of the Hotel Saint Vincent.Will definitely stay here next time we are in Paris.", "Date": "Dec 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR104869424", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nichkg"}, {"Content": "I had a lovely stay at the Hotel Saint Vincent I spent 4 nights at the Hotel Saint Vincent in early November and was very pleased with the hotel, the service and the location. I have stayed in this neighborhood before so I was familar with my surroundings but I thought the location of the Saint Vincent absolutely perfect. Rue du Pres au Clercs is a short, very quiet block with lovely shoppes. My room faced the street but was dark and quiet and perfect for sleeping. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have found in a hotel. The bathroom was large and modern with a towel warmer, hair dryer and nice shampoo and lotion. Thierry who was at the front desk during most of my stay was delightful and very helpful with directions and suggestions for restaurants. The lobby area is lovely with a nice fireplace and comfortable couches. I had breakfast at the hotel twice and it was very nice, worth the 13 euros. However, there are cafes a block away with delicious coffee if you prefer. I can not think of anything I did not like about the Saint Vincent and hope to return soon.", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR542636211", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Janet033"}, {"Content": "Good hotel in a good lovely location We know this area well but usually stay at the Verneuil or if we want a treat the Montalembert.We stayed for 3 nights at the St Vincent  we thought it was a perfect in between option.

I had a wonderful stay. I had rented an apartment on Rue Pre de Clercs, but arrived early and needed a place to stay.The stylish, beautiful, chic, welcoming Hotel Vincent accomodated me.The area is St. Germain de Pres. If you enjoy boutiques, antiques, art, and classic bon-vivant Paris, then this will be a good distric for you to stay in. It is walking distance to the Orsay, to Eglise St. Germain, and the most prestigious antiques and arts dealers in Paris.The hotel is a boutique hotel. Rooms are dressed in suptuous fabrics, bath prducts are by Fragonard or Roger et Gallet. Rooms are entirely restful and serene. Beds are ultra-comfy. I was in an attic room, and while a little awkward, it had a traditionally beamed ceiling with attic windows. Tres charmant.Breakfast is extra, but this is normal in France.Concierge/Host was impeccable, discreete, and endearing at all times. Fully bilingual.I would certainly stay here again, and I reccomend this hotel highly. Much of one's travel experience is based upon how comfortable their accomodations are, and what area they stay in. To me, Hotel St. Vincent excells in all areas.

This was my second stay here, the previous being almost exactly a year ago.It is a completely updated small hotel in a superb location. I travel to Paris for work which is situated a good subway ride from the hotel, but the St. Germain area is worth coming back to each evening. And on personal days or following work it is very well situated for site seeing, wandering, restaurants etc.As with the rest of Europe the prices have gone up since last year, however, it is still quite competitive. The rooms are beautiful and nicely designed. The staff is professional, helpful and knowledgeable. The continental breakfast is good and the service is pleasant.The one pet peeve I must mention is that for such a nice establishment they do not have irons and ironing boards available in each room. The one iron they have is located in the basement of the hotel which makes using it very inconvenient. This is a shortcoming of many small european hotels so it is not unique to the Saint Vincent. It would be very inexpensive to remedy this issue and it would set them apart from others.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR991101991", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Spike_8"}, {"Content": "Serene and Chic hotel in the heart of Saint Germain       Immaculate bathroom", "Date": "May 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR623231223", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PRS"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel, Great Staff The exchange rate in France is terrible, so I was prepared to pay a lot for a mediocre hotel. I was happy to find the Hotel St. Vincent both elegant and affordable. It is located on a very quiet street, but only steps to a bustling area with great shops, caf\u8305s, and restaurants including L'Atelier de Jo\u6bdbl Roubouchon, Cinq Mars, and Relais de l'Entrec\u4e48te, among many others. The staff is great, particularly St\u8305phane and Tony, who were always friendly and helpful. They go out of their way to ensure that every guest feels welcome. They even gave our cab driver emergency directions via cell phone when I gave him the incorrect street address of a restaurant (it was Rue Lamennais, not Rue Lyonnais). The rooms are not huge, but they are nicely kept, and the staff puts a fresh flower in the room prior to your arrival--a nice touch. Bathrooms are large, and there's a heated towel rack, which is perfect during the winter. The lobby area is tastefully furnished, with a comfortable seating area around a real wood-burning fireplace. It's a perfect place to have a drink before you go out, or when you get back, or whenever. There's a little stand with drinks in front of the hotel desk that's open pretty much all night. And there's a laptop with internet access in front of the hotel desk, too.Bottom line--this is a great small hotel.

If you are looking for a boutique style hotel we would not hesitate to recommend Hotel St Vincent. It is a lovely intimate hotel. Our room was a good size (for a European hotel) on the second floor and pretty much exactly as shown in the pictures on the hotel website, had a fireplace (not to light a fire but looked nice!), and opening french windows to the street below (view to the small street the hotel is in but not across Paris!) with lovely curtains and furnishings generally. The room was perfect and very comfortable. The bathroom was new but in an antique style. There is a breakfast room downstairs which is small but very nice with great service by a little french guy  the price for continental breakfast was good so we mainly ate breakfast in. There is a sitting area with very nice furnishings and ambience attached to the lobby, which we used some evenings (also has an internet pc you can use). This hotel does not have all the extras of a larger corporate type hotel, such as a gym, but we were looking for something different and definitely found it here. We are fairly picky about hotels generally.The location is two minutes down a side street off the Boulevard St Germain and about 5 mins walk from the Seine.
