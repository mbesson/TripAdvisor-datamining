We couldn't have found a better place to stay (unless money was no object maybe) but even then I could have stayed here!\u00c2\u00a0 This place has the perfect mixture of charm, art, history, and modern amenities. All facilities including the garden entrance, lobby, bar, eating area, all lounging areas, and rooms have a modern feel. However, the building is quite old (I think the website says how old- I think 1500's) \u00c2\u00a0and some of the rooms still have the original design elements. There is also local art and sculptures displayed throughout the hotel.\u00c2\u00a0 The service is amazing and the front desk speaks English very well.\u00c2\u00a0 We stayed in the charming \"dormer\" room but I highly suggest a superior room or if you can, the junior suite. \u00c2\u00a0The \" dormer\" room is on the fifth floor and has a small set of stairs to climb. There were only about 10 steps total and you can take the elevator to the fourth floor. The bell man also carried our bags up for us. \u00c2\u00a0The room has low sloping ceilings and I don't recommend it for anyone over 5'10. \u00c2\u00a0It is great if you are looking for a quiet, cozy, and romantic setting though. \u00c2\u00a0The bed was very comfortable and I loved the smell of their linens.\u00c2\u00a0 The bathroom was all new and the shower could use more head room but overall, ok. The water could also have been hotter but I will admit I love my showers very hot. My husband said the water temperature would be fine for any normal person. :)\u00c2\u00a0 The breakfast was very good for a European breakfast including scrambled eggs, bacon, more Italian meats, three types of bread, cereal, yogurt, and of course any drink you wanted.\u00c2\u00a0 The location was perfect! If you are coming from the train, make a right out of the train station and buy tickets at the far right booth for the water bus (vaparetto/actv). \u00c2\u00a0You will get on black line, number one (also far right building) and get off at San Stae which is only two stops down. The water bus is the cheapest and best way. A water taxi will cost around 40 to 50 euros and the water bus is only about 7 euros.\u00c2\u00a0 Once your off at S. Stae, make a left to the small bridge ( you will see it immediately) make a right once over the bridge and then an immediate left and another left into the garden area. Very easy!\u00c2\u00a0 Venice is very touristy and the crowds near Rialto and San Marco unbearable sometimes but this hotel is far out enough that it is quiet but close enough to walk to all attractions. \u00c2\u00a0You don't even need a map to get to Rialto or San Marco either. The directions are on yellow signs on the buildings. Just make a right out of the hotel then a left and make a left into the first bigger plaza area you see (spiezle, I think). \u00c2\u00a0The restaurant Muro is here and is pretty good.\u00c2\u00a0 If we venture back to Venice again, we will definitely stay here again!! It was great and I highly recommend it!\u00c2", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel But Bad Staff Recommendations\u201d", "Author": "SmarterTools I", "ReviewID": "UR127265675", "Content": "The hotel is new and beautiful.

When you get there you watch how it is made for 10 minutes and are then put in a one on one high pressure sales situation. Guests are led to believe they will get a far superior product with all shipping and duties/taxes included in the very high prices of these items. We later learned this is not true, with previous customers complaining that they had been hit with huge shipping and duty/tax costs on delivery. After you are done with the tour and paperwork for whatever purchases made they ship you off the island so that you cannot see anything else on the island.

The areas around St. Mark's were packed with tourists -- so many it was sometimes hard to walk. It was also swelteringly hot. This was part of the reason I so loved Palazzo Giovanelli. It's located away from the tourist traffic, in an area where you can wander uncrowded streets and alleys, browse menus at excellent little restaurants, and sit in a piazza with a gelato just watching birds. It made for a completely different experience of the city -- a place where your visual focus is on the buildings and canals and bridges instead of the sight of thousands of sweaty tourists. Palazzo Giovanelli was also very easy to find. I didn't realize how important this was till we arrived in Venice, got off the ferry, and started looking for our hotel. It's right off the San Stae stop, so we dodged a bullet of having to drag our luggage through winding, confusing streets and alleys trying to get our bearings after a long train trip. The hotel itself is really lovely. Our room was small but we were expecting that. The decor was modern and stylish -- very Italian -- with a nice marble bathroom and good-sized tub. The bed was comfortable and everything felt fresh and clean. The in-room Internet had a weak connection. It only worked in certain spots in the room. The public areas of the hotel were small but beautiful. (Definitely explore the upstairs floors to check out the breathtaking Murano glass chandeliers there.) The staff was always helpful and friendly and told us a little about the history of the hotel and Venice. Breakfast was fine. Not the largest selection, but we were satisfied. The lounge area overlooking the Grand Canal was lovely. Sometimes at night we would walk a few steps out the hotel's front door and sit by large huge, stunning art installation at the San Stae stop watching the world go by on the Grand Canal and the lights twinkling off the water.

On the second day I asked them to provide a small lamp on each bedside table, but they did not. They did nothing to address this in the four nights we stayed there.

It couldn't be easier to get to. Number 1 vaparetto (that's 1 not 2 as we did but never mind we had an early look at the Rialto Bridge!), get off at San Stae, then cross the wee bridge over the canal to the left & walk up the covered walkway, turn left & the hotel entrance is just along the path with the bouncey boards. The front desk staff were charming & courteous & we were taken straight up to our room when we arrived just after midday. We had got a good deal through Octopus Travel which specified that there would be no view. We couldn't have been happier when we saw room 104 with a view on to the San Stae Canal from one window and if you opened the other window & looked to the right, there was the Gran Canal. The room itself was lovely, with touches of traditional Venice like the red fabric on the wall & the wooden beamed roofs but modern lighting and a nice marble bathroom. We had a slight problem with our airconditioning with the room being 2 hot but this was sorted out then monitored by the front desk. The breakfast room was small but bright & modern, with a decent selection of the usual cold food, cereals etc as well as a hot container with bacon & eggs. The staff were again very polite & kept everyting replenished & if you need another cup of coffee then you only have to ask. We also had a drink at the bar one night, which was lovely to sit looking towards the doors to the waterside entrance. At night we found there were plenty of reasonably priced places to eat within an easy 5 minute walk of the hotel. After that if we felt like another drink we just hopped back on the Vaparetto then down to Rialto Market where there were a few bars. We also drank in a bar with amazing wine that was over the bridge then up the street and to the left but I'm afraid I can't remember the name. The guy behind the bar knew his stuff! I really can't say enough good things about the hotel. I think I must have looked at every hotel & B & B in Venice before we booked so many had dark & overbearing decor or they were too expensive or out of the way, I was really starting to think I would never find my Venice Hotel but I'm happy to say Palazzo Giovanelli was it for me. I know people say you only sleep in your room but coming back to a nice hotel can make a good trip even better. I would also recommend buying the transport pass through Venice Connected. We were there for 3 days so we bought the 72 hour pass but got the blue bus that cost 3 Euros from the airport then got our actual tickets when we got to Piazale Roma. This meant we then had our full 72 hours use on the vaparetto then got the city 5D bus back to the airport for our flight home. Because we bought them more that 7 days before we also got them for 28.05 instead of 33.00 euros. We purchased internet acess through them too which worked out at 8.00 euros. Mostly worked best near the vaparetto stops but we got it working at the waterside entrance to the hotel & up the main starcase at the arched windows!!

The hotel is absolutely spectacular, the staff are amazing and so polite and eager to help in any way. Our suite was pristine and made us feel like royality. The breakfasts offered plenty of variety and set us both up for the day. We hired a gondola which picked us up from the hotels very own private jetty. We were also provided with a private motorboat, free of charge, to take us to the island of Murano. If you buy a piece of Murano, no matter what the cost, the Murano factory provide a free motorboat return journey back to the Rialto. I cannot fault this hotel in any way, we were so well cared for and treat like one of their family and I can't wait to return.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel, hidden gem of Venice\u201d", "Author": "ExprncdTrvler3333", "ReviewID": "UR73205589", "Content": "I just recently got back from a stay at the Palazzo Giovanelli. I was a little apprehensive booking it because there were not many reviews and I had a hard time finding out any information or pictures of this hotel other than what was on their website. The hotel itself was amazing. It is an old palazzo that has recently been completely renovated. It is all new and modern yet still manages to give a Venetian feel. This was really refreshing to find since MANY of the other hotels in this price range in Venice seem like they haven't been renovated in 25+ years. It is directly on the Grand Canal waterfront and is 2 Vaporetto stops from the train/bus station. The station is right in front of this hotel or if you use a private boat you can pull up right to the hotels private dock. This hotel is not directly in main part of Venice (which is a good thing to get out of the crowds) and it is a beautiful 10-20 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge and St Marks areas. Since I was traveling on a budget I booked a Room with a dormer (which are smaller rooms located in the renovated attic part of the hotel on the 5th floor) that were around $150/night. I am assuming they are much smaller than the other rooms at the hotel and only have a small dormer window to look out. The room was actually to my surprise spacious, clean, and very comfortable with two chairs, a desk, a comfortable bed, a hallway area/closet to put our luggage, and a good size bathroom. The only downside of these rooms was that they are so close to the roof you have to bend over in certain parts of the room. If I were going to spend more money or stay longer than 2-3 days I would get a more upgraded room. Im sure many of them have amazing views of the canal. I would definitely stay here again given the price range. Even the nicer rooms were VERY reasonably priced for this city. Whenever I make it back I will definitely consider this hotel but I am sure once this hotel gets its name out there it will become significantly more expensive. Overall I was very happy! Friendly staff that all spoke English. Free wifi-internet. Satellite TV of some kind with many channels (even in English), the breakfast for us was included but it was a good selection of muffins, pastries, eggs, juices, yogurts, cereal, etc.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo, Japan", "Title": "\u201cThumbs up!

We had wonderful help from the front desk for reserving restaurants and gondola rides; they even prepared a bottle of wine to go on the gondola, which was so romantic! The room was spotless clean and the lobby is a beautiful open space. The location is perfect as it is in a very quiet and charming quarter of venice, yet very convenient to get to every where! Our room had a view over a lovely garden- I would say almost better than the canal view as it is very quiet and quaint-l ike a secret garden in the labyrinth of Venice.
