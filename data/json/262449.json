I'm a pretty tiny person, so this wasn't a big deal for me. Don't think anyone taller than me would've appreciated the shower though. If I were a few inches taller I'd have to duck. Another thing to note about the shower, if you don't catch it at the right time you will have to suffer through a cold shower. A couple of times I ended up boiling some water to wash my head in the kitchen sink with. The floor was a bit grubby. Could've used a good sweep. You'll be able to hear any neighbouring guests. Other than that though, I found it alright. I didn't have to hand over any ID and my payment online was accepted and I wasn't charged for anything extra. It's located close to Lancaster Gate and Paddington tube stations as well as the Paddington National Rail station. Located in a residential area so it's not as noisey as some areas of London.

My partner and I pre-booked and paid through Wotif. com. for what was supposed to be a self contained \"apartment\". When we arrived we were impressed with the location, the streetscape and the outside of the building. Even the entrance hall made us think we had made a good choice. At their office room they confirmed our booking but said they needed my credit card details and to photocopy my passport (which I was not comfortable about). However we were given no choice about this; If we did not comply, then we could not stay even though we had already paid through Wotif. We would forfeit our money. We were then given a key to a room in the basement. We had to negotiate a very narrow staircase with all our baggage. My partner had broken her arm in a fall in Spain the day before but there was no offer of help to carry our baggage. I had to make 3 trips up and down the steep narrow stairs. Once we reached our room we had a problem. There was not enough space for us to have our baggage in the room and for us to be in the room at the same time. The only solution was to put our 2 cases and 2 daypacks on the bed and then move them onto the floor as we were ready for bed. Our \"apartment\" had no chair. There was simply no room. The tiny door to the equally tiny bathroom did not open or close properly. Whenever we or any of our neighbours flushed a toilet or ran a tap/ shower, a methane type smell went though our room. The only natural light was through a very small window to a light-well. There was no tea or coffee in the room which was lucky because there was only 1 cup. In the basement there appeared to be 5 \"apartments\". If there was a fire on the upper floors I doubt very much that we would have been able to escape. To finish off our experience with Dylan Apartments; when we arrived home to Australia I had a request to contact my bank urgently. Within a couple of hours of me providing my credit card details to Dylan House and allowing staff to photocopy my passport, on-line purchases in UK and USA were made using my card details. I had not used that particular card in the preceding 6 days as all our other prepaid accommodation did not request we provide this information on booking in.

The storage facilities, clean cutlery and nicely sized fridge , on top of the plasma tv was all a bonus, as was the added storage space which was plenty for 2 nights. We were on the top floor, which suited us perfectly. The couple of stairs up was worth the quietness that the top floor offered us. I was also aware that some studio rooms can get stuffy but the fan unit provided was a great asset to stop this. I would say that while the rooms were clean and of a good standard, we did have a problem with our DVD player, which would not work. I went down to the main office and the man was very obliging in sending someone up.

The people in the office were pleasant and tried to respond to our concerns but there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much they could do. This is a case of greed overriding functionality. Our advice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it! It is a great area (we used to live around here) and there are loads of hotels.

The rooms were clean, kitchenette was very convinient: kettle, microwave, toaster, fridge - everything you need if on the budget and prefer to have a quick bite at the rooms. Staff was very polite with us and helpful. Yes rooms are tiny, but in London in such a price range I believe it\"s common. We booked a twin room, but were allocated, at first, a double one. After noting this out to the staff, they granted us a key from a single room next to ours. So we've got 2 rooms at our disposal. To compare - both were clean and decent. But a single, of course, was much smaller with a really tiny bathroom. Double was fine with toilet far from the sink :) On the negative side the double bed was really small and the walls were really thin, I've got an absolutely annoying neighbours who conducted a night style of life and that disturbed a lot.
