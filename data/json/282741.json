What a wonderful way to end my trip. The hotel is close to the airport and within a short walking distance to the metro. The hotel staff were very friendly and helped me out a great deal with directions to several points of interest. The rooms were clean and the beds did a fine job. I even got a laugh from the a la carte pillow pamphlet. Our room faced an open parking lot which was fine because our main purpose of the hotel was to sleep. Free internet access is available in the lobby. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with the price we paid to stay at the Velada Madrid Hotel.

Would recommend this hotel to someone who wants a good value, and who isn't afraid of using the metro or walking to get around town rather than being in the heart of town.

There was no way we could get it re-formulated in two days. When we told the person in charge at the reception that the medication had disappeared, she plainly stated \"that does not happen around here\". I must be a clown, then. Apparently, a client's word is not worth much at Velada's. Instead of trying to solve the situation or talking to the maids, she handed us some forms to fill, which we should deliver to Madrid authorities. What she didn't understand was that I was leaving the next day and simply did not have the time to stop my family's tour and head to some government department to handle a form that I doubt will be read.
