This is what you need after a day of wine tasting; somewhere where you don't need to use the car. The gentille ladies who seem to own and run the place are pleasant and helpful and we saw no signs of the grubby carpets etc that some have complained about. Admittedly it was expensive - we paid around USD 120 for a room with shared bathrooms - all that was available - but the bathrooms were always clean and dry and no sign of others using them, although they must have. The breakfast was much better than most 'motel' style places in USA and the hotel had a calm and quiet air about it. howver, there was a fairly noisy aircon fan outside our window which we asked the landlady to turn off at night, which she did. otherwise we had no real complaints.

For over $200 a night this was a serious disappointment. The room was tiny (I couldn't walk around the room after I opened my overnight bag), looked out onto a brick wall, paint was peeling in several spots, there was no night stand next to the bed and thus no lamp next to the bed, lighting from the ceiling lamp was inadequate to read, there was no TV or even a clock radio. I had to stand on the bed to turn on the ceiling fan and it was hot. Opening the window was not an option as the inadequate air conditioner was outside of the window and very loud. The carpet was old and I put towels on the floor for sanitary reasons. The bathroom was \"down-the-hall\" which I knew ahead of time. For this price, I would have expected a few more amenities especially for \"down-the-hall\" such as throw away slippers, paper cups in the bathroom, shower items. . . Breakfast consisted of pre-packaged bakery goods and beige coffee. This is a budget hotel with top pricing. And, yes, as other reviewers said, it has a weird feeling. I got up early and couldn't wait to get out. There is no elevator so be prepared to lug your bags up 2 flights of stairs.

As I was checking in, the lady at the front desk mentioned that she would be on duty until 8:00 PM. Since I travelled from Orlando Florida, the first order of business was a nice long nap, followed by unpacking and dinner. When I got back to my room around 8:10, I turned on the TV and found that it did not work. Fortunately, the lady (owner?) at the front desk was still there, waiting for one last guest to arrive. She immediately moved me to a different room--one slightly larger and with a bigger bathroom (and a working TV!). I don't know what hotel some of the other reviewers stayed at, but it could not have been this one. I found Hotel St. Helena to be quaint, tasteful, and clean. I have a bad back, and as such at home sleep on a mattress only slightly softer than a slab of granite. But I suffered no ill effects at all from the hotel's mattress. I did not venture into the garden, but the upstairs common area proved to be the perfect place, if a little dark, to enjoy a glass of wine after a long hot day in the kitchens of CIA. I also cannot speak to the quality of the breakfast or afternoon tea as class coincided with both. The location cannot be beat. Right in the heart of downtown St. Helena, with numerous restaurants and all of the shopping within easy walking distance, again I'll mention the bad back. There were really few negatives, but if I had to nitpick, an ice machine in a common area, or better yet small fridge in the room, would have been nice. Also, if you are travelling with a laptop and your power brick has a three prong plug, then you might want to bring a short extension cord or buy one at the hardware store just up the street as the only three prong outlet is in the bathroom.

The room's pillows looked like the ones I would throw out after my son came home from three weeks in summer camp. Gross. The breakfast was a sad affair. Don't believe the reviews about a \"French\" breakfast or whatever that is. Think reconstituted orange juice and a piece of flimsy raisin toast with a vat of recycled cream cheese on the side. Wine reception? Be careful of the glasses -- mine had a crack all the way up to its opening. Kind of speaks for the entire place.

And, at 5:15, that's what I found. I then went upstairs to a nicely appointed, old-fashioned hotel--at least until I got to the room. The room was like a monk's cell. Cold, no closet ( I was there for a sewing workshop so I had nice garments needing hanging), a mini TV 3/4 of the way up the wall (like in a hospital) and no dresser to put garments in! Weird! But weirder still was, after going for a walk, grabbing a bite to eat and coming back around eight, there was still not a soul in the hotel. It was still dark and cold and there was this slamming noise which sounded like a large door but, since there were no voices or footsteps following the slam, I figured it must be a central heating system. My room was still cold and frankly, I was creeped out. There was no wine as promised, no check in till 6 p.m and the number they left, if I needed anything, was the answering service. I know because that's the number I called to let them know I was leaving and, since I hadn't used anything but the toilet down the hall, would not want to be charged. I got a call the next day at 3, telling me I would be charged for that night, even though I drove to Calistoga and stayed at a more expensive hotel! They said there was a 72 hour cancellation policy. I never even received a confirmation letter saying this but, it is on their website--along with their promises of wine, check-in times, etc. However, since I did show but, couldn't stay, I don't see how relevant that policy would be, anyway.

But it is something. You can go to the little gourmet market which I did and get breakfast if you get there between 7:30-8:00am before it is sold out. Nice market. Has organic apples etc. Just know this before booking. You can walk to most restaurants and they are nice ones. There is parking as well for your car. But this time when I tried to call, no one ever answered the phone. Bed is not bad either. I paid $100/night with tax.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cCentrally located\u201d", "Author": "Larrysd", "ReviewID": "UR5809891", "Content": "We drove up, without a reservation, looked at the room...\"supposedly\" redone...and decided to use it as a base of operations while in the area.

Staff were very nice and the location of the hotel was ideal. However, I would never recommend this hotel. We were put in the Champagne Room, it was very small and there was barely enough room for the two of us and our luggage. The two single beds were awful, my back was completely out after spending one night in them. The shower is more like a gentle rain coming down and I was unable to get the soap out of my hair. When we looked at hotels, this hotel was not the cheapest but chose it because of location, sadly its totally not worth the price or location.", "Date": "June 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cGood Location, But Check the Bed!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3250240", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here during a spur-of-the-moment overnight trip to St. Helena. The staff was friendly, efficient, and willing to give dining and regional activity recommendations. The location is great if you like to spend time shopping and dining on the main drag in St. Helena. And the off-season rates are really reasonable; the hotel included parking for the length of our stay in the room rate. I second the previous reviewer's comments about the doll and puppet fetish -- they're everywhere! The room was clean, with a spacious bathroom, an antique wardrobe with hangers, and a nice selection of Yardley toiletries. The one downside for us was the comfort of our bed. We stayed in the Merlot room, and the sheets were scratchy. By morning, we also felt like the mattress springs had imprinted on our backsides. To make matters worse, a brass headboard was propped up behind the mattress, but it wasn't actually attached to the frame, so the slightest movement in the night resulted in the headboard knocking against the wall. Needless to say, I ended up coming home and taking a 2-hour nap to compensate for the lack of sleep the night before. Before accepting the room that they give you when you check in, I would definitely do a quick examination of the bed to see if it's going to yield a good night's sleep.", "Date": "March 3, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel St. Helena", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g33000-d190274-Reviews-Hotel_St_Helena-St_Helena_Napa_Valley_California.html", "Price": "$177 - $257*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1309 Main St.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">St. Helena</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94574</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "190274", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4d/a4/4da444f89904f3e7fd5cc09fab41ec2a1large.jpg"}}
