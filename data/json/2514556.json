My room had a single bed, a built in desk with a mirror above it, a sink with a mirror, and a freestanding wardrobe/closet. There was a radiator plus an electric heater (\"gas heater\" they told me it was called?). There were two outlets in the room, plus one for a shaver. Breakfast was included in the rate, and consisted of a fried egg, beans, ham, a sausage, toast, coffee or tea, PLUS you could help yourself to any of four different cereals and milk, and several kinds of juice. The location was incredible, right next to the British Museum. (Literally: you step out the door of the hotel and you were looking at the side of the museum. You could walk to the front entrance in about 3 minutes.) The room and all the facilities, while a little old (shabby, some might say) were spotlessly, sparklingly clean. I couldn't have asked for a cleaner place. Also, it was very quiet. I only ever saw another guest in the lounge or at breakfast. Never heard others in the hallway, never had to wait for a toilet or shower. The room and all the facilities, while a little old (shabby, some might say) were spotlessly, sparklingly clean. The tiles in the sink-surround area literally sparkled, which is pretty amazing because they seemed to be pretty old. The toilet and the shower always smelled vaguely like bleach, which, frankly, I found reassuring. I couldn't have asked for a cleaner place. That's the good. The Bad: The shower was very tiny. I'm a 5'2\" women of medium build. The shower was approximately 30\"x30\". Shaving my legs was tricky. Also, there is no shelf or ledge or anything to set your soap or shampoo on. I did feel a little funny about setting my soap on the floor of the shower and then, say, washing my face with it. The little vestibule outside the shower was exactly the same size as the shower, and there was no bathmat. I was turned off by stepping on the wet floor after my shower. I would stay again, but I would bring a suction-cup soap dish, and a cheap bathmat (with the plan to throw them out/ leave upon my departure). The Not Bad but Sort of Nit-Picky: The outlet situation was tough. There was no outlet anywhere near either mirror, and the cord on my tiny travel hair dryer was too short to use. I asked the front desk clerk where I could buy an extension cord, and though he tried to help, he couldn't really describe anywhere that I would easily be able to get to. Once he understood the problem, however, he loaned me a framed mirror that I hung on the handles of the wardrobe. It worked out well, and I was pleased with his willingness to help. A few other things: they seem to be very very strict about the check-in time. From the lounge I heard them tell a handful of inquiring guests that their rooms would not be ready until 2pm. Period. No offer to \"let me see what I can do,\" or anything like that. 2 pm, end of story (which is fine, and fair, but many hotels will try to squeeze you in. From what I overheard it seems to be a pretty firm policy at the Ruskin). Other reviewers complained about the decor. Yes, the walls were pink, the tiles around the sink were yellow, the bedspread was gold, the carpet was mauve, the curtains were blue, and the wood on the desk, chair and closet were all different. Really? You come to London to see things that are hundreds of years old, and complain because the furniture in your hotel is a bit shabby? How someone could pay so little and get such a great location, and yet have the nerve to complain about the decor is totally beyond my comprehension. If you want precisely the same comforts of home, here's a tip: don't leave home. I liked the hotel and wuold absolutely stay again. Overall, I was very pleased. I would stay again, but I would do some things differently. 1) bring a cheap bathmat, plan to leave it/throw it away when you leave.

I am very unpretentious but, sorry, I simply could not stay here. Somewhere in my readings it mentioned internet at this facility. Not true. Only a poor, sporadic WIFI signal. Signal is better in the lounge downstairs which closes at 11pm. Rooms do not have TV, but there is a TV in the lounge, which closes at 11pm. Old carpet. Undiffused fluorescent tube lighting. Comfortable bed. Room reeked of cleaning solution. Toilette clean but bring shower slippers. Management did give me a full refund. The staff was very friendly. At breakfast, which was nice but, alas, no yogurt, I met several people who were obviously fine with the accommodations. I, however, felt like a cloistered nun. For a mere 35 pounds more per night (plus 10 pounds per 24hr Internet usage = oh well) I lodged at the Grange Whitehall across the street and had a very lovely stay.

Within walking distance of three underground stations which make use of the tube quite practical.There are also bus lines that run near by. It is centrally located which makes sightseeing a breeze. I walked to most places and used the tube on occassions. The reception staff is excellent: friendly, helpfull and informative. The staff is knowledgeable about the sights and the surrounding neighboorhoods. If you have a specific situation ask and they shall find out for you. The hotel has a contract with a local taxi company which provides service for the guest at reduced rates. I used that service twice during my stay and I recommend it . I had an early departure from Heathrow and had no clue as to which terminal I needed to check in. The reception inquired as to which terminal I was to depart from at Heathrow and arranged for a cab to pick me up at 5:00AM. The complementary English breakafast is excellent and the breakafast staff is very nice, friendly and polite.I had a single room (G24) with a lovely view of an English garden. The room was quiet and very clean.Confortable single bed and clean linen which was changed regularly ( I stayed 5 nights).Room has a sink inside with clean towels included. There is a space heater in the room and an electric tea pot. I had a shared bathroom which was located near by and kept clean at all times. There is a WIFI connection available if you have your own portable PC. I strongly recommend the Ruskin for someone looking for an affordable, friendly hotel in the heart of central London that satisfies the basic necessities. If you want luxury and frivolous frills the Ruskin is not your kind of place. I would definitely return to the Ruskin.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Macau", "Title": "\u201cSmall room\u201d", "Author": "takako20", "ReviewID": "UR48375924", "Content": "We have a triple room there, the room is very small, especially the toliet.

We've stayed there 3 times and have never been disappointed. True, the decor may be dated and the rooms rather small, but consider these positives: (1) the staff is very helpful and courteous, from the gentlemen at the front desk to the waitresses serving a very fine English breakfast; (2) the rooms facing relatively quiet Montague Street are sunny, bright, and scrupulously clean; (3) the location, facing the British Museum on an elegant-looking street, gives you access to three tube stations and lovely Russell Square is one block north. All in all, once we Americans set aside our expectations about private bathrooms (although these are available, too) and gigantic rooms and beds (and cable TV), it's a great place to stay while sightseeing in London.

The hotel was well run, breakfast was excellent and quickly provided, and the staff was polite and visible, yet discrete. We came and went at our leisure, and the room was done well by the time we got back in the afternoon. Our twin room had only a sink, so we shared the bathrooms on the 3rd floor. Those were clean and available. We had absolutley no issue in that regard. My only complaint is the seemingly thin walls. The people next to us for one night were fairly loud, and the sound came right thorugh the wall like they were in our room.
