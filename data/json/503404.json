As the hotel is a long thin building it does lose some of its boutique feeling if you have a room at the far end and have to walk down the long corridors.

AS the price was the same in booking.com as booking directly with the hotel, we booked with them (i always think you can have a better room if you avoid booking by third party companies...). Our room only have windows in the upper part of the wall, so we couldn't see the street, but I have to say, didn't miss them too much. The decoration is really nice, with a touch of \"rococo\" style, if you get what I mean... Nice bed and beautiful bathroom... Facilites for tea&coffee, amenities... Room was not big, but perhaps cause I'm used to european standards I have to say that it wasn't small. Of course not as big as they are normally in Asia... Had dinner the first night in the roof restaurant, was a nice experience. Good communication by taxi or metro to anywhere in the city. If you are a party person, just in the road in the back there are lots of bars and some restaurants.

The area, near Chinatown, Club St and the CBD was ideal and convenient for me. Hotel itself would be best described trendy and boutique like. Staff are very nice and polite in general. The ramp to the hotel entrance is a bit out of the way so getting a cab could take quite awhile. You\u2019re better off walking down to the main roads to hail a cab. Here are some pros and cons based on my experience. Rooms: I had to switch the room during my stay as the original room 207 was extremely loud from the club next door and the hotel\u2019s bar right downstairs. In addition, the jacuzzi is right outside the room so the noise level from guests using it can be heard very clearly. Room itself was also very small and the balcony looked over the parking garage so not very appealing. Staff at first agreed to move my room but wanted to charge me a higher rate for the \u2018upgrade\u2019. When I did not agree they offered to move me to a room that would be a \u2018downgrade\u2019 as that is all they had available. When asked if they would refund me the difference, the answer was a \u2018no\u2019. Ultimately, we settled on a room change to another room categorized lower but they threw in breakfast for free. The second room, 235 was much better. The room itself was bigger, better functional layout. It didn\u2019t have a balcony but it actually had a door leading outside to a small roof top. The best thing\u2026 it was quiet. Room amenities: Well stocked with necessities \u2013 bath robe, slippers, shoe shining sponge, qtips, cotton balls, soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, tooth paste/brush, mouth wash, hair comb and even a nail file. On the down side, especially for women in my opinion, is the hair dryer. It\u2019s one of those low air hotel dryers mounted to the bathroom sink and the worst is you had to press and hold the button the entire time you are using the hair dryer. Room comes with complimentary bottled waters and a welcome sparkling citrus drink. The in-room safe is easy to use and the mini bar is well stocked. Note, there is no alcohol in the mini bar, just sodas and snacks. Food: For the days I had free breakfast\u2026..Breakfast bar had decent selection of fruit, yogurts, salmon and some Asian selections like dumplings. It wasn\u2019t bad but nothing to rave about. You can also order one item from the menu which is quite nice. I tried the eggs benedict which was okay, seafood congee \u2013 delicious and the noodle soup. The wait staff was a mixed experience. They were pleasant one morning and then quite indifferent the next. Surrounding area: As many posts have indicated, the hotel is near Chinatown where you can do some shopping and have a fun cultural experience. If you long for western bars and pub scenery, go around the corner from the hotel to Club street where you will have no shortage of bars to patronize. The MRT stations are within walking distance but not few minute walk, you\u2019ll need good 10 minutes walking time to get to nearest one. One of the best thing about staying here is the proximity to the Maxwell hawker/food center, literally a minute walk. Really good, cheap food with lots of options~ average $2-5 USD for a nice meal.

The bathroom has a completely see through shower, which was interesting. Nice big flat screen TV, free bottles of juice, comfy bed. The room wasn't huge but we didn't really care. It was very nice and very clean. The lobby is decorated so beautifully, little alcoves with couches and things, all in the scarlet and black theme. My fave was this \"poodle\" statue thing with a lipstick leash and necklace and Chinese slippers. It was all beautifully decorated but with a sense of humor - just so unique. I loved it. And it's a block from Chinatown, so it was easy to get to all of that shopping. The closest MRT is about a 5 minute walk, not too bad, but I would suggest a taxi if you have luggage.

It was also walking distance to the other attractions of Raffles Hotel/City, Merlion, Fullerton Hotel etc... although its less effort to use the very efficient public transport system. We loved our two days in Singapore, we highly recommend a visit (and if you have an awkwardly timed flight out don't worry about getting to the airport early there is a huge amount to do!), and we also loved The Scarlet!", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cFunky hotel near CBD with great atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "mjj11", "ReviewID": "UR121486176", "Content": "Great hotel in Singapore - beautiful interior design with choice of bars and restaurants.

There are also souvenir shops for those last-minute shopping, you just need to bargain. In general, Chinatown is a good base in Singapore for its unique feel and accessibility.

Being part of the SLH group, we could only have expected luxury and sensual delight.... Well, despite the fact that this is a beautiful boutique hotel and that it has a great central location in Chinatown (right across from the Buddha tooth relic temple), we left disappointed. Nothing to say about the staff, absolutely charming and attentive as one would expect in a 4-5 stars. Sadly, the hotel was undergoing some major renovation at the time (their main dining room on the street was closed for redo, and the main lobby entrance too), so we had to use the \"Bold\" bar's entrance lower along Erskine rd and could hear noise all day in the lobby. Quiet unpleasant. As for the room, we were made a nice offer for an executive that we had the opportunity to visit a few days before. Upon booking, we had requested a quiet room. When we checked-in, we were given room 229, which looked really fine besides the fact we expected not to be on the street. Of course the first night was horrible as we could barely sleep: - no double-glazed window reducing the noise from Erskine rd and the parking area on its side - no dark shades in the bathroom so the daylight would enter the bedroom though its glassdoor - no possibility to open/close the windows (no handles) to renew the air - no possibility to open/close the outdoor wooden shutters (one cannot open the windows) - terrible noise from the AC, even when we turned it off Next morning, we reported our discomfort to a staff member, but no special effort was offered, as we were told all the executive rooms were on the street. Too sad for us. We spent the 4 other nights with earplugs & eye night-shades. The room itself was small by very well decored and equipped (nice king size bed, a desk, a closet with plenty of gadgets umbrella, bathrobes, sleepers etc., a safe). We lacked of space for our 2 large suitcases. The bathroom was cute & with a large italian shower and plenty of toiletries. The service & turn down was nicely made every day. As for the facilities, it took us a while to find the jacuzzi and the fitness room, simply because we could not figure out what \"Soda\" and \"Flaunt\" meant. The \"Flaunt\" room was OK with a few machines, a stereo, good AC, a toilet, fresh towels. The \"Soda\" did not appeal us at all. The \"Breeze\" bar & restaurant on the top floor looked really cool for an al-fresco meal and it was packed every evening of our stay... but there was too many other tempting restaurants in the city. Another disappointment was the laundry service. We gave out a bag of clothes to be washed & pressed. It all returned nice and fresh the next day. We were just surprised upon reading the laundry bill that we were charged several extras for... stains! It looked weird and inappropriate for a yet costly service.

First time we stayed in a suite for a couple of nights which was lovely - decent sized room with separate lounge and long balcony with outdoor fans - boutique style decor (our room was slightly over the top) with veiws over the hawkers market opposite and terracotta roofs which is very different from staying down on Orchard Rd and for this reason we would stay here again. On the fringe of China Town and not far from Orchard Rd if thats where your heading. The hotel is lovely and kind of quirky with a lovely roof top bar. Breakfast is good - nothing amazing but nothing to complain about. The gym is tiny (think home gym) and the staff are friendly (although I must say they messed up our booking). Second time we stayed for only 8 hours and took their most basic rooml which I feel I should warn you about. This room was under ground and didn't have any windows . The door only just opened to clear the bed. The room was very small and just functional but difficult if there are two of you with a suit case each (forget it if you are a heavy packer!) - the most space was in the shower! I really wouldn't choose one of these basic rooms if you like space and fresh air - I am not claustrophobic at all but I kept wanting to open the door to the hallway (where there are also no windows on the basement floor). I would recommend this hotel if you are staying for a couple of nights only in a room with a balcony and if you like boutique hotels only - lots of cute little one of local designer shops around and cute little bars - very nice area but not in the modern part of Singapore. Good if you are a young couple or a bit of a fashionista, but not if you like space and service and if you want to be in the heart of Singapore.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cBoutique Beauty in China Town.

If you are honest, when you look at the website and other reviews of this hotel you probably know which camp you are going to fall into before you even get there. I love this kind of boutique hotel and would much prefer to stay in something like this with a bit of character and style than a big name chain hotel or a small bland hotel just because it represents better 'value'. You've probably read most of the reviews about the small rooms and the lack of windows so if this bothers you then don't stay here. There is no denying that the rooms are very small and the lack of natural light is a bit off-putting but, let's face it, you really shouldn't be sitting around in your room in the day whilst you are visiting Singapore. If this is something you are planning on doing though, then dig deeper in your pockets and pay for a bigger room or look elsewhere. Whilst the rooms may be small they are very pretty with chic fixtures and fittings. The bathroom is a decent size though. Also don't moan about the lack of pool or outside space - again, the website makes this clear as do the other reviews on TA. This isn't a huge sprawling resort hotel. We used the hot tub practically everyday after our days out and it made for a very relaxing way to start our evening. There was never anyone else using it either which was a bonus. There are also chairs/loungers around the hot tub area if you want to sit outside during the day. It's very secluded and peaceful. The 'gym' is a bit rubbish though - it's really just a room with some floor to ceiling mirrors in it and the odd hand weight lying around. There a couple of exercise machines but neither worked whilst I was there. There are fridges in there with bottles of water you can steal though should you have drank the ones provided in your room. The roof terrace is brilliant and be warned - expensive - but what do you expect? This is Singapore where drinks are never cheap. Great way to spend a chilled out evening though overlooking the city with cocktail in hand. Ann Siang Hill (where the hotel is located) is a very cool area. You are literally round the corner from some lovely bars and restaurants. And across the road from the hotel is the Maxwell Food Centre, where you can balance out all those SGD$16 bottles of Tiger Beer with a tasty authentic meal for SGD$5. Chinatown is a 5 minute walk too so you are close to street markets for more bargain hunting and cheap tasty food. The MRT station is around there too. I might like super stylish design hotels (which generally I'm sure I over pay for) but I still expect good service and good manners. The staff were pretty faultless in this respect. Friendly and helpful so have no complaints here. The Scarlet has obviously seen better days and could do with a lick of paint here and there but it's still pretty impressive if that's your thing. Of course, there will be better value and more centrally located hotels but for me and my husband (early 30s) who want decent nightlife and access to MRT station then this was perfect.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "intl", "Title": "\u201cAverage, aging design hotel, and quite overpriced.

The heritage building and location are fine but if you are used to staying in 4/5 star properties, including heritage hotels, there will be much about the facilities of this hotel which will disappoint. Rooms - we stayed in a deluxe (one step up from their standard rooms) which I chose because previous reviews said that standard rooms could be without natural light - well this room (108) had windows but they were at ceiling level and you would have to be much taller than me to see out of them, which you wouldn't be able to do as they are a) opaque glass and b) permanently covered by ceiling to floor curtains which do not draw (or if they are meant to then mine were broken!). This is probably because they are actually at street level for the alleyway behind the hotel - witnessed by the fact that from early in the morning there is the sound of trolleys being wheeled noisily past the windows. The rooms were adequately furnished, although very small, but this arrangement gave the impression of being housed in a cellar. Perhaps rooms higher up the building would be better - I didn;t get a chance to see. Also checked in late and TV in the room was not working (no sound) - to be fair the hotel fixed this quickly and efficiently but I would have thought they may have checked this. Finally if you are leaving on a late flight as we were and are unable to get a late check out, beware the facilities offered for changing/showering - we were offered a shower facility on the second floor however it turned out to be a shower cubicle alongside the toilet facilities used by guests of the bar/restaurant several floors up - as you are trying to change you are therefore on noddin acquaintance with the many people going in and out of the toilets - not very pleasant end to our stay.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding location, heritage building and welcoming staff\u201d", "Author": "LondonDonald", "ReviewID": "UR97052539", "Content": "This was my fourth stay at the Scarlet and it won't be my last.

In wanting to convey my feedback to the hotel, I completed the feedback form when I checked out and detailed my experience. It is in fact the first time, I have never received even an acknowledgement for completing the feedback form from a hotel, let alone an explanation as to the hotel's shortcomings. Guess this is a reflection of how important this hotel views its customers. The hotel's concept is unique, sort of a boudoir, and I thought the boutique nature would be a welcomed change from the usual business hotels in Singapore. However, the rooms are very small and with the hotel's concept, feel cluttered. I had paid extra from a room with a balcony, which I would not recommend as it was more of a ledge than somewhere to sit out with a view (I have confirmed all of the rooms with a balcony are like this). Upon being shown to the room, I called reception if I could change to a room with some view, even if it was without a balcony, and was flatly told 'no' (most hotels would at least check and see if there was no availability). The general cleanliness of the room, I found below average and I would imagine this is due to their cramped size, making it difficult to clean down both sides of the bed. I also noted the duvet smelt damp and requested that house-keeping change it before I returned from dinner.

Went to the room, and realized the shower area was bad. The soap holder was spoilt, tilted to the floor, waiting to drop off anytime and the holder for the shower head is spoilt, and as a result, the water would splash out into the toilet area. The hotel pride itself to be sleek and chic, with taglines like passion, desire and romance, but the housekeeping threw my partner's bear on the floor. How romance and passion can there be, when the staff are so poorly trained with their own hotel culture. I wasn't expecting them to tuck the bear in like one of the bay area hotel, but at least not throwing the bear on the floor. I borrowed a pair of scissors from the front desk, and upon check out I told the front desk that the scissors are in the room. Most proper hotel will just ignore it, but this hotel was too poor and too free, and the front desk staff took 10minutes to go into the room, come back and said, he can't find the scissors. They also look v sad and miserable when they realize they had to refund you some money if you had paid by cash. I just told the frontdesk staff, its in the room as I wasn't going to wait for him to go back into the room and find it again.

A very disappointing (and over-priced) stay.\u201d", "Author": "chezzz88", "ReviewID": "UR65277710", "Content": "I stayed at the Scarlet with 4 other friends for one night in late May 2010. I was in a Standard single room, two of my friends were in a Deluxe double room and the other two were in an Executive room. First of all there are good points about this hotel. It is housed in a row of restored old buildings so from the outside it looked very stylish and charismatic. The evening concierge (a Mr. Azan(sp?)) was also very helpful and efficient in giving advice about restaurants and aranging transport. However, the bad points far outweight the few good points that this hotel had:- 1. Firstly, check-in took an inordinately long time (almost half an hour). Even more ridiculous was that despite check in taking so long they still had to stop us on our way to dinner to ask for our credit card details because they had forgotten to do so at check-in. 2. The staff were also strangely inflexible about their processes. It appears that staff are instructed to give an standard introductory speech to all guests while they wait for check-in. 3 of my friends arrived first and heard it first. When me and my other friend arrived later we were sat down and they started repeating the speech from the top. Seeing as my other 3 friends have already listened to most of it could they not have demonstrated some flexibility in not repeating it or at least just subjected us to an abridged version (especially as it did not contain any critical information)? We actually said this to the staff halfway through but were totally ignored. Perhaps this lengthy introduction was to (unsuccessfully) hide the fact that check-in at this place somehow takes very long. 3. When I entered my room I was hit by the strong smell of mildew. When I asked reception for a room spray, the receptionist reacted before I had even before I had finished and I was quickly offered an ioniser which makes me suspect that smells are not an uncommon problem at this hotel (it may have something to the lack of windows and hence sunlight/ fresh air in many of the rooms). 4. There was also a smell of bad eggs which came and went. I think the smell came from the toilet. Given the tiny size of the Standard room the smell permeated through the room very quickly (despite the ioniser) 5. It appears that a lot of the rooms do not have windows at this hotel. The staff rather defensively mentioned as part of the introductory speech (even though we did not say anything) that this was set out in the room description. However, I had checked out the website of the hotel before our stay and do not remember seeing this fact (it may have been mentioned in some obscure corner of the website which I missed). The Standard single room was windowless. The Deluxe room had a slither of a skylight (hidden behind a beam) which might as well not have been there. Even the Executive room's skylight was just a tiny window on the ceiling which reminded me of an oubliette. 6. Before we left we were once again subjected to the inflexibility and even borderline rudeness of the staff. When we arranged our morning call the night before we were informed that it would come with complimentary tea and coffee the next morning. We responded along the lines of \"Excellent. Thanks\". The next morning the morning call came as promised but when we asked for our tea and coffee in the lobby afterwards the staff member we spoke to first looked at us as if we were aliens who have just landed from outer space and then repeatedly asked whether we had ordered the tea and coffee the night before. We told him we had been offered it when we arranged the morning call the night before. After a bit of a kerfuffle tea and coffee was finally brought to us. However, that member of staff came back and told us rather sanctimoniously that we should have asked for tea and coffee the night before. By this point we were all fed up. What precisely is the difference between us proactively ordering tea and coffee the night before and us being offered tea and coffee and accepting that offer the night before?! It was such a stupid little non-point over what was only tea and coffee but that member of staff simply wouldn't let it go and we had to have a second round of explanation/ argument with him. There may have been a breakdown in the chain of communication in the hotel but it was not our fault and there was certainly no reason for the staff to be so confrontational. 7. As an aside, I overheard two girls complaining to the reception (around early evening) that their room was too noisy (although I am not sure whether this was due to the rooftop bar or the bars behind the hotel). In summary it was unpleasant stay due to the poor quality of both the room and the staff. I was lucky to have only stayed one night. The hotel very much wants to be a trendy, luxury boutique hotel but has fallen very, very short. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe the hype...good location but pretentious with the smallest room imaginable\u201d", "Author": "Nicolafb", "ReviewID": "UR64963890", "Content": "Having read the reviews on trip advisor I was fairly confident about this hotel but I must have missed something because having just come back from a 1 night stay I certainly wouldn't be going back. I don't want to be too negative. It certainly wasn't awful and the location is pretty good as it is so near Chinatown although the street that it is on is pretty lively at night ( including the hotel itself) and so you will get lots of noise outside - and we stayed on a Monday night so I dread to think what it would be like on a Saturday night! We may have been unlucky with our room but it was the tiniest room imaginable. I upgraded to an executive room with a balcony as I had read some of the reviews about size of rooms but our room was absolutely tiny. I don't remember the last time I stayed in a room so small! The balcony overlooked a car park so whilst it was large it was too hot and depressing to use it. I would sooner have had the space that the balcony took up added to the room. We both had large suitcases as we had just come back from 8 days in Bali and we could hardly fit them in the room. The room itself was OK but nothing special - trying hard to be stylish but with such a small room simpler might have been better. However the bed was very comfortable, the airconditioning was good and the internet access for free was excellent. We didn't use the bar, restaurant or have breakfast so I can't comment on those which a lot of people seem to really rate so maybe if we had used those it would have improved my experience.

I chose the Scarlet after he was smitten by their photo's on the website, and we weren't disappointed. The building is a gem, both outside and in, with generous use of swagging and draping of lux furnishings to create the boudoir chic that is the hotel's theme. Our room was the farthest located from reception down a series of corridors, but it does guarantee no passing traffic to wake you in the night. The room itself was lovely, less vivid than the main reception areas so much more restful. Be warned that some of the rooms (ours included) don't have proper windows, so although they are lit well enough, if you get claustrophobic you may wish to let the staff know at check-in so they can assign the room you are best suited to. Check in was quick and easy, served by welcoming staff, and this welcome set the tone for all of our dealings with the staff. Upon mentioning to the desk clerk that it was a special occasion, my husband was wished a happy birthday and when we returned from our dinner, we found a piece of birthday cake and a card awaiting him from the guest relations manager. We had cocktails in the rooftop bar one evening, and the range and price is what you might expect from a hotel, but the bar is lovely - views over the rooftops across chinatown. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning, and this is the only area I felt was disappointing. It would be hard for anyone to justify the value for money, but as the price is on par with hotels of it's standard, maybe I'm just not a hotel breakfast person. My personal recommendation would be to eat out of the hotel as much as possible simply to ensure you taste all the diverse food options this amazing city offers. The Maxwell food court is opposite the hotel, and is a great option for meals throughout the day and for beers in the evening. Location in chinatown is great - right on the doorstep for one of the most old-world atmospheric areas of the city.

We booked an Executive Room after all the helpful reviews advised they were better options than the Standard and Deluxe Rooms. We were checked into 231 and when we straight away attempted to put waters in the mini fridge realised that it didn't work - it was piping hot! After flying in on a red eye, arriving in Singapore at 5am and not being able to check in until 2pm we really needed to grab a few hours sleep before going on a walking tour. Staff attempted to faff about to fix the fridge but we asked if we could change rooms so we could check in straight away and get to bed. We were moved to room 224 which was also an Executive but it was a much better room. It had more space either side and at the foot of the bed and the bathroom was twice the size, but was still very small. The previous inconvenience was a blessing in disguise as spending 3 nights in that tiny room would have been awful. The room, and the hotel itself, were very nicely gorgeously decorated and had all the facilities we needed. It also had a very very comfortable bed! The facilities at the hotel such as the bar, restaurant and rooftop bar were all great but it would have been good to have the spa open later (after a long day of touring) , or even have a swimming pool to cool down in. We loved the location of the hotel; walking distance to all the Chinatown eateries and market stalls, across the road from the Maxwell Food Centre, and a short stroll to the Chinatown MRT Station. We ate so much great food, which was very cheap, and loved being in the centre of a more 'authentic' experience. All the tourist sights are a mere train ride away. We had a few minor hiccups, such as the hotel accidentally checking us out after the first night but thankfully the only impact was standing around in the foyer with all our shopping bags for a while. Staff also messed up our airport shuttle booking and didn't think to phone and tell us, but we were able to get a taxi at the last-minute.

Delightful jacuzzi/ sundeck area on the 2nd floor and a great reasonably priced restaurant on the roof. Our room on the 3rd floor had an intriguing view across the rooftops with just a glimpse of one of the many temples. We loved it.

Don't try the local restaurants with pictures of food for breakfast unless you like sweet toast and undercooked watery poached eggs and ghastly coffee. Great cake shop 2 minutes along South Bridge road. Only criticism of the hotel is they don't promote their own facilities enough.

No mention it being of the home of the Singapore sling and the characters who made the place famous. All that is tucked away in the new in-house museum.

The room was huge and had a little desk, fridge, and all the amenities (and DVD player with free rentals at the front desk). The room was absolutely spotless (how very 'Singapore'!) and very quiet.

At that time, it was THE new, hip place to check out in Chinatown and its striking luxe decor was unexpected, considering the original Chinese shopfront architecture. Fast forward five years and now looking for a different area to stay in Singapore, we found ourselves taking a punt on the Scarlet. Thanks to the previous reviewers, we avoided booking small rooms without windows. Opting instead for an Executive with balcony, we found ourselves upgraded to a Premium room on arrival. Thanks to a previous poor experience reported by a reviewer here, we emailed to confirm our online booking had been received and had no problems on check-in. Mind you, our check-in was mid-day, not midnight as our previous poor unfortunate. Judging from the fire escape floor plans, this Premium room has more space than many of the surrounding rooms and we found it adequate, with a small balcony overlooking a roofline, just enough space around the King bed to walk around, a desk area with 2 chairs and an adequate wardrobe. Our bathroom was marble tiled and had a shower, bath and frosted glass door. Considering how timber furniture usually wears, these lush furnishings were in surprisingly good nick. The velvet on the main desk seat was worn but everything else was well maintained. The entertainment cupboard contained a DVD unit, which had a Scarlet-branded Chillout CD in it ready to play and an iPod dock that charged, but didn't appear connected to sound despite some remote fiddling. The door staff, front desk and concierge were attentive and friendly. The hotel only has a cold outdoor jacuzzi/spa but that was a nice enough nook if you wanted to cool off. The gym is functional for a stretch, has a limited multi-function weights machine and a treadmill. As the hotel comprises several previous shop buildings going down a slope, we found our corridor heading downhill a long way before we got to the room, but the hike up and down the corridor helped burn off the Singapore noodles from the Maxwell food centre located across a car park, next door. This food centre serves pretty good local offerings from the extremely popular chicken rice to reasonable fried oyster pancake and radish cake. Chinatown nightlife and more traditional eateries are close by, as is Club street, lined with evening restaurants and bars. Not much shopping nearby but taxis to those areas are easy. The hotel is hardly conventional - there are plenty of tiny rooms as warned in previous reviews, it's stuck in Chinatown and definitely not your usual international luxury chain offering. It is however, well furnished and funky for a small space, close to good local food, a short walk to more alternative nightlife and shows you a side of Singapore that is not Orchard Road.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cSimply the coolest place I have ever stayed!\u201d", "Author": "larryvan", "ReviewID": "UR54479153", "Content": "This was my first trip to Singapore and I spend 2 weeks traveling between three hotels. First of all, Singapore is not a cheap place. A normal room costs $100. I stayed at Robertson Quay and would never go back. The Scarlett Hotel was the same price and SUCH a difference. The people were so friendly and helpful. They let me check in early and gave me a free upgrate to an executive room bc they were overbooked. The room was so clean and cozy, I literally spent the first day in the hotel room! The internet was free in the rooms (most other places charge $30-40 per day). It was a great location in Chinatown and you really got an authentic feel for Singapore. You could walk easily to attractions or take a very cheap taxi. I couldn't decide between staying in the city or going to Sentosa so I did a few days in each. I'm not a city person, so I thought I would like to be near the beach, but I MUCH prefered being in the city. I moved from the Scarlett to the Amara Resort, which was double the price, but I would have gone back to the Scarlett if I could. The Scarlett has this hip cool feel to it. There is a small gym, a jacuzzi (which is actually cold, so go in the day!), and I nice place to eat on the roof.

Located in the heart of Chinatown you are immersed into the culture of Singapore as it existed prior to the dominance of the retail culture exemplified by the huge number of large shopping malls located everywhere in the City State. We had organised Hotel / Airport car transfers through the Scarlet for a very reasonable S$60 each way and were pleasantly surprised to be collected by an S Class Mercedes complete with chilled hand towels and bottled water. This exemplified the level of service offered throughout our stay which was excellent. We had booked a theme suite, and the Swank Suite was decorated in very dark opulent fabrics as expected. As other reviewers have commented, the rooms are small, and even in this suite there was no extra space to store our suitcases. The funky decor and vibe of the Hotel compensated for this however, and we enjoyed a very comfortable 4 night stay. The Scarlet is in the middle of a Culinary Oasis, offering everything from traditional Hawkers stalls one block away at the Maxwell Food Centre (open from late morning onwards), numerous stalls and small restaurants across the road in Smith Street (mostly lunch trade onwards), the basement fresh food markets just behind the Buddhist temple on Sago lane at the end of the street, more western oriented bars, clubs and restaurants around the corner in Club Street. And that\u2019s without even considering the excellent bar and two restaurants within the Scarlett itself, or the other quality restaurants contained in similar converted shop-house boutique Hotels such as 1929 and the New Majestic within easy walking distance. For authentic Chinese cuisine we breakfasted every morning on Yum Cha at Tak Po in Smith Street, fast friendly service with picture menus clearly identifying the food and price, a very cheap meal. We also tried a noodle restaurant Lan Zhou La Mian (19 Smith Street), renown as much for the showy hand noodle making display as for the cheap and tasty food. A small trap to be aware of, bowls of nuts or other condiments such as refresher towels served to you after you are seated are charged to your bill, so refuse them if you don\u2019t want them, although the cost is generally insignificant. For a more upmarket alternative Asian meal, Blue Ginger Restaurant (97 Tanjong Pagar Road) specialises in Peranakan cuisine, a mix of Chinese and Malay influences. We dined at Desire, The Scarlet\u2019s ground level fine dining restaurant, for lunch on the day of our arrival. The food was excellent, and the service good, although the French Maitre d\u2019 came across as typically arrogant and self important, which spoilt the ambience somewhat. We didn\u2019t get to experience Breeze, the rooftop eatery (open only in the evenings) due to the intermittent monsoon rains. Bold, the lobby bar offered a good selection of cocktails, and a fabulously eccentric selection of high backed lounge chairs suited perfectly to the Scarlet\u2019s style. Chinatown is also a cultural haven with numerous temples and shrines reflecting the rich cultural mix of Singapore. The Chinatown Cultural Museum is worth visiting to gain an appreciation for the hardships faced by many of the early migrants who settled in Singapore and contributed to its prosperity.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cgood boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "Singazulu", "ReviewID": "UR52950065", "Content": "Not all the rooms are nice.

OK, a long walk, but I guess I could have asked for one closer. No big deal. The picture from online showed an Executive room with a balcony, or large window. Ours did not have this, only two small windows, so the room appeared a bit dark, as it looked out over a tiled rooftop. No problem for us, since we were sleeping alot and not in the room much. I also kinda like the feel of an enclosed room. Call me crazy, but it feels like a den, all comfy cozy for the Lion. Anyway, the best part about this room was the bed. OH MY GOSH, it was so comfortable. I can't tell you exactly what it was, but it was soft, the cover was light but warm, and the abundant pillows made me want to hibernate. The Lion theme again? The bathroom was also excellent, with a large shower and all the amenities. It looked cool too. The only downside, for me, was that the sliding door to the bathroom had a frosted glass panel in it. And not that you could see anything clearly, you could definitely see the outline of your partner going to the restroom. I like a bit more privacy than that. I assume that other rooms have this door as well, but maybe it is pointed another way and not towards the bed. The staff seemed friendly and helpful, and then ofcourse, as everyone says, the place looks really good. The only other downside for me was the seating in the lobby area. And though it looks cool, it's not the type of furniture you want to sit for a few hours and read, hangout, etc. But such is the look. Didn't try the food and room service, but had a drink on the roof at a place called Breeze. It was very lovely, though expensive. But what hotel is not expensive in these countries?

Anything more than two suitcases and a hand luggage and you will be climbing over the suitcases to get around. The rooms are tastefully decorated, with average mod cons. The bed however is as good as the concrete on the side road below the balcony - possibly the hardest bed I've ever slept on, but if it takes your fancy, you're in luck. The bathrooms are very nicely decorated, however only had a bathtub in the Premier Executive Room, and the sliding door is somewhat see-through. Be wary : Some of the rooms do not have a window, but only a skylight. We were lucky enough to get a balcony on both occasions. The staff are generally ok, however we were unfortunate to have what seemed to be a new starter, who couldn't find our room at 11.30pm.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and the service was impeccable. The restaurant does great food if a little pricey.

The shower was perfect - tons of pressure and no shortage of water. We did not try the food in the hotel as the Scarlet is located close to an Asian food centre and a myriad of food stalls just across the street on Smith Street.

You really have nothing to complain but its size. Apart from physical layouts, it is also worth mentioning that the staff there provide good services. It is so obvious that they want to make everything right for you, and that kind of attitude makes all the difference. One example I can share is that I had to check out early due to my flight. And before I even asked, the Receptionist found out which terminal I should head to already. I found that very thoughtful and useful. Now, move on to the not so positive side. Like what I said earlier, it is true that the rooms are not spacious. And it is not guaranteed that there will be a window in your room, which makes it somewhat claustrophobic. The air-con can be VERY loud sometimes. I consider myself very easy to fall asleep, but even I found the noise quite disturbing. When I visited Soda, (the alias for their jacuzzi, I love they give names to their facilities) I was shocked that there were no clean towels around.

We stayed for a single night, as part of a two-day city trip in Singapore. The hotel's location is excellent, right in the heart of chinatown, within 5 minutes walk of MRT stations, close to the bus, and next door to an excellent food court with loads of hawker food stalls. The hotel itself is built within a row of old peranankan style townhouses, giving an amazing look on the outside, aswell as a quirky yet beautifully dressed up corrider inside. It gave an amazing feeling of staying in something of the Raffles hotel, with a seductive twist. Reception was very helpful with our check-in, and we were in our room no more than 2 minutes later. The rooms are a little on the small side, yet the hotel has used the space very smartly, meaning you have all the typical 4-star amenities plus some tucked away smartly. The dressing and style of the room is just as the name suggests - very burlesque with loads of deep velvets and reds, but all very very stylishly. There's plenty of space to get rid of your stuff, and the bathroom is of a good size also. The hotel goes out of it's way to tick the boxes here too - our room was also decked out with complimentary fruit flavoured sparkling water, and a bowl of dried tropical fruit slices. The toiletries in the bathroom are very extensively stocked and should fulfill most of your needs. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel the next morning, as we were kicking to go out and get a morning bowl of noodle soup (nothing better than a breakfast of champions) from the foodcourt next door, but we did see the spread and it looked very well stocked with many items available a-la-carte to ensure freshness. Checkout was also very easy, and the reception was kind enough to take care of our bags for a few hours. They also helped print out our departure boarding cards as we had left ours home by accident. All in all the hotel is spectacular. The staff are very friendly, the place is very clean, and the location is fantastic. If you want to stay someplace in Singapore, this is the place.

I had read the earlier reviews posted on Trip Advisor and was frankly concerned about the earlier reviewer who did not like the hotel. I e-mailed the hotel ahead to prepare them for an early arrival (1000hrs - local time) and to request a room with a window. Be aware that the three hotels I checked out have a 1400 hrs check-in time and will charge you extra if you check-in earlier than that. The Scarlet Hotel is an exception. Perhaps it was so because I e-mailed them ahead of time. BTW, all my e-mails were answered promptly. I have to admit little put off upon entering the hotel. It is small and a bit quirky. I thought the scarlet (red upholstery and walls) was a bit garish. It rather reminded me of a Japanese \"love\" hotel. You just have to get used to it if you are traveling on business and don't have anything other than business in mind. The staff reception is top quality unlike the experience another reviewer wrote. (Perhaps the management read the review and made changes!) I was immediately checked and taken to my room on the second floor. Certain floors have rather \"too cute\" names, again reminding you that this hotel is best suited for couples. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL FOR FAMILIES. My room was small yet suitable. I have stayed in hotels throughout Asia and this one had all the amenities. The room and bathroom facilities were very clean. In order to add to the ambiance, the hotel has a CD of romantic music left by your bedside. I took this all in stride. What was my company thinking??? I did not have breakfast or any other meal at the hotel. For breakfast, walk out the main entrance turn left, walk up the hill a little ways to the cross-road and then turn left again for the Maxwell Road Food Gallery. Join the locals for breakfast. If you like fruit and fruit juices made with soy milk (does not taste bland at all) you have found your spot. Be aware that the food gallery is an outside covered area with no A/C. The food is great and cheap. I think I got out ever morning with spending less than Sing dollar 10! The hotel has a very small gym. It is not particularly well lighted. You have to turn on the A/C in order to get air flowing. It can be a bit difficult at first. There is a small \"hot-tube\" type pool between the second and third floor. I think it is there purely for show and that romantic interlude. On the roof there is a bar. The bar overlooks the Financial District. At night the view is excellent. It also seems to be a gathering place for the ex-pat community. There were a two groups of women the night I was there. One was a book club group and the other was a farewell party. It is quiet up there unlike the bars on the Quay. Again, it is the perfect place for a quiet conversation or a romantic interlude. This hotel is very suitable for the young or even middle age couple visiting Singapore for a romantic time. There are not many places for romance in Singapore. Most people I ecountered are coming from China (shopping), Britain, OZ and the U.S. (for business). Be aware that Singapore is hot and humid. Subways are very efficient. The variety of food is excellent. The hotel is within the confines of Chinatown. Several taxi cab drivers I used did not know the hotel.

I informed them their price was 8 or 9 percent higher than the listed internet price. They insistently responded both prices were the same. I asked them which price would I pay and why do you have two different sets of prices for the same room. The hotel staff responded, by saying their price includes the hotel exchange rate applied to the bank the internet price does not include exchange fee. I told them, \"I'm not paying cash so why would you quote me the cash rate in the first place? Don't most customers pay by credit card as well? Then why would you quote me a higher price when most likely I am paying by credit card. You should ask the customer if they plan on paying by cash or credit and then quote them the correct price based on their payment method, not automatically quoting the hotel exchange rate price.\" They simply responded with a muddled look.

The room was horribly claustrophobic and over-dressed. When we stated we had asked for a window, the Reception woman who showed us to our room just wasn't interested. In the morning we complained and spoke to a different Receptionist who moved us with no problems and we had a window this time. Breakfast was nothing special in the over-dressed breakfast room. But on the last day there appeared to be a work conference on and there was a sign at the bottom of the stairs leading to the restaurant indicating it was closed due to the function. When we asked where we were supposed to have breakfast, which we had paid for in our booking, the same unhelpful Reception woman just pointed outside and told us to go and find a restaurant outside somewhere! My other half complained at this point and suddenly we were allowed into the breakfast room and there was no function on inside. But we just felt awkward and that we had to hurry. We would never stay here again. For the most part, things just seemed too much trouble for the staff. The narrow corridors wound on forever and were very claustrophic - if they had a fire in there, goodness knows how you would get out in a hurry, particulary from the 'basement' rooms (where we were put initially).

But I don't think it's so much the hotel's fault, but Singapore in general. This city-state is getting more and more expensive, and it's a shame but it's true. Anyway the hotel is fine, biggest let down were small rooms. I got upgraded to a deluxe room and all it had for a view was a skylight. The bathrooms need to have a little more attention paid to them, esp. with regards to caulking. Mold was a problem around the shower door hinge on the floor and around the sink. Gross. Bathrobes were a nice touch, as was the blazing Ethernet. Breakfast was not included but who needs it with the Maxwell hawker center close by? I thought this would be all worth it, but lots of vendors are closed for breakfast. And as expensive as taxis are now, I would rather just stay at the Intercontinental and be linked to the MRT at Bugis station...the IC costs more but you get a pool and better access. Here at the Scarlet you have to walk all through Chinatown's touristy stalls to get to the hot and humid MRT at Chinatown station here, an annoying pain making your way through the maze of touts and sweaty tourists. No pool either. Rooftop is pretty nice at night though. I went up there with a friend and no one came over to offer us anything. Which is just as well considering how expensive drinks are. Good thing there is a 7-11 literally steps away, but then there is just about everywhere in Singapore. Stylish to be sure, but the velvet is frayed around the edges so to speak.

So what's good and what's bad? The good things are the hotel's dining facilities on the lower level and roof level. Gorgeous boutique hotel (ie pretty \"high camp\" if you know what I mean, but done pretty well) atmosphere and great food and great service. So the birthday event went really well and I'd book the place for a function if ever I needed to. But the bad things are that we decided to stay the night. We booked a deluxe room and on being shown the room, our first reaction was that we'd cancel the booking and go back home to stay as the thought of staying in a tiny (extremely tiny) room with no windows was not something we had any intention of doing! However we were told if we paid $130 more we could have a better room, so we agreed (in a moment of madness) and were shown a room on the 2nd floor -- exactly the same size as the first but with a deck -- obviously the deck cost $130 a night, which is pretty pricey given the amount of time you would spend on a deck overlooking a little alley and a multi-storey carpark! The room decor was great and in keeping with the rest of the 'over-the-top' high camp decor of the hotel, but it gets hard when there is barely enough room for one person to walk around the bed (which is only a double in size). Like with many of these boutique hotels, they're great when they're new but sometimes maintenance is a bit lacking. Ours had a broken shower nozzle, a soap dish in the shower that was nearly falling off the wall, curtains that needed some readjustment as there were off their tracks and difficult to close, etc. They are small things but when your bill ends up being $480 - for one night, which is what the price of an executive room with balcony is when you include the 10% surcharge, the GST and breakfast for 2, then you feel a little ripped off. I would never stay at the Scarlet again, but I would go back for dinner, drinks or hold a function there. (By the way, our friends stayed in The Swank suite which we also saw -- so instead of one little room they got two little rooms but one was a lounge area and they had a slightly bigger deck, but to be honest for the money, if I could stay anywhere in Singapore (within reason), I'd stay at the Fullerton Hotel -- where we've stayed many times and where everything is always perfect!! ).

Overall it was a very nice experience, with only a few small issues. The first issue for many people could be the decor. The designer appears to have been allowed to go mad and do whatever he wanted, as long as he stuck to a \"Bordello\" theme. It is very over the top - lots of lush fabrics, gilding, striking patterns and whimsical statues of naked angels. The pictures on the web site will give you the idea. While I found the decor quite entertaining and well designed, if your taste runs to the minimal or to Laura Ashley chintz, then the Scarlet may not be for you.... and I imagine that if you were staying for more than a couple of days, you might be craving a bit of stark minimalism fairly quickly... We stayed in a Swank Suite, which was quite large by Asian hotel room standards - a small lounge room, separated from the bedroom and bathroom by a windowed corridor lined with heavy curtains, and a balcony which ran the length of the suite. There was not much of a view from the balcony (into the apartments next door) but it had very comfortable chairs and a lounge. It seems from many other reviews, however, that if you aren't prepared to pay for a suite, your room at the Scarlet will be small and windowless. If you're not going to front up the fairly hefty cash for a suite, then you might be disappointed. The suite had wonderful air conditioning, and fans on the balcony. The bed was very comfortable. We were given a lovely fruit basket and free water bottles on arrival. The suite is well appointed with a safe, umbrella and all sorts of other handy extras. Breakfast was ok, and the staff in the dining room were very helpful in making up a breakfast tray for me to take upstairs after my boyfriend decided he wanted to sleep in... The hotel is very handy to Chinatown and a short walk from a Metro station. Problems are only minor ones - the bathroom door is see-through, and so when you turn on the bathroom light during the night, the entire bedroom is lit up like a stadium. Not good if you are a light sleeper. The shower tends to run off into the rest of the bathroom. While the door staff were very helpful and friendly, the desk staff seemed a little out of their depth at times (although they certainly weren't rude, as some reviewers seem to have experienced). I enjoyed the Scarlet a lot, and would quite happily stay here again.

Despite the smallish rooms, they were decorated very nicely and had all the necessary mod coms. The facilities were inconvenient, so luckily the location was great for being out and about. Chinatown was on your doorstep, so very convenient for cheap, good food. Worth taking the tour bus S$23 pppday, which took you around singapore and u could get on/off whenever at the bus stops. The stop on north/south bridge road is the nearest and only 5 mins from hotel. Staff are very friendly and so no complaints there. Can't comment on the breakfast as the beds were so comfy, we missed it every morning! But plenty to choose from in the chinatown food stalls and very cheap!!

The hotel's lounge/bar isn't bad, but the social scene is very weak. What really made my experience at the Scarlet bad was when I wanted to mail my rent (I live in NYC) to the landlord located in NY. I discussed this with hotel patrons and their assured me that the mail will be sent that day (June 26).. Upon my return to NY I found out that the landlord received the check on July 13th, with a posted date of July 7th. The hotel actually kept my mail for over 10days and never informed me of it.

The exterior of the hotel is great. The furnitures in the lobby are cute and funky (great background for nice pictures), the first impression that you get while waiting to check in is really nice. The front desk staff are generally helpful and polite. But that is all about the things that are nice about the hotel. First the location, though it is right next to Chinatown, it is not exactly very near any train station. You have to walk like 15 mintues in the hot humid weather of Singapore and that is really not quite enjoyable especially if you're out all day and want to get back to the comfort of the hotel as soon as you can. The rooms are small small small and we were told we were already given one of the bigger rooms! There is hardly any space to walk between the bed and the TV. There is only a walk in shower (though the water pressure is good), no tub. The 'jacuzzi' that they had is really really pathetic. Very small and located on one side of the hotel that can only be accessed by a particular lift. So unless you stay on the same side of the hotel, you basically have to walk through the lobby in your bath robe, past a nice fancy restaurant to access the lift. EIther that or you have to wear your street clothes and bring all your gears (swim sutis, towels, bathing things etc) to go there and change. Given the size of the jacuzzi, it's not really a huge draw factor. Also, they posted on the web saying you pay $200 for a usualy $250 room as a 'promtotion'. But it is really just some business tatic. What they did was they took out the 'breakfast' component. What kind of 'promotion' is this when you're not getting everything? Then we have a rude incident. My husband and I were taking pictures OUTSIDE the hotel and got stopped by one of the hotel staff who not only very rudely told us that we cannot take pictures of the hotel (we were happily snapping away INSIDE the hotel and was never stopped!), worse thing is he stayed and make sure we pack our cameras away and keep glancing back while he walked away to make sure we don't 'sneak' out our cameras again! Overall, a very dissappointing experience.

This is certainly a place of quality design - but in the interest of being a boutique hotel it in effect does what, say, South Beach Miami does - charge you for the interior design, not for the quality of your USE of the room and hotel. I decided to get one of the suites - knowing the rooms would be small based on other traveller's input. I wanted a desk to finish working on my novel with, a quiet place to be, a lush and sumptuous experience. Indeed, this is an ultimate place for romance and it works for a very brief (3 days, max) stay. It's around the corner from the beginning of Chinatown (historical), is indeed right next to Maxwell Food Centre (hawker center), about 15 min leisurely walk to the nearest MRT and otherwise not really NEAR the heart of Singapore - Orchard Road. The room itself has sumptuous designs, and a tv with hardly any channels. Couches not really meant for sitting on - more for looking at. A desk with a chair not really meant for sitting at for more than 30 minutes (imagine me trying to work!). A beautiful shophouse verandah with fans - that was pretty awesome, and it had a chaise longue I admittedly never used. Since the Suites are entirely different from the rest of the hotel I have to balance the review - I appreciated the sexy decor, the sleek trappings - but things were so overdone that I'd rather they have made things more practical. At the very least, do NOT make me pay S$440 a night when the bed is hard and there are 5 TV channels, no dvd player, no movies, a limited room service menu, and no phone by the bed! (It was in the bathroom ... and in the living room ... but not by the bed.) There was no simple on/off light switch - instead, a 5-button lighting \"range\" system. No space for your luggage rack and suitcase. Correct - doormen were almost never at the door. Sometimes - only sometimes - if it rained someone would appear to help you in/out of the hotel with an umbrella. I often had to lug heavy bags of shopping on my own from car to the door and elbow my way in. They behave like a boutique hotel - a phone for the belldesk, which is 10 feet from the front desk. You'd call and have to \"be connected\" to the belldesk. It would ring endlessly. No one would answer. I'd call down again, ask again, wait again. Then have to *leave a message for the bellman to call me back.* You chalk this lack of ease and amenity to their not being as well staffed as a major hotel. It still isn't acceptable for the price you're paying. I was \"accidentally hung up on\" multiple times in the course of my stay. Put on hold and forgotten. Etc. When I was nice and easy going, things were slow, didn't really get done, I was left to fend for myself. However, when I got bossy and began to do things like say \"I need a taxi right now\" or \"I need you to fetch a box for me to ship to the USA\" - they'd make a limp effort to help. BUT - at the end of the stay I left a tip and guess what? They were all smiles and entreating me to return. I think not. I'd note the women of the hotel are generally lazy. Singaporean women are kind of 50/50 - some are unbelievably sweet, but anyone around 25 or younger has an attitude and acts like she doesn't want to be at the front desk or it's a pain to be doing her job. They generally look like they're sulking. Case in point, I walked into the 7-11 down the block (these are EVERYwhere) and saw two workers and said nothing expecting they didn' t want to be bothered with dealing with a guest (and vice versa). One was female, one was male. The guy made a point to say my name, wave, and greet me, smiling. The girl looked flicked a look at me, rolled her eyes, puffed on her cigarette, and then pointedly ignored me. They were both in uniform, and we were all literally at the end of the hotel block. I assume they were on break. I would buy snacks and bring back dinner from other places, eat them in bed, set the tray on the floor by the bed before sleep. Next day - the staff had cleaned their own dishware and leave the dishes/old food *where it was* - festering, still on the try, by the bed! This happened multiple times. The room service was fine - prompt delivery, nice staff. Restaurant very sexy, food pretty good - you can get more amazing food elsewhere for less, even of high restaurant caliber (try the spanish restaurant on Club street - fab!). But nice staff, sexy ambiance, great for couples. Really great and extensive drink menu. You do get little nibbles in your room on your arrival - little dried fruitbowl, fresh fruit bowl. Everything super pricy, drinks, restaurant, room service. Agreed, furniture takes up a lot of space. It's not necessarily bulky, just more interested, again, in design, not function. You want to be able to move around the room and have space for your suitcases and shopping and not to have to \"strategize\" your belongings. Bathroom was, as all Singapore hotel bathrooms are, lovely. Black marble, sexy and sleek. New and satisfying, rejuvenating. Lighting in the bathroom dim, however. Not much of a lip between floor and shower, so some leakage. Bath products frequently refilled from Flair, the boutique store next door (with which they also decorate their hotel rooms - the garbage bins, leather dining trays, glassware, etc.). My suite has an entire wall of shophouse window doors so I cannot speak to the darkness/window element, but the hotel is 3 floors tall (they fake the \"4th\"), and on an incline. Thus, the farthest corner is underground. Also, considering I had a suite - and paid what I paid - it was interesting that the cleaning cart was perpetually - and I mean PERPETUALLY, day and night - parked immediately outside my door and the elevator next to my door. Not very sexy. Sometimes it had a custom cover on it, sometimes not. I was so busy not being in my room that I never checked out anything else in the hotel. Oh, but note that for a place with a gym and jacuzzi, these guys don't have a business center! There is, however, free internet in the rooms. The plug is not necessarily anywhere convenient for you to use (the desk with the uncomfy chair). And the universal power outlet is only by the desk so, if you want to plug in things like cell phones or a travel radio anywhere else in the room - good luck.", "Date": "February 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNot recommended\u201d", "Author": "Rosamund", "ReviewID": "UR6787299", "Content": "At first the front desk told me that only premier rooms were available, at S$300+++ per night.

The skylight gave us plenty of light. The rooms are well equipped with thoughtful items such as umbrellas provided which was particularly useful for ourselves as we had forgotten ours. The bar up on the roof is fantastic and the cocktails are a must. The service we received throughout was fantastic - particularly from the concierge (Raymond - if i recall correctly) who booked us dinner tables etc very promptly and efficiently. We didn't try the restaurant but from what we could see it looked very nice.

My girlfriend and I wanted to find a place where we could spend a night together and celebrate her birthday. We came across the Scarlet Hotel at the ---- website where it was categorized as a boutique hotel. As there aren\u2019t many boutique hotels in Singapore, we were curious to find out more about the Scarlet and decided to stay there. We placed a reservation thru AsiaTravel for a 1-night stay in a Standard Room from 7 Jan 06 to 8 Jan 06. After making the reservation, we came across some reviews on Tripadvisor where guests who have stayed at the hotel complained that the hotel rooms were small and had faulty air-conditioning and water faucets. As I was going to celebrate my girlfriend\u2019s birthday at the Scarlet, I wanted to make sure that the Scarlet was the right choice. As such, I requested (from the hotel) to view a Standard room, 3 days before check-in. The hotel staff obligingly acceded to my request. When I arrived at the hotel, one of the front desk officers told me that all the Standard Rooms were either occupied or were being cleaned. He kindly showed me a Deluxe Room on the first floor, which he said was quite similar to the Standard Room in terms of amenities like the DVD player and the bathrobes, but Deluxe rooms were slightly larger. The moment I entered the Deluxe Room, I was very impressed with the interior d\u00e9cor. The room is small when compared to Deluxe Rooms of the city area hotels like The Oriental and Marina Mandarin. However, the efforts made into making the room plush and elegant outweighs the small room size. I also want to add that the hotel staff who showed me the room was very patient and acted as a good guide when I requested to see the hotel facilities such as the jacuzzi \u201cSoda\u201d and the restaurant \u201cDesire\u201d. After viewing the room, I requested from the hotel that they provide me with the following for my stay: \u00b7I wanted red rose petals to be laid out in the room, bed and bathroom before check-in. \u00b7I wanted a room which is located away from the lifts or noisy areas for privacy \u00b7I wanted a room with a skylight. I understand from the hotel staff and the Tripadvisor reviews that standard rooms either had a skylight or had no windows. The difference was that those with no windows had king beds as opposed to queen beds for those with skylights. \u00b7I wanted to order a cake for my girlfriend\u2019s birthday but the hotel offered a complimentary cake, which I appreciated very much. I must mention that 3 days before I checked-in, I had made some phone calls to check with the hotel on the rose petal arrangements with the florist, etc and the different hotel staff were very patient to help in my queries. If they had promised to call me back to confirm on some of my questions, they would. This is the type of service, which I expect from a fine hospitality establishment. On the day of the check-in, the front desk staff made sure that the check-in was smooth. One of the staff actually accompanied us to the room to open the door for us. She mentioned that the hotel had prepared a lighted candle in the room so she had to make sure that the lights were switched on at the correct time. The location of the room was as I have requested. It was located in a corner away from the main corridor so it was quiet and we could not hear the noises of the people walking past our room. When we entered the room, I was wow-ed. The pictures that I have attached to this review speak for themselves. The strengths of the Scarlet Hotel which I have experienced from my stay, can be summarized as follows: \u00b7Good hospitality service where the staff is attentive to the guests\u2019 needs. It\u2019s the staff who bring out the best in the hotel. I want to highlight that I have reserved a Standard Room with the Scarlet, which is the room with the least cost. Yet, I was offered the service equivalent to that of a guest who might be staying in the suite. I am impressed by this and would like to urge the staff of the Scarlet hotel to continue, if not exceed this level of service. I am sure your guests will choose to stay with you during repeated visits if they feel at home (which I did) at the Scarlet. \u00b7Detailed attention to the d\u00e9cor of the hotel interior and the rooms. The rooms are plush if not lavishly designed. Leather ice cube holders, waste bins, shoe holders and even a leather coat for the chain of the door latch reflect the intricate attention to details by the hotel\u2019s interior designer. Designer bathroom toiletries \u201cFlair\u201d and amenities and the bathrobe make a shower refreshing. Some of these items in the room can be purchased from a specialty shop \u201cFlair\u201d located outside the hotel. The shop\u2019s website can be found here ----. \u00b7A cosy hotel in the midst of Chinatown where shops and food are available. We were at the Scarlet when the light-up in Chinatown for the Chinese New Year took place. There were fireworks and we were lucky enough to catch a good view of the fireworks display. If you are looking for a hotel where room-size, facilities such as a swimming pool are key consideration factors, you might be able to get the room that you require in another hotel for the same price. The downside is that you would be missing out on what I have listed above. If you are interested to find out more about the Scarlet and to make sure that it meets your expectations, you can check out the hotel\u2019s website, where a fact sheet is available. ----. The fact sheet is accurate about what the hotel has and does not have to offer. One of my conversations with the hotel staff touched on the fact that the hotel\u2019s website did not provide sufficient pictures for potential guests to have a better expectation of the accommodation and facilities offered by the Scarlet. As such, one area of improvement that the Scarlet could consider is to provide more pictures of the hotel accommodation and facilities on its website. For locals, I believe if you give the hotel staff some advance notice, they would most likely be willing to show you the rooms before you decide to stay with them. Last of all, I would like to give my most sincere thanks to the staff at the Scarlet hotel for having done an excellent job in making my stay a pleasant one.", "Date": "January 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLovely Scarlet\u201d", "Author": "spbyrne", "ReviewID": "UR4250966", "Content": "Why is it that Asian hotels seem to do it so much better than their European and American counterparts?
