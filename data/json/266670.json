The location is excellent, away from the touristy bit, overlooking the lovely Hermitage museum and the Amstel canal, this is a very lovely budget hotel that you can find in Amsterdam. Do not expect 5 star facilities, but everything works for its purpose. The room was very clean, with fresh linen and very comfortable ber and pillows. Bathroom spotless as well. We did not try the breakfast as it was 9 eur per person, so can not comment on that. The best bit is that all guests can enjoy free drinks(coffee, non-alchoholic beveregs.tea) in the breakfast room on ground floor, a very pleasant perk for the guests. Yes, the walls are a bit thin, and you might hear other guest but this is an old, charming Dutch building so I would say that is quite normal. Stff was efficent and helpful, will give you all needed information and are quite knowledgable. I would recommend this hotel if you are using it as a base for your trip in Amsterdam.

We both had our own single rooms. His was on the second floor and mine on the 4th. His single room had a shower and bathroom but mine only had a sink as I had a separate room down the hall that was my own private shower and bathroom. If you stay in room 408 as I did you will have a separate bathroom which I didn't really mind (also my room was slightly larger since it didn't have the inside bathroom.) The hotel has a nice boutique feel to it and is very narrow and cosy and close to most things - Amsterdam is a walkable city - Our Hotel was 20-25 minutes walk from Central station and we could get anywhere we wanted within 30 minutes walk... There were only 2 problems with our stay - the 5 days we were there they were relaying the brick street in front of out hotel so starting at 8AM on the weekdays you could hear the constant clankety clank of the men outside working. I slept with earplugs on which solved the problem. Luckily the men did not work on weekends. Unfortunately my friend on the second floor whcih was practically street level could hear everything because they have his window permanently ajar about 4 inches with a wooden beam so the noise comes through. The last issue we had (and it's something I read about this hotel from another review) - When we checked out and it was time to pay - they told us the credit card machine was down and could we pay with cash. Well since my stay was only 230 Euro's total - I was able to do so. Can't imagine what would happen to someone that was counting on paying with a credit card and did not have the cash. Pretty sure it's a scam because the Hotel probably has to pay a fee to use the credit cards and would rather avoid those fees. Other than that the Hotel was fine.

I was there with a friend from abroad because we thought it would be fun to stay in a hotel after a concert in Paradiso. But it wasn't fun at all, for me. After reading the reviews here and seeing the pictures, I too was convinced by the modern decor. But in my opinion, the whole black&white&silver theme is just a cover up for everything that lacks. All I need is a good bed, and a cup of tea before I go to sleep, which was not possible. It starts after entering the very narrowl hallway with the receptionm, which is faced sideways. We where helped by the man with the long hair aswell, and yes he was nice. However you couldn't pay with a bankcard (weird) so I had to go out to get cash. The receptionist said he needed my ID while I would get money from a cashmachine! What? I said no, this felt wrong, never experienced this before. This al felt very dodgy to me. I also do not appreciate people who run a company in the Netherlands, not speaking dutch. I am very international and speak several languages, but in my own country I expect to communicate in dutch! Thankfully my friend had cash on her, cause really , I am not giving my passport to anyone.The guy joked that they would only use it for making fake ID's. But why should I trust them with my passport, if they can't trust me I will come back with money to pay the room? In our reservation it said we would have the small twin room on the 5th floor, but we where given the \"nicer \"room, which was located between the reception and the breakfastroom.(which means you hear people walking in and out, you hear the staff, you hear the breakfastroom being set up and an unsafe feeling cause there are no locks on the door and the hotel has the door open 24/7). At first glance, yes it looks nice. but look a little harder, and you discover the looks are just a decoy. First the mosquitos, they where everywhere, I am covered with bites. they where even in the shower. Then the lack of remote for the tv (no problem for us, but if you stay there longer it might be) no tea&coffe facilities eventhough it said every room in this hotel would have. The lights near the beds didn't work. which meant if you had to go to the toilet during the night you would have to find your way in the dark to the main lightswitch. and then the bed. It was the worst I have ever slept in, and I've slept in some crappy situations. It was rockhard, I didn't even know hard matrasses that hard existed, it was torture, my whole body hurt. And the the odd smell, which I found out came from the wall nex to my bed; it was completely wet, with the wallpaper coming of it. Not only did this smell nasty, but for me as I am asthmatic, it meant I coughed all night. It was also very very hot in the room, but leaving the window open was not really an option as it faced the backyard where people where walking in and out, also we already had enough mosquitos inside anyway. The bedsheets which where too small for the matrasses, looked very poor. You don't care for the nice decor after all this. And really, you can't call this a designhotel (which I have seen stated here and there on the net), think ikea, it may look nice but it's just cheap. It's just a decoy. the most important thing in a hotelroom is a good bed, and it was horrible. Only the next morning I found out, after being amazed that my friend actually did get some sleep, that her matrass was completely different, and somewhat softer, She was shocked after trying mine for just a minute. Also, she did not sleep against a wet, smelly wall. which by the way is not just unhealthy for people with astma, but in general. I guess I chose the wrong side of the room. That night in that hotel, on the rockhard bed, near the wet wall , in the heat, being accompanied by mosquitos was hell to me. Therefore I would not recommend this hotel to anyone , unless you really don't care about anything than a roof over your head. I couldn't wait for it to be morning (no sleep all night) and ofcourse we did not try the breakfast for 9,95 euro, you can get real coffee and good food elsewhere for this money. I wanted to get out of there a.s.a.p. When we checked out there was a cranky older woman standing behind the reception to whom it was apparantly too difficult to say good morning. After waiting for minutes she finally grunted ; yes? As in what do you want. After we said we wish to check out she asked; have you payed for the room? Well yes, in cash might I add, she just kept looking at us. Why don't they keep track of such essential things?Than finally she asked if we had questions (?) then we got our bill. They couldn't even bother to spell my name correctly, I was referred to as Melaine both in person as on the bill. It also still had the old name of the hotel on it (again, weird).Never had such a weird experience both with checking in and checking out. Dodgy!! what's with the paying cash (or with credit card against an additional 4% charge) what's with the wanting to keep your passport, are they so afraid that after seeing just the reception you will not come back? Why not invest in sheets that fitt the matrass, even if it would be the cheapest they could find. The only thing that was ok was the bathroom. although it is tiny yes, everything worked fine and it was clean. But overall; horrible! Never again.

Single room (shower across corridor) breakfast E50 per night. The shower was not en-suite (all other rooms are) but i was the only room using it and it was spotless. A power shower in Amsterdam is a plus. Room was comfortable and cleaned/changed every day. Breakfast served between 8-10am in pleasant dining room. Standard Dutch breakfast served each day (could have used more orange juice) was sufficient. The only thing my room really needed was a small fridge that would keep down the cost of constantly eating out. The area is within easy reach of everywhere, (100 yards from skinny bridge). It is only 2 metro stops and 5 tram stops from central station. The main advantage is that there is no tourist traffic whatsoever even though it is a main canal route. If staying for more than a few days this can be a bonus after the novelty of staying in a more touristy area wears off. The email exchange and subsequent booking by phone was excellent. The owners and staff are friendly and helpful. There is no curfew. I would recommend this as a base for exploring the wonderful city of Amsterdam.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cSuper place\u201d", "Author": "JRGreen", "ReviewID": "UR2060952", "Content": "We just stayed at The Fantasia for 7 days - after reading all of the great reviews we thought it was worth a try and it certainly did pay off.

Rooms were cleaned every day (rare for budget hotels in Holland). Not quite as conveniently located as some places in Amsterdam but much more quiet, so well worth it.

It's easy to find, less than a 2 minute walk from Waterlooplein station which is 3 stops till Central station though you can walk to central station from the hotel in just over a quarter of an hour. The rooms aren't exactly spacious, there's no restaurant or bar but you couldn't beat the service, location or price.

We were a little worried about the location of the hotel but although we didnt walk into the town centre (we had a 3 day tram pass) we were sure it wasnt a very long walk. The only problem was the stairs which were very steep but we were certain the exercise was good for all of us.
