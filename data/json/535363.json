IF YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THE SIGHTS OF ROME THIS IS THE PERFECT HOTEL!!! we went here for our honeymoon for 3 nights in august. we had originally booked to stay in the arcadia hotel but due to horrible reviews i changed to archimede at the last minute and i am so glad we did! it was a very peaceful hotel and we did not have disturbed sleep considering it was right in the centre. people had said the rooms were small but they were medium sized not small at all, a large double bed, built in wardrobe and chest of drawers with a bathroom with shower, bath, sink, toilet and bidet, also included in the room was air conditioning(not extra charge), and sky tv (not that you should need it) we used it for music whilst we were getting ready to go out. the maids cleaned every morning and we has fresh towels and bedding everyday. breakfast was very simple and very continental my husband was not impressed but i didn't mind it, croissants, limited cereal, a couple of juices and ham and cheese with rolls. so if you are expecting a full English you will be disappointed. it is a matter of taste. the hotel is a 2 minute walk from termini station which is the main train station in rome so it takes you everywhere! from the station you get coaches, buses, underground and trains. when we arrived at the airport the coach to termini was straight outside the door at bus line 1 and then i saw the hotel as we pulled up at the station so no danger of getting lost! the airport was no longer than 40 minutes from the station and it cost us 8euros each return ticket. there are lots of restaurants and bars around the hotel and the station. on our first night we decided to go for a walk and after 20-30 minutes of walking in a straight line from the station we were at the Colosseum!!! it also took us no longer than 1 hour to get to all the main sights on the 3rd day we decided to go to the Vatican and used the underground which was 1euro per person to go wherever you wanted there was also a choice of an all day ticket for 4euros per person to get on and off as many times as you liked. once on the underground it was 6 stops to the Vatican and we noticed that it was 1 stop to the trevi fountain and all other attractions were a couple of stops on the underground so if you don't fancy walking lots it was easy to get from the hotel to all the sights. the locals were friendly enough if you tired to speak Italian a little they would then help you. there was a \"spar\" shop just by the station to get all sorts of food bits for days out and it didn't seem to be much more expensive than home. we went for dinner every night and there were so many restaurants to choose from we spent no more than 40 euros on dinner each night. we found a few little pizza shops for lunch they are all around or we took a picnic from the spar shop. we found a great little snack bar which served a jug of beer or other drinks and when it came out with it came a cheese pizza, mini sandwiches and crisps this was all for 10 euros and filled us right up till dinner time and we had only stopped for a drink. there was lots of beggers and homeless they could be very intimidating but we were told to keep distance and ignore them at all times. there were a lot of police around so you felt safe. once a man was looking to try and get in to our bag and followed us down the road but after a few feet there were three police cars and he backed off. one thing i would say about the hotel is CHECK whether they are going to charge you roma tax upon check out some people did and some people didn't we were not told anything about it by the hotel or the travel provider until we checked out and had a bill for 24euros (3 euros per person per day) i hope this review helps you :-) mr and mrs perkins x", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff\u201d", "Author": "SanDieganTraveler201", "ReviewID": "UR116735284", "Content": "I had a great experience with a helpful staff at the Archimede.

The location, two short blocks from the Roma Termini station, makes it very convenient to hop the Metro or bus to visit any location in the city. The rooms were on the smallish side, but our family of four were not interested in anything but a place to sleep and get cleaned up. The main bed were twins stuck together, with two cots on the outer edges of the room for our kids. All of the mattresses were firm, and comfortable. The air conditioning worked well, and our room had a window that could easily open and let fresh air in. Americans who don't travel to Europe much might be thrown off by the lack of shower curtain in the bathroom, or the fact that there doesn't seem to be washcloths in Italy. But we don't blame the hotel; this is a cultural thing. The breakfast was typically Italian continental and decent. The staff was helpful, but sometimes a little too busy to answer questions in detail. Bonus features: there's a laundromat (not self-service) around the corner from this hotel, and try the Trattatoria Gemma alla Lupa around the other corner.
