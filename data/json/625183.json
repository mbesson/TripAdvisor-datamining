Aircon is not on in April and in any case the weather outside was in the low twenties but it was still hot. Housekeeping staff speak no English and room service very little. Breakfast was OK but uninteresting. I've seen better in B & Bs Rooms were large and moderately clean. There was a great shortage of electric plugs in the room and the desk was 1 metre long which is no good if you have business work to do. Internet was on/off every few minutes. Methinks their server is overloaded. There was also a shortage of drawers in the room if you wanted to unpack for a few days stay. TV only had foreign channels and it took them 3 days to put BBC on the menu after much complaining. There's a train line just below the hotel and if you have your windows open it sounds like a 707 is passing when a train passes by! I took the hotels Airport shuttle to Attaturk upon my departure. Nothing more than a \"dolmus\" yet it cost 90 Euros for a 35 km trip which took under an hour. And there was me thinking that transportation was cheap in Turkey!! Ripoff ! Hotel was booked but not paid for by my Client. ca \u00c2\u00a3100 per night incl breakfast", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMy First Istabul Experience\u201d", "Author": "Costasxlv", "ReviewID": "UR124385835", "Content": "This was actually my company's preffered hotel. It is situated on the Asian side of the city, it is very close to the see side but not recommended if you are planning to see the touristic Istabul, being very far from the european side. As a hotel it was decent and clean, the personel was very helpful but their english skills very limited! Also, the food at the restaurant on the 10th floor was good, with mainly turkish delights ! For my next visit in the city, I would prefer a hotel closer to the european side in order to see the highlights of Istabul !", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSome good points, some bad points\u201d", "Author": "sambuca2011", "ReviewID": "UR112173584", "Content": "The actually hotel is really nice, the bedrooms are a good size and very clean. Each day there seemed to be something missing, no bottles of water for making tea/coffee, no bath mat, no toilet roll, no tissues, but these were replaced if you asked at reception. The airconditioning in the room was pointless, it was cool if you stood directly under it, but did nothing to cool the room down, meaning that you woke up sweating and the room was so stuffy that it made me feel ill. The breakfast was great with loads of choice, the restaurant for evening meals was nice with an outdoor area which looked out towards the sea. The waitors and bar staff were friendly, although the language barrier was a bit of an issue at times. The swimming pool area was nice with plenty of sun loungers, although the pool was too cold to get in, even with the sun shining on it all day. There is a \"spa\" which tend to be left without anyone running it most of the time, I tried to arrange for a back massage and never found anyone to do it! The sauna was nice, and the Turkish bath was nice, althoguh we weren't sure what we were supposed to do whilst in there! We stayed for five nights, and on three of these nights an \"event\" was held, a childrens party, a school graduation and a wedding, our room was on the 7th floor, the events hall was on the tenth floor and we could literally sing along to the words of the songs as the music was so load, the parties went on until about 2330hrs, so if you are a light sleeper don't expect much sleep. The location of the hotel wasn't great, it was quite difficult to leave the hotel by foot as the pavements were very poor, and even when you did leave there wasn't much to see in the local area. The road and railway line outside the hotel were very busy and noisy.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cout of the way\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR108000447", "Content": "we stayed for the grand prix weekend, check in ok room though looking bit dated. we had triple room, there was Enough room for us all and luggage but beds were broken and v uncomfortable. also we were road side so v noisy. no air con only a blower/heater which wasn't great. 5 am wake up calls from the local mosque as well but u get use to that. food ok but al s carte. staff friendly. if you want sights then don't bother the area is v v v run down either go up the coast nearer the ferry port or south towards the harbour. as there is nothing there. no restaurants or anything of interest.

Not for tourists though as you are at least 25 minute drive from Taksim and a ferry ride or expensive & long taxi journey across the river to the tourist areas of the European side. You would really stay here for business in the local area. Its mainly the old industrial area so forget popping out for a decent meal as theres nothing around, so its hotel food which isnt too bad in the restaurant. The rooms are large as are the bathrooms and pretty quiet, double beds, tv etc. New carpets are currently being laid throughout. Careful if you are staying on upper floors, for some bizzare reason the rooms become uncomfortably hot & this was in January with the windows open! Think all the heat rises through them from the other rooms, its strange & the A/C only streams hot air in winter so u cant use that either!
