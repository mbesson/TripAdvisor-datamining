However I was pleasantly surprised. The location is great for Kings Cross and St Pancras, with easy access to the tube for getting around London (it's about a 15 minute tube ride to Leicester Square). There's not much to do in the area but nearby are McDonalds, Starbucks, Subway, Tesco etc, perfect for a snack. The room was spotless. Ours was overlooking a courtyard area in the middle of the hotel so we weren't disturbed by any tube or travel noise (which to be fair you expect in central London anyway, especially if you book a Travelodge so close to the railway!!). There's a bar on the first floor which is open til 5am, however we went in there at about midnight after an evening out and were the only people there. If you're concerned about noise from the bar, ask to be on a different floor (we were 2nd floor). The bed was very comfy, only small problem was that it was very warm - as with all these places, the windows only open a tiny bit so it can get a bit stuffy. Plenty of towels were provided. There was some noise of people passing by in the corridor on their way back from nights out, but this didn't last long and was expected as we stayed on Friday/Saturday nights - it's probably even quieter in midweek. Check in was very quick as when we got there, there was no queue. Staff were very helpful - the man on reception put me and my friends in opposite rooms although we hadn't booked together so hadn't expected to get rooms close by! So that was a bonus. My friends' room was overlooking the tube but they said the noise wasn't too bad at all, it didn't disturb their sleep and as I said before it's what you expect when you book next to one of the busiest train stations in London!

The only reason I have only given 3 stars is the fact that the hotel is very noisy, the room we had faced the street and although I had fun people watching it got loud at night (police sirens in London run all night) and there was a fight on the street outside. The only other negative comment is that we waited 15 mins in the bar before someone turned up to serve us although when he did he was appologetic.

They are locked into this position by a steel cable and there's nothing you can do. This, according to the notice stuck on the window, is 'for your safety'. Personally I would have thought it was safer, in the event of an emergency, to be able to open the window to shout for help, or to allow access for the fire brigade. If it is a question of child safety, then it should be easy to install child locks on the windows for parents' use. Instead, we are all being treated like children.

The view from the window was a bit bleak, but you really only need somewhere to sleep and shower when in London. The bed was very comfortable. We opted for the continental breakfast. It was basic and probably a bit overpriced, but adequate. The location is excellent, as we were travelling to and from Kings Cross Station. The underground being so close was great and you can walk into the West End in about 30 mins, which we did a couple of times. The only real negatives we had were there were 2 of us, however, they only provided one bath towel, which meant someone would have to get dried with a wet one. We got an extra towel from reception, but unfortunately, the maid took it away again and didn't replace it!! The other was that they could do with putting something on the corridor fire doors to stop them banging shut. You expect to have to hear some noise from the corridors etc but the banging of the 2 doors near our room was a bit irritating, especially at 5.30am!!!

We talked to the receptionist on arrival about this who informed us even though they were oversubscribed that night she would not refund any of the money we had accidentally paid to them. My company probably books 100- 150 rooms per year with Travelodge and we all felt that this was a very poor level of service given the amount of business we give Travelodge and has made us as a company try to avoid the whole of the Travelodge chain since this experience. When I eventually got to one of my rooms I was greeted with one of the worst rooms I have ever seen in any branded hotel chain. I counted 14 pubic hairs in my bath. The wall paper was either missing of hanging off in large areas of the hotel. There was mould in the corners of the room, the furniture was very tatty and the whole room had a bad musty smell. When I complained about my room to the receptionist she took a very long time to sort it out and in the mean time was laughing and joking with her colleague while I stood there waiting! Very poor service. The room I was given after I complained was better in the respect that it had no pubic hair in the bath. My colleague actually took the time to write to Travelodge to highlight the disappointing service we received but one month later we have still not received a reply. I am not surprised as it appears that Travelodge has absolutely no interest in retaining it's loyal customers over many years.

The bathroom was cramped - the door almost scraped the toilet bowl when closed and the shower although hot and powerful was not the cleanest and had black grouting. Sleep was hard to get as there were screaming and shouting teenagers running up and down the corridors and slamming doors. At breakfast the next morning we saw our first member of staff who looked like he'd rather be anywhere than there. The breakfast room is the bar and definitely not worth the price asked - however, no-one checked our vouchers so we could easily have eaten for free! Check out was done with a grumpy member of staff just pointing and grunting at a key drop box! Not a pleasant stay!

We arrived late at night with two very grumpy kids. What a nice suprise we got when we arrived. The travel cot was all set up, the room was basic but clean and it was right at the end of the corridor at the back of the hotel so was very quiet (the occassional train sound, a police/ambulance siren or two and a few uncouth and inconciderate people coming in late who made a noise but that was it) The only grumble was that the bathroom door wouldn't close with the toilet lid down.

When we arrived the woman on reception was less than thrilled with the fact that we wanted both a twin room (which I booked a few months in advance - paying extra for early check in) and a quiet room (which I had rung ahead and asked for). I got the impression that as far as she was concerned I could have one or the other but not both. I got both tho. My room was downstairs but there was no lift so I had to lug my suitcase down them (and back up to leave). The room was adequately clean and tidy. It had tea and coffee facilities although the cups and kettle provided did not look the best of cleanlieness so we boiled and washed a couple times before using. All bar one day they provided two sets of towels and when we asked for a second set we were given them. One massive problem I had was with my quiet room. I can sleep through more noise than my friend so it would have been ok for me. But he needed to shut the window to get a decent nights sleep (trains were not the problem. It was ambulances, fire trucks, police cars, people etc). However as this Travelodge is in an old building there is no central heating/air conditioning which in 21 degree made things rather warm. I think there must be a way to install such even in an old building. I didn't try the breakfast or the bar (there was an abundance of places to eat in the vicinity) so I can't comment on these. I also didn't use the wifi as I thought it was rather expensive. There are computers in the lobby which cost \u00c2\u00a31 for 20 minutes which my friend used. The location was quite central to everywhere we wanted to go so this was good. Overall it was what I was expecting from my a traveloge. If you are wanting a hotel, book into a hotel.

Upon leaving Kings Cross station, bear left and head towards the traffic lights. Look into the distance along Grays Inn Road and you can't miss it. It is literally a 3-4 minute walk across the road. Upon the advice of other Tripadvisor reviewers, I called ahead a day in advance and spoke to Monique on reception to request a quiet room. This was swiftly done and Monique said \"see you tomorrow\" which was a nice touch. Good start! When we arrived, the reception staff were friendly and welcoming. We checked into our room which was Room 128 on the first floor. We had a view which seemed to look out onto an inner courtyard and the other side of the hotel so we got some natural light in the room which we weren't expecting! I noticed immediately that the room was very hot. It was a very warm and sunny spring day in London and we'd just had a walk around the city, and were tired, so I attributed it to that, but I made a point of looking at the heater on the wall just in case and it was switched on. I left it as I presumed it would be cold by the time we got home that evening! The room was surprisingly spacious, the bedsheets were crisp and clean, only one pillow each (a spare was provided in the wardrobe space if required - it wasn't), there was hanging space with coathangers, and a large desk area. The bathroom was fairly small, but perfectly functional and spotlessly clean. The shower was powerful and hot although the head was in a stationary position on the wall and was not removable/adjustable. Again, thanks to the advice of previous Tripadvisor reviewers, I checked the number of towels on the rail and there was only one large bathsheet and one hand towel. Not enough for my partner and I, so I made sure I requested an extra towel in advance and this wasn't a problem. I would also say they were a bit stingy with the toilet paper - we had enough - just - but it literally ran out as we were checking out, so I'll knock them down half a mark for that too. We paid \u00c2\u00a335 for the room on a Sunday evening, booking through the official website 2-3 months or so in advance and for Central London, this really is exceptional. We only needed somewhere to get our head down for the night/shower in the morning after a concert and this not only met all of our requirements but actually exceeded them.

We were offered breakfast when we checked in but declined as we were leaving so early. I thought that the building was the nicest Travelodge we have ever seen. The receptionist told us that it was old housing offices. This conversion did however mean that our room was on the fifth floor, and the lift only went to the fourth floor, we then had to walk up some very windy stairs and narrow corridors to reach our room. Part of the charm for me, but could be difficult for anyone not so steady on their feet. Only one of the two lifts was working. There was a coffee machine in the lobby area but it was marked out of service. When we returned to the hotel later in the evening there was a drunk sitting in the doorway which was a bit off-putting, but I can understand why the very young staff on reception would not want to try to do anything. The room only had a shower rather than the usual shower over a bath I expect in Travelodges. There were towels provided as well as a small bar of soap, and plastic \"glasses\". We had a double room, which has one double bed, and a sofa bed. There was a television, which worked. The room was spotlessly clean, and very quiet for inner city London.

I picked it because it was convenient to walk to station / place of meeting and because whilst basic, you know what to expect with chain hotels. On arrival I had to dash out quickly again so ordered a taxi with the intention of dumping my case and being back downstairs by the time it came. The receptionist did not point out the lift but told me to go up the stairs to the 4th floor (nice of her!). When I got to my room the key wouldn't work. So I went back down and she gave me another to try. This also would not work. She told her colleague, who took me back up to check the same keys I had in my hand. Meanwhile my taxi was waiting, and yes his meter was ticking at my expense. When she established that I was correct she told me that she had not brought her own keys (!) and would have to go back for them - whilst waiting I noticed that the television had been turned up in the room I was trying to get into - I notice that this happened to another reviewer so I think there is a problem with their room allocation!!

However, this hotel was on a whole other level. When reviewers say that they could have been sleeping on the platform they are not lying! The noise was not helped by the badly fitted, insufficient windows which don't fully seal when you shut them. The train noise was unbearable, went on until late and started early but I figured that there would be at least a few hours sleep in between. Little did I know that the windows were so thin that you can hear every bar emptying its glass bins into the skips and workers on the railway line are not that considerate when working overnight. Shouting to each other and banging until the trains started again. After trying and failing to at least get an hour I went down to the continental breakfast to get a cup of tea - no such luck. No hot drinks available, the milk was in the process of turning sour and I don't know about anyone else but I don't like having chocolate chip muffins for my breakfast.

I overlooked the Thames Link railway tracks, I could tell you when the next train was because the tanoy announcement was so clear, even with the window shut. As well as better double glazing the hotel should seriously consider air conditioning or at the very least a portable fan. The double bed was spacious but a bit soft for me; that said I slept well, despite the heat. Whatever you do do not take advantage of the breakfast!. I did and regretted it. Served in the Cafe Bar, I say served but it really was self service in every sense of the word. Hot drink is dispensed from a machine; juice was bitter, the milk was warm and the fruit had seen better days but the best (worse) was the croissant. Now I can eat croissant which are cold but these were pre-packaged (so cold), greasy and flat; ....very flat, as though they had been squashed beyond all recognition.

Because it was a special trip I booked another hotel anyway for the second night, the Savoy, again at discounted rates. I wish I hadn't because the Travelodge was what you would expect, and the location to the train station is both good and bad. Good because you can be on the Tube in 5 minutes but bad because you do here the trains, so I would not recommend the hotel for light sleepers, but having said that only the rooms that back onto the train line are affected, as my daughters room faced the other side and she could not here the trains.
