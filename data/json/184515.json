It seemed to be unusual - up a quiet suburban street in an old area of Toronto - nearby Queen Street had many eclectic business, including great restaurants and a couple of bong shops (yes, I was astonished). But the location was alarming and the exterior appearance was off-putting (old brick and it didn't look like a hotel). The Alexandra used to be a self-help retirement facility - small rooms with cooking facilities. It looks old and run down, but it's actually comfortable and very clean, and I'd stay again. No restaurant there so a walk to Queen Street to many eating places is the daily program, or buy food and take it back - the rooms all have a microwave, cook top, small refrigerator. The central heat is a ceiling thermal system that was overwhelmed on a really cold night - so it's not the Ritz - but it is a ten dollar cab ride to the downtown business district. There is no pool or amenities of any kind. But it is in the $80 range (except during peak periods when they want $100 plus tax). Toronto is an expensive city and this is about the cheapest accommodation in town - but I would stay again - it's a bed, it's clean, and it worked for me. They also have wi-fi and that was a help. And local phone calls are only 35c apiece - however the wi-fi was chronically slow at times and they have the nerve to charge for parking - $5 a day. Their website says it is downtown - which it is not - but it is a $10 cab ride so it's not too far out. It worked for me. I've rated the rooms as poor - because they aren't average - but they are clean and livable. The website ( http://www.alexandrahotel.com ) has photos which make it look better than it is - but it's ok - just ok.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel, a few streetcar stops from downtown Toronto\u201d", "Author": "thor_74HH", "ReviewID": "UR125101768", "Content": "I have been to Toronto twice before and stayed virtually within spitting distance of Dundas Square. For my stay in February 2012, I chose this hotel, because rooms were advertised to have a small pantry. The hotel is located a few stops by streetcar from Dundas Square/Eaton Centre. There are basically three streetcar lines (on Dundas, on Queen and on Bathhurst) and you can walk to Spadina Ave. I did not feel unsafe, even when I returned a bit later at night. Also, the hotel is still located within walking distance of all major downtown attractions if you take the time to stroll down the streets. (Something I like to do anyway as you see the city you're visiting differently anyway, if you walk around a lot.) The room is resonably sized, although I have to say, that the pictures I saw on the hotel website give a larger impression that my room was in reality. The pantry was actually directly beside the bed - you could reach into the fridge lying in the bed. (Which I guess for some can be an advantage...) My room was clean, but it could use some renovation and that made room and bathroom appear a bit unclean. Furniture and cupboards have seen their best days a few years back. Front desk staff is very helpful and friendly. Upon check-in you'll get a key to the front door downstairs as well as your room key. Parking is charged extra. I arrived early and it was no problem checking in at that time. Still, the hotel offers a good value for money. Just in my case I could have booked a special offer in the downtown centre at an almost similar rate. Otherwise, it's a good place for anyone staying in Toronto. I would not do any more cooking than maybe making toast and tea for breaktfast.

Having said that, you get what you pay for. The hotel shows its' age and in some places (i.e. hallways, lobby area) shows some \"grimy\" spots. The rooms themselves are on the smaller side, but if you're just looking for a place to put your suitcase and sleep, the size is fine. As for cleanliness, it's certainly not the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, but it's not the best either. The sheets and towels were clean, but there were a few stray hairs in the bathroom. The carpets are old and I would recommend keeping your shoes on. The room we stayed in had a double bed and a single bed, along with a desk, a TV, mini-fridge, range, microwave, sink and cupboards.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind saving a few bucks and staying in a \"lower end\" hotel. My wife and I don't mind saving a few dollars if it means that the hotel room is less than spectacular. During the daytime, the neighborhood was great - at night time, not so much. There's a park behind the hotel and each morning, quite a few elderly folks were doing their morning workout. At night, there were a few \"vagrants\" around the neighborhood, but I didn't see anything too bad.

Its excellent value for money. I'm a single woman staying here on my own at the moment and I feel completely safe in the area as long as I do not venture out too late at night (this is the precaution I would take if I were anywhere unfamiliar). The rooms are equipped with a small kitchen (with all appliances - including plates/cutlery), a bed, sofa, desk, dining table, TV, Internet access point (no WIFI so please bring your own cable - although they will rent you one if you dont bring it yourself!), Air Con (although this produces a weird smell when I put it on so tend to leave the window open instead), double wardrobe and a bathroom with shower/bath. Each floor has its own laundry (although I haven't needed to use this yet) and its generally very quiet at night. From the 6th floor I have amazing views of the CN tower and city. Everyday my room is cleaned, the bathrooms are cleaned and towels are changed. My bed is made and any washing up I have to do is done! The maids are very considerate and friendly. As for the area around the hotel - it's mainly residential with a park behind the hotel (wouldn't like to go there late at night) and a small school right next to the complex. Access to the centre of the city is a 30 minute walk down Queen Street West which becomes better the other side of Spadina. Infact its a very trendy area, with lots going on and lots and lots of shops. Behind the hotel, and a short walk up Spadina takes you to the famous Kensington Market. Not much further and you are well into Chinatown (one of the largest!). Walk south and you are about a 30 min from the CN tower itself and also the harbourfront. I was nervous about coming to the accomodation (after reading a few reviews) but have not had a problem yet. The area on first sight is a bit daunting but as you integrate yourself you realise it for what it is - a multicultural residential area with the small shops making this place very diverse.

If you are looking for an inexpensive option in a vibrant neighbourhood, consider the Alexandra. All I can say is that those who have complained about the neighbourhood have misread the signs. This hotel is just off Queen Street West. Our taxi driver knew exactly where Ryerson street was. It's between Bathurst and Spadina. Queen Street offers a vibrant caf\u00c3\u00a9 culture and great boutique shops. The Alexandra is a stone's throw from Chinatown on Spadina, and within walking distance of the Roger's Centre (Skydome) and even downtown. The Queen streetcar is 100 metres from the door. There aren't many \"dangerous\" neighbourhoods in Toronto, and this is certainly not one of them. It may appear a bit frayed at the edges, even rundown to some. But it is as safe as any large city area can be. As for the hotel, we stayed a week and had a great experience. Even the staff were friendly to us, although we might have been lucky. Indeed, we had a major problem that was quickly and amicably resolved. In one of the rooms (we had three) there was a strong smell of what seemed to be urine in the bathroom. We assumed that it hadn't been cleaned. It turned out that it was someone cooking something very smelly in the next door room, and it was filtering through the air vent. We were quickly and courteously moved to another room. Which brings me to another issue. You may see this hotel advertised as offering \"suites\" or \"apartments\". Suites these are not, and they are definitely not apartments. They are two-bedded rooms with a kitchenette in the room. In some rooms (we saw four and all were slightly different) the kitchen is only a few inches from one of the beds. It would be very cramped for more than two adults and one child. Still you can cook (although there are cheap options for eating out, especially in Chinatown) and the fridge is useful. All things considered, if you were staying a while in Toronto, this is a good option.

Taxis are plentiful and as cheap as chips if you want to head over to the CN Tower (which is actually ace) and chain stores etc, it's really a short distance, I walked it every time without a second thought.
