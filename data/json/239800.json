Breakfast ALWAYS closes early so, if they say it's open until 10:00 and you get there are 9:45 almost everything is put away, which makes you feel uncomfortable and the restaurant closes on the weekends, Friday, Saturday and Sunday except for breakfast and room service shuts down on the weekends. There is also no security at this hotel what so ever. The gym next door that you have access to is pretty nice, but the staff isn't and they have signs which say Hotel key and photo ID required, No Exceptions which makes you feel uncomfortable before you even walk in to workout. I have stayed at much nicer Hilton Garden Inns and think the management needs to make sure that the Hilton offers more than this hotel.

Just a block off the 'main drag.' Parking is across the street, and the front desk will give you passes if you ask. There's a little cafe across the street and the food is awesome. The hotel has breakfast - for $12 you could have access to: fruit, granola, yogurt, scrambled eggs, potatoes, biscuits, sausage and bacon, cereal, bagels/bread, danishes, Starbucks coffee, an omelet station and waffle station. Great if you want a hearty breakfast, but if you're a light breakfast eater, you may want to find some place else and not waste your time or get a muffin from their pantry (located right by the front desk). The pantry was a pretty good idea - beverages, snacks, toiletries in one convenient spot. Of course, you're probably better hitting up the Walgreens (open 24 hours) a few blocks down if you want to get things cheaper. The hotel is also only a block from Fez - check it out to get a burger or drink! There are also other restaurants within walking distance. The rooms in the West Tower are a bit more updated than the Cabana rooms. My room (west tower) was alright - carpet was fine, comfortable king size bed (you can adjust the firmness), chair and ottoman, desk with ergonomic chair, pool view, metal luggage stand (in closet, ironing board, mini fridge, microwave, and TV. The bathroom could have used some updating - mainly the shower. Also - water pressure was really not all that great. It's a shame - they have the showerheads with the adjustable streams (mist, massage, etc.) but because the water pressure was so low, it didn't really matter what setting you had it on. My room also had an adjoining door to another room - I imagine you would be able to request something like this should you need it - which could be a plus for families if needed (although, this is not really a 'family' hotel - more like for business trips/adults.

This one is comparable to most, but definitely is not a standard HGI. It is in an older partially renovated hotel, so not the typical HGI layout. Most of the prior comments are on-the mark. Yes, some units you have to walk outside to another building (tower), yes, it is hard to find the dining room, and yes, the parking lot is a hassle - located on the other side of an office building from the hotel. On the plus side, the parking was free, the room (and bathroom) was very spacious and well equipped. The heating/cooling system worked well and was quiet. On the negative side, the room was not real clean - shower tiles had some mildew in the caulking and the carpet appeared dirty. Second, there was a shortage of electrical (AC) outlets - 4 for the entire room and all were in use - including a large extension cord that allowed two lamps and a clock radio to plug into one outlet (fire safety?). Although there were 3 plugs on the side of the desk for electronics, CPAP users will be dismayed to find there were no outlets by the bed available unless you unpluged a lamp or clock from the extension cord. When will hotels realize that lots of people with sleep apnea use these medical devices by their beds at night. Why can't they get lamps with AC outlets in them - like many hotels (and other HGI's) do. This was a big issue for me. If I was in this area of town, I would probably return because overall it is a decent hotel and meets my basic needs, but it is nothing close to being as nice as the Hilton in Chandler, or many other HGI properties.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "PMaloney", "ReviewID": "UR54746817", "Content": "I stayed here for 3 nights.

I have stayed at various HiltonHHonors properties in the Phoenix area, and decided to stay close to the downtown area this time. After search for good rates, I decided to try this property and wasn't a bit disappointed! Once I got to the property, checked-in, and decided what I wanted to do, I realized the new Metro Light Rail line was less than 2 blocks away! (The Indian School Road/Central Avenue stop is the one you want for this hotel). The light rail takes you east to Mesa, and north to Montibello Ave/19th Street. This was the way to get around when you don't have a car! The staff were very helpful and very gracious, very accommodating, and some of the best I've experience!! The property isn't your \"typical\" Hilton Garden Inn, this was apparently a hotel of a different name at one time. The common areas and rooms are dated and showing wear and tear, and need a re-do. The entire property could stand a major face lift. That's my only negative comment, everything else was outstanding. As HiltonHHonors Gold, I got an upgrade to a king suite - very spacious and perfect for an extended weekend trip. I loved all of the room! Breakfast coupons were also available. The breakfast offering is buffet with made-to-order omlets and waffles. I figured it was just another HGI standard breakfast buffet. I was amazed at how good the scrambled eggs were, along with the breakfast potatoes! This was one of the best breakfast buffets I've experienced in awhile. I could eat this every day but would gain more weight than I would like!! Great food, good service. The hotel does not offer lunch or dinner - the property is among corporate midtown Phoenix, so weekends are very quiet. Perfect time to come for a get away! The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle within a five mile radius -- a trip to Biltmore Fashion Park was a nice change of pace. All in all, this was a great experience, the property is in the midtown area of Phoenix. If you don't have a car, there are various restaurants you can walk to, or just hop the light rail ($10.50 for a 3-day unlimited pass) and head downtown. The Heard Museum and Phoenix Art Museum are 2-stops from the hotel. If you want to do in-room food, a Super Target is a light rail ride to the north at the Montibello/19th Avenue stop.

The hotel public areas are fine, though a little odd and chopped up. Our concern was with the room and the bed.

The room was on the second floor and had absolutely no view except for the roof, which raised some security issues, as someone could have entered our room through the window. A bigger problem was the bed--it was so soft, with no support, that any movement made by one person could be felt by the other.
