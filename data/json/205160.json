Let me start with the negatives. There are no tea/coffee making facilities within the rooms. Cappucinos are available in the lobby area but they cost 5 euros each - definitley overpriced. You only get one hour free WiFi per day. It costs 9 euros if you want access for longer. Given that it only costs hotels about 65 pence per day to provide this service, I think it's a little unfair. The room price was \u00a3140 per night. I thought this was a little steep for what it was but I understand that Rome is an expensive city. At one point I asked a member of staff for the address of a bar. Whilst he looked it up, I happened to mention the district that it was located in (just to provide more information) but he cut me off rather abruptly, clearly not wishing to be distracted. I felt it was a bit rude of him. Now the positives - the rooms are a pretty good size, the lifts are quick. breakfast runs up until 11am. The location is pretty good - it's not especially close to any of the major sites but is within 15 minutes walk of many of the sites - e.g. Vatican to the West, Piazza Navona to the South and Spanish Steps to the East. The chap at breakfast advised us of some gluten free restaurants and he also provided some gluten free products at breakfast - he was very helpful. We did have a few other (fairly minor) issues but the hotel dealt with them in an efficient manner. Overall, this is a pretty good hotel.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTh\u00e9 best hotel in Rome in terms of location and quality for money\u201d", "Author": "Cmuteppwr", "ReviewID": "UR127882848", "Content": "Th\u00e9 best hotel in Rome in terms of location and quality for money", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel with bigger rooms\u201d", "Author": "FoodNomad53", "ReviewID": "UR127610960", "Content": "This is a nice place to stay just across the river from Piazza del Popolo and the old historic center. I prefer an even more central location to Visconti (e.g. vicinity of the Spanish Steps & Trevi), however, with the Visconti Palace you do get rooms that are roomier than almost all hotels in the very center, and you're really only about 10 minutes walk away anyway. The breakfast is always good at Visconti, but the coffee isn't as good as you'll find at the many bars around town. The beds & linens are always very comfortable (I always sleep well at this hotel). Our bathroom sink was not draining properly but the problem was fixed immediately after we called about it. WiFi only worked decent in the lobby and the login procedure is unnecessarily tedious (however, once you manage through the login maze, the signal strength and speed are fine, but only from the lobby). I have stayed at this hotel 3 times in the last 25 years and do not hesitate to return, and do when my #1 location hotels are booked or over-priced.

Excellent, personal service in the restaurant and bar, very helpful receptionists, discrete and efficient chamber maids. The breakfast buffet is OK, (ask the waiter for a cappucino). Beautiful garden terrace and patio. Nice little restaurants in the neighbourhood. Visconti Palace is only on a 15' walk of Vatican City, Piazza del Popolo, the Spanish Steps and Piazza Navona.

Upon arrival check in was easy and our luggage was taken upstairs by bell boy I think mainly cause elevator is too small to fit 2 of us and the luggage. Lobby was very nice just like on hotel pictures, clean nicely kept, modern. Room was not as great but good. Green dated carpet had white stains on it which was not very pleasing. Breakfast was excellent can find food for absolutely any taste. On our second or third night we got to the hotel around 11pm and noticed there was no hot water, I thought we had to wait for it to warm up but that never happened so I took quick freezing shower and called it a day. Next morning there were still no hot water, so I went down to find out and they told me that they been working on it since yesterday and they are sorry. So we went on with our day upon return in the eve water was back on. Internet is also a big catch there. They give you an hour free but when you logging In you have to be careful to select free hour because if like us you use either iPhone or iPad you don't see whole page on the screen and don't see the area where you need to choose free hour as oppose to 9 euro per day which is their defult. So when we called to say that we made an error they said there is nothing they can do and even if we used it for 15 min we had to pay. I would expect hotel could compensate those 9 euros for luck of hot water but they did not feel the need for better service.

If you prefer to be in a residential neighborhood situated among the homes and local businesses of native Romans, and away from the crush of the typical tourist zone, this is the place to stay. If you enjoy being able to walk to several unpretentious (but delicious) local restaurants that are predominantly frequented by its Italian-speaking neighbors, this is the place to stay. We enjoyed 5 nights at the Visconti Palace earlier this month and would stay here again in a heartbeat. When we arrived at approx. 10:00 a.m. after an overnight flight from Atlanta and were greeted by hotel staff (with a smile and in English!) and were told that our rooms were ready. The two hotel elevators were small (typical in Italy) but they worked well and came quickly. We judged the beds to be firm, but quite comfortable, and the size of the bathroom was similar to a typical American hotel--large by Italian hotel standards. Rooms had a small/mid sized flat screen TV with access to the typical Italian channels and many in various European/Middle Eastern/Chinese languages, including a few in English (British TV). We found the daily breakfast buffet to be very good and a great way to fortify ourselves before we headed out to see the sights. You'll find scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, a variety of cold meats/cheeses, yogurt, fruit, lots of breads/pastries, juices, coffee, tea, cappuccino and espresso--so there's lots to choose from. We ended our days with a bottle of wine/prosecco in the lobby lounge area, where the service was professional/polite, and included a variety of olives, chips, nuts (complimentary) that were served with the reasonably priced wines. We didn't get to experience the rooftop lounge area, since it was a bit cool and it drizzled off and on during our stay. The Visconti is a block West of the Tiber River, between the Ponte Cavour and Ponte Regina Margherita. It's a very short walk to the Castel Sant'Angelo, Piazza Del Popolo, Via Del Corso (shopping), Ara Pacis, Piazza Novona, Pantheon, Campo Di Fiori, Piazza Colonna, Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps.

The Junior Suite had an entry foyer, a living room with TV, sofa, desk and internet, a window-wall bedroom (windows did open) with a king size bed, TV, & plenty of drawer and hanging storage, and an amazing bathroom with shower/tub combo, toilet, bidet, sink and oodles of extra amenities including upgraded lotions & potions and his & her slippers. The included breakfast buffet was simply wonderful. If they didn't have something you wanted, shame on you. Meats, cheeses, pastries, breads, cereals, eggs, fruits, all sorts of juices, waters, coffee, tea etc etc. We had a couple of early tours and we joked that the Breakfast Buffet manager opened the doors exactly on time ... not one moment early. It was a filling and nutritious way to start our day. The hotel's location was great. Walking distance to many attractions & restaurants and the HoHo bus route (we love HoHo buses to get a feel for a city). Interestingly, several taxi drivers did not know of the hotel, so we had to offer the address. In short, the Visconti Palace is NOT inexpensive, but it's Rome after all, and I believe youj get what you pay for.

When we arrived we were told that we wouldn't be able to check in until after 5pm because the hotel was still being cleaned. (Sidenote: they spoke very good English which was good). I have traveled enough to know that early check in isn't always a guarantee but when you call and ask and are told you are all set you should expect it. I'm not so much unhappy about not being able to check in but the way the front desk (2 people a man and woman, I dont have names) treated us as if we were insane for even thinking we could check in, as if this has never happened. They did hold our bags while we went sightseeing but it almost seemed as if it was an inconvenience. Anyway, the location is great...we walked up a road with so much shopping to the Coliseum and the Spanish Steps. I don't feel like the restaurants were as good as the first night but were still very many of them and good. When we did get into our room it was nice. Big Flat screen TV, comfortable bed, roomy bathroom and a small refrig that was stocked but still had enough room to fit some of the waters we bought outside (way cheaper). Checkout was very slow for some reason also. While I don't feel that this hotel is bad or dirty, or bad location, or unsafe...I do feel that for the money we spent we could have most certainly had a better overall hotel experience.

The staff at the reception is not always helpful, even less friendly some times. Room: We had a room on the 6th floor facing west. In the afternoons, there\u2019s a very bright and glaring light from the sun filtering through the huge floor-to-ceiling glass window. The curtains had to be drawn all the time, not only to reduce the sun\u2019s glare, but from prying eyes from the windows of the adjacent office building. The room size is comfortable and there\u2019s a mini bar, where all the drinks are chargeable, including the Aqua Panna at \u20ac4 per 45 cl bottle. Coffee and tea making facilities are not given. The room safe is small, and I could not get my 13 inch laptop into the safe, but my iPad was able to fit in with some manipulation! There\u2019s a Philips TV on the generously long writing table, but all the programs are in Italian. The air conditioner has an effective thermostat and runs quite silently. There\u2019s no balcony in the room. There\u2019s no WiFi in the rooms, only at the reception area and the patio. For this usage, you need to get the code which changes daily,and you are limited to two log-ins for a total use of 30 min. But high-speed Internet connection by wire is available at a fee of \u20ac8 for an hour. in the room. There\u2019s a cleaning service daily and occasionally, a turn down service at night. There are many restaurants in the area and it\u2019s not a problem to find places to eat outside of the hotel. If you wanted room service, there\u2019s an additional service charge of \u20ac7.00 on top of the food bill. The hotel has a small gym and a roof garden for nightly bar-b-cues. This hotel is walking distance to the Vatican City, the Spanish Steps, the Galleria Borghese amongst the interesting venues. We notice there was a high turn over of guests, and the hotel is almost full daily. Tip: Buy a 1.5 litre of drinking water down the road for \u20ac0.90 or as low as \u20ac0.18 in some supermarkets, and stock these in your room. You will also need adapters for your electrical appliances, as this hotel does not use the international three pin sockets.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTravel Bug\u201d", "Author": "Patrice H", "ReviewID": "UR119003698", "Content": "Reasonable rates, great location, walking distance to major sights including Vatican, Spanish Steps, etc. Quiet neighborhood, great shopping nearby.

One morning we woken by repairmen hammering on the building facade, outside our window. When we complained the noise did stop but as a crane had to be brought in, surely management could have informed the rooms beforehand (and there was no later apology from management).

Despite many attempts to be served and being kept waiting more than 15 minutes and then when a later group arrived at the bar and were served before us - we left.

One observation was that when we had a tour booked, I had asked the genlleman at the desk to let us know when the bus arrived. We had gone downstairs for the breakfast buffet (As an aside, there was no extra charge for the mosquito in the bacon on the buffet). When the bus was late, he acted as though I was being pushy, (the bus was 30 minutes late.) and basically told me to chill and not worry. As it happned, the tour bus company had failed to send a bu to pick us up, and we ended taking a taxi to the bus depot for the tour. On our final day, we elected to check out and have the bellman lock our up our luggage. We had a very early flight out and decided not to book a room for the final night, since we would need to be at the airport at 3:15 AM. A fallacy that one of the hotel staffers told us was that if we went to airport at 3:00 AM, then we could not get into the airport and we would \"have to stay on the street.\" Luckily, this was not the case.

The major benefit is that the shopping in the immediate area is great (Via Cola di Rienzo), without being over run by tourists in the area of Via del Corso. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a large suite on the 7th floor (as we were on our honeymoon). Within 5 mins a bottle of Processco and food was delivered, compliments of the management. The staff were great, the breakfast buffet excellent. Rooms are spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. The terrace on the 7th floor was one of the best that I have seen in Rome.

Overall, the Visconti Palace was pretty good, but it was no where near as great as the previous reviews I had read. The hotel was very modern and clean. The lobby/lounge area was very inviting and we did enjoy a nice glass of wine there one night. The room was spacious for European standards, clean and modern - although it wasn't overly attractive. The bed was basically two twin beds joined together and was about two feet off the ground. It did get a little warm in there but not too bad. The first night I slept with the window open and was woken up a few times due to noise - trash pickup, etc. The other nights we just chose to sleep with the window closed. Probably a combination of all the things mentioned above - but I did not sleep well at all while here and seemed to be up most of the night. The breakfast was pretty good although there were not many hot items. My husband and I found enough to keep us full for breakfast. The front desk staff was not particularly friendly. They did not greet us when we would go in and out, not even a simple hello. It almost seemed like we were bothering them sometimes with our questions (which weren't much - where to buy train tickets, can you make us a dinner reservation?). As far as the location goes, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. We did A LOT of walking and were often tired in the afternoon. To come back to the hotel during the day wasn't always easy.

Admittidley it wasn't our first choice in terms of picking the hotel in the first place as we organised this trip only 10 days before going and the hotels we identified as out first choices were all full, so eventually through TA help we picked the Visconti. Pro's: Location is OK, if you enjoy walking and the weather is good, the location is fine. The hotel is clean and the rooms are clean and fairly modern, but not an attractive modern or a likeable modern. Con's: Breakfast is terrible, nothing good about it at all to report, there are a few OK cafe's near by so that was our workaround. I found most of the staff just unhelpful, not rude apart from one guy on the front desk, but in the main just unhelpful. The Air conditioning is not switched on until peak summer and the windows only open 2 inches so the rooms even in Early April are excessivley hot. I reported this daily as it genuinely did affect my sleep, i was awake with noise from outside from having the window open and the heat fo the room was too much for me personally - no manager or staff member was helpful with this matter, simply told, Air conditioning isoff in hotel until it is hot. I went on to explain that it was a feature advertised as a room feature so that i felt duped by then checking in to find it wasn't available. On my third and final night they eventually found a fan that i requested daily, this was better nothing but the controls were broken, buttons missing off fan controls so i couldn't set it up as i would have liked to. In summary if the air con was on and worked and the breakfast was overhauled then i think this would be a genine 4 star hotel contender, and of course some refersher customer service courses for some of the management and staff wouldn't go a miss.

VP hotel came up to all our expectations, based on previous Tripadvisor reviews. We had a standard double on 4th floor at rear of the hotel - very queit, as requested. Decent size room with spacious well equipped bathroom, incl full size tub with powerful shower over. Comfortable (firm) large double bed (two twin mattresses pushed together, as is common continental practice). Room was nicely furnished and kept spotlessly clean throughout our stay. Ample storage. Comfortable room temperature (early Nov) and large window can be opened if necessary. We always read in bed at night and usually have to struggle due to inadequate light; however at VP we were particularly delighted with the bright mini down-spotlights in the uplighters by the bed. The included self service buffet breakfast (in the large pleasant basement cafe) was exellent, with a wide hot and cold choice which was kept well topped up. We usually ate around 8.00am in order to make most use of the day in our busy schedule. VP also has a nicely furnished and stylish lounge and bar, which serves light snacks later in the day and evening (soup, sandwiches etc). However, it is a 4star hotel and prices were a bit steep for Britons suffering from the collapse of the Sterling exchange rate against the Euro: 6 Euro for a small beer or glass of wine! We thought the location of the hotel was ideal, just across the river on the Vatican side and with easy access to all the sites, either walking or by bus from Piazza Cavour (5 min walk). Bus No 87 takes you to the Colosseum in c15 minutes for 1 Euro! St Peters Basilica and the Vatican Museum are a comfortable 15-20 min stroll from the hotel and many of the popular sites on the other side of the river (Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, Spanish Steps etc) are an easy stroll. But take the bus for the Colosseum / Forum as that is a fair walk from VP and you will do lots of walking when you get there. The area around the hotel is relatively queit with a few restaurants and cafes to choose from for evening dinner. We found a lovely cellar restaurant only 200 metres down the street from the hotel: Alle Due Fontanelle (www.alleduefontanelle.com) offered a delicious three course dinner with wide choice of starter and main course for Euro 18 per person. And that also included bottled water, house wine and coffee. Staff were very friendly and it was so good and convenient we ate there three times. We would thoroughly recommend the Visconti Palace hotel for a comfortable, conveniently located good value break in Rome. Pre booked (via Expedia) shuttle bus transfers from the airport to the hotel and return worked without hitch. We visited all the main sites and lots of churches. As first time visitors to Rome we were overwhelmed by the architecture, history and art . A particular highlight for us was the Vatican Museum, which includes the Sistine chapel at the end of the mandatory route. But don't rush through the many rooms and halls of the museum as there is so much amazing work to see - allow three hours for the whole visit (plus St Peters afterwards, so needs a whole day!) The restoration work on most of the ceilings and the masterpiece whole wall paintings is fantastic - showing the original clean bright colours. In addition they are for the most part well lit, particularly the ornate ceilings, which makes a tremendous difference. Only natural light is allowed in the Sistine chapel but it is awesome. The Vatican Museum is worth booking ahead online to avoid admission queues. You pay a small premium to do this but worth it. We booked ahead using the official Vatican website, which allows you to print off a specific timed admission voucher.

The hotel room was lovely and the breakfast was delicious and lavish; even though we've stayed at a number of hotels in Italy, the spread still impressed us. The staff was extremely helpful. Although we arrived very early in the morning, we were given a room immediately. We had reserved a king bed, and were directed to a room with twin beds. When we told the manager, he apologized profusely, and sent another worker to accompany us to a second room to make sure that it was correct.

We did alot of walking, which was great for taking off the cruise pounds and my parents, both in their 70's kept up well, even in the warm August days. This hotel is easily accessible to the Vatican and surrounding areas. Only a $6.00 Euro ride to Plaza Novona, Trevi Fountain and Plaza Espana areas, but when we were there, traffic was light. Two gems for dining: Ristorante del Pallardo - need a reservation and is truly an Italain home cooking experience that brought me back to the days of when my Grandmother and Grandfather hekd Sunday dinners. This is a set menu, truly affordable, whatever they are serving that day, wine included. They made us feel right at home and well worth the adventure of finding it ( we walked from the Pantheon, using a map) . Just down home italian cooking. Le Cupole - only three blocks from the Visconti, this other family run restaurant was also another gem and a true italian dining experience at a good price. Cannot wait to go back to Rome.

We stayed one night pre cruise in a mini suite which is the same type of room we had before, very large and spacious which I posted photos of in the past. For the two nights post cruise we stayed in an executive suite and you would have thought I died an went to heaven! The suite was HUGE- really the bathroom alone was bigger than some cabins I have seen on ships (the total cabin). When you enter the suite there is a sitting area which they brought up a bed for my son to sleep on. This allowed us to still use the couch, desk and entertaiment area. The suite was stocked with two flat pannel TV's a Bose entertainment system (where you can listen to music in the bath if you wish) tons of storage and a stunning view from the huge balcony. The next room over is the bathroom which was divine! Seperate marble shower and tub, toliet and bidet and large counter and sink area. The scale was actually nice to have as we weighed our luggage before check out and found we had to move things around. The master bedroom is very large, has built in closets and more drawer space than I have ever seen in a hotel before. There are three sliders to get out to the huge balcony which is the ulimate place to enjoy a beverage from the well stocked mini bar and watch the lights go down over the city.The lights are hidden in the bonsai trees and beautiful when lit.

It is definitely a modern hotel, with a plush reception area and sharply dressed staff (though I found them to be rather cold and distant). I was moderately disappointed by the room, however, as it in no way looked like any of the images contained on the hotel's website in terms of decor. It wasn't a bad room, just not aligning in any way with the promotional literature of the hotel. Calling the decor that of an average Holiday Inn would be about right. The bathroom was nice and large, however, and fully functional. I felt as though the air conditioner could have been stronger, even though it was on full blast. The Continental breakfast was fine, with everything seeming to be quite fresh. There was a large tour in the dining room when I was there, so it may be a favored spot for the larger tour operators. One downside to the stay was that a guest in one of the adjacent rooms decided to watch his television on the highest volume setting at 2am. This necessitated calls to the front desk, which dispatched a staff member to deal with the situation. Although it was handled well by the staff, it was not fun to lose an hour of sleep in the middle of the night. I'm not sure I would stay at this hotel again. Maybe for a quick one-night stay it would be fine, but any longer than that and i think the minuses would start to overshadow the plusses.

The hotel is situated in a predominantly residential area to the west of the Tiber close to Castel St Angelo.

I booked through expedia and got a good rate which averaged ou at about \u00a390 per night which given the location was the best rate that I could get by miles. The location is great: 15 minutes walk to St Peters 10 minutes to Piazza Navona 10 minutes to Pazza del Popolo Most of the popular tour buses stop either at Piazza Navona or St Peters. The hotel has good sized rooms with comfy beds and big bathrooms (the tub was ok size but a little small for soaking). TV is an old style CRT screen with limited channels but I wasnt in Rome for the TV! This was my first trip in Europe, I usually go to the US, but I felt the hotel information within the room was lacking, most hotels have brochures or folders explaining the facilities - the best source of info in this hotel was the advert within the lift The roof terrace is great with plenty of seating space and good sun until 7pm at night. The communal areas are reasonable - the bar is pretty small and bar staff were not very friendly, the food and drink was expensive as it seems to be everywhere in Rome. The included buffet breakfast was very good, plenty of choice. The front desk staff weren't particularly friendly on the day before I checked out I asked if there was a computer that I could use to print a boarding card for the flight and was told I could use the TV based system within my room, when I tried to explain that there was no way to print from this I was met with a blank look, I also asked if the hotel were able to book transfers from the hotel to the airport and was told they could book a taxi or private car only, no shuttles,etc. Given previous experience of dodgy taxis within Rome i decided to use the nearby Metro station to transfer to the main Termini stazione (1 euro) and got the da Vinci Express (11euro) The housekeeping staff were excellent. I had the choice of staying here and a couple of more business orientated hotels on the outskirts of Rome and while being close to the attractions was nice, if I booked again I would be tempted by cheaper rates more facilities (e.g. pool) at the other hotels.

On arrival we had a friendly welcome from the numerous reception staff. All were keen to help with a variety of questions regarding the hotel itself, the location and about Rome itself. The reception area, bar and lounge are modern and well maintained. The bar stocks a vast array of drinks - I was particularly impressd to find Pimms! The restaurant is located in the basement. Again, it is modern and well maintained. They serve a buffet style breakfast which would cater for most tastes. The food is a good quality and regularly replenished, there are also plenty of tables, so it doesn't matter if you fancy a bit of a lie in. I'm not sure if the restaurant offers meals other than breakfast as we always ate out. The bar does serve a variety of bar snacks though and the room service menu was fairly extensive. The rooms were well appointed and spotless. Maid service was daily. The rooms are a good size for europe - there's plenty of room for all your luggage and to wander around in comfort. We found the beds to be quite hard but I appreciate this personal preference. We were not bothered by any external noise either from the corridor, adjacent rooms or outside. The hotel is situated over the river from the main centre of rome. It takes approx 5-10 minutes to walk to the piazza nevona. All of the sites in Rome are within easy walking distance of the hotel. Spanish steps - 20mins, Trevi fountain - 10-15mins. Some obviously take longer than others! The Colleseum probably takes the longest, about 30-45 minutes depending on how energetic you're feeling. The hotel is on a road, which means that your taxi from the airport can drop you off directly outside. A lot of the hotels in the old centre of rome have no road access and you have to find your way through the streets with your suitcases - fine if you know where you're going but we met a number of people during our trip frantically roaming the streets for their hotel! Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is modern, spacious and well maintained.

We were independent travellers from the UK and whilst there WERE large American tour groups in evidence, the hotel seemed to be successfully catering for the full range of business and leisure guests from many countriese who were staying. We ate out in the evenings and there is a fair choice of typical, reasonably priced Italian restaurants within the immediate, safe and pleasant locality. The hotel location was excellent, on the left bank of the Tiber so close to Vatican City (10- 15 mins walk) but also convenient for the sights on the right bank with the Trevi Fountain and Piazza Nouva also about 10 mins. To get up to the Forum and Coloseum we took a 5 min walk to Lepanto Metro and then used the excellent Metro service (1 Euro yes 1 Euro!! each). Before strolling back through the city with a couple of coffee stops! If travelling independently by air I recommend taking a taxi from either of the airports. If you use one of the official white taxis, there is a fixed charge of E30 from Campino and (I think) E40 from LDV to any of the main hotels in the city centre. As this was our first rip to Rome we took 2x1/2 day guided tours on our first day with Gray Line ( Appian Line).

The bar is nice. The room is fine. The bathroom is clean. The staff SUCKS!!! I have to say that their staff is probably the rudest I have ever met. I totally agree with the people that gave negative comments toward this hotel's staff. Out of the 7 front desk staffs that I saw during my 4 night stay only 2 were actually friendly and were kind of willing to provide us with infomation. The others were simply rude and doesn't even look at you when they're talking to people. I noticed that they were only friendly enough and patient enough to Italian speakers. They showed no manner nor patience to English speakers. Only the female staff was kind. The only way to obtain hot water is through the bar. The bartender is extremely rude also. One night I was trying to get hot water for my wife and the bartender just kept saying \"No more hot water, No more hot water\" (rudely) and was blabbering Italian to his colleague, I don't understand Italian but I knew from his tone that he wasn't saying anything nice. By the way, there is no shower curtain so the water is very likely to flood your bathroom floor. However, there is a peice of glass that blocks the water from spilling out the shower but it only covers halfway so you'll have to either bathe or cautiously shower yourself. Water coming out the shower is not always hot enough, so you'll have to take your chances. I'm assuming that's because they use solar panels to heat up the water and there wasn't enough sun light during the day. The location of the hotel is fine if your destination is the Vatican, Via Condotti or Piazza del Popolo, they're all 10-15 minutes away. There are no metros nearby, you'll have to walk for about 12 minutes to the Lepanto station (red line). I wouldn't recommend anyone with heavy luggage to take the metro because there are no elevators around, you'll have to haul it up the stairs yourself. The taxi from/to the Airport is 50 euros, 10 euros more than to any other hotels in Rome, don't know why but that's the way it is. I've confirmed it with 3 sources and that seems to be the general rate.

The hotel looks nothing from the outside and is in a rather nondescript road but its an easy 10 minutes walk to the Vatican and the same in the other direction to Piazza Popolo. The outside bar area is great to unwind in on an evening, lit with candles and water feature. Drinks are average price for a 4* city hotel. Be aware that in August, many restaurants and some shops are closed for 3 weeks for holidays - nearly all the restaurants near the hotel were shut, hence why we asked for recommendations.

The hotel is in a quiet area but 10 minutes of walking gets you to good shops as well as tourist attractions. Close to the hotel are several nice restaurants. We booked two double rooms interconnecting. One had a king size bed and the other had two singles. Both rooms were very clean, comfortable and were a good size. The air conditioning was a God-send since the temperatures were in the mid thirties every day. The breakfast room was very large and the food plentiful. I would have loved to have been able to make some toast but sadly european hotels don't seem to possess toasters. Another thing I thought was strange was that when I requested an iron to borrow, I was told that iron's are not permitted in hotels there (something to do with the wiring I think?) I have never come across this before but I've never stayed in Rome before so maybe that's normal over there???? We found the desk staff to be very pleasant and most spoke good English. In fact they were very helpfull when I left my sunglasses behind in a taxi that we'd ordered from the hotel. They made repeated phone calls to various taxi companies until they tracked down the taxi we'd travelled in earlier that morning and the driver returned the sunglasses later that day. A couple of tips on Rome: If you want to visit the Vatican City and see the Vatican museums (where you'll see the Sistene Chapel amongst other things), it might be best to join a tour group and go early in the morning. The conceirge can organise this for you. If you go separately (which you can't do before 10am), the queues are unbelievable - 2 to 4 hours long and they wind all the way around the Vatican City's walls. Also be aware that you must have your shoulders and knees covered. You won't be allowed in if they are exposed. (Three quarter pants are fine and a scarf draped over the shoulders seems to suffice). Also, beware of the gypsies!! Thankfully we had been pre-warned about gypsies carrying babies and trying to make you look at their babies whilst picking your pockets. It happened to us on our first day in Rome. It all happened very quickly but basically two women with babies strapped to their fronts approached us. A young girl distracted myself and my two children by pulling me towards her and blowing kisses at me repeatedly whilst the two women (who look quite ordinary - no big hooped ear-rings and layered skirts here) closed in on my husband showing him their babies. They backed him up against the wall and held one arm tightly when he suddenly remembered what he'd been told. He immediately felt a hand going into his pockets (they make it look as though their hands are supporting the baby). He managed to shake them off and shouted at them to get away which they did but it was obvious from their faces that they were annoyed that they were unsuccessful on this occasion. Rome was not my favourite destination on our holiday but the Visconti Palace made it a comfortable stay.

Also it was far from being in \"central Rome\" as advertised, we had to walk miles to see anything at all. I am still in great pain from all the trudging. My advice: don't go there. Rather don't go to Rome at all, its far over-rated, the Tiber is an open sewer decorated with at least ten metres either side with dense algae, if you fell in you would die from inhaling noxious fumes before you thankfully drowned. The Vatican is just another dome, the Parthenon a broken wall and the whole place is dense with pickpockets.

Had 3 bed triple-- 3 twins (very firm!). Location was convenient to Ponte Cavour and Piazza Cavour. Several sights were about a 20 min walk away-- Spanish Steps, Vatican and Plaza Navarro. Hotel was on a quiet street-- walked there from Lepanto Metro via Termini Station (10 blocks--get map) and airport train--all worked fine for total cost of about $15 Euros pp--use cab from Lepanto to save energy. Rome streets are a bit hard to navigate because names change every few blocks on side streets. Nobody in the area knew Fred Cesi street or the hotel by name.... Hotel has a flat rate airport service for 50 Euros--good deal for family so you don't have to lug bags down streets (Common sight). Hotel desk staff friendliness scale was as previously reported--ranged from a bit arrogant to extremely nice-- all came through when pressed with questions. The hotel staff provided plenty of toiletries and travel stuff, good toilets, and rooms were serviced very nicely & promptly. Hotel breakfast daily was more than adequate--from 0630 to past 1100 daily which is very convenient if you want to sleep in. Breakfasts consisted of cold foods--pastries & breads, fresh & canned fruit, yogurt, hot drinks, plenty of cereals, sliced deli meats & cheeses.. better selection than home for us! Lots of tour groups--a bit noisy in the evenings in the hotel. We stayed in room 115--fairly quiet for big city and could take stairs if we wanted to. Rooms were modern, baths had hand shower device and hair dryer with 1 setting--okay though. Great time of year to visit Rome-- cool, sunny and dry weather compared to other parts of Europe. Plenty of reasonable pizza and Trattorias nearby. Try \"Luncha\" for quick daytime meal. Grocery nearby makes sandwiches for lunch. Comared to London, traveling and eating in Rome is much cheaper.

This hotel is smartly decorated and very clean but the staff were a big let down. On check-in we were aked for our passports and booking confirmation and given our room key, no conversation, no welcome, no information about breakfast - which we'd paid for. We booked a double non-smoking room and were given a twin smoking room, apart from that the accomodation was satisfactory. The hotel has a bar and serves light food which is a bonus in Rome, it also has a pleasant outdoor patio area, however it was not welcoming. The staff were simply rude, they did not offer to serve us when we sat at the bar in front of them - we felt like we had to interupt them and ask if we could have a drink, etc. although they all spoke english, the only conversation was - \"cash or charge to room\". This wasn't just our experience I heard them being extremely sour and rude to many american guests too. On the one occassion I dared to complain at receiving green tea when I asked for mint tea, the waiter simply replied - \"that's all we have\", despite telling me they had mint tea when I enquired before ordering it. This location is convenient for the Vatican area, but unless you want to go there a lot, all the other attractions are across the river, so it wasn't as central as we thought. This was poor value for money and I certainly wouldn't recommend staying here when there are so many other hotel and appartment choices, we spent the minimum time in our hotel as we felt so uncomfortable and unwelcomed there, the atmosphere was dire.", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rome Hotel for Families\u201d", "Author": "Jasminedog", "ReviewID": "UR5537381", "Content": "Our family of 11 reserved 5 rooms at the Visconti Palace for our July 2006 visit to Rome and everyone agreed it was a great centrally located hotel. We would definitely stay here again and believe the Positives clearly outweigh any Negatives. Reserve here with confidence. The hotel was full, but rarely felt busy even during the morning breakfast rush. There was no problem checking in and all five of our rooms were ready to be occupied at check in. The hotel rooms were not huge by U.S. standards, but few European hotel rooms are. The AC worked fine, the windows blocked out noise sufficiently well and the televisions were large. The room decor was Danish modern, but not on par to the quality of furnishings in the lobby. The website photo of the rooms were much more beautiful than the reality (as far as our 5 rooms anyway), but nevertheless we had no real complaint about the rooms. The breakfast buffet was fine and typically European - cold sliced meats and cheeses, 4 kinds of cereals, various breakfast breads, pastries, muffins and croissants, fresh whole and fresh sliced fruits, yogurt, and coffee, hot chocolate, tea were fully enjoyed by even our younger picky eaters of the family. The breakfast room was huge and very modern. We used the fitness center regularly. All of the equipment was in excellent condition. There was a treadmill, elliptical stepper, recumbent bicycle, free weights and about 4 weight stations to work the legs and upper arms and chest and back. The fitness room also had a 42 inch plasma flat screen and his/her rest room/changing facilities. We crossed over the Ponte Cavour bridge to easily access the Spanish Steps and to view the Ara Pacis (and purchase our Roma Passes, helping us to bypass the lines at the Coliseum and giving us 3 day of bus and Metro access). The Ponte Umberto bridge (in front of the nearby Palace of Justice) led us directly to the night scene at the Piazza Navonna. The Positives: (1) The hotel is easily accessible to the great parts of central Rome that are especially great places to be during the evening ... Spanish Steps (immediately east) and Piazza Navona (directly south). (2) The location is in a fairly quiet area off Piazza Cavour and therefore does not have to contend with the intense traffic and noise of Rome. (3) Public buses were 1 block and the subway was easily accessed at the Spanish Steps (15 min walk). (4) The rooms are clean, nicely maintained and air conditioned. A good breakfast buffet was included each morning. Furnishings were fine and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and the custom towels were very fluffy. We had no noise problems in any of our rooms. (5) Public facilities in the lobby are very modern in style. The fitness room was nicely equipped (for being in Rome). There is a small bar with a cozy outdoor patio off the lobby. (6) Modern electrical outlets meant we only needed the 2-prong adaptor, and we did not need our electrical converter. The hair dryer in the bathroom was also powerful. The Negatives: (1) The hotel's quiet location meant that there was not much for the first time tourist to do in the immediate neighborhood. A handful of restaurants were in the area, but it was still pretty lonesome at night. So we always walked over to Piazza Navona. (2) The desk staff, as previous posters have written, could be friendlier, but this was not really a problem for us at all. In fact, the senior gentleman at the front desk went out of his way to help me with directions to various sights. (3) The hotel lacks any pool to cool off after a hot day in Rome (there are only a handful of Rome hotels that have a pool). (4) The hotel is not near the Coliseum and Forum and Via Veneto (but all easily accessed by Subway). The Vatican would have been a 30-minute walk away, but only a few minutes by bus at Piazza Cavour. (5) The rooms can only be booked as doubles or triples. No Quads. Therefore we had to book multiple rooms to accommodate everyone. The hotel is great for couples or 3 person families and those who want the modern conveniences of a hotel in a very central location to most of the sights of Rome. The hotel is not for those who want the old \"atmosphere\" of small intimate pensiones. Having done the latter, we would gladly opt return to the Visconti Palace.", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "mcphail858", "ReviewID": "UR5498634", "Content": "My wife and I just got back from a week in Italy.

You can take a cab but it was nice to cross over the river each time because of the wonderful view of the Vatican.

Colosseum & Roman Forum further away, on other side of city - 45 minute walk or 10 mins by Metro (2 blocks away). Taxi rank nearby in Piazza Cavour, a 5 minute walk from hotel. Very pleasant outdoor terrace, very relaxing after a day out in the city. Hot tip - use fridge in room for keeping your own cold bottled water / drinks. I most certainly intend to stay at this hotel again. Great location, within walking distance of most major tourist attractions. It was very comfortable and relaxing. It had everthing I needed and I didn't have a single complaint during an 8 night stay. Getting the most out of your stay: Plan trip with good guide book. Walking is best way to get around, definitely have comfortable footwear. Vatican is worth at least a day, if not more. Must do's - St Peter's Basilica and Dome, Papal Treasury and Vatican Museums including awesome Sistine Chapel. Do visit Piazza del Popello and church there called Santa Maria del Popello - just 5 to 10 minutes from the hotel (in the opposite direction from Vatican).

It really is just an okay hotel. Not bad, but nothing spectacular either. The best thing about the hotel is probably its location, as it is a fairly short walk to the Piazza Navona and to the Vatican. About a 15 minute walk. The hotel itself might seem modern in the lobby and common areas, but the rooms are of average size, rather plain and the bathroom a bit run-down for a hotel of this caliber. The hotel cleaning staff was a bit cheap on replenishing shampoo and soap and toiletries and such. The staff seemed fine, we didn't encounter any rudeness or any unwilingness to help us out. One other thing to note, typically, I'm not super picky about what hotels serve for breakfasts, nor does it determine if I'll stay at a hotel or not, but I would say that the Visconti breakfast was rather cheap in what they served. There were no hot foods at breakfast, not even powdered eggs or sausages. It was just cereal, yogurt, bread, pastries, deli meats and cheese. And the regular, coffee and orange juice. I would say it was probably one of the worst hotel breakfasts I've ever had in that sense. Bad for a hotel of this caliber. We didn't even bother going again for the second day. Just something I was not prepared for.
