The hotel is no where near Rome, is in a place where there is no facilities or tourist places around. We really regretted staying here.The hotel has a Shuttle service which is \u00a312 per person expensive shuttle. We asked the man on the reception if there is any other way to get to Rome but he was rather unhelpful and would not tell us of any other way. We found how to get to Rome ourselves. We caught Co travel bus from outside the hotel to Ostia (lido center) only 10 min, this stops outside the train station from where we got a Train into Rome.It cost us \u00a32 to get into Rome in total from the hotel and \u00a32 to get back. The hotel was charging us a total of \u00a324 per person to Rome and back. Me, my wife and daughter traveled to Rome and back over 3 days for \u00a312 whereas the hotel would have charged us \u00a3144.

We had to asks for bread and butter with our evening meals where the others got it without asking once they were seated at the table. I booked thee hotel through Thomas Cook who told me it was a great hotel and within five minutes walk of the Vatican which was rubbish it was like a good two hour walk and we spent so much on taxis just to get into the town I suggest to anyone booking this hotel be aware the rooms where so awful with the shower unti broken the room was so marked up and dirty and they said it was a superior room and charge those prices. It was going to be a holiday of a life time for me and my girlfriend and family and it turn into a holiday of hell.

I opted to book a chain hotel rather than an independent as I assumed (incorrectly) that it would conform to the 4 star rating it had been given. However, I was very disappointed with the hotel when I arrived. It was miles out of town, a good 25 minute walk to the nearest metro station (although there was a sporadic free shuttle service from the hotel), there was very little in the way of restaurants or shops in the immediate vicinity, the lobby was small and unimpressive and the staff were surly and not particularly welcoming. The lifts were tiny and a bit rickety and our room had a vending machine right outside it, which buzzed and hummed all night. On the positive side, this hotel was quite cheap compared to some others, the room was clean and of a decent size with a fairly comfortable king sized bed and en suite bathroom, and breakfast was included, although some of it was inedible (particularly the scrambled eggs). Perhaps I am being overly picky but the room did not contain any information about the hotel facilities i.e. what was in the fitness suite, when it was open etc, there were no instructions for operating the air conditioning (which didn't seem to do anything other than turn off or heat the room to 26 degrees), no tea or coffee making facilities, and no room service menu even though some scant information on the key card suggested room service was available. In their defence, we probably could have got all this information from the reception staff but as they were less than helpful when we did have occasion to speak to them we didn't bother asking and spent as little time in the hotel as possible. If this hotel had been listed as a 3 star hotel I would not have been so disappointed and for the price I paid it was quite good value. However, I was hoping for something a little more luxurious and feel I was misled by the star rating and the pictures on the hotel website, which make it look nicer than it was. Next time I would opt for something a bit more expensive closer to the city centre or if I was staying on a budget I'd probably opt for an Ibis and give the Golden Tulip a miss.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "milford haven", "Title": "\u201coutdated,out of town,get me out of here\u201d", "Author": "swimmerb0y", "ReviewID": "UR119900577", "Content": "spent 5 nights at this hotel in mid october.got there at 9ish the first night and after putting our bags in the double room we went to the restaurant for what the receptionsist described as the best pizzas.being a son of italian parents i was eager to try the food .the pizza came out dripping in olive oil and we were presented with the most soggiest pizza ive ever seen yuk !!!!.the head waiter totaly ignored us the two times we went there very rude and unhelpfull.never mind move on we thought.the next day i wanted to try the pools well the indoor pool was broken(we stumbled across this as we passed through the gym area it was all in darkness ???.on to the outdoor pool which was absolutely filthy i love swimming and this was a big factor in booking this hotel as this offered this facilty.what a let down.you just couldnt get in there .in the room there were no tea/coffee facilities so had to have cold drinks instead.we only ate 1 more time in restaraunt and the choice of food was very poor (unless you love fish) breakfast wasnt much better.selection of fruit,croissants toast etc .we couldnt wait to get out of the hotel to be honest.as previous reviews stated you have to get a bus to metro to get anywhere.not much to do around hotel area.there is a supermarket 5 mins away if you need some supplies.1 word of advise for me to give would be take plenty of time to get back to fumicino aiport it took us 4 hours to get back there as the bus/metro/train journey was a nightmare.its only half hour in taxi(prices range from 45-60 euros. overall impression rome is a beautyfull place shame the hotel didnt live up to our expectation the hotel photos must of been taken years ago.shame on you golden tulip for allowing those photos to dupe peaple into thinking this place is a great place to stay and eat.please avoid this hotel as its prob in the worst hotel ive ever stayed in.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "Clareshuff", "ReviewID": "UR118316263", "Content": "The hotel is a 20 minute walk/quick bus ride from the end of the Vatican metro line which wasn't a problem for us but I would stay nearer the centre next time - we thought Rome would be chaos but it wasn't that busy and we could easily have coped with staying closer to the centre.

Rooms: -small, especially with 3 to a room (a cot was added) it gets cramped. -not very good storage areas so you can't keep things organized, which makes the size of the room feel even more cramped -good showers, but be careful of the water leaking out through the slit in the door -bathrooms are clean and besides the zero options for storing your toilettries -- there isn't even a shelf or cupboard underneath -- I have nothing to report -windows open well, but you have to yank them really hard to pull them back in (don't worry, you won't break them) Pool: -haven't swam in it yet, but from what the other students say, it is nice -pool area has lots of seating opportunities, and I love the cushioned areas under the cabana-thing -overall, great pool area. They even have tables. Hotel restaurant (as a group of students we are served our food - no ordering): -clean -basic food: pasta or pizza every night, which are usually delicious -dessert isn't that great -free breakfast mostly consists of yoghurt, hard bread, nutella & dressings, tea & coffee (I am very thankful for the tea!), simple cereal (no sugary stuff), juice, canned fruit, and hotel scrambed eggs Complaints: -we were only given one room key, and you have to pay for extra -our hotel WiFi was down for the entire time, so we had to use unlocked networks and roam around the parking lot and lobby looking for a connection. It was a rare excitement when we did get internet access. -the walls are thin, so sleep is very difficult with screaming, giggly, hyper teenage girls in the hallway (admittedly, the girls from my studying trip, but I tried not to associate with them. Many customers in nearby rooms got very upset with the noise level) -laundry rates are very high, but then again I've never used hotel laundry before, so maybe they are normal -hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the bus stop, then usually another 10-15 minute wait for the bus, 5-10 minutes bus ride to the metro. Week-long metro tickets cost 16 euros, or 1 euro for each ride. Your best bet is getting the week pass. *Tip: our first night sleeping, I was freezing. To control the air conditioning: shut it off, turn it up before bed, or open the window which automatcially turns off the AC. I give this hotel 3 stars because it is basic but acceptable. The front desk is pretty nice, but twice already I've handed in the key to them and they didn't have it in our room slot (we had to hand in our keys before going out, but I think that's a student group thing).

Excellent sized room, clean and tidy, with LCD t.v, touser press, FREE safe,air conditioning(contact reception to have switched on),large marble tiled bathroom with power shower and hairdryer. Hotel is good size, clean & modern with 6 floors, good sized swimming pool with terraced area, restaurant, bar, Gym (excellent -Technogym equipment), sauna & jacuzzi and shuttle bus. Breakfast - No issues as previous reviews highlight otherwise,clean and no waiting. Choice of fruit, breads,cheese& meats, cereal, juices, yoghurt, cakes,tea and coffee. Only hot food was scrambled egg. Check in 1200. Nearby - Supermarket, 2 Restaurants, Pharmacy,Bus Terminal, Couple of takeaway stalls. Centre of Rome is really easy to get to from hotel and we cannot understand the negative feedback re location. To be honest we both loved getting out the hustle and bustle and noise of the city after walking around all day. You can get to Rome tourist spots using the metro from either Battistini or Cornelia Stations and get off at either the vatican city, spanish steps etc and it only takes 6-7 minutes. You can get to Battistini or Cornelia station using either bus 546 or 889 both from bus terminal outside hotel. The bus service is every 5 minutes,and finishes at 0000. The metro is every 2 minutes. If walking from metro you can get to hotel in 15minutes on a relatively straight forward route from Battistini metro stop. Despite the grafiti(throughout whole city) the area was safe to walk at night. You can get a 3 day tourist pass that covers buses and tube for 11euro's each person buying it from metro station. You walk on and off the bus and we never showed the ticket once. Public transport was great and we never had to use taxis or open top bus due to its good service. There was also storage available for cases,and showers in the gym to feshen up prior to late flight. Negatives - There are only a few but if changed would have made this hotel great. Sauna & Jacuzzi - Can only be booked as \"Romantic Moments\" charged at 20euro's per person for 30minutes! Swimming pool - You must have a swimming cap, and own towel(not room towels), otherwise hotel will sell a cap and rent towels. Minibar- Well overpriced. a can of diet coke is 4Euro's, but you can buy one across the road from stall at 1.50euro. From Champiano airport you can get several allocated buses to Rome Railway Station (TERMINI), including teravision at 4euro's each. Be aware in peak traffic(like when we arrived at 9am) it can take 1hour 20minutes plus 20 minute wait in queue at bus terminal. We found the best way to get the public transport bus at 1.20euro each from the airport to Anagnina (first train station on metro line A) which takes 15minutes by bus. Then board tube at Anagnina and get off at either TERMINI(15minutes)or stay on tube all the way to Hotel, Battistini(approx25-30 minutes from angina).

Problems with room heating, computer access and the booking of the free minibus to the Metro station were frequent. We booked places on the minibus four times - it was generally good, but twice ran fifteen minutes late and on the fourth occasion left (on time) as we got to the lobby - the drivers never checked the room numbers of guests who booked - he just went. We obtained a taxi via the desk - it arrived quickly but there was no hint of apology or recompense from the desk staff, or suggestion that the minibus, on its return, would take us in to the station. The girl had no idea of a helpful response. The hotel is well out of the city in an area devoid of eating places and nearby transport - hence the minibus service to Cornelia Metro station. We arrived at 3pm on the Sunday to find there was no food available and three different times were given for the restaurant to open - the dreadful young lady on duty (she who later failed to apologise for the missed minibus) clearly didn't know the correct time and equally clearly couldn't care less.

They said it was not the hotels problem but the neighbourhood's.(????????? they use a communal heater???right) It was like that every single morning we stayed there..so my advice..shower at night. What else...mmm yes we got 50 euros a head stolen from us( two people two different rooms) !!!!! I might be ingenous but it is the first time in my LIFE its happenned to me. If I say ive been to around 35 hotels I can tell you im not exageratting. I travel a lot, a big lot. Mainly trough europe and Ive never ever been robbed before. All they said to us is \" 1. We have to check because its never happenned to us before\" then. \"2. You might have spent them and don't remember having done so\" (??????????what??). And last, after angry emails, a nice call \"3. We are sorry. We try to do our best. You are invited to our hotel anytime\" FINNALLY THEY SAID SORRY! But I will not take their offer. Specially when they tryed to charge us for a bottle of water WE BOUGHT and did not put in the fridge????? Furniture: A friend cut his finger (eldery man ) just by passing his fingers on the furniture (modern- steel -ready to cut fingers decoration). Yeap, and remeber , each room only gets 5 hangers.Yeap, we checked. No internet. No white or yellow pages at the information desk..(?basic at any hotel?? the phone guide??) And last but not least...la cassaforte broke...and they didnt consider themselves responsible for it.They wouldn't give us a solution.\" We don't have the key\" Only when we mentioned \"police\" if they didn't get it open(with 3000 euro inside you would have been mad too) they started to move. What can I say. It's nothing personal against those employees that may be doing a great job. But seriously, overall its an awful hotel that made our trip so much worse ( we had another problem but that was self infflicted). I don't recommend it and if you want a good advice: DON'T GO THERE!", "Date": "December 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGolden Tulip Review\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3942622", "Content": "The hotel is not easy to find and the directions supplied on the website could be better. My wife and I got a taxi from the airport and the driver had a problematic time finding it. Unfortunately this was repeated with other drivers during our stay. The area is not the nicest part of Rome and is a long distance from the sights. There is a bus stop outside the hotel and a taxi rank. The nearest metro station is about 1.5 miles away. The room was comfortable and adequate but nothing special. If you want to use the mini bar you need to get the porter to open it for you, the first time I've ever seen this in a hotel. The bar is very small and seems to close when the bartender feels they want to go home. The restaurant in the hotel is better avoided. You can eat better and cheaper elsewhere.
