There was quite a bit of traffic noise at night from ongoing construction and several highways nearby.

Many top class restaurants nearby: the Brooklyn, Elliotts and the Space Needle (for lunch). Almost any cuisine is available. Many thanks to Emily at the main desk.

There is a working fireplace, armchairs, sink and fridge. The bathroom was huge. The bed is clearly quite new and firm. Most people would find this comfortable but I am used to sleeping on memory foam, so I found it a little too firm. A morning breakfast buffet is included in the price. This is high quality food with a lot of choices. Everything is made fresh including the muffins and quiche. There were 5 kinds of juice, 2 hot dishes, hot cereal, cold cereal, choices of bread, fruit and even soy milk. Many hotels advertise an included breakfast but this one rates 5 stars! There is also \"afternoon tea\" from 4 p.m. to 6:30. This is also extensive and includes red and white wine, coffee, teas, cheese, crackers, crudites with dip, fruit, and a fresh baked dessert. I didn't bother going out for dinner after this. On the downside, Room 12 has no telephone. I don't carry a cell due to roaming charges, so I had to go to the front desk to use a phone. However, there was a desktop available in the lobby. I was told the wiring in Room has to be re-done. There is no way to contact the desk once you are in this room if you don't carry a cell. The morning and early afternoon staff are very helpful and friendly. However, the young lady who works afternoons needs communication training. Her presentation of information is fast and disorganized. It is better to speak with the earlier shift. The location of this hotel is excellent. The Seattle Art Museum is across the street, Pike Place Market is a very short walk, and downtown shopping is also 6 blocks away. A large number of restaurants and bistros are close by. There is no need for a car. In fact, I was told that parking is $25 per day. When I stayed there was a 2 nights for 1 deal offered from Sunday to Thursday. Considering the meals and the location of this hotel, I felt it was a real deal. The regular price for my room would be outside my budget. I would stay here again if I could get the 2 for 1 deal and overall, I recommend this hotel.

Usually my husband and I stay on the two main floors of the Inn. This time my daughter, grand daughter and I stayed in a unit with two beds. These units are in another building and you need to walk outside and across a walkway. I didn't like having to get all bundled up to go to breakfast, afternoon wine or the front desk. It really isn't a big deal but wanted to mention this. The pool is in the same building as our unit so with children, that might be better. There is a video game machine (free) near the pool. However, my grand daughter was headed to the pool (immediately after check-in ) but it was closed for repairs the entire weekend. Not a good thing. Although there is not wireless internet through the Inn, we were able to get free wireless from the Harbor Steps area by sitting near the window inside or out on the balcony. I hooked up my laptop through their free internet at the desk in the unit. In the main building we are not able to get wireless in the rooms. All in all, I still give the Inn 5 stars because of the amenities, location and cost. If you walk up the Post Alley, it is a short walk to the Pike Market and interesting gum wall. Must see to know what I am talking about. Some great happy hours in the area. We walked to everything: underground tour, Pike Market, 5th street to catch the monorail to space needle, aquarium, art museum and much more. We have stayed at other Inns owned by Four Sisters. Inn at Sonoma is also a favorite. Don't be put off by the highrise building of Inn at Harbor Steps. I have read reviews and I don't see the problem with the building.

The inn has a very homey feel (fresh baked cookies at check in!) and even has an extensive library that you can borrow books from. They have breakfast every morning and cocktail hour in the afternoons. The breakfast had quite a few items like eggs, toast, oatmeal, potatoes and fruit. The only complaint that we had was that day 2 of breakfast was EXACTLY the same as day 1, down to the same exact quiche. Our last morning there we went out for breakfast because we weren't really interested in eating the same thing 3 days in a row. But it was nice to have the option of not going out.

If you like a nice tub this won't do. But you do have access to a nice fitness center and two hot tubs. Also, they need to upgrade the mattresses. These are old style, with too much wiggle.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at the Inn at the Harbor Steps twice in 2011. The first time was for one night Saturday, July 9th, with my daughter and her best friend for a bachelorette party at Can Can, http://thecancan.com/ The second time was for three nights September 21, 22 & 23, for a birthday celebration with my daughter. Both times we had a queen room facing the Harbor Steps which is an urban park. Location: Can you say location, location, location; the Inn At The Harbor Steps is in the heart of all there is to do in the downtown core. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s within an easy walking distance of the Pike Street Market, Pioneer Square, Westlake Center, the waterfront, Bell Town, Seattle Art Museum. If you want to go to the Seattle Center to see the EMP, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short walk to the monorail which will take you directly there. This may be the only hotel in downtown Seattle, except the Edgewater on the waterfront that has balconies. The Harbor Steps is an urban park that runs between 1st ave, Western ave and the water front and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lovely example of urban outdoor planning. In good weather you can sit on your balcony, enjoy the view and people watch. They are demolishing the Alaska Way viaduct, an old elevated freeway that runs along the water front. Right now you have a peak a boo view of Elliott bay from those balconies overlooking the Harbor Steps. When the viaduct is gone you will have a wonderful unhindered view of the bay. Queen Rooms: The Inn is located within a large downtown apartment complex and the queen rooms we stayed in are very large, about the same size as the studio apartments, somewhere between 550 and 600 sq ft. The rooms are nicely laid out, with a staggered open separation between the two beds, so if you are in one bed you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the other bed unless you crane your neck around. There is also a nice sitting area with comfortable chairs and tables just before the door to the balcony. There is a full sized enclosed closet in the hallway leading to the large bathroom. There is a mini fridge and coffee area between the closet and bathroom. There is also a large desk work area just inside the front door to the right. The bed linens and towels were all very nice and always clean and the amenities in the bathroom though not upscale, were not bottom line and were adequate. There is traffic noise from the viaduct but I only noticed it when I was out on the balcony and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me. Breakfast and Afternoon Tea: At breakfast there are usually several quiche type egg dishes, hot oatmeal, cereal, fruit, muffins, breads, pastries, juice, coffee and tea. The Afternoon Tea offers tea, coffee, white and red wine, cheese and crackers and some kind of cake. The afternoon tea/wine was always lightly attended and the attendant always asked for our room number I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how apartment residents could take it over as mentioned in another review and the attendant always kept everything fully stocked. Fitness Room and Pool area: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the fitness room but did walk thru and it seemed to have a nice assortment of machines with big windows looking out to the south and west. We did use the pool area which was large and very clean. I did not see any of the problems mentioned in another review. Service and Staff: We were always greeted warmly and all of our questions and requests were answered and fulfilled in a very professional and friendly manner by the front desk staff. I never saw cleaning carts left parked in the hall and our room was always very clean after the cleaning staff was there. In July, 30 minutes after checking out and while waiting in line for the ferry, we discovered we had left a large bag with all of our Pike Place Market purchases on the floor of the parking garage. We called the hotel and they immediately sent someone down to look, they found the bag and mailed it home to us. The hotel manager sent me an email later to make sure we had received the package. Parking: Yes, because of all the one way streets, you do have to drive two blocks make a right, go one block, make a right, go back two blocks, park and take an elevator back to the lobby using keys that are not electronic. It was just not a big deal to us, the parking rate is a good value compared to other hotels in the same area. The blocks are short, the garage is well marked and secure and you have easy in/out privileges that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involve waiting for a valet if you want to drive out of downtown area. To sum it up The Inn at the Harbor Steps is not a 5 star or maybe even a 4 star hotel, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I fully understand those ratings anyway. There are starting to be telltale signs of wear like carpets, paint and curtains that need up grading soon, if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to lose customers willing to pay their prices. The wine at the afternoon affair probably does come from a box as another reviewer said. Hotels in downtown Seattle are very expensive even in the off season, so for the location and price value, I would highly recommend this hotel and rate it 4 stars.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat Inn at Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "Corinn45", "ReviewID": "UR120018860", "Content": "Loved this place on our recent stay in Seattle.

So when we arrived and I saw it is part of an apartment building I cringed. Then when we finally got past the locked front door and the apartment lobby staff was so much more friendly than the hotel's staff, I began to get frustrated. This was a birthday trip for my husband, and I chose this hotel so I didn't want to disappoint him on a special weekend. We got a blur of information including parking instructions-you have to drive down two blocks, circle down behind the apartments and park in a public lot. The desk clerk did not say it was a public lot, so that was fun to figure out. In a relatively short amount of time we make it back up to the hotel and were shown to our room. The fireplace is really nice to have in your room. And their robes are wonderful. But, for now, that is where the nice ends. The bed was so hard and my pillow was so flat I woke the next day with a sore back and neck. That hasn't ever happened to me in a hotel before. Our towels smelled so strong of some chemical, I couldn't stand to use them. Rust stains around the toilet were unappealing. And I had to run the water for several minutes before I had hot water for a shower. ? How does that happen in a hotel like this??? French doors were opened immediately because the room smelled-we kept them open as much as possible. I can't place what it was, it just didn't smell good. When we opened the french doors, we noticed the white blinds were dirty, too. The lamp had a burn spot on the shade and the bedside table's laminate top was peeling. So cleanliness was poor, service was very poor, and initial presentation (including dirty elevator floors, maintenance carts parked in the lobby all day, and a locked front door you have to get buzzed into) was very poor. The next morning I hoped the next shift of staff would be better. But not really. We asked at the front desk for information on public transit to the football stadium for a game we were going to later in the afternoon. The clerk pointed us to a train tunnel two blocks up, so that was helpful. But it would have been really nice if she had also told us the buses in the tunnel run the same course and they are free. A great piece of information for downtown guests to have... Upside: staying in a hotel right by the market and the waterfront was so much fun. We saw a part of downtown Seattle we have never explored on foot, and we have been going to Seattle for a lot of years. I know there are a lot of hotels downtown to choose from, so if you are debating if it is worth it to stay downtown, it is so worth it to stay there! No hassle with finding parking downtown, come back to the hotel if you want a break, public transit is so close and takes you all over if you don't want to drive, and more to see and do around every corner than you could ever do. Really, really nice to be down in the heart of things. The breakfast and the afternoon cocktail hour are good. The food service area looks very clean and well presented. But that is not enough to make us go back to the Inn at Harbor Steps. And I would not search out a Four Sisters Inn since this one was so poor. I submitted a survey to the hotel and I will say the same thing here: this was like a hotel which wants to be upscale but just isn't willing to really put in the level of effort it takes.

The breakfast room reminded my of the common area in a Holiday Inn Express or something of that caliber. Other reviewers are correct in that parking is difficult to navigate - you want directions. You not only get physical keys, but also 2 fobs for the garage and buidling access - it's quite a handful. Do ask for a quiet room - there are a couple that appear to be right under the viaduct exit.

Here are pros and cons: CONS: Check in desk staff sit at low chairs so that you can't see them as you enter the lobby.

The bathroom had globs of stuff on the walls and grout in the shower was missing or dirty. The mat in the bath was dirty. There were layers of dust along the edges of the carpet near the bed and cobwebs in the corners. The decor was drab and uncoordinated. Heating and cooling systems are a joke, see photos. The TV was circa 1980s and placed in a location that made it difficult to watch from anywhere in the room. There was no information about local TV channels so if you are there during a weather event, you are on your own. The local magazines and Where mag were months and years out of date.

Otherwise, room is more than enough room and ample air, ample heat on the shower, etc. For the price, it was good. A few misses in housekeeping, including dirty wash clothes from former guest in shower, alarm clocks set that were not intended for us so woke us up, patio door left unlocked, etc. Having teenagers along, the location of the rooms did not leave us comfortable for their location.

The bed was average, but fine for us. Floor A room 8 Let me explain how this place is situated. This is an apartment bldg and they rent out the lower floors that are below the main level. The room are not underground as they sit along a fairly steep incline so the are along the area OFF of the Harbor Steps which are a main pedestrian way to the water 2 bolcks away. It is very quiet at night as this area outside the rooms is closed at night. There is a very nice breakfast served every day. From different egg dishes, potatoes, cereal, fresh fruit, muffins, coffee and oj. etc Changes a little daily. Allen is the cook and does a great job! From 4:30 til 6:30 they put out wine and cheese and some veggies and some kind of cake to munch on in the Library area. Very Nice. There is a small gym, basketball court, lap pool, hot tub and laundry use.. If you want to save some $$$ take the Light Rail from the airport to the University stop and walk ONE block down to !st st and the Inn is right there on the left. $2.50 per person, Yes only two and a half bucks. About $40 bucks for a taxi. Just follow the sign at the airport for the Light Rail, it's about a 5-10 minute walk and its lighted and marked well. It takes 35 minutes to get there. If you need anything there is a small market halfway down the Harbor Steps. I didn't find it till we were leaving though. Lots of places to eat in the area within walking distance. Only about a block from the waterfront, which you can take the elevator down to 1 and avoid the steps if you like. The elevator is kind of across the walkway, just ask the guys at the front desk. It's floor 6 on the way back, which is strange cause it's the ground level. I would recommend the Inn, because the staff was great, the room large and clean, the great breakfast and the afternoon wine and chesse all included. Great location also.

We had previously stayed at a Four Sisters Inn in California and had an amazing experience, so we thought that another hotel from the same chain would offer the same experience. The Inn in California was bright, clean, comfortable and the service was excellent. Everything that the Inn at Harbour Steps was not. The hotel room was nothing like the pictures on the website and didn't match the description even closely. The room was quite dark and poorly furnished. The fireplace was in a location that you couldn't sit in front of and the shams on the bed were badly stained. It was an old, dark and \"well worn\" room that didn't exactly make for a pleasant and inviting weekend. The hotel advertized wine and cheese reception every evening. Good luck on that one! When we participated about 30 minutes after the advertised start, there was no cheese left, no crackers, no fruit or veggies left, no clean wine glasses and very little wine. After washing two glasses at the sink, we each had one glass of wine before the wine was completely finished and guests were wandering around looking for refills. I went to the front desk to ask for someone to replenish the cheese and wine. After a phone call to someone, one carafe of white wine appeared after 20 minutes. No red wine, no cheese or crackers or fruit. The excuse the next day was that they only have a set amount of fruit, cheese and crackers, and they have nobody available to prepare more. The breakfast was OK, but the server in the kitchen was completely stressed out trying to keep up with the guests eating and requesting clean dishes and cutlery. We did send an e-mail to the hotel management detailing our experience, but we had no reply. I guess they just weren't interested in hearing our feedback. On a positive note, the Inn's location in Seattle is good. Close to shopping and restaurants. It could be better with a considerable amount of updating of the rooms, at least to our room. Plus the service attitude needs to change and the wine and cheese reception needs to be properly staged.

On the flipside, $18 a day to park in their garage seems a bit steep. At least there was no valet to take more of my money for parking my car. The room was attractive, clean and comfortable, with a few notable exceptions: Since the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd occupies the two lowest floors (The Harbor Step Apartments and main floor occupy the 20 floors above them.), the room was so close to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd themselves that we were disturbed by loud passersby and clanking service carts until late that night. The room was also stuffy (especially with the door closed to keep the noise down) and both the air conditioner and ceiling fan were positioned so far from the bed that that they were of limited use. Once the noise died down, we were not disturbed and the bed was reasonably comfortable, though a bit small for a King. The bathroom was elegant and well-stocked and the two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plush robes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd provided were nice. The staff was friendly and helpful when called upon, so no complaints there. Other amenities, such as the sauna, gym and hot tub were very useful, but the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free drinks and hors d'oeuvres\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they put out in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153library\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were underwhelming, especially for non-drinkers, consisting mostly of bland cheeses and odd salads. The complimentary breakfast was much better, featuring a variety of baked goods, breakfast casseroles, French toast and juices. However, only one employee was expected to cook, clean tables and assist guests. He eventually had to call the desk clerk for help and everyone had to wait for more food to be set out.

The room was outfitted with several table lamps and one floor lamp, but no overheads. This might be fine for young eyes, but it was a challenge to put my lipstick on straight.

This room was on the bottom floor of the inside atrium and the patio doors (well there was no patio so that was strange) did not lock. At night homeless people slept or walked around that atrium and we did not feel comfortable with that. The room was so dark that it was impossible to shave or put on makeup very well in addition to being very depressing and there was zero view to look at. So, the second day, after much ado and a few wasted hours later, we were transferred to a 2 bedroom queen in an entirely other part of the hotel. This part was in the tower that has mostly apartments in it and the hotel has a few rooms that they rent out. We enjoyed this room much more although it still wasn't all that clean. I had \"something\" (perhaps vomit?) running down the side of one of the bedside tables and the carpeting needed to be replaced etc. We really enjoyed the view from the big patio (complete with table and chairs) overlooking the harbor steps.

The walls must be very well insulated as we had no complaints to my very loud cheering, especially when Luis Gonzales hit the game winner in the bottom of the 9th inning.

Location is prime time 2 blocks from Pike Street Market and catty corner to the Seattle Art Museum which we took in this trip. We had been advised to take mass transit--city bus-- from the airport to downtown location. Seattle has a mass transit system to be proud of and it was a simple 1 block wall downhill to the hotel. Cost $1.50/person versus $28 + gratuity for the taxis. We did the bus round trip and saved $60+ dollars which we spent in restaurants or souvenirs. Matt's in the Market was a great place for sandwiches....the catfish sandwich you won't find better. Pike Street Chowder on Alley Street has the best clam chowder in the City. We took advantage of the breakfast and happy hour which was well received by both of us. I don't see how they class this place as a B & B, you have all the privacy of a hotel. Room 9 was much smaller than #20. For both rooms you are near access roads from the freeway, but that never seemed to bother us.

In the check-in process, a rapid stream of information as to \"What was where\" in the hotel was delivered in a robotic, barely decipherable fashion. We felt neither welcomed nor acknowledged as guests. Although clean, with a comfortable bed, the decor of our\"elegant Superior Room\" felt out-dated and lack-lustre. Teddy bears and cheap potpourris do not belong in a smart downtown hotel anymore, in my opinion, especially with such a totally different theme in the lobby area. There were no clean wine glasses in the Library for our afternoon drinks and the hors d'oeuvres needed refreshing, and we had to trail up to the front desk to get attention. Very over-heated room and music far too loud. Skipped the whole experience the next afternoon. Quality and assortment of the breakfast food was okay, but the fresh fruit (cantaloupe and melon) was hard and tasteless. Coffee was fine one day, thin the next. The breakfast room was windowless and felt like a generic basement conference room with a few artificial bouquets and some easy chairs thrown in an attempt to soften the effect. While there were 2 little tables set up in a corner of a much more open area overlooking the courtyard, they were jammed in alongside artificial plants and did not provide a sense of privacy from the traffic flow up and down the ramps nearby.

The \"Inn\" is actually two lower levels, below street level on the uphill side, of a large, fairly modern apartment building. The furnishings are a little spare, sort of \"Pottery Barnish,\" but everything was clean and most everything worked well (thankfully a plunger was located next to the toilet). You enter a common reception lobby (no more) shared by the Inn guests and the apartment dwellers. There are two desks. One of the left for the apartments and one on the right for the Inn. There is no mixing these businesses. The appartment desk will not \"give you the time of day\" if you're there for the Inn. We figured that out pretty quickly. The Inn desk was very nice, however. We'd go back at the $175 price, which is much less than traditional hotels in the area.

I found the decor to be charming and loved the little extras like the fluffy bathrobes, the fact that there were lot of towels in the bathroom, complementary bottled water and sodas and nice roomy sitting area with magazines. It was very quiet and very large. Our balcony overlooked the harbor steps where we could see both the harbor and the Seattle Art Museum's Hammering Man. We didn't have the opportunity to enjoy their included afternoon tea, but we did enjoy breakfast. It included hot quiche, bread pudding and hot oatmeal as well as the usual assortment of breads, muffins, cereals and drinks. As not every property suits every travellor, I will mention the challenges at this place. Checking in was a bit tricky. There are a couple of three-minute parking stalls in front and they were full when we arrived. After circling the block a few times, my friend got out of the car to register while I continued circling. We also had quite the adventure finding the correct parking area in the maze-like parking garage.

You have to pull up at the front of the hotel and unload from the street, get your keys and then back your car around the block in the parking garage and take an elevator back up to the lobby. Traffic was bad and i missed the one way turn to get me in front of the hotel so i went directly to the parking garage. Fortunately someone that lived there unlocked the elevator door so we could go up to the lobby. You must check in first because your room key is also the elevator key. We had two queen beds in a very spacious room, refridgerator, and balcony. All two queen beds overlook the Harbor steps and we could also see the water and pier from our room. They do not advertise these rooms as waterfront but you could see the water when sitting on the right side of the patio table (comes with 2 chairs) from all of these rooms facing the Harbor steps SW tower( i believe) You do look past the freeway to see the harbor area. The room is not sound proof and ear plugs would be necessary for light sleepers. We could here road noise and the door opening into our hallway at night. Our Room #64 was right next to this entrance door. We enjoyed the morning breakfast of quiche, potatoes, yogurt, fruit, oatmeal, cakes ect. The free pop and water in the room was a nice touch. Except there was only 2 sodas and one water our first night and we were paying for four of us in a room. House keeping left 8 the next night. The afternoon wine was average and they din't have anyone working the room. We were told to come up and ask if the wine ran out but who wants to run up and ask. Two of us ran along the waterfront in the morning, down the harbor steps and one block further. The Argosy cruise loads right there. We jogged down to the edgewater hotel and circled around pike street for Starbucks and French pastries at 7:30 am on a Sunday. There are many food choices nearby. The Seattle museum is directly across the street and one day we hopped a city bus that stopped in front of it to the Seattle center, walked around there and took the monorail near the Space needle to Westlake mall for shopping. Nordstroms and Macy's ect are all right around here. We walked back to the hotel from there. If you love wine the Purple Cafe was fun and had alot of energy. We felt a little under dressed but sat at the bar and forgot about it after a few glasses of wine. We had dinner at the Wild Ginger a couple blocks away it was about $50 a person with drink and dinner. Lots of energy here too. A reservation is advised. I would definitely stay here again. While i was here on a girls weekend i would bring my family. (kids 9 and 10) There was a pool, sauna, hottubs, weight room, barbque area, indoor basketball court. However I only noticed one family with kids there while we were there. I joggged by the waterfront Marriot which is on the opposite end of the waterfront and thought this would also be a good choice. Its closer to the Space Needle and you can enter pike street from the opposite end. It appears to have serveral different size balconies which look toward the water and the indoor/outdoor pool looked cool. Its close the the cruise ships sailing to Alaska and would be a great hotel to stay in before a cruise. I hope this helps.

The rooms had high ceilings and a fireplace. The amenities were also great, with an accessible gym and daily breakfasts that included oatmeal, cereal, breads, and frittatas. The staff was very friendly and was free to answer any questions we had. While these were great, there were a few drawbacks. First, during our stay, the weather in Seattle ranged from cool to pleasant with a few sprinkles in between. Unfortunately, the Inn blasted the common areas with heat that eventually affected the temperature of our room. While we were excited to have a fireplace, it was never used...and in fact, we turned on the ceiling fan and used the AC unit to cool off our room. In another attempt to cool ourselves down, we tried to open the French doors to let some air in. To our dismay, the top hinge to the right door was not attached and the door looked like it would fall off. A second concern was quality/cleanliness of the bedroom/bathroom area. The bath towels were older and frayed and one of the bathrobes that was hanging had makeup stains on the collar. Also, there were stains on the floor prior to our use which was not wiped off by the cleaning crew. Third, the bed and pillows were not the most comfortable.

Not all rooms are in the tower which houses the breakfast/front desk/pool/library. Its not a far walk, but if it is raining it means getting wet carrying your food back to your room. (2) wine and food in afternoon ----this was a wonderful touch, except they never replenished the food--even such items as crackers or cheese.

We had only the dimmest of lights from the lamps, to the point that I couldn't even choose an outfit from my suitcase without checking what I had in the bathroom lights. As the majority of our stay was dark and rainy outside, the option of bright lighting in the room would have been better.

It's a quick walk to Pike Place Market, Seattle Aquarium, the downtown shopping district, Pioneer Square, and the ferries. It's also two blocks away from my favorite seafood restaurant, Elliott's. ROOMS: The rooms are extremely large - they appear to actually be studio apartment floorplans since the majority of the building is residential. Ceilings are very high with floor to ceiling glass facing the steps down to the waterfront. Beds are comfortable, there is LOTS of closet space, and a small balcony with table and chair overlooking the Harbor Steps. EXTRAS THAT MATTERED: 1) We had our two toddler daughters with us and the staff was terrific - expecially Laura at the concierge desk. 2) Included breakfast was continental, but with lots of fruit, baked items, cereal, yogurt, juice, and a wonderful egg/potato/cheese dish. 3) Parking is secure under the building with easy exit to Western Avenue via Seneca. 4) There's a Tully's Coffee and gourmet deli along The Steps in addition to a million restaurants in the neighborhood. 5) If you want to use Seattle's public transit to go to the University or East Side, it's right there. 6) The folks at the desk will let you drop off your bags early before check-in. 7) Refrigerator in the room was great for the kids. 8) There's a nice library where you can relax. 9) There are DVD machines in the rooms and a DVD library to pick from. DRAWBACKS: Our room was right by the entrance door to the Inn rooms in the building so we could hear the door closing at night as people came in and out. Overall, it was a great experience and we will be back on our next trip. NOTE: I previously lived in Seattle for 13 years, so I feel qualified to say the location is ideal and the room price ($200 per night) very reasonable for that location.", "Date": "November 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Standford, CT", "Title": "\u201cGreat home away from home, wonderful hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4052867", "Content": "Great hotel!

Like most large cities, Seattle has some street people, however the hotel feels like a safe and quiet place in the middle of a the city. Never felt unsafe walking around town. Save your money and do not rent a car, we paid to have it parked the entire time in the garage and never took it out! The staff had great advice on resturants, and had all their menus! Also thanks to David at the front desk we took a ferry, just blocks away from the hotel to Bainbridge Island and had lunch, wonderful view of Seattle. This is a must to experience Seattle.

We are in our late twenties and a professional working couple, no kids and have never been to Seattle. LOCATION Great: Location, truly is close to everything. Not so Great: Bums and close proximity to strip clubs. ROOM Great: Noise level in rooms. Despite being next to several busy roads, the noise level was minimium if you could hear anything at all. We stayed in a whirpool tub and fireplace room, which I highly recommend if you can afford to spend the extra money. The Jacuzzi tub is fantastic. Getting the paper everyday is nice as well. Not so Great: Our room had a particular \"cold\" feeling to it. The room has a very high ceiling and the walls are painted stark white. It just doesn't have a \"cozy\" feeling. The fireplace ----. You can't turn it up or down, you just flip a switch. This may be fine for some, but in comparison to other places we have stayed, the fireplace always has had some control to it. In this case, its either ON or OFF. Our comforter had some \"stains\" on it when we arrived. We called the front desk and it was changed promptly. Comment: Some nights we received turn down service and some nights we didn't. One night a gentlemen came and asked if we wanted turn down, we were getting ready to leave for dinner and asked if he could come back in 15 minutes. He then became a tad forceful that the turn down was either now or never. We had 2 nights of turndown including the above and two nights with no turn down. Weird. FOOD Great: Complimentary soda and water in your room. We had a very early flight upon our departure and were offered plates in our room. Not so great: The breakfast was hardly more then a contintental breakfast. Ours for 4 straight days was, an egg quiche (which was terrible), fruit, yogurt, cold cereal, oatmeal, a variety of breads, juice, coffee, and tea. There was no variety for 4 days. For those of you that know about foods, this is a straight sugar and carb breakfast. I had read on their own website and additional reviews on this site about their \"Fabulous Four Sisters Inn\" breakfast. I feel that the breakfasts we experienced fell short. In addition the tea/wine hour wasn't that great either but again this is compared to our previous experiences. There was wine offered (terrible wine), cheese, crackers, and 1 - 2 kinds of tea. There weren't any pastries of any kind. Like I said, our experiences has been to either have a scone, cookie, etc offered with tea. Staff: Great: Janice and Greg were fabulous. Very kind curteous and helpful. The umbrellas were great as well. Not so Great: Other staff members. They didn't know much if at all about how to get around, restaurants etc. They kept talking to us like we were from there, using phrases like \"just over there\" \"around the corner\" Overall the stay at this hotel was \"OK\". I would probably venture to stay elsewhere next time, dependent on price. The greatest thing about this Inn is the location, the worst thing was the breakfast and the tea/wine hour. I paid $800 for 4 nights in their top of the line room, I don't think this stay was worth $800.", "Date": "October 18, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Inn at Harbor Steps - A Four Sisters Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d115723-Reviews-Inn_at_Harbor_Steps_A_Four_Sisters_Inn-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$173 - $274*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1221 First Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "115723", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e7/e1/e7e133dacb1c2de211a06983551e38ed81large.jpg"}}
