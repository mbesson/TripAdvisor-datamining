The staff was always accommodating and willing to assist with our many questions. When we blew our plug adapter they had spares on hand so we could continue taking a million pictures. They provided champagne and strawberries on arrival since it was our honeymoon. They made reservations for us for dinner. I thought breakfast was fantastic with a variety of meat, cheeses and pastries (a little something for everyone). The common spaces were beautiful. We stayed in the Pompeiana (room 813) which was a standard room. We took a lot of care to pick out this room because it had a huge and amazing bathtub in the photos. Did not disappoint. A beautiful room with a view out onto the garden and the bathtub was amazing after a long day of walking around. Words to the wise that I do not consider negatives - Prepare to walk. The Aventine is not in the middle of everything. But it is very doable. Also, the metro is very usable. Lastly, the beds are a bit harder than what most Americans are used to. But this is not a flaw of the hotel but rather a difference in culture that I point out only so that people are not surprised and think it is something particular to this hotel.

The service is excellent (for instance, at check-in you are greeted with a welcome drink), and cleanliness superb. Morning breakfast is rich: I only wished I didn't find three days of bad weather that prevented us from enjoying it outside (there are patios in the back and in the front of the hotel). The hotel is part of a group of three, all located nearby, and a restaurant has been opened recently (though being just a few minutes of walk from Testaccio, we didn't try it). Keep in mind the being above a hill, if you have to reach it on foot it's a 5/10 minutes walk uphill (from the nearest bus stop). The Aventine is a residential area with beautiful centuries-old buildings, trees and parks.

And yellows and golds. And cypresses and date palms. Even the deepest nine-hour jet lag yields to the tinkling sounds of tiny birds and a shaft of spring sunlight falling across open luggage and scattered clothes. Waking up after a night's journey halfway around the world can be disorienting. But to open your eyes in a room in the Hotel San Anselmo is to know you're in Rome. Near the crest of the Aventine Hill, the San Anselmo is set in a peaceful neighborhood of quiet palazzos, elegant apartments and ancient churches. Down the street are parks with sweeping views of the Eternal City's domes, spires and jagged ruins. The hotel's decor is a playful modern nod to the city's Baroque heritage, with striped canopies over the windows and inlaid marble bathroom floors. A blast from the dual-head shower followed by a warm towel from the heated racks is steadying enough for a trip down to the airy, orchid-filled breakfast room for the buffet of hot and cold items, included in the hotel's rates. The San Anselmo often hosts managers and consultants with business in the international agencies headquartered in Rome. The morning tables are occupied by serious-looking professionals logged in to the hotel's complimentary wi-fi, flicking intently away at smartphone screens. There is no restaurant, but the barman is always happy to whip up a toasted panino and pour a glass of prosecco for you to enjoy in an overstuffed chair in the lounge. Or if you'd rather sit on the terrace with a cappucino while reading La Repubblica under the grapevines, you have only to ask. Service at the San Anselmo is flawless. The staff are pleasant and efficient and graciously see to it that guests' needs are met. From a 3:00 AM wake-up to numerous phone calls and considerable time wrangling with an airline when I mistakenly thought I had left a pair of glasses on the plane, nothing was ever a problem. And who needs a hotel restaurant when you are a few blocks' walk down a curving cobblestoned street from some of Rome's best dining? At the foot of the Aventine Hill, across the jumbled traffic of the Via Marmorata, lies the Testaccio neighborhood. Historically the site of the city's butchers, it's still the place to go to sample Rome's traditional snout-to-tail cuisine. Testaccio is also home to the famous Volpetti deli, a jewelry shop of the finest delicacies the Italian peninsula can provide, from meats and cheeses to pastas, wines, and a densely sweet, espresso-colored balsamic vinegar the clerks will insist you taste. Next to the deli is Volpetti Piu, a tavola calda where servers dish up ample helpings of roast chicken, octopus salad, stuffed zuccini blossoms and rice balls for patrons in a plain, fluorescent-lit space. Tourists and Roman families crowd the tables, sipping hearty house wine and discussing the day's events between forkfuls of steaming fresh lasagne and stuffed tomatoes. The Aventine Hill is only a Metro stop or two from Rome's most iconic tourist sights. But after a day of noise, crowds, fake gladiators outside the Colosseum, spilled gelato and cultural overload, there's no more peaceful place to retire. Climb wearily out of the Piramide metro stop. Walk past the ancient Aurelian Walls and the pyramid-shaped tomb of imperial official Caius Cestus (like you, a tourist, who had his burial place modeled on those of the Pharaohs after a visit to Egypt). Head up the cobbled street, past the giggling schoolchildren and the yellow mimosa branches trailing over the stone walls. Wander on to the crest of the hill, past the discreet polished brass placard marking the Egyptian Embassy to the Holy See. Across the street is a plain wall, with a few tourists standing around, their black-leather-jacket-clad taxi drivers chatting near their idling vehicles waiting a few yards down the street. Approach the ancient door to see what the other visitors are bending down to view. The door, perpetually locked, has a keyhole that perfectly frames a view of Saint Peter's dome hovering serenely over the gardens of the Knights of Malta. The other tourists get back into their taxis, leaving the neighborhood to silence and the singing birds. But you'll be lucky enough to walk a block back to the San Anselmo.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel to stay in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Natalie B", "ReviewID": "UR127158904", "Content": "San Anselmo is one of a group of three hotels in a quiet residential area of Rome on Aventino hill.

Yes its true, you do wake to the sound of birdsong and i you a really lucky, as our friends were, to the sound of Gregorian Chant from the nearby monastery. Our room was on the top floor and overlooked the small shaded garden where we had a wonderful breakfast every morning. The rooms and all individually and tastefully decorated and the bathrooms excellent. Our friends found the night clerk to be a little aloof and distant ( they had a long flight with delays and really could have used a friendly face) but we had no problem withe the service and requests.

She could not have been more right. We chose Rome for our honeymoon and months of research and recommendations from friends and family we decided on San Anselmo. I emailed the hotel many (many) times before our arrival inquiring about New Years Eve and airport transfers and found the staff to be very helpful and responsive. We did not manage to pre-arrange out airport transfer as we were going to attempt to get there ourselves as our flight was getting in earlier enough to try. Unfortunately due to bad weather we missed our connection and had an ETA of 8PM in Rome. With nothing but my blackberry int'l data plan I managed to arrange over email with the hotel to have a car service pick us up at the airport. The transfer was quiet affordable and we were happy when we arrive Rome and saw a sign with our name. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by pleasant reception staff who helped us settle up with the taxi driver for the agreed upon price as our Italian was none existent. Our room was great. The bathroom was amazing so much so I told my husband when we get a house I want to build a bathroom like the one in our room at the hotel. The heat worked great which was clutch as we visited in the height of winter. An additional plus was the bathroom had heated towel racks. On the first morning we stopped downstairs to inquire about the best way to get around Rome as our first stop was the Vatican. The front desk staff was very knowledgeable and gave us the best advice which was to take the bus. He told us where to get tickets and that the bus stop was right down the hill. (bus 23 took us to the Vatican in 10 mins and bus 3 or 280 took us to the Colosseum in 8 mins- we got a tourist 3 day unlimited pass for the bus for 11 Euro which was a deal) Breakfast- It was authentic and plentiful! We stayed for 4 Nights and 4.5 days and there was so much choice I did not have the opportunity to taste everything and believe me I tried. Cappuccinos each morning and a full breakfast allowed us to have a light lunch around 2pm and then a nice dinner. The Hotel is also quite close (15 min walk along the river) to Traverse in Rome which is located on the opposite side of the river. The Traverse is a long street with many restaurants and bars. My husband and I ate at a different restaurant there each night. The food was great and affordable which was a pleasant surprise as we were told it would be expensive to eat in Rome. Honestly I did not think the prices were bad as they were quite comparable to the value you could get in NYC restaurants (not the expensive ones). The hotel was also very close the the \"Jewish Ghetto\" which had another strip of restaurants. We ate at Giggetto al Portico d'Ottavia which was the best meal we had in Rome. One of the sites close to the San Anselmo is the keyhole which is beyond amazing. I won't say what you will see but ask the front desk to point you in the right direction and check it out. The surrounding area of the hotel was a quite, safe, clean residential area. My husband and I walked around and also identified the other hotels owned by the same chain in the same area. Without a doubt we will visit San Anselmo or one of its sister hotels in the future.

However, they couldn't do more to help with our questions on how to get to attractions, where to eat for a special birthday meal and arranging transfer back to the airport (Mercedes private taxi company at \u20ac40 one way - recommended). The two bar men were so charming and serve up late night drinks to enjoy in the lounge or front terrace with a warm smile and good humour. A brilliant way to finish off each evening! We received complimentary sparkling wine and strawberries on arrival and for the day of my birthday - really lovely touch. The location: It was incredibly hot during our stay (32/33 degrees each day) so the walk uphill was more hard work, despite us being young(ish!) and fit. If you are visiting during the cooler months this will be less of an issue. It takes approx 15 minutes to walk to Travestere, 20-25 minutes to walk to the Colliseum and around 30-40 minutes to stroll to the central area of Campo F\u2019iori/Piazza Navona/Pantheon etc. We simply took taxis back from Travastere and Campo F\u2019iori(\u20ac9/11 respectively) to save the legs and indigestion after a meal with lovely local wine! Places to eat: We didn't pick Testaccio for eating out as we felt it lacked any charm for romantic meals out. We were visiting for my 40th birthday weekend so wanted places with a terrace or looking over a pretty piazza. But several local restaurants get a write up in Lonely Planet. PS - Be sure to visit the Volpetti deli (Testaccio) \u2013 lovely charactful place and they give you loads of free samples. We bought some tasty olives to enjoy on our terrace. Wanting to eat out - fear not! It is a pleasant 15 minute walk downhill to the wonderful Travestere area (head right out of the hotel - walk down the cobbled pathway just past the Orange Park - and across the Ponte Palatino) where you will find a fantastic choice of relaxed and reasonably priced trattorias, bars and restaurants. Make sure you walk a good distance in for the best choice. We found Travastere best value area to eat in, compared to Campo F'iori/Piazza Farnesse which was lovely setting but more expensive. We went there on the night of my birthday. Can recommend restaurant \"Osteria ar Galleto\" - head into Piazza Farnesse and it is tucked in the right hand corner by the alleyway. Fab atmosphere (lots of Italians eating there too), not too expensive, funny and charming waiting staff.

We chose three others as back-up in case they did not have availability for the dates we selected. I read all of the reviews very carefully and loved the hotel website. I sent off my email inquiry to reserve for October 2010. The hotel website reservation service did not work when I tried twice to use it. In addition, the packages available had unclear information. I wanted to talk to someone at the hotel and see what they could recommend to fit our stay in Rome. What I got back in response was this: The rate right now is 270 euros (I wanted the rate for October). Send me your credit card details. See our website for promotions (I had specified the promotion was unclear that I needed their help). Ok, so I respond again \u2013 politely \u2013 asking the rates for October, confirmation of the room details (is there a balcony, etc) and specific recommendations on their package for a 4-day stay. Two days go by and someone else responds: Check our website and send us your credit card details. And so on and so on until I just gave up. The responses we got from other hotels in Rome were impeccable, with full details, cancellation policy, package recommendations and even airport pick-up information. We chose one in particular, the Palm Gallery, which is just outstanding service-wise. Why was it so hard for Hotel S Anselmo to take two minutes out of their day to help us book our reservation properly? I do not know but it left a bad taste in my mouth and we will not ever go there. This is my own personal experience and perhaps the hotel really is top-notch, as the other reviews say, but I find it hard to start off on such a rude basis when we were about to put down over a thousand euros for a hotel that is not even city-center.

The staff could not be faulted for anything, being very helpful and yet discrete - the front desk staff could not be more accommodating with any request. The hotel serves a very nice breakfast, which should be eaten outside in the back garden if the weather permits. While not having its own restaurant for dinner, the sister Hotel San Pio around the corner is a good spot for dinner (maitre d' is Stefano). The hotel staff will also recommend many good restaurants within walking distance in the area - be sure to try Trattoria de Bucatino on Via Luca Della Robbia, which looks very plain from outside but is one of those great family-run neighbourhood restaurants where the locals go for good honest Italian food. The rooms in the hotel are absolutely lovely - make sure to upgrade if you can get a reasonable rate, as it is certainly worth the extra money, even given the fact that the standard rooms are still superior to most hotels. As a recommendation, I would suggest strolling along to the wooden gate of the adjacent Order of Malta headquarters, which gives you a narrow view directly across Rome to the Vatican via a hole in the gate itself, and then taking a walk through the nearby orange tree park (ask at the hotel reception for directions) to get a great view of Rome from a height. Then go back out of the park itself and take the walkway running parallel to the park, which brings you down to the river - walk 600-700 metres along the riverbank, and either catch the 23 bus to the Vatican or stroll across the pedestrian bridge (Ponte Fabricio) on to the Isola Tiberina, and on from there to the rest of Rome...

My husband made his decision by looking at its reviews in Trip Adviser, and I'm glad he did so. All good things that have been said about this place, they are true. First of all, it is located in a very quiet, upscale residential area. The building itself used to be a private villa before being turned into a hotel. But don't think that it is in a remote area; we could walk from the hotel to the T-station (and the next station is Colosseum) in about 10 minutes. And it is a very nice walk. If you take a cab from the hotel, it takes 10 minutes to the central Rome, for 7-8 Euros. The room we stayed was beautifully furnished. Oh and the bathroom... Beautiful red marbles and the luxurious shower area are what I remember. Usually I'm disgusted to use hotel bathrooms no matter how clean they look, but I felt very comfortable in this place. The only possibly negative thing I can say about the room is the fact that they joined two twin beds to make a bed for two. You could feel the gap between the beds when lying. But we were so captured by all the other nice things about the hotel, it did not bother us that much. This was also mentioned in the hotel reviews, so we expected that. They offer a rich breakfast in their peaceful backyard. Breakfast included tea, coffee, cheese and jam varieties, boiled eggs, cherry tomatoes, butter, honey, Nutella, cereal, etc. However, they do not have a restaurant to offer dinner. Still not a problem. They have a sister hotel in 5 minute walk: Hotel Villa San Pio. We had dinner there two nights and it was great. It was also very romantic to walk back to our hotel after the dinner. I don't understand why some people told in their reviews that the staff were negligent. They were very kind to us.

We wanted a place that would suit our party of three couples staying in Rome for several days at the end of a cruise. This place completely filled the bill, and was described by some of our party as the best part of our Roman stay. Those of us who weren't keen on traipsing all day welcomed the away-from-the-bustle location, and spent time relaxing in the garden or exploring the neighborhood. This area is home to embassies, old churches, walled garden villas, schools and monasteries.

Each day staff at the front desk helped us find and make reservations at local restaurants, but it seemed to me that hand-holding with tourists might not be a favorite duty. We walked to the sister hotel's restaurant (good, moderate prices) and also Apuleius restaurant (good but expensive). We also walked down the hill, along the river and across the Ponte Palatine to Trastevere for more casual, reasonably-priced restaurants. Owner and staff were willing to negotiate a lower rate for three rooms, and arranged for a driver and a no-frills minivan to meet us at the cruise ship port to transport us and lots of luggage to the hotel for a reasonable price. If you stay at Sant'Anselmo, be sure to visit one of my all-time favorite churches, the early-Christian-era Santa Sabina (ca. 432) set in a lovely rose garden.

Other rooms where much bigger with balconies and seperate rooms etc... the mad thing is they are all the same price. So book very carefully, as a box is charged the same as a suite.

The streets are one way but the local cab drivers know their way around and we were treated in a very fair manner by them. Taxi drivers from Termini might not and we were ripped off a bit (a common theme in tourist destinations.) The breakfast and private garden are a wonderful way to start the day.

Both the common areas and the rooms (at least the one we were in - 831, the Mirror Room) are really lovely - OK, so our room wasn't the biggest, but it was big enough and certainly didn't feel cramped. Breakfast (outside in the garden when we were there in mid-May) is fantastic.The overall impression is romantic and elegant, and we enjoyed our stay. But - is it worth the price we paid (270 euros per night)? On balance, not quite. First, even though all rooms are advertised as having air-con, it's really pretty feeble compared to (far less expensive) hotels I've stayed at elsewhere. As a result, the room never really dropped to a temperature that I would call comfortable. And remember we went in mid-May, when the weather was 27 degrees (that's about 82 degrees ) - I imagine in mid-summer, when the temperature can hit close to 40, it must get pretty unbearable. Mainly, though, as others have mentioned on this site, we were really disappointed - angry, in fact - with the attitude of the front-desk staff. We also experienced the general sense of apathy when we checked in, and on the odd occasion that we needed some information. Worse, though - we needed internet access during our stay, but our in-room internet connection wasn't working. The front desk seemed totally unconcerned by this, suggesting that we walk to another hotel to use their internet - despite the fact that the front desk had internet access on a computer right there, and could easily have let us use it for two minutes. At the other hotel we had to hang around waiting for the sole computer terminal to come free. Are these big issues? Not really, no. But after having paid a fair chunk of money for a room, I would have expected better all-round service than this.

Also, the hotel is in a very quiet residential neighbourhood - which is good for the tranquillity factor, but makes finding a decent place to eat nearby a bit of a trial, especially as the hotel has no restaurant of it's own. Definitely ask for the restaurant map from front desk!

We both absolutely loved our rooms - 834 is quite small but has a huge bathroom which is the same size as the bedroom! 825 is incredibly romantic with Italian love poems on the walls and a lovely terrace. It doesn't have a bath but it does have a power shower with all kinds of jets on it. On the day of the wedding we were moved into room 829 which was meant to be the best room in the hotel. It was nice but we both actually preferred the rooms that we had been in. 829 was big but only had small windows in the bedroom itself so it felt quite dark. There was also only really limited storage space - no drawers, just one small wardrobe - so we ended up living out of suitcases during our stay. Room 829 does have a terrace, which is a nice feature, but the terrace is shared with the room next door and so is not private, plus the view is away from the centre of Rome rather than towards it so there are no famous landmarks to spot on the horizon. Also the layout of the room is such that when you enter the room you are in a corridor with the entrance to the terrace at the end and then the bedroom is a separate room off to the right. The floor to ceiling windows leading on to the terrace made the corridor very light but also made it like a sauna and the air conditioning unit in the bedroom struggled to keep the room cool unless the door to the bedroom was kept shut all the time. The bathroom was also quite disappointing as it was tiny and had no windows or air conditioning so it became hot quite quickly. We much preferred the bathrooms in the other two rooms. Having said all that, we still loved our stay at Hotel San Anselmo. We had 15 wedding guests staying with us in the hotel and they all loved their rooms. Also things such as breakfast, the garden, the lounge area etc were excellent as stated in the other reviews. Also I must say a final word about the service in the hotel. All the staff were amazingly friendly and efficient. Nothing was too much trouble for them. When we left the hotel to go to the train station it was raining and there were no taxis available at all. The concierge pulled out all the stops for us and called in a favour from an airport transfer service who rushed us to the station free of charge just in time for the train! Without the help of the hotel we would never have made it. I would definitely recommend the hotel but I would specifically request a room that is not 829 next time.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Hotel\u201d", "Author": "gasman401", "ReviewID": "UR16699251", "Content": "This is a perfect hotel for a great price!

The Aventine hill is a quiet, residential neighborhood in Rome with nice parks and astounding views. Although it is technically in the city center ist is certainly not in the middle of the action. There are no places to eat directly by the hotel. For restaurants it is a 15 minute walk to Trastevere, Testaccio or the Jewish Ghetto. The main tourist sites are a little farther. Indeed, the walk back is UP THE HILL but what do you expect, it's a hill! Personally I loved the location. Rome can get pretty crazy and it is nice to stay a little away from the \"scene\".

The colluseum and Roman Forum are only a 15 minute walk away and the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps an extra 10-15 minutes.

I wanted something totally different, somewhere charming and more personal to stay on my own time and money. The hotel Sant Anselmo exceeded my expectations, I cant really find anything to gripe about. We had only one problem, and that was that we were first given a room on the ground floor (room 802)and there was a terrace door out to the garden that couldnt be left open through the night, there was no window and I have to have the window open at night for fresh air, also I am a light sleeper and the phone in the reception area woke me up several times during the first night. the next morning I explained my problem to the staff at the front desk and they said they are pretty full but would look into it. Returning to the hotel in the afternoon we were offered a choice of 2 rooms that were available, we chose room 814 which is a lovely romantic room, quite large compared to the other rooms, with a large bathroom with jacuzzi bathtub and great shower, there are also 2 sinks and marble everywhere. Towels were changed in the evening and chocolates placed on the pillows. No problems after the move, slept like a baby.

The airline lost our bags, I travel all the time and used to loosing my bags, you usually get them on the next flight. But not Alitalia, the bags arrived at the airport the same night we did but it took them for ever to get them from the airport to the hotel. every time I called they would say please hold and then hang up, I was about to blow my top and head out to the airport and get them myself after 2 days.But the desk manager at the hotel called for us and the same day the bags were brought to our room.

The hotel staff welcomed us with a big smile and talked good English. They willingly provided us with good tips and information about how to get to the main attractions in Rome. Baci chocolates were left on our pillows every evening, and it became a treat that we really looked forward to. Breakfast provided a good selection of cured meats and Italian cheeses, bread, boiled eggs, cereals, fresh fruit, dried fruit, yoghurt, sweets and pastries. Together with a lovely cappuccino, it was a great way to start off your day in Rome! The Hotel is situated in the quiet area of Aventino, right between the Metro stations of Pyramide and Circo Massimo (both are approximately a 10 minute walk away). It is possible to walk to the main attractions from the hotel, as the Collosseum, Circo Massimo and Foro Rormano are just 15 minutes away, while the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, and Piazza Navona are less than a 75 minute walk away, especially if you walk along the Tiber river. The metro is relatively cheap and easy to use. There are two main metro lines, A (red) and B (blue) and both connect at Termini station. Line B runs until 23.00 while Line A runs until 21.00 with night buses taking the same route until 23.00. A single metro ticket (BIT) costs 1 Euro while a day metro ticket (BIG) costs 4 Euro. If you are arriving from Fiumicino Airport you can ask the Hotel to book you a taxi at a fixed rate of 40 Euro for the 25 minute drive. Otherwise you can choose either of the following options to get to the Hotel from Fiumicino: - Get on the stopping train (FR1) from Fiumicino airport and get off at Ostiense, which is connected with Pyramide station (ticket costs 5.75 Euro). You can then walk it to the hotel or else get a taxi for about 8 Euro. OR Getting on the Leonardo Express train from Fiumicino to Termini station (ticket costs 9.50 Euro), and then getting the metro to Circo Massimo or Pyramide. You can then walk it to the hotel or take a taxi for about 8 Euro. I would suggest that you go to Piazza Cavallieri di Malta and look through the keyhole of the front gate. It is just a corner away from the Hotel and through the keyhole you would be able to see the Dome of St Peter\u2019s Basilica!

When we got to the hotel and advised them, the gentleman on reception couldn't have been apologetic, saying that he'd actually booked it himself. The reception itself is stunning, a lot of glass, chandliers & tasteful furniture...............all feeling very cool & calm after the mad Roman drivers, which make you just want to close your eyes & hope for the best! When we got to our room, the previous hassle was soon forgotten! We had a lovely large room on the first floor, a huge shower with green twinkling lights and a veranda with a table & chairs that overlooked the garden. It was a bit noisy in the morning as the kitchen was just below, & we didn't actually use the veranda, but even so it was a stunning room. Also the free San Anselmo hotel cocktail soon soothe our travellers nerves! ;-) Now the breakfast was one of the best things about the hotel!! It was warm enough for us to eat in the garden everyday & there was so much choice - cereals, cheeses, fresh fruit, toast, croissants, meats, cakes etc etc - all very well laid out & fresh. Although this hotel is a bit away from the centre of Rome, we didn't actually find it too far to walk anywhere - especially when we found the short cut to the river down the Aventine hill - mind you a better route going, rather than coming back up the hill! We had intended to use the tourist bus to get around but you got much more of a taste of Rome, by walking through all the hidden side streets & stopping a little coffee bars to rest. Walking back was sometimes more difficult, especially the day when we had a 3 hour liquid lunch in the Hotel de Russie, people watching the immaculate, sophisticated Italians going about their business!! Not sure that wine & expensive boutiques are a good combination either, as we finished with a bit of shopping. ;-) It was so nice to come back to some peace & tranquility after a hard day's sightseeing - just to sit in the chairs outside & have a quick drink & listen to the sound of the birds. We always found the staff very friendly & welcoming. A lovely touch was the little chocolates on the bed when it was turned down - although for some reason we only got those the first day. After all our walking we only managed to to go as far as the sister hotel, Hotel Villa S. Pio, for dinner each night. Well actually the first night we just nipped in for a post sightseeing glass of wine & ended up staying for dinner! Food there was lovely and the service was perfect, outside on the patio, especially the bottle of Veuve Cliquot that my husband had somehow arranged...................and only 5 mins back to the San Anselmo! A couple of things to note - just round from the hotel is a big tall gate in a piazza, which if you look through the keyhole, gives you a perfect view of the dome of St Peter, both day & night. Also a bit further along the road to the right is a small garden with stunning views across Rome to the Vatican. Mind you every which way you look, there is stunning architecture & history! During dinner on our last night we were already planning our return trip.....................need I say more!", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAutumn Break in Rome\u201d", "Author": "themacrae", "ReviewID": "UR10163495", "Content": "got a rate of 270euro b+b via venere.com for this very pleasant hotel in a peaceful part of town and convenient for bus 30 Express and metro (Pyramid) into the centre if you are ready for 10/15 minute walk - downhill going and uphill back. One morning there was a taxi strike which created enormous traffic jams but otherwise the journey in was quick and the bus came often. The hotel room was a triumph of the over egged school of interior design with hanging curtains and a wonderful chandelier. The bathroom was a mass of marble and rococo frames around the mirrors but no where to hang the robes provided. The assumption seems to be that you will throw everything on the floor. Room was decorated with handwritted extracts in italian a form of tasteful graffiti from the poets - Keats, Goethe etc. Tele was new and integrated with internet connection but irritating to operate - did not try the internet connection. MIni bar and safe provided. Room was clean and well-serviced with English speaking maid who remembered our request for extra pillows. Turn down service and Baci on pillow. We had only brought hand luggage with the current restrictions on liquids, aerosols etc so were glad of the shampoos and shower gels - there was one packet of shaving cream which was not replenished. Very pleasant breakfast crew speaking English and good choice of fruit, pastries, boiled eggs, ham and cheese. Ate in the garden on the first morning but it got too cold thereafter but it would be a great asset in summer. The chairs in the inside breakfast room were the heaviest pieces of furniture I have ever attempted to move - they had heavy steel frames. Tried associated restaurant in one of the other two hotels in the big garden square - at 85euros the most expensive meal we two had in Rome and by no means the best but OK for the first evening when we had not had time to explore. Plenty of good restaurants down the hill in Testaccio in the via Luca della Robbia if you want to eat locally. Front desk gave us a useful map of local restaurants which we supplemented with Time Out and Lonely Planet guides. To sum up the hotel met our needs for a comfortable base back in a quiet part of town after hard days' sightseeing. In addition to the location, the premises were stylish if a little over the top and we would go back to the location and perhaps try one of the other properties in the same garden.

The walk into town can be cut down by walking up to the top of S\u2019Anselmo (a few mins) and cutting through the park straight down to Circo Maximo in which you are in easy walking distance of the Colosseum and Forum (all downhill!) Then park also has some very nice views across the Tiber. Rome itself is a wonderful contrast and well worth a visit. Colleseum is about 11 Euro but is a must see. There are touts outside who will tell you the wait to get in is about a hour and they would get you in on a tour party for around 22 E (we queued for 10 mins) As for the Vatican the queue looked like it was approx 3 hours long at 830 in the morning (cost 13E) and it does not open until 10am. I know most books say get there early however it may be better to try latter in the day! The Metro is fairly cheap at around 1E a trip although it is a bit grimy down there, be prepared for sardines if going to the Vatican early on the Metro. As for San Pietro the queues look quite long however mainly this is a security check and you get to the front fairly quickly, it is free unless you want to view Rome from the top in which you will pay approx 7E for the lift (then walk up another 300 steps to the top). The views from the top are stunning. Suggest if going by train you go to Ostiense instead of the main terninal at Termini (costs about half) although if you have got an early flight back beware of the early morning trains from here, they are packed!
