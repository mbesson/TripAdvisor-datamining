Accidentally booked a single room while traveling with my wife. (Single rooms in Europe fit only one person) Despite the hotel being basically completely booked, the staff were able to work things out in a very reasonable fashion. It also gave me the opportunity to see three rooms in one visit. I've stayed at many hotels in Paris and they all have small rooms and bathrooms. It's just the way things are there so don't go expecting you'll have some huge room like you'd get at say the Indianapolis Marriott. What you want are clean, comfortable rooms with decent bathrooms and nicely appointed common areas. This hotel has all these things but much more. I should also mention that my wife was very happy that the bathroom \"products\" were all l'occitaine. We stayed in what they call an executive suite one night, which was on the smallish side, but comfortable. The only issue was that rooms 29 and 30 are next to the breakfast and lounge area so there was some noise at night, but didn't notice much in the morning. We then moved to the junior suite, which was very nice, on the top floor with sort of a separate sitting area. Very comfy room with exposed beam ceiling. Common areas were very comfortable with an asian-influenced, but very Parisian decor. The breakfast was quite good with excellent bread and good coffee and croissants. I would also recommend a visit to Carton bakery, which is nearby and has perfect croissants. And of course you are in an area with hundreds of places to eat, but chocolates, drink, etc. all within a ten minute walk. The best thing of all about the hotel was the staff. The manager always seemed to be there and the staff were amazingly accommodating. They went out of their way to ensure that we had a great stay. One simple example was that my wife mentioned she liked one of the songs on the CD player, but couldn\u2019t remember which one. The manager got all the CDs out and had my wife look through them. When that didn\u2019t work, he gave her the remote so she could scan through all eight CDs to see if she could find the song.

This is without doubt the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in (and I speak from a UK/European perspective not from a US perspective, where I know expectations are even higher). At 6\"2 tall, I could just about stand up in the hotel room itself, but could not stand up straight in the shower - this is no exageration - I literally had to crouch to fit into the bathroom which, by way of a comparison, is around the same size as that found on a Boeing 737 and probably smaller than the bathroom on the Eurostar on the way over the Paris. Ok, I am exagerating here, but only just. As we were only there for 2 nights, we were travelling light with just two small holdalls. This is just as well as in a standard room, there is literally no space to put a decent sized suitcase. The rooom is so narrow that there is approx 5cm of space either side of the bed - and this does not even include any bedside tables of shelving to place a book or a glass of water. The long and short of it is that it is virutally impossible for two grown adults to spend any length of time in the room together unless they are fast asleep. All in all, this didn't spoil our stay but I do feel the size (or lack thereof) of the rooms are a hugely important factor for anyone even considering this hotel. if you are over 6\" tall, then you will feel like a giant anywhere within these four walls. Otherwise this is a charming little hotel which, had it been \u20ac100 a night rather than \u20ac200+ I would heartily recommend as a chic little bolt-hole in Paris. It only succeeds in justifying this price tag because of its excellent location in the middle of St Germain and within walking distance of all major sites.

I then noticed 2 days later at check-out that our postcard was still laying there so I asked for it back so we could handle it ourselves. I kind of expected it to have been mailed already after 2 days. The other thing was a phone call that we made to the transfer company that we were using to the airport. I had assumed that local calls would be free but the next time I checked my email they had sent me an email saying they would be charging us 5+ euros for the call. Nobody had told us that there would be a charge for local calls. When I replied regarding this they then told me that it was to a cell phone (which I don't know how I was supposed to know that I was calling a cell phone nor do I understand what difference that makes in the charge).

So I always have 2 fears when traveling: as a single person will I get a terrible room?and CAN I SMOKE? So MOST Paris (and European) hotels will tell you they are non-smoking only, but nearly all have large opening windows, so it doesn't really matter. Fact is, you can smoke. There's an obscure law relating to this. (Might be more problematic if you are traveling in the winter and need to keep the windows closed. I don't travel then, so can't comment.) Location is perfect, especially for me, whose favorite place in Paris is the Luxembourg Gardens, One block from a metro station and very close to many other things. (It was really fun to see Midnight in Paris at the featured theater before it got to the US!) Lots of restaurants nearby. Though venturing out to La Condonnerie is WELL worth the effort. DO NOT EAT AT IL SUPLICE--though the Editeurs across the street is fine. I wouldn't spring for the 12 euro breakfast--especially since steps away are several cafes serving the same or better at better prices. I was very impressed with the cleaning service--it seemed like most days (I was there for 8 days) by the time I came back from breakfast the room was made up. Amazing. I think I paid about $190 American a night. Paris--and getting there--is getting prohibitively expensive. I am used to going twice a year on a small salary, but I think that is about to change unpleasantly.

This was our first trip to Paris and we decided to stay in a smaller Parisian hotel instead of one of the larger chains. We arrived by train to Paris and took the Metro to the Odeon stop which was only a short walk to the hotel which was on a small but busy street. We arrived at 1130 and our room was ready which we were happy about. We were taken towards the back and up a small staircase to a landing with doors to two rooms. I believe ours was room 31. It was a standard double room as we booked, and was small but well laid out. There was a double bed, desk, and small closet. The large window overlooked a small courtyard and fountain. The bathroom was small, the small outer room had a toilet and sink facing each other, and then beyond was a tiled shower. Water pressure and temperature were excellent and it was very clean. The bed only had a comforter, so we requested an additional bed sheet and it was delivered to our room after we had gone out. All the staff were courteous and greeted you as you returned or left the hotel, and they all spoke English, along with a variety of other languages. The hotel key was a standard key card, and the room had heat and air conditioning. At check-in we were given a code to access the free wireless internet which worked perfectly. We did not have the breakfast at the hotel, we simply grabbed pastries from nearby shops. the location was quite good. Only a couple of blocks to the Metro, as well as to a bus stop which has a line that takes you right to the Eiffel Tower (along with other places). there are little shops and cafes all around, as well as the Jardin du Luxembourg just to the south which was a very peaceful and interesting place to spend the early evening. We walked to Notre Dame and the Louvre from the hotel, each in about 10-15 minutes. Overall it was a comfortable and decent hotel for central Paris, and lived up to our expectations. the room and bathroom were small, but we expected that.

The room and bathroom were sizeable enough to be comfortable. Alot of people have issues with the size of hotel rooms in Paris, but I can assure you that the Odeon is adequate. We did make use of the closet and the hotel was kind enough to provide us with enough hangars so that we could hang our clothes instead of living out of our suitcase. The toiletries were nice. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The concierege was very helpful and even managed to book a table for us at the Grand Colbert where the movie \"Somethings Gotta Give\" was filmed. Let me rephrase, not just a table, but THE table where the movie's scene was shot. It was a highlight of our trip and the Odeon made it possible. They were also very helpful with getting us taxis to restaurants and train stations when needed. The breakfast is good, although the price is a little steep.

Originally, we were in room 15 on the 5th floor which is quite possibly the smallest hotel room I\u2019ve ever been in. I know European hotel rooms are typically smaller, but this was a bit much. It felt like we were staying in someone\u2019s attic, not to mention it reeked of cigarette smoke despite being a non-smoking room. We contacted the front desk to be moved but the hotel was fully-booked that night. However, they offered to give us a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite the following day. Luckily we weren\u2019t in our room too terribly much the first night. But when it was time to go to bed we obviously were, and the bed was lumpy and uncomfortable and the pillows weren\u2019t any better. As promised, the staff moved us to a junior suite the next day. It was room 4 on the 2nd floor and was much more spacious and odor-free. That said, it still left a lot to be desired. The bed was uncomfortable and the lighting was awful. There was also quite a bit of noise from the room next door. A few pluses \u2013 L\u2019Occitane toiletries and free wifi. Our rate included breakfast and it was okay\u2014your basic continental breakfast. They have an \u201chonesty bar\u201d which was handy\u2014take what you want and note it accordingly and they will charge your room. The common areas are really cozy and charming. While I wasn\u2019t overwhelmed with this place, the one thing I can\u2019t speak highly enough of was the staff. They were very accommodating and they truly aim to please. There was one gentleman whose name I don\u2019t recall, but he seemed to be there around the clock and always had a friendly attitude. They were all great in helping with directions and suggestions. They also left a box of chocolates in our room the first night, which was a nice and surprising touch.

We also had an area to the right of the bottom of the bed, with a table and two chairs which was draped with even more fabric. A lovely spot for breakfast in your bathrobes! The man on reception was able to recommend somewhere nearby we could still get something to eat, which was really helpful. The only niggle is that I really feel unsettled in gloomy rooms; when I booked I requested a double rather than a twin (which we got) and a room with plenty of natural light (which we didn't!) There wasn't a window at all in the bedroom area or the bathroom. The only window was in the area where the table & chairs were. It had a heavy curtain & a net curtain, which I just had to open even though it looked out on to an air con unit! I still felt a bit claustrophobic, which was a shame because otherwise the room was lovely. It was only a 2 night stay, and it was a couple of bright days in July ... we're going back to Paris in October and I must admit I couldn't stay here again then because it would just be too gloomy. The layout of the hotel suggests that most rooms don't have great views or are particularly bright. If that doesn't bother you, then I'd absolutely recommend this hotel. My partner loved the room but even he said he wouldn't be keen to stay in the same room again. Also, the maids were cleaning the rooms either side of us from about 8:30am on the Sunday morning; it would have been fine, but they'd left the doors open so they could carry on chatting & laughing and even bashing the hoover against our door ... which did get slightly irritating after an hour or so! It's in a lovely location, a really easy walk from Odeon metro, and loads of bars and restaurants within a very short walk.

We had two rooms on the fourth floor, arranged in a sort of suite, because we were four: my wife and I, and our children, 12 and 13. We were extremely comfortable, in every way. Air conditioning was efficient and unobtrusive. Bathrooms were lovely, uncluttered, and immaculate. We were on the street side but the double-pane windows kept it quiet as a Bentley. The staff -- in particular the three young men who rotate at the reception: Brice, Mathieu and Sebastien -- were attentive, extremely courteous and anxious to be of assistance. Though I speak fluent French, I often heard them speak English to other guests and on the phone, and their English is very good and can make Paris a lot more serviceable for those who do not speak French. One evening I asked Mathieu to make a reservation for us and some friends at a restaurant in the neighborhood -- 7 people in all. To my astonishment, he walked to the restaurant, spoke to the owner, and picked out the perfect table for us. Taxis, theatre tickets, tours, packages, recommendations -- I recommend they be relied upon, and I know they relish the opportunity to serve. I must say, also, that we were fortunate to be introduced, one day, to the owners of the hotel -- an exquisite, charming couple whose presence and conversation were a pleasure.

We arrived at the Odeon fairly early (9am from US) and were told the room was being cleaned. It would be ready in less than hour.

Two days before our departure, I checked the hotel website and the rates had decreased to E169 per night. A fifty euro difference! I told this to the front desk man, who checked with the boss and they would NOT honor the current reduction in rates. This was a big disappointment for me as 100 euros ($140 US) is not insignificant to me. I asked if at least we could upgrade to a \"superior\" room instead of the \"standard\" which we had booked, as the \"superior\" was E214 per night when checked 2 days before arrival. They said indeed they would put us in the superior, but it was, alas, a standard.

Since we discovered that Saint Germain is the area we absolutely love, we've been scouting out various hotels in the area.

The decor has been carefully selected and is really lovely. The staff could not have been more friendly and attentive, and this is definitely a hotel we will be returning to. We are used to Parisian hotel rooms being fairly small, and therefore booked two Superiore rooms, ours was 14, on the top floor and set into the eaves. This is a really lovely and very quiet room with gorgeous soft furnishing, etc. My only critism is that the bathroom, being set into the eaves is quite small - if you're very tall (which my husband and I aren't) this might be a problem. Room 11 which our friends had was larger and more suitable to tall people (which our friends are!!!). That said, its by no means pokey for a Parisian room, and we had no complaints at all. There's some fabulous eateries and shopping in very short walking distance - I'd highly recommend the Boucherie Rouliere, for the most amazing Cote de Boef I've had in a long time!

On our first morning we went out for breakfast to Paul's pattiserie and cafe but on the second we paid for the breakfast at the hotel. We were not disappointed. We probably paid around the same as the previous day, but this was a far mor generous and leisurely help- yourself continental breakfast. Again, there is always a member of staff to hand should you need anything else, more coffee etc and lots of international newspapers and magazines if you really want to take your time before you hit the sites once again.
