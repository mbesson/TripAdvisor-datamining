Although we asked for a room with a view to the sea, we didn't get one when we checked in. But, the staff was very kind and they made their the best to find us one for the next two nights. Having breakfast looking at the Roman seaside under a warm July sunshine was simply priceless... The hotel is clean and not far from the station of this local train which takes to Rome downtown in around 30 minutes. I would totally recommend this place!", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lee's Summit, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cEh\u201d", "Author": "Stkrebs", "ReviewID": "UR5299704", "Content": "Hotel La Riva is an O.K. hotel if you do not have other choices. The first room they gace us reeked of cigarette smoke and the manager on duty was a bit defensive about saying that they were non required to have non-smoking rooms. The second room they gave us did not reek of smoke. The rooms are tiny, even compared to the other rooms we stayed at during our trip to Italy. In addition, it appears that there were pigeons nesting directly above our ceiling; at first the noise was entertaining, it then became irritating. Lastly, each of the hotels we stayed in included breakfast, Hotel La Riva had the fewest breakfast options and the breakfast items lacked freshness.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "La Riva", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d571580-Reviews-La_Riva-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$99 - $161*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Piazzale Magellano 22</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Lido di Ostia</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">122</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "571580", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9f/11/9f11eab91454111132e1b178a3cd8d4c1large.jpg"}}
