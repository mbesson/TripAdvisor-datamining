Just two blocks from the Charles de Gualle Etoile metro station and easy walking distance to Arc de Triomphe, Champs-Elysees and the Eiffel Tower, we had no problem getting to some of the major Paris sights from Hidden.

We arrived at Charles de Gaulle around 6 PM. We took the AF shuttle bus to the the city centre which took about an hour. The final stop is near the Arc de Triomphe. With 2 big travel cases and 2 handbags it's a long walk to this hotel. I think 15 minutes minimum. Even without the travel cases it's in my opinion not near the Arc the Triomphe. I really can't understand the hype about this hotel. Check in went smooth. The elevator is very small. When we came into our room it had a musty odour. The room was very small, too small. Fortunately for us we were there just to sleep. The coco mat bed was to hard. The bedding wasn't comfortable, it felt like soft sandpaper. The furniture was not painted to give one the so called back to basic nature feeling. We received complimentary champagne (half bottle Taitinger), some candies and a bottle of Vittel water. The bathroom was in fact in the room. They just put a shower cabin in the corner of the room, behind a wall. There was a rain shower though with a good pressure. The water leaked out of the douche cabin on the floor in front of the sink. The WC was in the smallest WC room I've ever seen...even smaller than the one of Sofitel Dubai. The tiny bar soap, the liquid soap and the body lotion were of their own brand, but a decent quality. We ordered some softdrinks via room service and the service was rapidly. We did not tried their breakfast. At the end I had the feeling like this hotel is literally basic (with nature in mind and organic food) with a price that can't justify the size and quality of the room. Next time I will not stay at this hotel anymore and I will look for a hotel that's closer to the Champs and that gives the quality that I pay for.

When entering the hotel you find your self in a wooden relaxing ambience. The welcome was really warm and we were lucky to be upgraded to a room with a terrace! Very nice gesture that we appreciated! The rooms are really small. Even smaller from the regular small room that you expect to find in Paris; however the decoration, the bed and the linens were EXCELLENT! They have choosen to furnish the whole place with environmental friendly furniture ( COCO - Mat). The quality of sleep that you have compensates you for staying at 25m2! The breakfast is rich of healthy food with the highlight to be to preparing in front of you Smoothies with fresh food of your choice! Fresh bakery, local fromagerie and charcuterie gives you energy to go and experience Paris. In terms of location, it is very convenient: just 3 minutes walking from Arc de Triopmhe and Champs Elysee.

The reconstruction on the building next to the Hidden made it impossible to sleep morning or day. When I made my reservation I requested a quiet room. No one thought to contact guests to inform them that work was being done next door and that this may cause problems, or to put a notice on the hotels website... This would have prevented me a great deal of stress qnd inconvenience. Wednesay 7 Septembre I spent a great deal of time trying to sort this problem out, and as the manager had left for the day nothing was done. I requested that a message be left for him to inform him that I was not satisfied and that I would like to speak with him the following morning. After being woken up at 8heures du matin by the constant drilling and banging I dressed and went to the lobby and requested to speak with the manager; I was told he was on the phone and would be with me in five minutes. I sat down and waited for over TWENTY MINUTES for him, all the while I could hear him laughing on the telephone on what I can only assume was a personal call. When I did speak to him I found him rude and obnoxious and I was given the distinct impression that he could give a damn about me or the problem I was having. He even yelled at me, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO!! Eventually it was agreed I should move hotels. I provided my email address for him to correspond with me as I had a business luncheon to attend. Several of his emails were less than gracious and some were downright rude in demanding that I be back at the hotel and packed before 3heures apris midi. Of course this was impossible as my luncheon did not begin until 13:00. Perhaps if I had not been kept waiting so long to speak with him I could have packed prior to lunch and left my bad downstairs... Please let me make perfectly clear, that as someone who visitis Paris many times a year and who travels frequently for business that I have never had such a miserable experience with a hotel in my entire life. I am shocked and appalled by the experience I have had with the Hidden Hotel, and understand that what I have written is not even half of the nightmare that I encountered! As for the noise I speak of, imagine being in a room with several industrial drills going at full throttle and you will have an idea of what I speak of. In all my years of travel, I have never had to move hotels mid stay, then again I have never experienced such a disaster as I did this time in Paris. I can honestly say that the level of contempt and ineptitdue that I experienced has made this a completely memorable stay, yet for all of the wrong reasons. Throughout the entire ordeal not once did anyone apologise to me, though everyone acknowledged that the noise was horrific. I am certain that Mr Kelly the manager and the Hidden Hotel have provided others with a pleasurable experience, but on every conceivable level they failed miserably with me. I am not someone who looks to complain, I understand that any establishment can have an off day, it is how the faults are dealt with that matter, this is when the true essence of an establishment is revealed; unfortunately the Hidden don't seem to care enough about their brand or their customers than to be arrogant, contemptuous and snide. I only wish that the Hidden Hotel had stayed that way for me.

The room was very small, but it was set up really nice and the bed was definitely comfortable. This city is another one where i have to ask \"am i really going to be spending that much time in the hotel?\" When the answer is no, then who cares! They have a nice bar for drinks and an impressive breakfast spread, although we didn't sit to eat. If i go back to Paris, i will definitely consider coming back here. Some of the more interesting bakeries and eateries were in this district than what we walked into around the more popular areas.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montpellier", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel\u201d", "Author": "worldhereicome34", "ReviewID": "UR107628405", "Content": "This is a really nice hotel for people travelling to Paris.

Service The staff spoke excellent English, so we were able to take a breather from hearing my appalling French for a bi, and it was great for getting directions on places to go and tips on the area. The staff were also incredibly nice, and that's saying a lot for staff in Paris, most are slightly off hand-ish and almost cold, (not in a bad way, it just seems that's the norm), but these guys were just lovely, no other way to describe them. Coffee: Order it in bed if you get a chance, the coffee was really really good, we found a lot of the cafes around served less-than-great coffee (I know, how is that possible, it's Paris isn't it?!) but these guys nailed it. The room: The room was awesome, very appealing to anyone interested in the minimalist look, and had a great tv with English speaking channels, a beautiful bathroom, but the problem lay with the bed. For all the beds at the hidden hotel, they use twin beds pushed together to form a queen, not unusual for a hotel, but in this case it really fails. My husband and I rolled together and joked in the morning about how we spent the night pull ourselves out of the abyss in the mattress, trying to get air. We were pretty high on life while we were there, so it didn't matter much, but if you were trying to get a good nights' sleep, say on business, or had a bad back, you would have a horrible time. Location: Great location, close to the Arc de Triumph and shopping, and about 20 minutes from de Louvre. The trick is writing down the route you take when you leave, because their alleyway is so tiny, it's not on most maps, making for a difficult time on your way back to the hotel.

This was my 3rd stay at Hidden , and it is truly a small gem, as much as I hate to write this, just like when a good, relatively unknown restaurant you like gets good reviews, then it becomes harder to get a table... Elsa and her staff make you feel most welcome, in an unpretentious, but very professional way. The beds here are amazing. The rooms are mostly tiny, but very well laid out and extremely functional. On my first visit I even had an outdoor terrace. The \"all natural\" approach to the use of materials makes this a comfortable property for allergy-prone people, like me. I personally like the 17e, and proximity to \u00c9toile, so that works nicely for me, and wether your are taking the Car Air France into town, or taxi, the Hidden is easily accessible. My only reservation is the cleanliness of the all-natural slate tiled showers. On my last visit, there was soap residue, and a slightly musty looking shower stall. I am assuming that eco-friendly cleaning products are used, and maybe harder to fully clean the tiles. That can (and I am sure will be) fixed. The 15 euro breakfast is not cheap, but still a good value with a good enough selection.

The furniture, colour schemes and textures had the intended effect of creating a serene and cooling ambience on a hot Paris day - I suspect on a cold day it would give the opposite and desired effect. The hotel was abound by wood, leather and raw fabric setting it apart from most other hotels. The rooms we stayed in were particularly impressive - enough room for two and two medium luggage, a comfy 'coco' bed (see their website for full details), a lovely slate shower and a large flat screen TV. Only the separate toilet was a bit small for the long-limbed and wide-bottomed clientele, but we really didn't care as the intention was to spend as little time in there as possible!

Everyone, including the cleaner, looked as though they wanted to be there and were conscious to make you feel comfortable.

It is small - but most hotel rooms are small in Paris. This hotel was just opened a year ago - and all is new. I woke the second morning exclaiming to my wife how comfortable the bed was. She said she read it was some sort of coconut matting or something. All I know is it was the most comfortable I have slept in (we have the dense foam stuff at home. We have a king at home - was also worried about not enough room to flop around - but no problem. The air conditioning worked great and not too loud. HD TV in room (uh - in French). But who watches TV when in Paris??? Ok - the shower was probably worth the price of admission. Hand held and also rain shower overhead. Plenty of water pressure and Hot water. A place to sit - and plenty of room for two people... Ok - the hotel being green - they had some sort of organic small bar soap. Uh - bring you own deodorant (dial or Irish spring) for by 2PM each day - uh, I was aware I did not smell that good (no a problem at home. The toilet foes not have room to read the newspaper (to give you an idea of its size) - but, ..., enjoyed to extra space they left in the shower. There is continental breakfast each morning from 8 to 11. Was not until day three that we realized that we being charged 15 Euro per person for the experience (was not included in our expedia package). But - upon reflection, my wife and both agreed we could not do better somewhere else. Coffee, FRESH fruits, avocados, nuts, cheese, yogurt, bread, fruit smoothies, dried fruit, cereals, FRESH squeezed juices, assortment of thin sliced meat. We did not need to eat again until late in the day. The ladies working the small breakfast area were very nice and helpful. That said (I am typing this on my blackberry on the flight back - so no particular order) EVERY employee of the hotel was VERY nice. Read THAT in all the other hotel reviews. Oh - and wireless internet at no charge - worked great in our room. Location was excellent - near metro. Oh - by the way - my wife dragged me to the moulon rouge show. It is expensive - so I was a bit reluctant to go see a burlesque show (funny how it was the women pushing to go). Some of our friends had gone a couple weeks earlier - so - no way out. Ask the hotel to reserve the 7pm dinner followed by show at 9. If hotel makes reservations - you get better seating. The hotel charged 16 euro to reserve for us - bit the actual price was reduced by about that amount by the rouge. You do not need to rush to get there at 7 as you have assigned seats - not sure how it was done. We had a table next to the stage - wow. Short version is it must not be missed - I thought it was over a couple times. The show was fantastic. And of course my 50 something year old (and beautiful of course) wife loved it - \"very tastefully done\". The Sacre Couer church on top of the hill was cool. BUT - behind it (on its level) to the left you will find a large square FILLED w artist. We saw no artist anywhere else in town. Also - many wandering around doing portraits. You have to see it.

I would like to say a great THANKYOU to the night receptionist man , i didnt get his name but originally from sweden i think , but was always happy to chat from 8pm and even when we got back late , also the barman who was there later on Please contact me if you have any questions about the hotel.. we will defantly be going back to this hotel!!!!!! thanks to all the team at the Hidden Hotel Dave and Terri", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cExcelent service and location\u201d", "Author": "Hilbis", "ReviewID": "UR67705072", "Content": "Very friendly and professional staff, the location is unbeatable, few blocks from Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees and still quiet and peaceful.

The lobby was also comfortable and welcoming, and played a great selection of music; and 3) the staff \u2013 warm, courteous, helpful, and they really made an effort to take care of their guests.

It is comfortably hidden in one of the small street, yet it is so near to Arc de Triomphe. So in terms of location I couldn't ask for more. I booked the hotel when there was a promotional rate going on, I got a good deal. So, I feel the rate that they offered for a hotel in Paris was very reasonable and definitely a \"get\"! The room was quite small for a Paris standard, so it feels a little bit cramped, but it was nicely decorated. It has a natural touch with fibery straw feeling, the concept of the hotel is to bring you back to the nature, which I feel they did a good job. Also, the bed was very comfortable for my bad back. I didn't eat any meal in the hotel, so I can't comment on that one. Check in and check out process was also very efficient, I had an early flight in the morning of checking out, so the nite before I asked the receptionist to book me a cab in the morning, which was done so without fail. So, I was pretty satisfied with their service. The only thing that I need to point out was, when we reached the hotel to check in, there was nobody helping us to carry our bags to the lobby, so we had to carry our own bags to the lobby and room....so that was a minus point from my point of view. Although my review in general sounds good, but I will still give this hotel a rate of 3 out of 5.The reason is, personally I feel they are good for Paris standard, but compare to hotels in Asia, they are far behind, and being a traveller around Asia a lot, I prefer to compare hotels to hotels rather than relatively to the place per se.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cFOUND: Best hotel in Paris.\u201d", "Author": "twoboosDublin", "ReviewID": "UR47662116", "Content": "The Hidden Hotel is an experience!

The staff were really friendly and happy to help with any request that I had, nothing seemed too much trouble. I stayed in an intuition room (not the largest but in proportion and it's Paris so not many rooms are particularly big) which I think was the base room, but totally ideal for someone travelling on their own with everything you would need. I like to look out for the smaller boutique styled places and Hidden ticked the boxes. Calming lavender on the super comfy coco mat bed, surrounded in muslin and a great shower housed in slate, lovely!
