The hotel is located about 10min from the main street Damrak and 15min from the central station, if you take the tram. Tram 9 and 14 stop right around the corner. The room was, in my case, a nice single room with own balcony. It was small but enough when you are out all day anyway. Good bathroom. My room was no. 10 - the NEW no. 10. The old no. 10 (now no. 14 I think) is now the budget single and only has a window in the ceiling... My room was on the 3rd floor and not handicap friendly because of the stairs. Breakfast (included) was really good. Nice dining room and good selection of food. It was a bit pricey, but as a student, what isn't?

Ten or fifteen minutes will take you to the very centre of town. Its reasonably well serviced by public transport, both train & tram and opposite a small but picturesque park. As such, it is in a decent location, but there are hotels that are more central or more close to the most popular attractions, depending on what you are hoping to do while you are in Amsterdam. Being a bit further out does have its advantages though, with quieter evenings and cheaper restaurants. We stayed for two nights at 110 euros per night, which was more than we'd like to pay, but we were having difficulties finding cheaper ensuite accomodation in a reasonably central location on the weekend (Amsterdam is a tourist town, often with more expensive accomodation on the weekends). Its an old hotel, but they've refurbished and maintained the places that matter the most - the beautiful breakfast area and the rooms themselves. Our room (7) was up two sets of stairs, the first being quite reasonable, the second being quite steep as is common in Amsterdam. This is particularly difficult if you have bags and the person who checked us in didn't offer any help. Still, it was good exercise! The room was a decent size with high ceilings, though it was far longer than it was wide. The bathroom was recently refurbished with a great shower. Although we were notified in advance, we don't like the way many Amsterdam hotels (including this one) push two single beds together and sell the room as a double. The room was both well lit and well heated. There were stains on the two chairs facing the small television, which was a bit disconcerting, but that didn't bother us too much. The desk provided is too small for any work, should you be in Amsterdam for work, but its sufficient for keys, wallet, passport, cameras and so on. The room comes with a mini-fridge which is helpful to store drinks and what not, especially since the supermarket is so close by. Some of the corridors and hallways were a bit tired with peeling wallpaper but this doesn't matter as you're not in a hotel like this to admire the surroundings (though as I mentioned before, the breakfast area is beautiful). The friendliness of staff depended on who you were dealing with, as is the case with most small hotels, but we usually found hotel staff helpful and friendly. The staff pointed us out to a nearby set of restaurants which, being a bit further out of the city, were much better value than eating in the centre of town. To get to these restaurants, leave the hotel and immediately turn left, at the intersection turn left again, and then at the next intersection you should see the restaurants to the right on both sides of the street. We had an Indonesian banquet that was supposedly for one person (with around 20 dishes!) for less than 20 euros which was more than enough for the two of us. The hotel breakfast (included) was great as long as you didn't want anything hot to eat - there were different varieties of cheese, cold cuts, boiled eggs, different types of bread, crispbread, pate, jam (and other bread spreads), chocolate sprinkles, cereal, yoghurt, fruit, fresh orange juice, tea bags of many kinds (from cactus to raspberry to your more standard offerings), coffee and more. Breakfast was supposedly until 10am, but they didn't rush us away while we kept eating past then, which was great. A toaster wouldn't go astray, but we were still impressed by the breakfast nevertheless. They also provided a number of useful free things and services that are sometimes the realm of more expensive hotels - a bookcase with books to read (including travel books), free Amsterdam postcards, free Hotel Parklane pens and a free Hotel Parklane alarm clock. It was rated as a 2 star hotel, but I've been to 3 star hotels that were significantly worse. Overall, we had a great time at the Hotel Parklane and our most significant reservation is that if we'd booked earlier, we would perhaps have been able to find a comparable place at 10-20 euros a night cheaper.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester.", "Title": "\u201cThree cheers for the Hotel Parklane!\u201d", "Author": "TerryManchester", "ReviewID": "UR11026610", "Content": "Excellently located, friendly, family-run hotel that offers real value for money.

Good night's sleep, anyone? A good, standard breakfast is served in a lovely old drawing-room type area. So much better than the \"canteen\" feel of other places I have stayed at. All in all - and I mean this as a compliment - it's not really like staying at a hotel - more like guesting with a family.

It's not located at the busy Damrak/Central Station area, so it gives you a local blend living environment. From the hotel, it's just walking distance to get to the Metro Station-Waterlooplien Stop or Tram 9 that goes to Central Station. If one wants to exercise their legs, then a walk about 30-50 minutes will take them to Central Station. Some places can be done via walking....Jews Historical Museum, Rembrandt's House, Artis Zoo, a Waterlooplein Flea Market are within walking distance.

In light of this quandry, my husband and I consider ourselves fortunate to have discovered Hotel Parklane. The building is situated on a lovely street in the Plantage neighborhood \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a very green and mostly residential area. The Wertheim Park is also just opposite the property, and we had a nice view of it from our window. Some other interesting sights are in the neighborhood: the Jewish Historical Museum, Verzetsmuseum (highlighting the Dutch resistence to German occupation during WWII), and the Hortus Botanicus. We stayed seven nights in a double room (#5) containing two twin beds, a small desk, a TV, a wardrobe, and a couple of chairs. Though the place was not particularly spacious, I was expecting it to be much smaller, as many lodgings in the city are. The bathroom is very modern and clean; the shower boasts tremendous water pressure and all the fixtures appeared to be new. The room also had a mini-fridge which, for me, was worth its weight in gold -- perfect for chilling bottles of water and cheeses to enjoy after an outing. Also, for those that are interested, smoking (both kinds) is permitted in the rooms, so long as you take care to blow out the window and are considerate of other guests. The staff was at all times pleasant and competent. The breakfast buffet (served from 8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 am) consisted of typical Dutch elements \u00e2\u20ac\u201c muesli, yogurt, slices of bread, cold cuts, cheese, jam, boiled eggs, and the like. Nothing extravagant, but plenty of everything. The dining room is also a nice area, with several small tables near large, light-filled windows. We had daily housekeeping service and always found a fresh supply of towels when we returned in the evenings. In light of it all, I have only two criticisms. The first relates to the linens; the towels are thin and rather rough, as are the sheets. The pillows have also seen better days, being quite flat and lumpy. Secondly, the carpeting is clearly not new and could stand to be replaced. Well, one can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have everything.
