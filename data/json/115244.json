It's close to good restaurants (eg. Lucy's, Rock N Sake, Cochon, Emeril's) and museums (eg. WWII Museum, Children's Museum, Civil War Museum). All within walking distance. The lobby and adjacent dining area are spacious with an interesting Mardi Gras mural on the main wall. I enjoyed staring at that thing and finding the peculiar little details. They also have a restaurant in the hotel but I did not dine there. The staff were all very friendly, courteous, and helpful, especially the bellman and the parking valets. The room was what you would expect from an Embassy Suites, although a tad bit smaller, but still very comfortable (comfy bed, crisp sheets, warm comforter). Everything was clean and well-maintained with only one minor exception: the shower did not produce hot water, only lukewarm water. The Manager's Reception was very popular with all the guests, serving cocktails, beer, and wine all for free! The breakfast was also well-stocked and they even provided a cook-to-order service, also for free (just like any other Embassy Suites). All in all, I give this hotel high marks for location, beautiful lobby area, comfortable rooms/bedding, breakfast, and a jubilant Manager's Reception. The only low marks: $30 for parking per night (all hotels in the city will charge this) and a lukewarm shower.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cThis is our New Orleans home away from home!\u201d", "Author": "Dawn A", "ReviewID": "UR138932591", "Content": "Our son is a senior at Tulane University and we have been staying at this Embassy Suites ever since we started looking at colleges when he was a sophomore in high school.

The valet parking is worth the price; our car is safe & secure and the attendants know you by name (and remember it!) from the first time you meet them.

The main differences were that there was no self parking available. You had to use the hotels parking lot and you had to pay $30 a night to park there. Although you could park on the street there were meters and as we were new in town we did not want to get a ticket, we asked the dfront desk staff and none of them seemed to know how the meters worked. Several people in my famiky had handixcapped placards and they did not know if there was handicapped parking at the meters nor was there any discount for parking in the lot. To me, this seemed like something the front desk staff should know, but perhaps I was expected too much. You were given tickets when you checked in and you had to bring those rickets down to breakfast each morning. Wthout them you could not eat as they were collected by a very pleasant lady each morning. Breakfast was the usual fare, but the gentleman cook cooked grits better than the lady cook and he seemed more at ease in the kitchen than she did. This Embassy Suites only exceeded the others in which I have stayed because of the staff. Brandon and Ricky seemed to truly liked their jobs and if they did not they were really good at faking it. They were knowledgeable, personable, friendly and welcoming. I felt as if they were old family friends. They made the trip enjoyable with their suggestions and knowledge. The front desk staff was friendly eough but not overly so. There were two people at the concierge desk, a man and a woman. I dealt with both of them. DeMarcus (I beleive was his name) was very firendly when were were discussing the rour of the city. The lady--not so much. She managed to make me feel as if I was bothering her or that she had something better to do than answer my questions. We did eat in the restaurant in the hotel and the food was good, but I did not know how to take our server Charles, he rolled his eyes at our questions, had a smart answer to some of our queastions and actesd like we were disturbing him, but by the end of the meal it was okay. I guess he had not encountered anyone like us in his restaurant. I will admit, we can be a handfull but I'm not sure that his behavior was okay until we had at least established some kind of relationship. It was a bit off putting at first, but all well that ends well. As I said it all turned out fine and our meal came out as we requested. Our room was clean and while I did not pull out the couch bed (too lazy) I did sleep on the couch, it was comfortable enough. The beds, according to my family were xomfortable. There was a balcony that was attached to the room and that was nice. There was no real view to speak of.The only real complaint that I have about the room is that the curtain steing was broken and so I was unable to raise the curtain, I had to fix iy so that the light could come into the room, but not the way it was intended. The curtain had not been raised as a long time probably because the string was broken because a dust storm hit me when I tried to raise the curtain.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Franklin, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNIce decor and good breakfast..\u201d", "Author": "mammothsales24", "ReviewID": "UR138168394", "Content": "The Embassy is in a great location because its near casino and the river walk..

Unfortunately, due to staying out until 5am every morning during our trip, we were unable to partake in the made to order omelettes and juice bar. However, kudos to ES for even offering. The other amenity that ultimately led to our hotel decision-making was the Manager's Reception. Unless you're staying in an all-inclusive resort, don't plan on getting free booze at your hotel. BUT the ES is the exception to the rule and if you're looking for a cheap way to start the night off before hitting up Bourbon St, take advantage of this added benefit. The alcohol menu included Miller Light, Coors Light, well drinks and a few bartender specials that they were very secretive to disclose...but very tasty. I'd suggest sticking to the beer. They also provided free chips/salsa and trail mix to keep the gullet full. Now, I must say the rooms were average. Ours included two queen beds and a fold out couch which was much more comfortable sleeping on as an actual couch than the fold out. My friend said he felt the coils in his back each time he moved, which as you can imagine, was super uncomfortable. This came after a 15 hour drinking binge so I can only imagine how a child, or sober person would feel. Our patio didnt have a great view but it was nice to be able to wake up and have a smoke outside, if that's your sort of thing. I did like the layout of the room, with the living area being separate from the beds. We were able to comfortably fit four guys for three days. The bathroom and shower were mostly clean and if you could get used to the NOLA bugs sneaking into the room, it wasnt too bad. Again, the main reason we chose this hotel was because of the free booze and breakfast! The location was actually perfect for us. We chose not to stay in the French Quarter because of price but I think this was a good choice considering almost everything was within walking distance, if walking 10-15 minutes is ok with you. The open drinking laws gave us something to do while making our treks around town! The Riverwalk was basically across the street, Canal and Bourbon are close and Harrah's Casino was nearby. We spent alot of time there, and lost, but had a good time regardless. I would suggest cabbing to the French Market or SuperDome, though. There was also a really good pizza joint down the street called \"Pie\", which was a pleasant surprise when stumbling back to the hotel. They're open really late and cheap eats! The staff was nice and had some good food/restaurant recommendations. Just ask anyone there for help and they'll kindly assist. Check in/out was a quick process and no problems in this category. Overall, I'd consider this a \"Very Good\" place to stay. We found a good deal on Priceline about a month before our trip. If this is your first time to New Orleans, as it was mine, you will be pleasantly surprised. It's not really my idea of a \"family\" trip but if you're going to party and hang out with friends, you'll get your fair share in this town! Think of Vegas without the overpriced drinks, cover charges and douchy nightclubs. Instead, you'll find 3 for 1 drinks, hand grenades, beads and a party on every corner.

I've always enjoyed the amenities of Embassy Suites and was looking forward to staying at one. Check-in was speedy aside from the long line of other volunteers trying to do the same. My room was on the 13th floor all the way at the end of the hall. At least, I thought it would be a hall. I ended up having to go outdoors into an exterior corridor, much safer than a motel as it was on the 13th floor but still, back out into the soup of humidity (and pouring rain later in the week). The suite was nice. The building itself seems to be older evidenced by some cracks here in there on walls and ceilings. The refrigerator was turned a bit too cold as some of my leftovers from breakfast froze during the day. The thermostat was set at 60 when I walked in... much too cold. I turned it up to 70 and enjoyed a much more comfortable stay. The balcony is not much of a balcony as it is a place to just step outside and view the highway, about a half mile away. All in all, the room met my expectations. Because of my volunteer work I did not have the opportunity to partake in the daily happy hour, but I did enjoy a perfect free breakfast each morning. This hotel had one of the best breakfast spreads I have ever seen. There were varieties in cereals, yogurts, fruits, breads and pastries. Plenty of juices, milk and soda (if that is what you drink at breakfast). They rotate three main hot dishes (pancakes, french toast, and buscuits/gravy). I always made my way to the omelet station. Chef Robert was very personable each day and enjoyed his work. He even knew my order as the week went on, a superb job. I visited the business center a few times to check-in at home. The internet was slow and it seemed that whenever there was more than one person in the room, the connection would freeze. Oh well, I didn't need to spend time online, but it was nice to do every once in awhile. Business travelers should be warned, however. Check-out was as easy as the check-in and I was on my way to the airport at the end of the week. An avid cruiser myself, this would be a great hotel for those heading to the cruise port.

While we were gone, someone used a guest key, made by an employee at the hotel, to enter our room and steal 2 e-readers, a mac book, a hp laptop, a digital camera, and jewelry. The jewelry was my mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and included her grandmother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s engagement ring! Irreplaceable items, to say the least. We immediately reported this to the staff who appeared uncaring and basically dismissed us. We contacted the police and I also contacted the Hilton Corporate office. The New Orleans P.D. was honest and understanding. They followed up with us the next day. At this same hotel on this same day, another multifamily room that was staying a few floors up, had electronics stolen from their room also. Both rooms were located close to stairways. We were told that this type of thing rarely happens before we talked to the other family that had items stolen. We by chance found this other family in passing. When our items were stolen, the manager at the hotel that night was very unkind and uncaring. He dismissed us and refused, at first, to contact anyone higher than him in management. We suggested the police be called so that we could report the stolen goods. This was not recommended by the hotel security or administration but we insisted and eventually contacted them ourselves. Hotel security did not follow proper procedure when our items were reported stolen. We found out the next day that they were supposed to run a key reader to determine the time of entries into our rooms immediately. This was not completed until the next day! When this was ran by the head of security, it documented that there were 2 entries into our room during times we were across town and had receipts to prove our whereabouts. Although we had met with the General Manager and Security Director the next morning with the other family and had some hope that action would be taken, it appears the Embassy Suites Company and Hilton let this matter fall between the cracks and do not want to take any responsibility. We received a letter a month later stating that they were not claiming fault in the matter because we did not utilize the safe or leave our valuables with hotel staff. When I emailed them back and explained that there was not a safe and I would not feel safe leaving the items with the front desk clerk that gave a complete stranger a key to our room, the security team that allowed our room to be broken into, or the office manager who was uncaring and blaming. The response we received was that Hilton was further looking into the manner. It is now 5 months later and Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Embassy Suites has not claimed any responsibility in this manner.

The location in New Orleans is good, 3 blocks from the Convention Center, Riverwalk and Canal Street. It is a bit of a walk to Bourbon Street and a long walk to Cafe Du monde. There are two arrival areas, on on Julia Street and one around the corner on Peters St. If you want to valet or self park use the entrance on Peters St. If you arrive by cab they will drop you off at the Julia St. entrance. We arrived by car and parked at the Julia St. entrance, no one came out to greet us. We went inside and finally got acknowledged and then someone helped us, Broderick is his name, a good guy who did a good job. The check in was fine however the young lady who helped us is a trainee. We asked her if they had laundry facilities at the hotel, she told us no and that we would need to send our stuff out. When we inquired later about dropping off our laundry the gentleman who we talked to told us about the guest laundry on the 7th floor, it saved us a fortune, it was free except for the soap. The rooms were small for embassy suites. The hall way between the sitting area and bedroom was quite small as was the bathroom, one of the few that have only one sink. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The Managers reception was normal with the exception that the lines where very long and the serving area was small. Of course the snacks were standard fare now a days, chips and salsa, pretzels. Used to be that you would get vegetables and chips and some other nice items other than the above. The pool area was very small, right at street level so you could here all of the cars going by. The Embassy Suites Convention Center is a good hotel, service was good with the exceptions I have already stated. The one problem we had a check out was we needed help with our bags, we called and were told they would be right up. It took 2 phone calls and 20 minutes to get help. Staffing, funny, I have said that in a number of my reviews, was the issue. They did have 3 people on duty but only one of them were making bag runs. The hotel was very full and you would think they would staff to handle the crowd, Nope!! This is not just a problem with this property but it did affect us. The young man who helped us was not a very happy young man at first. Once we started talking to him he cheered up. He was very happy when we told him that we needed a cab. He had left his whistle at home and was not happy about yelling. However, my wife can whistle, he was very impressed with this and we actually got a smile out of him.

We were attended to quickly, and I suppose since I am the person with higher priority I was given a room and the other two in my party had to wait. That is too be expected in convention time, and they were polite and organized about it. What I did not like was that one of my people was put in a different type of room, a non suite (which I did not know Embassy Suites had) and the rate was the same. The clerk knew this was a bad deal and could not look us in the eyes, mumbled she was sorry and dismissed us. When i got to my room I found either it was a smoking room or someone smoked there, and since the hotel was full, that was that. I have significant alergies to smoke so that is an issue, I had made our reservations 5 months ahead of time just to make sure that we got non-smoking rooms. Dining Room: We did have a few meals in the restaurant. Food was good, and the service very polite, but painfully slow. Manager's Cocktail party. A little above average in terms of the snacks etc. It is a large area for the event so there is plenty of comfortable seating. Definately a high point :-) Breakfast The buffet line was organized and moved well. Typical Embassy Suites breakfast, which is a selling point for the restaurant. Gym This is a little gem in the hotel with enough room and machines to accomodate the crowd. Very well done and maintained, another high point.

I asked why I didn't get a call, and the gentleman behind the desk didn't have an answer. He did apologize though. We asked for a room in the Loft, since I had seen the reviews saying these rooms were nicer, but it was sold out. The room we had though was very nice. It did not open up to the outside as other reviews have stated, and it was clean. There were some stains on the carpet near the TV, and our sheets and pillows appeared to have some ink stains.

Shampoo and conditioner were in minute quanities in bottles with lids guarenteed to break your fingernails (used my teeth to open each morning).

As an Hhonor Gold member I was surprisingly disappointed at this hotel. The staff was great but the property is long overdue for a complete renovation. It's important for travelers to know there are two buildings, the main hotel, and The Lofts (located in the a seperate building next door)As an \"upgrade\" I assigned to room 1504 in the main building and was told I'd have to go \"outside\" to get to the room. Once I reached the 15th floor I felt my heart sank as I walked through a door to the outside. It was like being at an old highway roadside motel, the outside looked and smelled like it. Everything about the room was tattered, moldy, and dark. It took TWO MINUTES for me to realize the door to the balcony (which could be accessed by anyone in the room next door) did not lock. SAFETY ISSUE!!! I went downstairs, advised the staff of the problem and ......get this.... was reassigned a room on the top floor of The Lofts. The lady at the front desk was puzzled as to why I wasn't initially assigned to that building as an Hhonors Gold Member. My concern is that ALL guests should be entitled to a clean, functional room regardless of whether or not they are an Hhonors member. No one should have to venture outside on a worn balcony to a tattered, moldy, and unsecured room. The dampness, and the mold/mildewy smell indicates a much deeper problem with ventilation or perhaps not all rooms were redone after Katrina...who knows. While it's admirable the Lofts are mostly reserved for it's most discerning guests, I feel the Corporation is not meeitng the minimum requirements owed to any of it's guests, that being health, safety, and security. The Lofts were wonderful. The room was clean, newly renovated, quiet, whose decor was modern contemporary. The 2-room suite was the typical Embassy Suites we're all accustomed to staying. The air in the room was crisp and fresh, complete with all the amenities. One luxury was having wall switches that operated most of the lamps instead of having to fumble through the room to find a lamp. Housekeeping did a great job every day. The hotel should also renovate the furniture in it's restarant especially it's breakfast area. I also had the opportunity to try room service and the room service was prompt and courteous.

It was also a birthday trip for our 25 year old son - the convention was the New Orleans Comic Con. From the second we arrived, it was smooth as silk. The lady up front (don't know her name but she greeted us very nicely) was efficient and a very welcome sight after the long drive from Houston. The gentleman who valet parked the car was right there waiting for us. Our room was on the 2nd floor and overlooked the very unique courtyard (where breakfast was served). The room was very clean and comfortable. The pillows could have had a little more to them - they were too square - but otherwise, the bed was a dream and the bathroom was a nice size with fluffy towels and no mold or dirt...very clean. Breakfast was a typical Embassy Suites fare but they had grits which you don't always see and the bacon was so crisp I probably had more than I should have. The walk to the convention center was only two short blocks but the convention center was about 6 blocks long so there was a walk once we arrived there. We went into the French Quarter and Harrahs (where I proceeded to win $41 on a $5 bill) and the walk was about 1 mile into the very center. It seemed much shorter than that and there was a lot to see along the way. I was worried because an earlier reviewer had mentioned that she thought this was a crime-ridden area - it certainly did NOT seem to be to me. There were quite a few eateries (Emile's and Mulate's) right near the hotel and some night spots and we walked back from the quarter (after beignets at Cafe Du Monde) and we never felt anything but safe the whole walk back. There were people everywhere. Even though there were night spots and people walking about, the room was pretty quiet. AND the best part was that it had a really nice little balcony as well. I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there on my next trip to the Big Easy. If I had to find one negative it was the $30 a night for parking but that's pretty much all over New Orleans - hardly a way around it.

It was the weekend of the Sugar Bowl so I had to prepay for the room about 1 month in advance (I booked several months in advance). We arrived Sat afternoon around 2 pm (Sugar Bowl was Friday Night) and because of all the late checkouts our room wasn't ready. We were waiting to store our luggage, the luggage room was overflowing. We weren't complaining, we were just waiting patiently talking about where we were going for \"snack/lunch\". The manager walked by us. Then the receptionist called us over and asked if I would like 2 king rooms, we were parents with 2 20+ kids (originally had a 2Q with sofa room) I asked if it would be the same price and they said of course. So we were given two separate rooms on the same floor (7th I think) which all of us were very happy with. The rooms were very nice, one of the boys slept on his sofa bed and said it was fine. The bathroom is between the two rooms (bedroom and living room) and both had a door you could close off so lots of privacy. The changers for the TVs didn't work real well but we were only there for one night so didn't bother asking for new batteries. The happy hour was a \"rum punch\" or could order anything like a gin&tonic (obviously not top shelf). They had chips and salsa, and even walked around with some muffaletta (sp?) slider type sandwiches. The main set of elevators broke down for about an hour on Sunday morning and the management moved us over to the employee's elevators, telling the employees to not use them for a while. I thought they handled it very well. We stayed here because it was within walking distance of the Quarter and walking distance to the Pier. If you are going to walk to the pier you actually walk on the road that says no pedestrians. We walked the whole convention center looking for the way to the terminals and even went in and asked a security guard and he's the one that says everyone walks that road.

My biggest problem with the hotel is that the unrenovated rooms are visually unappealing with old styling and many moldy/damp smelling rooms. The renovated suites (which I asked to be switched into) were on the other hand much better. Other concerns: 1. There is also construction going on which can be heard from early in the morning to mid evening if you happen to be in one of the rooms closest to the construction. 2. If you're interested in being close to Bourbon Street, this hotel is a hearty walk from the action. 3. Some of the rooms have outdoor entry which gives the hotel a very motel-like feel (particularly when combined with the old style of the rooms). Bottom line - there are other comparably priced hotels in New Orleans that I've stayed at and had a much more enjoyable stay - Hotel Monteleone & Marriott New Orleans to name a few.

We were very please with the Embassy suites. The staff were super friendly and helpful, and explained all the features of the hotel. The suite was 2 rooms and a balcony, which we found great because we could put the children in one room and stay up until \"grown up\" bedtime in the other room. The room also had a fridge, which was great storing babyfood and bottles, and a microwave, which is very handy! There was space enough for our Pack n' Play and all the luggage and toys that are required when travelling with children. Although outside the balcony was quite noisy, the hotel was amazingly soundproof and we never noticed any outside noise. I must also add that there was really no great view off our balcony. We faced the outside of another building. The hotel was very close to the Childrens Museum, The Aquarium, The Boardwalk Market, and the Convention center. There is also a convenience store and a family friendly resteraunt (Mulate) within 2 blocks. The French quarter was a little farther away but my 4 year old was able to walk it with minimal complaining. My husband and my 4 year old were also able to walk back from the Superdome after a Saints game. We especially appreciated the free breakfast in the morning and the Managers Reception in the evening. Their was a lot of choices available for breakfast, including cook to order omletes, fruit, breads and muffins, cereal and oatmeal. Even my 7 month old enjoyed the cream of wheat! The managers reception is a great idea. The grown ups can grab an adult beverage on the house, and we could use the hotel high chair to feed the baby in the atrium whilst enjoying the beverage! Our 4 year old enjoyed the dry snacks that were offered. If it was just me and my husband going to party in the French quarter I probably would not choose this hotel.

The NO Embassy is renovating rooms on the 16th floor and when we rode up to see the view, it seems like the rooms will be more like the Huntsville location, with larger bathrooms. My only real complaint was the small bathroom and lack of counter space, but again, free breakfast is great - eggs or omelets, bacon, sausage, grits, hashbrowns, fruit, yogurt, etc. - and it was quick and good. There were lines at night for drinks, but they had two bartenders and it moved very, very quickly. We had several drinks every night we stayed with a very limited wait time. There is also chips/salsa and snack mix available. I thought the location was pretty good, but i guess it depends on what you want to do. you can catch the riverfront streetcar to the french quarter just a couple of blocks from the Embassy. I really enjoyed the Riverwalk, which is also just a block or so, and I LOVED Mulates, a restaurant on the next block. We walked to a from Harrah's every night - maybe a four block walk, five at the most, and walked back after midnight with no problems. Go from 7:00 to 10:00 pm every night and there is a cajun band and dancing and the food is great too. Also, Emerils is right across the street.

It was a package deal (airfare/hotel) and very reasonable for staying at the Embassy Suites for 4 nights. I've stayed at many Embassy Suites and new this wasn't initially an ES. I've stayed at other hotels in the Warehouse District (Spring Hill & Staybridge). I knew where it was located and knew it was close to the Riverfront Trolley to travel up to the Quarter, that was all good. Sure the reviews bothered me a little but good breakfast, happy hour, and decent room would outweigh any bad reviews. Well I contacted Rachael Velazquez, Customer Service Mgr., and requested a room in the Lofts since they were newer. I knew they were in another building right next door but wasn't worried. I had booked for 2 couples and requested 2 rooms close together in the Lofts. She e-mailed back and said everything was taken care of. Upon arrival at the airport we took a taxi to ES. We all checked in and followed the signs out of the parking garage and right across an alley into the Lofts. It wasn't more than 75 yards from Check-in desk to the front of the Lofts, not a problem. We were on the 6th floor and the rooms were directly across from each other. Being not a super high rise they isn't much of a view like the Marriott or Sheraton but who cares, your not in the room much anyway. The rooms were very nice. The outside walls were brick and very nostalgic. It was a perfect ES room (clean, nice bedding, and nice bath). We were very happy, Ms. Velazquez had taken very good care of us. We arrived around 5:30 from the airport and Happy Hour runs from 5:30 to 7:30. So we unpacked and went down to the lounge. It's good to get there early because the comfy seats fill up quick. They have snacks (nachos/salsa & chex mix) and of course beer and mixed drinks for free. Weekend nights get a big line but it moves fast and remember to tip, they work hard. The salsa was bangin. In the morning, of course, they have their made-to-order breakfast or buffet. The omelettes were great, I'm sure I gained weight from just eating b/f every morning. They do have a heated pool and jacuzzi just outside of the Atrium area (happy hour/breakfast area). You can even smoke out there. I had no problem with housekeeping, they did a great job cleaning the rooms, don't forget to tip them either, they deserve it. So whatever you do do not believe the bad reviews you've read here. Probably in the main building they need some renovations, which I heard were coming, but the Lofts was fine. I've stayed in the Warehouse District 3 or 4 times and never had any worry of crime. Emeril's is right around the corner from the ES. I wish to thank everybody at the ES for all their hospitality, it was a GREAT stay, I will stay there again in the future. Just several tips: When going to the FQ go out the front of the ES and turn left and walk down Julia to the Riverfront Trolley ($1.25) will take you all the way up to The Mint then walk back stopping to see everything.

We used an opaque third party booking agency so I wasn't sure which hotel we were getting until it was already reserved. I was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews about this hotel but wanted to say that we really enjoyed staying there. The location for us was nice. It was close enough to walk pretty much anywhere we wanted to go and just a few blocks from the riverfront streetcar line. It's a little away from Bourbon Street but we still felt safe walking back to our hotel at night. The location is quieter than the hotels I have stayed at in the French Quarter on previous trips. The hotel has a hot breakfast buffet every morning included in the price of your stay. Even though it was a busy weekend in New Orleans we never had to wait long to get through the line, even when we ordered omelettes. Our room was very clean. Although there were some signs of wear, there was nothing in our room that was torn or broken. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and checking in and out went smoothly. We arrived at about 6 pm on a Friday and left around 8:30 the following Monday. There are two charges that I would like to let other travelers know about - we had our car and parking is $30.00 per night. They also charge $14.95 per day for high speed internet access but have a business center where you can use the internet for free.

We stayed three nights (the third night was free!) and had a wonderful time. EVERY ONE of the staff was pleasant and smiled and welcomed us. A special thumbs up to Roderick, the concierge. The room was fine. It was a suite with two double beds and a pull-out sofa. It fit us (2 adults, a 17 year old and a 14 year old) just fine. Plenty of room with 2 TV's, a fridge and a microwave. The breakfast was good too. Yes, you may have to wait a few minutes for your cooked-to-order eggs, but you can skip that and take the pre-cooked scrambled eggs if you want. Much better than the same old Hampton Inn rubber eggs we've gotten so tired of. And there's bacon, sausage, potatoes, french toast, muffins, fruit, etc. every day. And it's included in the price! And to top it all off, there's a nightly free happy hour. Two hours of free drinks. Ah, New Orleans. The location is perfect. You're not in the French Quarter, but for my money, you don't want to be. Yes, it's interesting down there and I love to visit, but it's loud and sometimes gross (Bourbon street is particularly seedy and smells). The location of the Embassy Suites is in the Warehouse district. It's an easy walk to the quarter. I would recommend this to anyone. Yes the outside is painted a funky color and it's not brand new, but it had all we wanted. There is a nice heated pool, a jacuzzi, a really good exercise/weight room (with free weights!). Remember that this is New Orleans, a serious party town. You may want to bring some ear plugs. Some revelers are out to the wee hours, but this is nothing particular to this hotel. New Orleans offers not only the quarter, but the WWII museum, swamp tours, plantation tours, and much more. We've done all these and they were worth every penny. And take the city tour too so you can see all the other districts and the Katrina devastation/rebuilding...and the quirky cemeterys. Go! Eat some cajun food! Relax! Have some fun. Come back to the Embassy Suites, put in your earplugs and go to sleep. You won't regret it. Only drawbacks: $30/night for parking, but that seems like a New Orleans standard. Also $15/night for wireless internet access.

We arrived on the 31st and departed on the 3rd. Upon arriving at the hotel it looked very nice and the people were very friendly. When we walked into our room, we were shocked at the condition. Everything was ragged. It was clean, but that is where the good review ended. The TV went in and out and when we called (twice) they said they would fix it, but they never did. On the moring of the Sugar Bowl there was no hot water in fact there was no hot water until that night, after the Sugar Bowl was over. There were three of us in the room (which we paid extra for,) but we were only given 2 towels. We requested towels; they never came. We finally found a cart in the hallway and got towels off of it. They also did not removed the dirty towels after we requested that they do so. The dirty towels were not removed until the 2nd of January ( I guess they figured that since they were not planning on providing hot water there was no need to provide towels.) Breakfast each day was wonderful and the service people were very friendly and helpful. One of the resons the Embassy Suites was choosen was due to the on site parking however, when we started to leave we discovered that the car had been moved to an off site location and it did take about 30 minutes to get it to the hotel. Other people waiting said that they had been waiting for over an hour. As we left the dining area there was a lady complaining that her room had no water at all (she was in the shower when the water cut off with shampoo in her hair; she had taken a cold shower the day before.) As we were talking with her and her husband, a manager came over and apologized for the problems saying that it was due to Katrina, a recurring theme throughout our stay. Every time we called the front desk with a complaint it was blamed on Katrina. While I feel bad for the people of New Orleans that Katrina hit them, it has been 3 years and other places are back up and running and New Orleans has commercials saying they are back.

Most hotels in New Orleans were sold out this night with many fans in town for the game. We arrived approximately 12:30 in the afternoon and were told we would not be able to check in until 3PM at the earliest and when standing in line found out that there was no hot water and water pressure was very low in the hotel (under repairs) and had none the night before. We came back and were able to check in approximately 3:10 but were told we had no towels in the room (They arrived within 30 min or so.) There were guests sitting all in the common areas downstairs waiting to check in. We were told this was due to a large number of people who checked out late. Our room (619) was clean but had worn carpeting and a chair with a large tear. It is definately in need of updating. We had a view of the street below from the balcony. We arrived back around midnight and there was hot water so we all took showers before going to bed. This was a good thing because the next morning just as we were checking out there was no water - a sudden outage leaving some guests in the shower with soap and shampoo on them. (Very unhappy guests.) We had the breakfast (included) which offered a good variety and made to order items. There was a buffet area set up with hot foods like eggs, grits, bacon, etc. (I assume due to the large amount of guests.) They were refilling food/drink areas constantly so that seemed to work well. We called for our car and went down to wait with a large number of guests who were also waiting for their cars. This valet service was total chaos. There was no organization at all. We waited approximately 20 minutes and asked (car on the way is what we were told) - another 10 minutes and again told car is on the way. I went into the hotel and requested a refund of my parking which was immediately given. After another 30 minutes or so I confronted the valet manager asking where my vehicle and keys were and was again told rudely that there was someone getting it even though I told her I had heard that for over 50-55 minutes. I had to go in and get a hotel manager involved and requested a refund. My husband went looking through the garage himself (others did the same) and retreived our car which was in the main hotel garage just a couple of levels up. There was no reason our car should not have been retreived within a reasonable amount of time. I requested a refund of our entire stay which was promptly taken care of by the hotel management calling Priceline and requested that my entire amount be refunded. (This was done as I verified it on their website.) There were major problems with this stay, some of which were mechanical failure (not fault of the staff) and some with management issues of another sub contracted company. The staff that I encountered were friendly and helpful even though they were being forced to handle a lot of unhappy guests and problems beyond their control (boiler issues). I would commend the entire front desk staff (especially Rachael) for their attempts to make everyone happy in a bad situation. They were doing the best that they could and handled everyon in a very professional manner. The parking however is lacking in management and I suspect that is is run by Central Parking rather than the hotel as the valets had their uniforms on. The girl who was in charge was terrible and should not be in that position. While I stood there she continued to tell everyone on the phone that it would be 20 minutes to retreive their vehicles when that was obviously not possible. There were other guests standing there saying they had lost their cars and/or their keys and had been there over 1 hours as well and guests who also gave up and retreived their own cars even though the rude girl there kept telling them that they couldn't do so. Their current set up is unable to handle the volume of guests that a large event produces and in New Orleans with so many events and Mardi Gras just a couple of weeks away, if no improvement is made this will continue to be a problem. The hotel is in need of updating and general maintenance seems to be an issue. It is in a good location and very convenient to the RiverWalk, Aquarium and for cruise ship passengers.

However, there were good reasons why it looked like a good deal. First the positive...the location is great for access to the convention center... Now the problems... On the first night we were on the 5th floor of the loft, which is a separate building behind the hotel. The first thing we noticed walking into the room was a cockroach sitting on the table. The room decorations in the loft have an industrial feel with unpainted exterior walls, as it is a converted factory/warehouse, which is fine if you like that sort of thing. We also had two double beds instead of the requested King, the elevator shaft was right by the bed, making noise all night and the hotel staff was unwilling and/or unable to move us. The next morning the toilet blocked and the alarm clock radio volume switch didn't work. We were moved to a new room the next day. While this one had a king bed and was in the main hotel, there was a noisy electrical transformer in the corridor closet behind the bed. The toilet blocked again, but flooded the bathroom this time, meaning we needed replacement towels that took a while to arrive. Then the towel bar broke. We were also unable to change the time setting on the alarm clock so had to remember it was always an hour behind. Finally, when we returned on our final day after touring the French Quarter, we found ourselves locked out of the room. We had been told we had checked out already!!! After showing our ID and having spoken with the senior receptionist, we were eventually let back into our room. Luckily our belongings were still there... We don't know if these types of problems are common in New Orleans, but they certainly should not be common at Embassy Suites.

We would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "August 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cA Class Act!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5077974", "Content": "This hotel is within close walking distance of the convention center and Riverwalk. It is also close to some great antique shopping and Emeril's Restaurant-yum! You could even walk to Harrah's casino depending on the time of day and the weather,probably about 6 blocks. The hotel is beautiful. The breakfast and cocktail hour are good quality and add even a better value to the stay. The front desk staff was very warm, especially Brenda. And also Rickey worked at the conceirge and helped us book our tours and gave some great advice. Their presense made us feel safe and right at home. The room was absolutely beautiful and the decor looks brand new. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was sparkling clean. This is our third stay with Embassy Suites as we have stayed in theirs in Las Vegas and New Jersey and looking forward to our Embassy Suites trip in March to their signature property in New York CIty. We have never had a problem and would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to stay at when in New Orleans. If you have ever wanted to go to New Orleans or are debating on going back post-Katrina, my opinion is that this city offers so much more then your average vacation destination. Nowhere else in the US can you travel to that has more to offer than New Orleans. Everything from its culture and history, to gambling, to music and arts, and the BEST food we have ever tasted in our lives. We will be back and have already booked our next trip there!", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "raleigh nc", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for this trip\u201d", "Author": "matt5217", "ReviewID": "UR4582287", "Content": "Despite struggling to properly staff up in these post Katrina days, this property did a great job when we were there over President's Weekend. The location is ideal for visitors going to the convention center, and not a bad walk from the French Quarter, but a bit sheltered from that action. Since we were also in town to visit family that live in Uptown it was a nice central location. The facility was clean, staff was friendly and very helpful, and breakfast delicious. They were only offering maid service every third day-but that's all I get at home anyways.", "Date": "March 4, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Embassy Suites New Orleans-Convention Center", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d115244-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_New_Orleans_Convention_Center-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "Price": "$121 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">315 Julia Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New Orleans</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">LA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">70130</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "115244", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b5/71/b5711d3f04611cb79e799bbda3b3ae3c11large.jpg"}}
