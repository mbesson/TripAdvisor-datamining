Since we arrived so early, they held our suitcases behind the desk while we wandered around Old San Juan, and they were waiting for us in our rooms when returned in the afternoon. The location is great and the service was excellent. The room was clean and reasonably comfortable, and there's free wi-fi in the lobby. We had one of the rooms in front with a balcony. The plus side is having the cute balcony, with a view of the Plaza. The drawback is having street noise - though we really didn't notice it anyway. The air conditioner fan was loud enough to cover it up, but constant enough to not bother me for sleeping. There's a taxi stand across the street, but since we had an early flight, the manager arranged to have a taxi waiting for us at 5:45 am (the driver was already waiting in the lobby when we checked out around 5:30). He also arranged for us to have an early wake-up call at 5am (there's no phone in the room - the wake up \"call\" was a knock at the door), but it was right on time. There was an alarm clock in the room, but it was nice to have the extra assurance of the wake-up call. It's not fancy, but it was a good value for Old San Juan. We also stayed at Hotel Milano pre-cruise, and I felt that the two hotels were pretty comparable, and would stay again at either one.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Twin Lakes, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cConstantly improving\u201d", "Author": "miken-11", "ReviewID": "UR127667915", "Content": "This was our sixth stay in the last six years at this hotel.

The elevator is very interesting and if you are claustrophobic, you shouldn't get in it. We didn't experience any problems with it while we were there (February 25). The rooms were clean and because they are inside rooms, we had no problem with noise. The phone didn't work in our room but we didn't need it. My sister and brother-in-law's TV didn't work and they were unable to control the air conditioner. It was either on or off instead of regulated by temperature. However we weren't in the room that much - only to sleep and shower. It is great for a pre-cruise stay and we will stay there again. The staff was nice and helpful when we needed something.

It is a short walk to Cafeteria Mallorca for breakfast (mallorca con mantequilla) or to church around the corner. We chose Hotel Plaza De Armas because of price and location. We chose not to have a refrigerator or a balcony. You shouldn't complain if you chose not to get these items and didn't get them for free. The rooms were pretty basic. They were clean and comfortable enough. The bathroom was clean and there was abundant hot water. Everything appeared to work. There were no bugs. The front desk staff was charming and very helpful. They appear to be very honest and hard working people trained in hotel service. They do not perform miracles. They watched our luggage for us and gave us whatever advice we requested. There is a restaurant at the front of the hotel. The elevator is slow and only holds 4 people or 1,200 pounds. We were happy that there was an elevator. Historic hotels don't always have elevators. If you want more amenities, go somewhere else and pay for them. Luis Garzon, Guest Relations Manager at Hotel Plaza De Armas, was right. He made sure that we didn't have to worry.

Not much privacy from your neighbors. The doors that lead from your room to the balcony...well let's just say I hope it doesn't rain or become very windy when you are here or you would be in for a surprise.

The luggage was everywhere and they were busy checking in people so it is not \"watched\" I think this hotel would benefit from having food available. There is room in the back sitting area, there may even be a bar but I can't remember, that could be used. Elevator is scarey! It quit working when we were there, they put a sign on the main floor only that it was out of service. A cable was frayed and was fixed the following day. It would have been nice to have a sign on EVERY floor instead of having guests get in and wait forever(thank goodness the cable didn't snap!) No problem getting a taxi.

The charge was refunded the following day (upon checkout) when the front desk clerk informed me of the charge. We would have never checked in and gone elsewhere had we not pre-paid for our room. Believe me, we wanted to! Don't waste your time or money with this place. There are numerous other comparable places in the area....pick one of them. I can provide photos if you'd like!

My girlfriend and I decided to indulge in all the wonderful things Puerto Rico has to offer. Unfortunately, we chose to stay at the Howard Johnson Plaza de Armas. Big mistake. The price is alluring, but after you read the rest of this review, I hope you will look elsewhere. I am not one to complain. I have stayed in no frills hotels in the past and was not expecting much when I checked into the HoJo. But this place is an orgy of aggravation. We selected a suite room so we would have a window. I guess the definition of a suite at the HoJo means handyman's special with the following \"amenities\": 1. Running toilet that would not flush 2. Safe locked rendering it useless 3. Phone not working 4. Television with only two channels 5. Broken iron 6. Inconsistent water temperature 7. And last but not least, no control of AC that does not really work anyway. The first room we checked into had all the problems listed above. When we opened the door we were greeted by a blast of oven temperature heat. Apparently it is normal for the HoJo staff to have the AC turned off when the room is not occupied and it is 100 degrees outside. That means the temperature in the room would stay in the 90s for at least your first day as the AC catches up. Just turning on the AC is a feat of acrobatics. The unit is situated at the ceiling level, 10 feet above the floor. There are no wall controls or remote control to the unit. To activate, you must climb on chairs or nightstands to reach the controls. The room was equipped with a ceiling fan which we thought would alleviate the sweltering heat, until we discovered that the ceiling lights must be on for the ceiling fan to operate. They were both on the same circuit. This means that you have to sleep with the lights on if you decide to use the ceiling fan. The next morning we woke up exhausted if you can consider tossing and turning in 90 degree heat sleep. Our first stop was the front desk. We inquired about the AC control and were informed that the controller was missing, without any further explanation. We also mentioned the toilet was not working. The front desk staff told us we could change rooms if we wanted to which we agreed to. Later that day we returned to the hotel, we inquired about the room status, and the front desk staff assigned us to a new room comparable to the suite we were paying for. We eagerly moved our luggage to the new room expecting to finally start our vacation only to be greeted with all the same \"amenities\" listed above in a smaller room with no ceiling fan option. The first thing I want to mention about this room is the more challenging acrobatics required to operate the AC unit. Do not attempt this if you are faint of heart, disabled or elderly. Climbing onto the top of a seven foot armoire is necessary to access the AC controls. Unfortunately, we prepaid the room so we could not get a refund if we checked out. Trust us, we really wanted to check out. After analyzing our plight we decided to stay the additional nights we paid for and then move to another hotel. The only way we could sleep in the oppressive heat was by purchasing a pedestal fan at the local drugstore. The fan helped us stay cooler, but it did not keep the cockroaches away. We found a jumbo size cockroach in our room the next morning. What a wonderful way to awake. I can go on forever about how disappointing this hotel is. Save your money, save your time, spare yourself the aggravation and book a different hotel. After checking out of the HoJo, we checked into the Sheraton two blocks away. That is when our vacation really began. P.S. If you decide to stay at the HoJo, do not waste any time waiting for the elevator.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chapin, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cBetter nearby\u201d", "Author": "mack243SouthCarolina", "ReviewID": "UR70835043", "Content": "Toilet Overflowed ; coffie maker broken; no windows; elevator small& slow; remote broken.

We chose this hotel because of its location in \"Old San Juan\" and what appeared to be a reasonable price. We had asked for and received one of their better rooms.......a room with a balcony and queen size bed. When we arrived, we immediately noticed the room safe did not work, there was no hot water and when we went to call the front desk, we discovered the phone was not working. After a trip to the front desk, we were advised the phones had not worked for several weeks due to a power outage?? Their answer for the safe was that the battery was probably weak or dead however they then did not fix?? As to the hot water, they suggested we \"fiddle with the tap\". Eventually after several attempts, we did get some warm water out of the shower....we never did get any warm/hot water in the sink. The hotel is very old and it is apparent that it is not maintained. The elevator holds either 4 adults or 2 adults with luggage and is painfully slow....many people including ourselves used the stairs vs waiting for the elevator. The general appearance is that it is dirty although on a positive note, the sheets appeared to be clean and the mattress reasonably comfortable. The room was air conditioned but the noise from the air conditioner caused one to debate whether or not to turn it on at night when you're trying to sleep. The windows had no glass.....only wooden shutters and the street was busy all night so between the air conditioner and the street noise, sleep was hard to get. Oh, by the way, over the doors to the rooms there are wooden slats so you hear everything happening in the hallway which adds to the noise factor. As an aside, we went to go out the front door of the hotel one night. The desk manager was looking at a valve just outside their front door but on hotel property as it bubbled up raw sewage onto the side walk which then ran into the street. That was pretty disgusting and you had no choice but to walk over it to either exit or enter the hotel. By the time we got back to the hotel later that evening, the valve was closed and it appeared they had \"washed down\" the side walk but the sewage was still in the street. If we hadn't prepaid for these rooms, I would have left after seeing the room for the first time. It seemed to be too much of a hassle to look for another room and try to get our money back from Howard Johnson. Would I stay here again...........definitely not!!

We were on a pre-wedding trip to meet wedding planner, photographer and to visit the Caribe Hilton which is where the wedding will be held. We also wanted to stay somewhere relatively inexpensive and centrally located so we could sight-see as much as possible in between all the appointments. The location is great if you want to stay in Old San Juan. I would much rather stay in a resort or different area for vacation but this was perfect for just a \"place to sleep\" I had no expectations of the hotel being a resort, or having any extra amenities. My connections in PR told me the hotel was clean and in a good location which is all I was looking for. That being said, this by far the worst room I've ever stayed at, and the worst service I've ever encountered in my life. We had to switch rooms right off the bat because I did not feel safe on the first floor. The door opened right almost on top of the bed, the bathroom sink was in the actual room, the pillows were the thickness of a magazine, the towels barely wrapped around me and I am 5 ft 110 pounds. The shower was so small I could barely fit. All of this, however, we just laughed at and I took the blame for booking the room. It served it's purpose, and was just a place to sleep--although you couldn't really sleep there since the whole place echoed and you could hear everything in the hallway,lobby, or outside. The building is old and neat, could be a really neat hotel if taken care of. The part I had a major problem with is that our key never worked, from day one. After a rainy, hot muggy day of walking around and dragging our bags everywhere, we would return to our hotel to climb the narrow, hot stairway 3 flights to our room (the elevator is old, scary, and takes 20 minutes to get to the 3rd floor, and is so tiny two of us couldn't really fit), only to find that our key would not work and we would have to go down and get someone. It got to the point where we would ask someone to follow us up to our room in case our key wouldn't work. We went through 11 keys total and whoever was at the front desk was always frustrated and panicked and couldnt' get ahold of anyone to help. We are pretty easy going people and were never rude to them, by the way. The last night we were there, we had made a point to get back at a reasonable hour after dinner since we had to get up at 5 am to go to the airport. Of course, our key did not work, and hours later the poor desk guy couldn't get the master key, the housekeeping keys, or even a huge long hanger looking tool to open our room. No manager, supervisor, etc was available or on-call. Which I felt was very unsafe. What if there was a child in the room that you went downstairs to get a bottle of water for and couldn't get back in the room? He offered us another key to another room like that could help at all considering all of our luggage was in our room. Finally, as the desk guy was downstairs frantically trying to call someone, my fiance managed to jimmy open our door with the hanger thing (much like a car) after laying on the filthy floor for an hour trying to make it work. He got the number to the owner and supervisor and was basically told by the owner it wasn't his problem, there was nothing he could do about it, and to leave his complaint in writing. No apology for the severe inconvenience of a customer actually having to break into their own room, or for the fact that we had about 4 hours at that point until we needed to go to the airport. Completely unbelievable, for ANYONE\"S standards. I am surprised they are still in business, the guy working even told us this wasn't right for us, or for him, and that it happened all the time. I realize there is a different \"mentality\" or way of doing business on an island, etc etc. However, there is no excuse for this kind of treatment or customer service and we will be filing several complaints with whoever we can find to do so.

Beware though that while we didn't have problems sleeping with all the noise (we were wearing ear plugs), friends of ours only slept for about 2hrs b/c of the noise. There was some crazy guy outside having a fit with himself all night long. The hotel is in a great location, we walked all around no problems to the forts and the cruise pier we were leaving out of was @ 10min walk away. We chose to get a cab @12usd though rather than dragging our luggage all around the cobblestone streets. Old San Juan is a beautiful area and I just wish we had more time there to explore. The continental breakfast is just that, toast and jam (no pb), 2 cereal choices, danishes, coffee and juice. Great restaurants in the area, there's one a few blocks away that invented the pina coloda...yum! Also great shopping as for name brands etc... Oh and they say the elevator is small...it is extremely small. You can probably fit 4 adults in it and that's it. It was faster to take the small staircase up to the third floor while walking very slowly than the elevator:) All part of the charm though!", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Dakota", "Title": "\u201cReally enjoyed this hotel--great location!\u201d", "Author": "mitswan", "ReviewID": "UR23140018", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for two nights before our cruise left port.

We basically needed a place to sleep and shower, so we weren't concerned about amenities. What we loved about this hotel was the fact that our two kids could have separate beds. Our spacious room had a king, a single, and a futon. Perfect arrangement for our family. We also had a fridge and a microwave. Everything was clean and the bathroom was clean and spacious, as well. We were at the top of the (very narrow) staircase on the second floor, so we didn't really bother using the elevator, which appeared to be so slow that it was almost stopped. I don't think we would've found the hotel on our own, so I'm glad the taxi driver knew where it was. As previous reviewers have noted, it's just a little storefront tucked in between two other stores. It's tall and skinny. We arrived early and were unable to check in. Though it seemed as though we waited forever (we had to remember that we were now on \"caribbean time\"), the guy at the front desk was very helpful. He stored our luggage and gave us some recommendations for lunch while we waited for our room to be ready. When we returned an hour later, our room was ready and we were able to check in. The location is great for getting anywhere in Old San Juan. We walked to El Morro and then around the rest of the city. When we got back to the hotel several hours later, we were thrilled to find a Pizza Hut right around the corner. We weren't that hungry... just needed to eat and get some sleep. That brings me to our only real complaint about the hotel. Our room faced the street and there seemed to be a lot of traffic until the wee hours of the morning. In San Juan, as in most Caribbean places we've been, this includes a lot of horn honking. While this didn't seem to affect our two kids, my husband and I had a less than stellar night's sleep. The complimentary breakfast was simple, but adequate. The water pressure in the shower was great. And once again, the hotel stored our luggage while we wandered around as we had to check out before we could go to the cruise ship. We were credited the fee for the room safe as we didn't use it. And with the AAA rate, the room was more than reasonable for being in the center of Old San Juan. We would definitely stay there again.

We knew that we were arriving late and leaving by noon, so we were willing to take the chance. We were arriving Christmas Day, so I did not have high expectations on service, figuring everyone was off. The desk manager was very helpful pointing to a place for a 10 pm snack for us and kids. We had a room facing the street with two window/balconies on the second floor (room 206 I think, labled \"home office\" on the door). Yes, the elevator is old (the kind you have to close the cage and door for it to move), but we were on the 2nd floor, so we didn't need it much. The room was not the most quiet, but the air conditioner makes enough noise to drown out most of the street noise. I wake at the slightest sound, and only a couple of honks early in the morning were enough to wake me. It was a huge room, with lots of space for our 4 large suitcases. It's clearly an older building, but honestly, the most noticable part was the worn/scuffed tiles in the hallway. Once in our room, there were new, clean tiles, a clean bath, and lots of space. There was a king, a twin, and a sofa that folded down into a twin. I have to warn you that the sofa looked to be about 5 ft long with wide padded arms (about 12 inches each), so when the back folds down, it worked for my tall 6 year old, but at 5' 7\", I would have been hanging ontothe arms which were not entirely flat with the bed.. There were no sheets ready when we arrived, but the front desk quickly located them, and I made up the bed myself. Almost across the street from this hotel is a plaza square, which had a lovely espresso/bakery kiosk, which was open on Christmas day evening. We slept through the breakfast provided by the hotel, but there is a fast food joint within 1/2 block that was perfectly adequate for breakfast. There is also a Wendy's in the same block. We loved that it was a 10 min walk to the old fortress of San Juan, and the front desk gave us a walking map and good directions. The waterfront is also in easy walking distance, but we did not have time. The cab ride to the cruise terminal was about 10 min. All in all, it was a great price compared to the other options for 4 of us, but I'm not sure I would have put an adult in the sofa bed. One last note: I booked directly though the hotel, and when I went to confirm, they thought we had 3 persons instead of 4. They were able to confirm us a room for 4, but I was under the impressions that I was getting a King Plus room, which was a king and two twins, We ended up with a king, twin and small sofa bed, which worked for us but not if our children had been bigger.

The hotel is apparently in an old apartment building converted to this purpose. Rooms: You will want a room with a queen size bed or larger. Our group found smaller beds in other rooms that were unacceptable, even for one person. There are no windows in most rooms (except those facing the street). The rooms are very quiet, especially since there is an air conditioner in each room. Rooms are reasonably spacious and wi-fi is included at no cost. Elevator: There is a single elevator that moves at a speed of about one minute per floor (literally). This is a four story building. If you have no problem walking up and down stairs, you will use the cramped staircase instead of the elevator. If you need to use an elevator, you are going to have frustrations. Depending on your physical condition, a lower floor might be desirable. Staff: We found the staff to be quite pleasant and helpful. Overall, this seems to be a hotel used primarily by cruise ship passengers for a single night stay on one end or the other. So long as you are not looking for luxury and have no problem with stairs, the hotel is quite acceptable.

The Plaza is a great spot for people watching, meeting locals, and getting some coffee. The big problem with Old San Juan for me was that there aren't very many street signs on the buildings at intersections, so often times you really don't have a clue what street you're on. After driving in and out of Old San Juan though, you start to figure it out (it's not that big an area). This is an old colonial building converted in to a hotel. That means most of the rooms don't have windows because the houses had windows in the front and back to allow air to pass through the house and cool it down. Side rooms didn't have windows. I guess the door were just left open. If you want a room with a view, don't stay here. If you want a large room, this isn't the place to stay. If you want someplace to rest your head at night, this will do just fine. The air conditioner in my room sounded like, well, an air conditioner. If you're used to very high end central air conditioning that makes nary a sound, I suppose you might find it noisy. If you're used to the sound a window air conditioner makes (white noise), you'll be perplexed by the negative comments left by others about the sound the AC makes. The continental breakfast offered is decent, and should be taken advantage of (pastries, cereal, fruit, toast, juice, coffee). The staff is friendly and helpful, and made sure we knew which parking garage had the best rates (thank goodness! There was a big difference!). The elevator did break down one day while I was there, and it's slow, but it's not like it takes 10 minutes to get between floors. This is hardly unusual at a hotel in a building that was built before elevators were even invented (stay at any old converted hotel in Paris, and this elevator will seem like heaven by comparison). The staff gladly helped my travel companion with her bag the day the elevator was broken. I would describe the hotel decor in the lobby and lounge area as \"Pottery Barn.\" And I rather liked the tile work in the lobby.

We slept very well there because the walls are thick and a fan is constantly circulating air since there are not any windows. I would stay there if I returned to the area and would recommend it to a friend who does not mind these issues if the price is right! I don't think you could find a better hotel, at this price in such a great location!", "Date": "May 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "amoree", "ReviewID": "UR7391126", "Content": "I stayed at HoJo's on my way back from Vieques. Overrall it was in a great location and the hotel was nice but I don't think it was worth the money being asked. The rooms are very small and it feels a little stuffy. The elevator was small and slow and doesn't always work. The staff was helpful with the few problems we encountered. Our air conditioner stopped working in the middle of the night and we had to change rooms. This was done quickly and the night person was very nice. They did a great job remodeling the place. It was no trip to paradise but it served the purpose and it was quiet. I probably would stay there again but would look to see how big the larger rooms are first.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, MD", "Title": "\u201cReally is a great location\u201d", "Author": "TravelBugMaryland", "ReviewID": "UR7332040", "Content": "The location really is great -- right on a main sqare, with a trolley stop outside. I had an inside room (so no windows) and that was a little weird, but I was out most of the day and night and came back just to sleep so it didn't affect me. The people were really nice to me throughout my stay -- especially after I missed my flight and had to find a room at 8PM on a Friday night! (Note: Get to the airport 2 hours early no matter what the airline says. The people move really slowly in San Juan! I should have had more than enough time except for the line literally didn't move for 30 minutes, and then just barely). There's nothing glamorous about this place, but it is clean and it's a great price. The free breakfast was more like a hostel breakfast, so unless you're really on a budget, I'd venture out and eat something a little more local in flavor. As for parking, there are several paid lots that seem far away but are actually right on the free trolley line. However, I didn't have to use them -- I had great luck both nights finding street parking between 5-7PM -- after the working people left for the day and before the diners and party-ers came in for the clubs and stuff. When all is said and done, however, I wish I had foregone the rental car -- it was a liability more than an asset. If you do get one, get the smallest one possible -- the streets are very narrow.", "Date": "April 11, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Plaza De Armas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g147320-d268431-Reviews-Hotel_Plaza_De_Armas-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$107 - $163*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle San Jose 202</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Juan</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00907</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "268431", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8d/ec/8dec7423dad773d4a8a4563647d3629e15large.jpg"}}
