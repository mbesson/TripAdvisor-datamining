We had a triple room with a double bed and a single bed. The room was basic but a reasonable size, clean with a TV and tea making facilities. The en suite was a bit small. You have to sit sideways on the toilet!. The metal shower was good but there was nowhere to put soap etc. There were plenty of towels provided. Our room was quiet on Thursday and Friday but there was more noise on Saturday night presumably due to the other guests. Breakfast started at 6.30 in the week and at 8 on weekends. The basic breakfast consisted of two sausages, two slices bacon, 1 egg, 2 tomatoes, 3 three mushrooms, two tomatoes and baked beans. This came with as much toast as you required. Cereals, yogurts etc were also provided. Service was cheerful and very efficient. We went when breakfast started and never had to queue. Overal great value for London at \u00a380 per day. A good Italian restaurant nearby was Chix Chocs. The hotel is 5 minutes from the underground but only 3 minutes from the shops-buses.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cGood place to get your head down.\u201d", "Author": "Serenesiren", "ReviewID": "UR120910784", "Content": "This is a basic B and B, clean and a good location.

The rooms are fairly large, the beds are big and comfy with lovely crisp bedding, the bathroom was a decent size, towels were nice and fresh. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good although I only have cereal & toast so can't vouch for the cooked breakfast. I also loved having such a large TV - it must have been a 32inch (not sure if they're all that big). The only bad thing was the WiFi which was terrible - very weak signal. It's a pleasant 5 minute uphill walk from the Tube but once you're at the top of the hill you are very close to the main street which has plenty of places to eat, as well as a Sainsbury's. The back garden is lovely and peaceful - if you get a room at the back, overlooking the garden, it almost feels as though you're in the countryside.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "canberra", "Title": "\u201cWould certainly recommend this guest house\u201d", "Author": "lgblakers", "ReviewID": "UR114747869", "Content": "The rooms were large (we had two different ones) and comfortabley furnished.Bathrooms clean and also good size.

While we've stayed in some hotels in downtown areas, many of the hotels are either too high priced, in a \"dodgy\" area, or funky/not well maintained. We are not afraid of going further afield nor of riding the Tube, so when we stumbled across Heatherbank, we decided to give it a try-- what a great choice. Jackie Patel, family, and staff run this boutique hotel in North Finchley, not far from the Woodside Park tube station on the Northern line. The hotel is on a quiet street, about 500 meters from the Tube station and about 200 meters from the High Street with shops, restaurants. Jackie was not bothered at all when we arrived at 1130 at night, nor with our need to sleep in the next day! The hotel is a set of old houses that they have been refurbishing very nicely and the rooms are filled with cool old touches like scalloped ceilings, beautiful woodwork, etc. Full breakfast is included-- pretty much anything you would like! The hotel also features a huge backyard that we would have loved to have used when we traveled with kids (but in the summer, it looks like it would be an oasis to rest in, too). Parking is a bit tough in the area, but there are spots available in front of the hotel (we just tubed it-- about 25 minutes to King's Cross). Some folks would find that too far, but we figured it was a small price to pay for a great hotel at a reasonable cost. Bathrooms are small, but functional and clean-- and equipped with instant hot water for showers. A little noise from people coming and going, but not much more than you'd have at any other hotel Downsides? not many that I can think of... Would be great if they'd move a few hundred meters closer to the tube (just kidding!). Not a lot of nightlife around (a few pubs), but we're not really into Discos and all-night partying anyway. They are upgrading mattresses and had not replaced ours yet, but it needed it. Despite these would we stay there again?

There's a beautiful garden behind the breakfast room, don't forget to catch some fresh air over there, it's really relaxing! Never expected to have such good service provided, it offers very affordable price for laundry service, so you don't need to look for laundry nearby. Disadvantages of the guesthouse is no sound proof for the rooms, you can hear people walking up and down the staircase or slamming door and there's no lift to the rooms. Worst thing is the shower's pressure is extremely low and the water heater is lousy, can't mix water well; sudden cold or hot, very irritating and takes very long time to finish bathing. Not recommended for traveller with baby or young kids. Make sure you book the hair dryer first during your check in, very limited supply of hair dryer and car park space.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "Scyene", "ReviewID": "UR8213092", "Content": "I was in London with substandard arrangements so a friend suggested Heatherbank Guesthouse.
