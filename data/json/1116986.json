The room was the smallest I have ever stayed in. Just enough room for a small bed, a small wash basin and stool. The bed was short and sunk in the middle which meant I had a very uncomfortable night's sleep. Adding to this, the \"Hotel\" is in a busy part of town near a fairly major road with alot of traffic and pedestrians at all hours. The walls are thin and you can hear the comings and goings of the other guests throughout the night. The toilet and showers were shared and located in the hall and were extremely small - it was difficult to fit inside and close the door! The shower and toilet did not appear particularly clean either. The building itself is old and the interior has a very \"knocked around\" feel about it. More like a very average hostel rather than a Hotel. Except they charge high hotel rates! The one redeeming feature is the \"Hotel's\" location. Easy walking distance to most touristy places in Amsterdam. I didn't need to take trams, I walked everywhere. Nevertheless, there are hundreds of hotels in Amsterdam, many with good, if not better, locations. I would not recommend this hotel to family and friends.

The bar area was the best I saw while in Amsterdam, and our friends who were staying in other hotels often came to enjoy drinks with us before we went out.

The decor definitely fits the place well, and the staff are happy for you to play the guitars and the piano (at reasonable times). Although we did not have breakfast, it looked tasty! The rooms were quite small which is typical in Amsterdam due to the shape of the buildings, but everything you needed was there. The room was very clean, the bed was comfy and the interesting furniture and fixtures surely made the place special. The bathrooms were clean and although I would normally request an en-suite room, there was no need as the facilities were fine. The whole place was great, everywhere including the bar, corridors, stairs and rooms were always cleaned. Only down-side was being woken up early in the morning by the cleaners, as the walls are a little thin, but at least you know the place is clean!! It was worth the money!

All the rooms are made up of musical bits and pices like a snare drum light shade, flight case bed and wardrobes, drum stools for seat's. plus the rooms all have plasma t.v's and ipod docking stations!. the bar stays open all nite which was a plus, th only problem being that they kept running out of ice.

From Backstage Hotel anything you would like to see is in a walking distance. The Leidseplein (with things to do day and night), the Vondelpark, streets to shop, museums, the canals with houses of many centuries ago, architecture and much more. But also stations for trams and busses wich can take you to other neighbourhoods of the city. Also, from the airport busses go regularly to take you to the Leidseplein (5 minutes from Backstage) in about half an hour. The hotel itself is great, nice people, quiet surroundings (yes one will hear people walking by, the tram etc. but that's part of 'living' the city.

The hotel itself is a very typical Dutch house in Amsterdam, tall and narrow. Check in was very easy, as most people in Amsterdam speak very good English, and we were given a room on the 4th floor. The only bad thing about this is that there is no lift at the hotel and the stairs are narrow and steep, so it is not a good prospect for those who struggle with heavy luggage. The decor of the room is superb, everything from the drum kit light, to the drummer chair, and rockstar table with lights. Not only that, but there is an iPod radio alarm clock in the room, and all rooms have free Wi-Fi access (just ask for the login details at reception). The room itself is not that big, but if you are only using it for sleeping before seeing and partaking in the sights of Amsterdam then it is quite good.
