It is a V Shaped layout and is surrounded by gas stations and a Carl's Jr. Upon arrival, I had a plate with an apple, a banana, crackers with peanut butter, Andes mints, and 2 bottles of water waiting in my room. Very nice touch for Priority Club guests. There is also a nightly Happy Hour in the lobby with free beverages. The young lady at the front desk made smiley small talk with me at check-in. There was also a bell man, although I declined his services. The lobby is inviting, and the restaurant open until 10pm. PC Local amenities included a Free Movie coupon and a 10% off restaurant coupon. All of the staff were great. The room rocked - although it was an off zig zag floorplan. Upon entry, I had a micro-kitchen: dorm fridge, microwave, 2 burner electric range (with range hood!), and a sink. Then, the next room had a 2 person round table and chairs, a desk, a gold-colored couch, TV in armoire and an arm chair. The next room (you walk through the vanity area to get to the bedroom) was the bedroom, with a (you guessed it!) bed, and tube-tv filled armoire. The windows open slightly - enough to get fresh air. Upon inspection, the air filter was clean (maybe 10 days worth of dirt). The bedding was clean and comfortable. 2 firm pillows, 2 soft pillows. The restaurant, Spiral, is located off of the lobby, and appears attractive. It has typical HI-restaurant food. The fitness center had a recumbent bike, stair stepper, a treadmill, a sauna, and an elliptical. The fitness center is cramped, and people walk through it en route to the outdoor jacuzzi area. The room, including bathroom, was immaculate. The towels were thick, and only mildly abrasive. Water took awhile at 4am to get hot, though water pressure is good. The ironing board is thinly padded, but it is well constructed and sturdy. The Sunbeam iron had been drained and had minimal mineral deposits. Internet access was disappointingly slow.

There's no bellman to help with your luggage. The outside & lobby look new & impressive. However, upon entering our room I realized that this was once an old hotel which has been renovated. All the furniture & d\u00c3\u00a9cor have been updated, but there were a few tell-tale signs: the ceiling had yellow stains (water damage?), the door to the room & the bathroom doors despite having a fresh coat of paint showed signs of an old motel door from days gone by.

I appreciated the elaborate as possible continental breakfast with the hostess so happy to accomodate. The pool and hot tub were great. My room was clean and well equipped and the bathroom was very large. Internet access down in the lobby is free. The Chinese restaurant attached was delicious. An all around great choice for the area.

The check-in staff was friendly and efficient, and our mini-suite was clean and welcoming. There was a refrigerator, a sink, a microwave, flatware, and silverware in the kitchenette in the front room. There were also two bottles of water and a package of microwaveable popcorn on the table in front of the couch (with a pull-out bed inside). I know that is minor, but it was a pleasant gesture. A desk and a television were also in this front room. The front room could be closed off by a door that separated it from the bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom contained a spacious king bed, a clock radio alarm, curtains that effectively blocked out the morning sun, two night tables, drawers, a chair, and a second television. The sink is separate from the rest of the bathroom and is located by a built-in hair dryer. The toiletries provided by the hotel were another detail that added a charm; two shampoos, a conditioner, lotion, and mouthwash were all supplied on the counter. The hotel was right off of the 15 freeway- which is a little bit out of the way from the heart of San Diego, but there was a restaurant next door, a complimentary continental breakfast, good service, free parking, and an affordable rate that made this hotel pleasurable stop.", "Date": "May 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Provo, Utah", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!!!\u201d", "Author": "redshoetraveler", "ReviewID": "UR3353727", "Content": "This hotel is actually called the Holiday Inn Select North Miramar. I don't know if the name change is new, but it is at this address and is the one pictured. We had an excellent stay at this hotel for one night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean, comfortable, and spacious. This hotel received the highest rating for Holiday Inns in the region, and yet the rate was excellent...much lower than other hotels in most areas of San Diego. It's farther from downtown and star attractions, but not very far. It took us about 10 minutes to drive to Sea World. They serve a free breakfast that consists of a good variety of muffins, bagels, yogurts, juices, coffee, danishes, cereal, etc. A good continental breakfast. They also have free drinks and appetizers in the evening, but we didn't go to that. There aren't very many restaurants immediately around the hotel, but there is a fair selection within a short drive. I would definitely stay here again if in San Diego.", "Date": "April 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Monica, CA", "Title": "\u201conly fair holiday inn\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1649978", "Content": "I visited holiday inn on a business trip.
