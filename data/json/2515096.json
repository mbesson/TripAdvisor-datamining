You would never guess that something this nice and scenic would be found near the airport. This place is simply wonderful, beginning with check-in. I needed to make an appointment for a spa visit and asked for a recommendation. The staff member not only recommended a place, but called the spa for me to make the appointment. Great service from the start. The valet service is reasonable and the staff is friendly. If you have a rental car and a morning flight, you should definitely return your car the night before and take the shuttle to the airport. Very convenient. Things you should know: Because of all the positive and because they also served fresh lox, I can overlook the continental breakfast (I pretty much dined on salmon during my whole trip), but I've had better complimentary (and hot) breakfasts at other hotels. While comfortable for one person, the room was small. Like one other review stated, there is no room for dining in the standard room, but I never used room service or the restaurant for dinner so that wasn't a problem for me. Also, the restaurant only takes reservations for dinner, but I was out during most of my stay so that also didn't bother me. If you have a rental car, it is close to plenty of dining options and other useful attractions. Otherwise, you will likely have to dine in or call a taxi. I booked this place based completely on recent Tripadvisor reviews. I needed a place close to the airport for my last night in Seattle and originally booked a lower rated chain hotel. My plans changed and I needed more nights and figured I might as well look for something nicer and enjoy my stay. I'm very happy with this choice! It was the perfect ending to my time in the Seattle area and close to the attractions I visited on my last couple of days.

We actually live in Seattle and took the rare opportunity to spend a night away from our small children to recharge and get a good night of sleep. While the Cedarbrook Lodge caters in large part to those flying in our out of SEA, I do feel justified reviewing it for our purpose, as the Lodge advertises \"romance\" packages. Our room, containing a queen sized bed, was very nice. A bit small, but not unreasonably so. It was very clean, and the pillows we had ordered from the Lodge's pillow menu were waiting for us in our room upon our arrival. I don't know if the rooms or the Lodge on the whole have been specifically soundproofed, but I don't recall ever hearing an airplane, even though we were practically on the grounds of SEA. My wife particularly enjoyed lounging in the chair in the room, as it was quite comfortable. The soaking tub was a welcome benefit of the room, and the water was VERY hot. We had adequate hangers, and the television worked well. The Cedarbrook's web site indicates that the room has an alarm clock with a connection for Apple mobile devices; our room did not have such an alarm clock. Rather, we had a clock with a connection that fit into the headphone port of our iPhones, which played music nicely (thank you, Pandora) through the system. I bring this up solely because we only brought one iPhone charger with us for two iPhones, anticipating that we would be able to charge one of the phones through the alarm clock Apple connection. Of course, this is a small point, but a point nonetheless. The living room in the corridor leading to our room, containing an endless supply of Talking Rain (still) water, yogurt, cheese sticks and ice cream, was very nice. It would have been great if the refrigerators had also contained Talking Rain sparkling water, but we appreciated the opportunity to choose from the various chocolate covered malted milk balls and other treats. We did visit the Cedarbrook's fitness center which, like everywhere else in the Lodge, was exceptionally clean and in very good condition. The machines were very nice, and two televisions are mounted high on the wall with volume loud enough to generally be heard over the noise of the various machines. There were also rest rooms and lockers available. Sadly, no pool or sauna, but one can dream. . . The Marketplace, advertised on the Cedarbrook's web site as being adjacent to the reception desk, is small, but as we were checking in, my wife immediately gravitated to it and found a few items (a scarf and a pair of gloves with smart phone sensitive finger tips) that she loved. No we didn't purchase them, but the Marketplace is a nice touch. We did not visit the bar, but it looked nice. We did dine in the Copperleaf restaurant, as we'd read the reviews and were excited to visit another Seattle area restaurant that would wow us. Unfortunately, we just didn't find the food to be as good as anticipated. The setting for the restaurant is lovely and a wonderful repurposed use of the space from the former conference center that the Cedarbrook once was. But, the food underwhelmed us. It was good; it just wasn't great. The negronis we ordered ware very good. The service from our waiter, as from everybody else at the Cedarbrook Lodge, was top notch. I think next time we will stick with the bar menu, as the burger seems to get rave reviews. The complimentary continental breakfast was nice, and definitely a step up from complimentary breakfasts served at most hotels. The server was having a bit of a difficult time keeping up with the demand for food, as during the twenty minutes we ware eating we witnessed a number of items running low or out for a number of minutes before being replenished. But, I can't recall ever experiencing a complimentary continental breakfast in the United States that contained unlimited salmon. Nice touch. The value we received for what we paid was very, very good. The Cedarbook Lodge is a fantastic deal and provided a great respite from our crazy kids for a lovely evening. If one needs a hotel at SEA, it would be just plain silly to stay anywhere else. And, I can say that we, too, will likely return the next time we can convince a friend to stay with our little ones. I just suspect we won't be dining at the Copperleaf. Finally, I should say that I went into this stay at the Cedarbook Lodge with a preconceived ideal from the McDonald's Lodge in Oak Brook, Illinois, where I've stayed many, many times when doing consulting work for McDonald's Corporation. Don't laugh, but it is truly a remarkable hotel, with restful, tastefully decorated quiet rooms and a fantastic restaurant (yes, really). It, too, was designed with a corporate mentality (as the Cedarbrook was formerly the WAMU conference center), and I think it is still my ideal for this type of lodging. Of course, it's half way across the country from our home and not nearly as convenient for a quick night away, so I think we'll be sticking with the Cedarbrook Lodge!", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cComplete satisfaction\u201d", "Author": "J N", "ReviewID": "UR126337562", "Content": "A beautiful property with a great experience.

It's a nice hotel, but I think the praise lavished on it might be a bit excessive. The rooms are nice, clean, maybe a bit small, and the bathroom is on the basic side of things. My shower curtain smelled a slightly mildewy, and both the sink faucet and tub faucet were difficult to get to the right temperature and pressure settings - for example, when I turned on the sink faucet, it would start spraying wildly and then I would try to turn it down and it would be a small trickle, and then the smallest nudge would make it spray again. You get the point. I'm just trying to show that these are the kind of fixtures you find at basic hotels - perfectly acceptable, but based on the reviews, you might expect more. And just to give you a sense of the level of the hotel, the only the toiletries in the bathroom are one bath soap, one bottle of lotion, and some bath salts - no shampoo, no conditioner. Again, it's not a big deal, but clearly this is not a high-end hotel. Certainly the grounds are nice, and the freebies in the \"living rooms\" are really nice - Hagen Dazs ice cream, malted milk balls, string cheese, etc. The breakfast is fine, nothing special, but it's very nice that it's free. Most of all, I just want to say that despite all of the reviews, let's be clear: this place feels like a conference center. If you were here just for a conference, you would not be disappointed.

We\u2019d eaten at the Copperleaf Restaurant in the Lodge several times and had been impressed, both with the food and service in the restaurant and by the beautiful property itself, so we decided to look into the cost of a room. We were pleasantly surprised that the Cedarbrook Lodge is very competitively priced. And because a day lifting boxes full of our prized possessions had left us tired and sore, the over-sized soaking tub clinched it for us. This beautiful property was built in 2002 as Washington Mutual\u2019s conference center. It became a hotel following WaMu\u2019s acquisition by JPMorganChase. A desk clerk told us the Chase folks, being East Coast types, had no interest in keeping such a property so far away, so it was reincarnated as a hotel as September 2009. And I\u2019m ecstatic! Our guest room, a Deluxe Queen, was not particularly large at 276 square feet, but was very well laid out. Ten-foot ceilings made the room feel more spacious. In addition to the usual retinue of amenities, rooms have very large desks that provide plenty of space for working (if you\u2019re so inclined). The queen bed in our room was flanked by a chair and ottoman that made for more comfortable TV watching than sitting up in bed. Bathrooms all have over-sized soaking tubs that were so exquisite my wife is already talking about adding one to our new home. (Despite the favorable room rate, our stay may have turned out to be quite expensive after all!) Amenities are by Green from Nat\u00fcra, a line of soaps and shampoos I first encountered at the Hotel Avalon in Portland. They\u2019re designed to minimize the impact on the environment, including the inevitable waste caused by the short-term, single-use nature of hotel soaps. Because we were too tired to change into nicer clothes and trundle to the restaurant, we had room service bring dinner to us. We shared a Market Greens salad, Alaskan Black Cod fish & chips, and fromage blanc for dessert, along with some well-deserved Pinot Gris. All items were well prepared and delivered quickly. Those who are inclined to wander from their rooms have a variety of options. The bar is equipped with a pool table, there is a fitness center, and the grounds themselves have numerous walking paths.

I travel for business 100 days a year and this property is one of my favorites. I am one of those guys who write letters to the management if I have a problem with a hotel.

I stayed at the Cedarbrook last Summer for 7 nights and am now just finishing up a 8 night stay for a training at a Criminal Justice academy nearby. Why such emotions you ask? Well - it is just blocks from the airport and a mile from the freeway, but you would never know it. I feel like I am in the woods as it is tucked into effective landscaping. The architecture is attractive and rustic. The standard rooms are large and comfortable with big bathrooms and huge tubs. The included breakfast is simple, but fresh and of good quality. Each building in the hotel has a nice little lounge with a fridge full of water, yogurts, string cheese and ice cream. Yep, you read that right. AND there are bins with chocolates for you to enjoy anytime you like. The room service is fast and reasonable, and the food is terrific. Every employee I have come in contact with in my 16 nights here this year has been helpful and pleasant - every single one.

Bottom line, if there were one of these in every city in America I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Downside?

After hearing such rave reviews from them, we decided to try it ourselves. I tried to book a studio suite over a month before our stay and everything was booked. So, I booked a regular room. I kept checking back and nothing was available. The day of our stay, I checked and, lo and behold, studio suites are available. I called to change my reservation to a studio suite (which at the AAA rate should have been another $30). The front desk told me it would be a flat $50 fee-no exceptions. So, you block out all these suites; open them the day I am arriving; offer them at a AAA rate; but tell me since I already booked a regular room that I have to pay a flat fee to upgrade? How does that make me want to keep referring people; put up family & friends or personally come back and I haven't even checked in yet? You're not even full that night... Ok...Now we pull up in front to check in at registration. Most parking is coned off so you have to either park hither and yon in self-park ($12 per night) and walk to registration or use valet parking ($15 per night + gratuity) to get out of your vehicle at registration. Being disabled, I asked where the disability parking was located. Valet pointed to 2 spots. I said thanks and started to pull away. He stopped me and said \"whoa, you can't park there! Those are reserved valet spots\". What?!? So, there is no choice for parking if you are disabled? We discovered later that there are other spots in self park, but they are so far away (2 buildings) that it would be impossible to negotiate that distance. Management really needs to make some sort of allowance and designate those two close disability spots as self park. The valet was so rudely insistent that we get out there that I was absolutely shocked. We checked in without a problem and our room was absolutely spotless and wonderful! Bed was great, room was very comfortable for a basic room. Would love a bigger room next time if I come back. As for amenities, all the friends and family have always raved about the \"Living Room\" at Cedarbrook. Here's the website description: \"Each 500+ square foot residential oasis features a vaulted ceiling, stone-encased gas fireplace, wall of floor-to-ceiling working windows, original artwork, 26\" Panasonic flat screen stereo TV with DVD/VHS player, comfy sofa, multiple lounge chairs with ottomans (corduroy or leather, you pick) and shelves of 'library' books. Among refreshment items available daily are bottled waters, individual yogurts, string cheese, ice cream bars and a variety of gourmet malted milk balls, a signature of Cedarbrook Lodge. \" Lovely, except there was no string cheese anywhere to be found and all the chips & ice cream they usually have out had been cleaned out by convention people. There is ALWAYS string cheese. Some of us don't want sugar-can't have sugar. Called the front desk. \"If there's no chips or string cheese, then we're out.\" But isn't that part of what you advertise? \"Don't you restock?\" \"Ma'am, whatever is there is what we have left and you'll just have to choose from that.\" Hey, listen, I'm not trying to be picky, but for what you advertised, from what I know from the 20+ friends and family I have hosted here-there are supposed to be some other selections. Could you just be nicer when I call and inquire? Dinner was absolutely lovely (see my other review of the Copperleaf Restaurant). Overall, this is a wonderful property. However, some of the staff are quite young. Our observation of them, not only with us but with other guests, at the desk found that they had a tendency to be abrupt and a tad condescending. Perhaps they thought they were being professional, it came across as cold and dismissing. If management can warm up the hotel staff and they match the professionalism of the staff of the restaurant-I'll be back. I'm hoping it was just an off night for this place.

The front desk staff could not have been more accommodating - special thanks to Alice & David, rightfully proud of their hotel, who saw to our getting to and from the light rail station several times during our stay without our own car. They also gave us excellent advice for our time there. Because of their help, we were able to be happy tourists despite being perhaps 15 miles from the heart of Seattle.

It is a beautiful hotel with immaculate surroundings and attentive staff. My room was comfortable and clean. Recycling is a priority in this hotel, which is noticed from the toiletries offered by Green Natura, eco friendly utensils and eating ware at the breakfast buffet, and recycling bins in common areas and each Lodge's Living Room. While complimentary shuttle service to and from the Sea-Tac airport is convenient, I would prefer that the shuttle service to the airport be made more frequently than once every 30 minutes, especially since they are so close to the airport, but perhaps they have a good reason for this. Complimentary snacks in each lodge's Living Room was a delightful surprise. I was thrilled with the idea of unlimited bottled water and string cheese. My companions were even more delighted with the personal servings of Haagen Daz ice cream, chips and several jars of chocolate candies. As a person who limits their carbohydrate consumption, replacing one of the jars of candies with a jar of nuts, would have been the icing on the cake for me. At the complimentary breakfast buffet, I was thrilled to see hard-cooked eggs and smoked salmon, two beautiful protein choices. A seasonal raw vegetable, or two, sliced thin would have been more to my liking, given my dietary restrictions, but I consoled myself on fabulous, fresh fruit. Despite, my fussy food requirements, I look forward to the time I can spend another night (or two!) at the Cedarbrook Lodge in Seattle.

The restaurant was full for the night, and since we were tired, we decided to just eat at the bar. Our server was attentive and helpful with food and beer suggestions. The crabcake sandwich was excellent, mostly crab and very little filler. As it should be! We also had an Heirloom tomato salad that was small, but very flavorful. The beer list was very good. We wandered around the grounds in the rain, made much more comfortable by the umbrellas at every door! They have Haagen Dazs ice cream in the lounge for guests, a nice little touch. The rooms are huge and unbelievable comfortable. The decor is as Pacific Northwest as it gets. Complimentary continental breakfast in the morning was fantastic. Again, only top notch food: smoked salmon for the bagels, and lots of toppings for fresh oatmeal. The grounds are beautiful. The only drawback to the location of the hotel is the distance into Seattle itself. It is very convenient to Sea-Tac, but a long ride into the city.

Initially we couldn't decide whether to stay in town or elsewhere. Checked out Trip Advisor for options. Looked at Inn on the Market. However they only had city view rooms available and a bit pricier than other options. We managed to get a discounted price on the Cedarbrook through Hotels.com. Cedarbrook it easy to get to, just off the I5 and close to the Airport. Place looks great not the standard airport hotel. Set in trees and nice grounds. Reception was very good, quick and easy. Booked the restaurant on arrival. Room was very good. Very clean, bright, comfortable with a view over the gardens. Had a nice feel to it. Bathroom was a very good size with large bath, in fact this was the first time I've had a bath in years. There was no fridge or minibar however there was a lounge area where you could get free water, yogurts, chocolate and Haagen Das Ice Cream!! Restaurant was a bit pricey but we enjoyed our meal and the staff were very attentive. A little bit Nouveau Cuisine for my liking but very tasty. I had the Salmon and my wife had lamb. Overall a worthwhile experience. I would recommend at least one visit to the restaurant on your visit. For those on a budget there are cheaper options in the bar. Burgers etc. Breakfast was good quality, usual US fare except the fancy tea bags and the smoked Salmon. That was nice. They charge for parking, $12 per night for self parking and a bit more for valet parking. I felt they shouldn't be charging for parking however we got such a good rate on the room I didn't begrudge paying a few dollars for this. Most people will arrive depart using the shuttle anyway. The shuttle was available to take guests to the airport. We used it to go to the light rail station and then into town. Light Rail is the way to go. Day pass was just over $5. We had a walk through the grounds, there is a kitchen garden where the chef can get his veg and herbs. There is a business centre where I printed out our boarding cards for the flight home.

The snacks available 24/7 that everyone refers to were great fun, and I ate too many 'chocolate malt balls'.

GREAT FRUIT, granola, and oatmeal with toppings galore ... a real treat. And smoked salmon! It is served in a gorgeous dining room (so unlike many other hotels), with large round tables and floor to ceiling windows to the beautiful grounds.

I picked this hotel over less expensive airport hotels because of the reviews which talked about the beautiful grounds. Well, they are beautiful but we were essentially not allowed to use them the afternoon/evening we were there as they were rented out to a wedding. As this was the whole point of choosing this hotel, I felt I certainly did not get my money's worth. It is a beautiful setting although the hotel rooms themselves are starting to become dated- arm chair in the room stained, tear in the blanket etc. Additionally, perhaps due to the wedding, we were put in an wheelchair accessible room. This meant we did not have a bathtub and the shower was only a hand held. As is usually the case, hand held showers give much less pressure. The shower was also a roll in with a shower curtain that did not reach the floor. As a result, it is very easy to end up with water all over the floor, especially if you have children. Not very relaxing after 15 hours on airplanes. Over all I felt as though we were not valued as clients. The benefits went to the wedding party. If that is the hotel's priority, fine, but they need to tell potential guests that parts of the facilities will be off limits and they may end up with a room with poor bathroom facilities. I did ask to speak to a manager right away only to be told that none is available on weekends.

That would be pretty fantastic, if true... especially at what I consider to be reasonable rates. Nothing against Cedarbrook Lodge, but there's no way it's in the top 20 in the world. (Probably more of a flaw with the Trip Advisor rating system than the hotel.) The hotel is certainly unique... definitely not your run of the mill chain. It has a nice rustic, northwest motif. As others have pointed out, Cedarbrook Lodge has lots of unusual amenities like 24/7 malted milk balls, chips, ice cream, etc., in the lobby area of each building (to go along with comfortable chairs, a fireplace, and a flat screen TV.) The grounds are nicely maintained and they have a gourmet restaurant where I enjoyed a very pleasant dinner outside on the patio (the pan seared halibut was excellent). Peter, my waiter, was attentive and friendly, even though I was a lone diner in the midst of several other busier tables. One problem... after ordering dessert, the maitre d' reported back that the chef would be unable to prepare it (the coconut sorbet) unless I could wait 30 minutes or so. I probably didn't need it anyway. Here's what Cedarbrook Lodge would need to do to get in my top tier: have a bellman meet me at the front door and offer to help with luggage. The first people I encountered were behind the front desk (and it was only 6:30 PM or so). The front desk clerks need to smile and be friendlier. The young man was friendly enough, but I felt like I was imposing on the young woman. Maybe they were trainees??? The early morning front desk clerk (and shuttle driver) was fine... competent and friendly. Ice for the rooms is provided in plastic bags in a freezer in the lobby, but unfortunately, each bag was frozen in a hard chunk, and I didn't think the people downstairs would appreciate me breaking it apart on their ceiling! Some of the wood surfaces in the rooms are starting to show their age - water marks, etc. In my opinion Cedarbrook Lodge is OK... perhaps very good... just not a five star hotel (or in the top twenty worldwide).", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "LMarieF", "ReviewID": "UR117255676", "Content": "We had a one night stay at the Cedarbrook Lodge and wish all hotels could be as warm and welcoming.

After approaching the counter the gentleman was courteous and checked us in. We proceeded to check in however no bell hop was available so we proceeded to push the luggage cart to the other end of the property to our room. The room: We booked s suite through AAA.

The extra room did big add any usable space at all and from looking into the regular rooms they were a much better value and we liked them more. Room service: Food was pretty standard. Ordered a crab sandwich and the bread was soggy. My new wife ordered a chicken sandwhich and it was very good. The fire alarm: We were awoken at 3 am by the fire alarm going off in our building. Staff was clueless and totally unavailable. The fire trucks showed up and they proceeded to search the building with no fire found. The next issue was the alarm. The fire men were unable to disable it fully but they disabled the alarm sound at approx 4:15. The blinking stove light in our room however proceeded to blink every second until approx 6 am. At no time during this ordeal was any staff member available for questions nor did they let us know what was going on.

The free shuttle service takes you to and from the airport or light rail promptly. Breakfast is good and the restaurant is excellent but a little pricey. The staff was also very pleasant. If I need to travel to the Seattle airport area or plan to divide time between Seattle, Tacoma, and Olympia, this would be the only place I would stay. On the other hand, if I was planning to be in downtown Seattle for the entire trip I would likely stay somewhere more convenient despite the fact this would be a better hotel.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "replay49", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but would not recommend for a business meeting\u201d", "Author": "replay49", "ReviewID": "UR116127927", "Content": "We recently hosted a small (11 person) 6 hour business meeting here. The facility is beautiful and well appointed, but the staff does not appear to be geared to handle business meetings, either that or they just subscribe to poor customer service, I don\u2019t know which. The package we purchased included continental breakfast, box lunch, and afternoon snack as well as coffee and soda throughout the meeting. The cost per person, including their mandatory 21% \u201cservice charge\u201d, was $101.64 before taxes. When we arrived in the room, there was, as planned, coffee and tea, plus a tray of cold bagels a small batch of muffins about the size of a mini-cupcake as well as a bowl of apples, oranges and pears. The fruit was not sliced nor were there utensils provided. There was no way to toast the bagels, however there were small packets of cream cheese. This is what they advertised as a continental breakfast. After our meeting started, so did the gardeners outside the room. For a good part of the morning portion of the meeting, we were competing with a gardener who had a complete arsenal of power tools, including a mower, edger, and blower. There was no apparent consideration for keeping the noise down during our meeting. Lunch was supposed to arrive at Noon, but it was delivered a half hour early, interrupting our meeting. Rather than have the servers disrupt us further, we asked them to leave the box lunches on the carts on which they were brought and we would serve ourselves later. This apparently caused much confusion for the staff, because they took it to mean we wanted no further interruptions and therefore did not deliver the afternoon snack, which was included in the price per person. Not once during our stay did anyone from the sales or catering departments stop by to see if we needed anything. When a couple of days after the meeting we complained about the service, the noise, and the non-existent afternoon break, we were treated in an unprofessional manner, laying the blame on us for not complaining at the time. I should point out that the meeting was in a building quite a ways from the front desk. In order to complain, we would have to leave the meeting, hike to the front desk, wait for someone to speak to from sales or catering, and hike back to the meeting. For the amount of money we spent on this relatively short meeting, we should expect better from a luxury hotel. To add insult to injury, when we finally received a copy of our bill (it had been charged to our credit card) we discovered they overcharged us by $250. It took over one month to receive the refund.

The Lodge is a little oasis just minutes from the busy SeaTac area and AirLink station.

Large bathroom and soaking tub/shower with nice toiletries, large sink counter, comfy non-bulky robe, magnifying mirror and full-length mirror. 2. Sizeable Fitness Center with good quality treadmills, ellipticals, weight machines, free weights and nice view of the lush property. 3. Free Computer terminals and printers in main building. 4. Free Shuttle to Seatac Airport or Airlink station and free parking. 5. Comfortable Bed and easy chair in room. Bright room with huge windows. 6. In-room coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee and half and half creamer. 7. Plentiful healthy continental breakfast. This is a full breakfast to last you for hours. 8. Snacks and beverages on every floor. Lots of fun choices. 9. Quiet and restful. Nice walking paths to take a stroll on the pretty grounds. 10. Felt safe as a female solo traveler. 11. AAA discount + free full breakfast and snacks + free parking/shuttle = Good value versus similar caliber downtown and nearby hotels. This is not an airport budget hotel. Cons: The Lodge may remind you of a corporate conference center. It was owned by the defunct WAMU bank. Only restaurant available is the onsite restaurant and bar, so you are limited if you stay on the property. The Deluxe Queen room may be on the smaller side but it is large enough to walk around. Could use a folding luggage rack in room versus the available bench. Beware of the non-refundable 2-day cancellation policy. Room Location Tip: Per the bellman, the third (top) floor tends to be quieter because the property prefers children be on lower floors because the children might fall out the top floor guest room windows.

These things alone would probably warrant a five star review and the \"living room\" stocked with free snacks was just icing on the cake. I have read through the reviews and though most people love this place I've noticed that a big problem for those who don't is the location and I would like to touch on this. We were on our way South on a road trip, this hotel felt very remote and I would have never seen it driving along the interstate and yet it's less than five minutes off the Interstate. As much as I loved this hotel I can't imagine staying here without a car, it's only a ten or 15 minute drive to downtown and the parking is free so it's a great base for touring Seattle by vehicle but I wouldn't try relying on their shuttle and transit it's simply too remote a location. Now that I've gotten that out of the way let's move on to the good stuff: As I mentioned the location is gorgeous. The hotel is located next to extensive wooded wetlands and they have some short paths you can stroll along as well as some pretty ponds. Our room had a nice view of the wetlands, two queen beds and a really comfortable full size chair and ottoman. The bathroom had a soaker tub and a separate shower which was really nice not to mention really comfy bathrobes. A short elevator ride was the common area they call the living room there was a fridge stocked with bottled water, yogurt and cheese strings and a freezer full of individual Hagen Daz Ice creams. There was also fresh fruit, potato chips and the yummiest malt balls on offer. This was a unique and much appreciated amenity, it was like having a mini bar without the ridiculous prices, or any price did I mention it was all free? Breakfast was not extensive but was high quality and tasty. There was homemade granola, bagels with smoked salmon and a few other items I don't recall it too was included in the price of the room. We didn't have drinks in the lounge or eat dinner in the restaurant but both looked pleasant and we probably would have it we weren't traveling with our kids.

I asked to speak to the manager only to be told the manager was not available. I asked if she knew the phone was not working, she said yes she did her manager called her on cell to let her know.

The most important thing I have to say about our stay was how incredible this hotel is for the money. When you get to the hotel you can't believe you are just 5 minutes from the airport. The staff was very nice and helpful, especially Michael, he really gave us some good tips. This was our first trip to Seattle but would go back in a heartbeat if given the chance and would stay here everytime. Like others have said, it really is the look and the little extras that make this hotel so great. I would have given it a full 5 rating but had to hold back because I really feel they should put in a hot tub. The breakfast was good but in my opinion could use a little more variety, even if it was some eggo waffles you could pop in the toaster. Those two things are the only negative things I could come up with. The restuarant is upscale and pricey and the food is wonderful. I had the lamb and it was great. I would recommend ordering from the lounge, especially the burger and fries, they are well worth the money. They have a shuttle that will take you to the airport and the literail station by the airport which is what we did every day to get into the city. The train is $5.50 a person for an all day pass and you can walk to anywhere you would want to visit in the city, it is about a 30-40 minute ride from SeaTac to the Westlake Center which is the last stop on either end. When you are getting back to the SeaTac station just call the front desk and the shuttle will come back and pick you up.

Here are the good points: Close to airport, tucked away in a residential neighborhood. Gorgeous, restful environment Free snacks Nice staff I didn't use it but the Fitness Center looked very nice. Now for the negatives: We dropped our rental car off at the airport and called for a shuttle ride from the airport kiosk. The call just kept going to voice mail. \"We're sorry to have missed your call. Please leave a message.\" After deciding this wasn't a fluke and, indeed, there was no one answering the phone that day, I called the reservation number. We stayed on hold with her for about 10 minutes while she tried to call. Same answer. Or should I say, Same No Answer. Finally she advised us to walk down to the next island and try from there. Not sure why a different person would be manning the phone for each island, but it worked--we got to talk to a live person and requested a ride for 5 people. Our ride arrived within about 25 minutes. It was the hotel car (not a shuttle) and wasn't big enough for the 5 of us. Our five year old sat on a lap. I thought it was odd that a high rated \"airport hotel\" that advertises an airport shuttle, didn't seem to have their act together in this area. The rooms were beautiful but not very practical. The light was dim, not good for people who like to read at night. The tv was small and, surprisingly, not a flat screen. It was tucked away in a cabinet, on a swivel base, and seemed like an after-thought. There was no table in the room so room service had to be eaten at the desk. High points for aesthetics, low marks for usability. No pool. At this price point and with the beautiful grounds, our family was very surprised that there wasn't a pool. Indeed, there's not a lot here at all for families to do if you don't have a car. Except snack. The restaurant on-site is very expensive and the seating extremely limited (13 tables total). My husband and I enjoyed our meal there, but to take an entire family to dinner would cost a small fortune. Because this hotel is close to the airport and in a residential neighborhood, your options are seriously limited if you don't have a car. In short, I think this hotel is trying to cater to a certain type of traveler and I'm not sure exactly who that traveler is. I assume it's the business traveler on an expense account. I saw several people on their laptops sitting in the \"living rooms\" in each complex. It's very quiet and I can see how that would be appreciated by a business traveler. As for us, I don't think we'd stay there again. It was actually more expensive for us than our beautiful rooms at the Mayflower Park, and there just wasn't much to do once we got there.

Since it was my adult daughter & me (Even though I hadn't seen her in 6 months), I reluctanly agreed to the two rooms so as not to put out the family w/ small children.

No toiletries or coffe pot / coffee. Called the front desk to ask why no coffee / toiletries and what these rooms are used for because they are obviously not guest rooms.

They avoided my question and said they would send housekeeping over with coffee and etc. Again, no apology and treating me like I was putting them out. A housekeeping young man arrived with one coffee pot without a handle. Said it was the only one he could find and still had no coffee or toiletries. I asked him what these rooms were used for and he said they were really meeting rooms - not guest rooms. I went back to the front desk and said I was not told the rooms were meeting rooms and wanted the double room after all - it's what I had reserved and paid for. The front desk was extremely rude - especially the young man - and insisted they were no rooms - they were completely sold out. Once again, suddenly the girl at the desk said they had a double and would put me in that one. She then proceeded to scold me and said \"I gave you a choice and this is what YOU took.\" (??!!##) I had never been treated that way before and I was only wanting WHAT I RESERVED AND PAID FOR! There was NEVER an apology for the inconvenience they put ME through - they acted as if I was at fault.

I did complain and was not charged. Breakfast was lovely, bagels, toast, boiled eggs, muffins,fruit, yoghurt, smoked salmon, cereals, juice, tea and coffee, perfect start to the day. Great free Internet. The shuttle also goes to a Mall and the light Rail Station which made it very easy to go downtown.

We stayed for 5 days in a Seattle hotel very well-reviewed on this site. It was fabulous. But we had an early flight so we moved to Cedarbrook for the last day. I had read glowing reviews, so I thought it would be a good finish to our trip. I liked the photo of the studio with fireplace, so I reserved it. So far, so good. We arrived to the information from the desk clerk that there was no bellman to help my 75 year-old husband with the bags. Really? For a $235 room? We parked extremely far from our room because the lot was at the exact opposite end of the building from our room. Big pain for my husband. The room was large... very large and bare. One Murphy bed, two easy chairs and many, many built-in cabinets and drawers. I counted 24 cabinets and shelves. Wow! This could have been an apartment with great storage. But it was a hotel room with no luggage rack, nothing for the suitcase. The entry space into the room was 8x8 and bare, except for a vanity with no chair. Also, a small overhead light was not enough to make the vanity usable. I had a strong feeling that the room had had another, happier life. It was just too sparse that I feel sure no decorator planned for it to appear as it did. Too bad it was not completely refitted for a hotel room.The bath was 9 feet long with one little 12\" towel bar near the far end. Otherwise, bare wall.Very strange decor, but the bathtub itself was deep and lovely. I know this may sound picky, but we had just left a fabulous hotel for the same price, with bell hops, great service, fresh flowers. And great free wireless. Cedarbrook advertises free wireless, but not in our room. Nada. I called the front desk and was told that it didn't quite reach all the way to the end of the hall but I could walk to the desk with my laptop and turn it on there, get online and then walk back to my room and usually the wireless would keep working. I am not making this up! I never got a signal at all. The restaurant was beautiful and the food was great. We had dinner, no drinks and a bottle of wine for $175. Well it was good food and good service. We did not eat the continental breakfast included with the room because we had to spend that time hustling our bags back to the car. We travel frequently with no budget issues. But I know a good value for a great place, and Cedarbrook is not it. The hotel advertises as a great place for a conference or a wedding. This might be true. There are little living rooms in the middle of the halls with a frig filled with ice cream and other treats. Maybe this works well for togetherness for a large group. I would have preferred a little frig. in my own room, however.

My friend called me and told me to try to book a hotel in Seattle because she didn't think we'd be able to make the 25 minute drive to our home. Our nightmare vacation seemed to never end, and I had no way to book a hotel because we were boarding a flight. To my surprise the airline had wireless and I was able to find out that my friend called every airport hotel and they were all booked, except for one room at the Cedarbrook lodge, so she booked it. We arrived at 3 am and the shuttle managed to pick us up in spite of the frozen, unplowed road. We were exhausted and I didn't think I could bare one more night in a bad hotel, after the disappointing trip, but to my shock, this hotel was gorgeous. I honestly (and I'm being honest here) almost wish I had saved the thousands of dollars on the disgusting Mexico (5 star) resort and just checked in a few miles from home. I could have slept a week. We snacked on fresh fruit and ice cream before bed. The rooms were so clean you could eat off the floors, as if no one had ever stepped foot into them before that day. The sheets were crisp, soft, with a big cozy comforter and my young daughter kept asking me if this was our new home...to which I answered, \"yes\". We slept like babies and in the morning went to the lobby for breakfast which was included in the price, and it was the best buffet breakfast I had ever seen..and I've traveled plenty. Homemade granola, hard boiled eggs, fresh juices, delicious breads. I cannot imagine even the most discriminating of travelers being disappointed in any way. I couldn't find anything to complain about and frankly I didn't think there was such a thing when it came to travel. As I write this, I realize that perhaps I should have checked in at Cedarbrook instead of booking my next trip. At least I know it is there if when I return from my long travel, I need a weekend reprieve. The only downside to this hotel, might be that it is not located in the center of Seattle.

Having never been there, we relied on TripAdvisor reviews and were happy we did. We got a great AAA rate, which gave us three nights for the price of one, and a late checkout on our last day. However, we weren't aware there was also a complimentary upgrade to the next class of room until we actually made the reservations and got the confirmation letter where that detail was mentioned. Thus, we paid for the suite and could have paid for the smaller room and been upgraded to the suite for the same price. When we mentioned this at check-in, we were told there are only a limited number of suites and we may not have been able to get a suite if it had already been booked anyway - adding that there had been a number of inquiries into the suite. This was not a big deal, and on the plus side, they honored the credit for checked baggage where they reimburse you the cost of checked baggage (one bag for each (max two), for the flight to Seattle). The website said they would not credit the cost if combined with any other promotion (AAA), but they reimbursed us with no problem at all. I believe this promotion expires in March of this 2011. Without going into detail, we agree with the other positive reviews here....great service, comfy bed, free healthy breakfast (wonderful if you're not expecting bacon and pancakes), great view from our room, a wonderful clean gym that I want in my own home - with Life Fitness equipment and men's/women's bathroom with shower and towels and a great view while exercising. In the room, the TV is a little on the small and old side, but it worked just fine for us. Inside the room with the windows closed, we never heard any airport noise. I'm always about the bathroom, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a magnified make-up mirror, and the tub was huge (see pics). Our shuttle drivers picked us up from the airport, and shuttled us to the Lite Rail, which took us to downtown. Kudos to Tasha and Alice, who were both friendly, informative and warm. We found a few hairs and a mud smudge on the bathroom floor after housekeeping had cleaned, but we met the housekeeper and she was also warm, pleasant and friendly. A great, quiet and romantic stay at the Cedarbrook Lodge! Oh, and my brother and his wife stayed at the lodge as well.

Service was nothing to write home about, adequate. Their 'living room' with the free snacks was ok, malted milk balls, yogurt, cheese sticks, ice cream, some sad oranges. Nice, but not exceptional. Because I booked through Expedia, they did not reward the Stash Hotel points that I just signed up for. OK, I get that, but to book through them for the same room would have cost $40 more. Didn't seem worth it. Because we could not get a reservation into their rave restaurant, we decided to eat instead at the lounge. The food was good, not exceptional.

This is a gorgeous hotel, with beautiful landscaped property. We like to sleep with the window open, and heard some faint noise from planes, but otherwise you would never know this serene hotel is minutes from the airport. There is a free shuttle from the airport plus they will shuttle you to the large, nearby mall. The only thing negative thing I would want people to know is that if you have mobility issues, you may want to stay elsewhere; there is a fair bit of walking to get around the property. There is no one to handle luggage and it was a bit difficult to get our luggage from our car to our room as they only have one(!!!) luggage cart and getting it from the main building to our building was a bit of an adventure. We did speak to the manager on duty regarding getting a cart for all three buildings, which would be extremely helpful to travellers with luggage. The hotel consists of three separate buildings connected by pretty walkways with extensive and lush landscaping throughout. Service was excellent and always pleasant. There are separate lounges in each of the buildings where there is free: Haagen Dazs ice cream cups, fruit, local Tim's potato chips, the best chocolate malt balls I have ever tasted, chocolate covered raisins, yogurt and string cheese, plus local Talking Rain water. We stayed in a studio suite, which is extremely spacious for two with a murphy bed. The decor is light and airy and modern, as evidenced in the other areas of the hotel. Though we enjoyed our room, it seemed a bit \"office-ish\" and on the hotel website we noticed later that the bed is put up to turn the room into a conference room. Though comfortable, I would not recommend it for a romantic getaway. As another reviewer noted, the queen bed is probably not a full queen as it seemed slightly small to us, but was very comfortable and we had a great sleep. I also would have appreciated some bedside lighting -- there is none for those of you who like to read in bed. The bathroom was well-lit and the deep soaker tub most enjoyable; the shower had excellent shower pressure. Wifi was slow at times, but otherwise worked well. The restaurant has amazing local farm to table organic cusine on par with restaurants downtown. Even you've got a fairly long layover between flights, consider the short trip on their shuttle to have some great local Northwest food. Also, the continental breakfast is fairly extensive - bagels, smoked salmon, fruits and cereals and pastries -- you would be hard-pressed to find nothing to eat.

Each guest building has a lounge with a pantry with the much-discussed free snacks. Free parking and free wired and wireless internet in the room although my room got spotty wifi reception. I did not see many other guests so either the buildings absorb the activity really well or their occupancy is low. The guest room seemed a little small to me considering how spacious the rest of the facility is but it was well appointed, clean and modern. The bathroom in particular was nice--well lit and plenty of counter space. We had dinner in the restaurant. I found the quality excellent and would compare it to any standalone restaurant. Prices were reasonable and they participate in Restaurant Week so they had a $25 3-course menu that was great value. Service all-around in the hotel and restaurant was attentive.

Seattle's light rail goes to the airport from downtown, so theorectically, I could have taken the train into the city to meet up with my friends. The Cedarbrook will shuttle you over to the rail station. Everything about this hotel was awesome. The rooms, though small are very efficiently laid out so it didn't feel cramped. The bathroom was large and gorgeous. There was an elaborate selection of coffee and tea in the room. The staff was warm & friendly and totally exuded that Seattle sincerity I've missed since moving away. The Continental breakfast was fantastic - home baked goods, fresh smoked salmon, etc. They have an unattended snack bar in each of the buildings that's available 24 hours. The phrase snack bar actually cheapens the reality - there is a fridge full of yogurt, cheese sticks, ice cream cups, and bottled water. On the counter there was fresh fruit, bags of local potato chips, and glass jars of candy. This was unlike anything I have experienced in an American hotel. The gym was really big and posh with incredible wilderness views. The grounds were beautiful. As is typical in Seattle, it was drizzling the entire time so I didn't get to totally enjoy the outdoor spaces. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and bring friends.

After stumbling upon Cedarbrook Lodge (it did not previously show up in my searches) and seeing the reviews and photos, I just had to try this place for myself. Wow was I glad I changed 'hotels'. Well you can't really call this place a hotel, I'd call it more a retreat. The place is stunning, it's relaxing, it's class, it's got friendly down-to-earth helpful staff and the you would swear you're in some magical retreat in a hidden part of the world, yet only minutes away from SeaTac. You only hear the aeroplanes outside and even then they aren't that loud. While I normally try and go for more apartment style accommodation, the rooms were nice and cosy feeling. The bed was extremely comfortable and the deep bathtub a blessing. The living areas were great to be able to grab some water, yoghurt, ice-cream or nibbles 24x7. My only complaint here was lack of ice available to take back to the room to keep your water cold (which amazingly they did reply to upon submitting an online survey). The place should really be a 5 star resort in my view. It does have a health retreat kind of feel and peaceful, tranquil atmosphere and I would have loved to have had a spa and/or massage to top it off, sadly both are currently lacking. The shuttle service they provide is amazing. Not just to SeaTac and the Light Rail (a whole $5 return to downtown Seattle) but to the Southcenter Mall. We almost felt like we had a car waiting for us whenever we wanted to venture out. Upon returning from downtown 1 call from the station before and the cute Flex was already waiting for us. There really is no need to be downtown with their shuttle service and Seattle's light rail system (last stop is Westlake Center and the monorail is upstairs to take you to Seattle Center). If cruising, you could get a town car, or the light rail and a cab from downtown to the piers. The continental buffet breakfast was adequate, given I'm normally one that prefers a hot breakfast, in-room and the restaurant was a little steep for what you get, but no real complaints here. I have stayed at hundreds of places (normally 4-5 star) and I am a little fussy. This place is easily in my top 5.

We looked at this particular hotel initially because they were associated with the Rock-n-Roll marathon but we picked them for many other reasons. First, the pictures and the website are dead on. The place was beautiful! We stayed in a double queen bed room and it was huge. The set up of the room was perfect, with a long desk along the front wall. There were two closets, and built in cabinet where the TV was kept. Right next to the oversize windows, they had a lounge chair and table. The bathroom was large and very clean. I believe there are three different \"lodges\" and each building has an individual \"family room\" type area. While the individual rooms don't have refrigerators (which is something I normally need to have); you are encouraged to use the large one in this family room. And there are FREE snacks~~~ three different types of malt balls, string cheese, yogurt, and Hagen Diaz ice cream. I admit that we definitely helped ourselves to these on a daily basis. Our booking deal came with a credit to the restaurant, Copper Leaf. We liked the seasonal menu and came back both nights. I recently finished culinary school and was really impressed with the food we received. I especially liked the presentation of their butter with the sea salt sprinkled down the middle. I had the most tender and light gnocchi/ fava bean dish ever. Initially the price can seem steep but everything we had seemed to be very worth the price, except maybe the soup, which was tasty but nothing overly special. We ate outside both nights and really enjoyed the setting. Another bonus was that we could just add the bill to the room charges, no questions asked. Nice and convenient. We walked the grounds and found what looked like very well tended herb gardens. We also took a walk through the greenbelt that circles the property. Everything was quiet and peaceful. I was really surprised at how close we were to the airport but how little of the noise we heard. And I liked that we could see the planes take off from our room, like they were in our backyard! And let me not forget the staff! From the minute I called to ask questions about the hotel to the minute we left, we were impressed. Everyone was not only nice but KNOWLEDGEABLE! It was such a nice change to have a staff that seriously knew what was going on and could answer questions correctly. Helpful and courteous every step of the way.

The conference space is very professional and comes in a variety of options for space - from an auditorium to small \"dens\". The food is fantastic and there is lots of it. The new bistro resturant is in front of the fireplace and is a nice intimate place for dinner and features fresh northwest foods.

We were headed to Washington, D.C. from BC, and decided to stay overnight in Seattle at each end of the trip to reduce the jet-lag. Lodge is an appropriate term for this place, as it is not your typical hotel. Although within about 5 minutes of the airport, the setting amongst trees, creeks, etc., make you feel as though you are away from it all! The rooms were nice - clean, pleasant, with excellent free Wifi. The TVs were a bit old, and placed off to the end of the room (probably because this used to be the WaMu leadership center), but we didn't use them. A neat feature is that each building has a living room, with seating, TV, free snacks and water - everyone seemed pleased with this. Our first room's A/C wasn't working, but they moved us to another room. On our return trip, the shower drained slowly, so there were a couple maintenance issues, but no big deals. Staff was friendly and helpful, but the check-in process was quite slow and disorganized both times. The second time, they didn't have the room type we reserved, but they gave us two smaller rooms instead, which was fine. Accessibility could be an issue for some, as you may have to walk quite a bit to get to your building/room (it is a lodge, after all).

Cedarbrook Lodge offers awesome amenities including complimentary ice cream, yogurt, bottled water and more in a tranquil setting, you almost feel you are at home. Parking is free and the staff very accommodating. We took advantage of the Lodge's free shuttle service to the airport and hopped on the Link Light Rail ($5.00 each for a round trip fare) for a half hour trip to downtown Seattle for dinner. Way cheaper than a taxi fare and a more enjoyable ride.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradenton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWOW Beautiful Lodge\u201d", "Author": "Babydoll2000", "ReviewID": "UR63871492", "Content": "Close to the lite rail to get downtown, they drive you there and airport also.

The grounds are so pretty that they are used for weddings. You could tell that the property was well maintained. They provided a free shuttle from the SeaTac hotel and also volunteered to drive us to the monorail (about 10 min. away) so we could go to downtown Seattle. Also, the free buffet breakfast was outstanding. I hope we get the opportunity to visit again.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pearl City, HI", "Title": "\u201cA walk in the woods\u201d", "Author": "NaKoa", "ReviewID": "UR45594599", "Content": "After a late flight and later check-in, we awoke to an amazing view of cedar trees outside our floor to ceiling windows. We felt like we were literally in the middle of a forest, although we were all of 5 minutes from SeaTac Airport. If you like peace and quiet, this is the place for you. Previous reviewers told me what to expect, but I was surprised by the simple beauty of the hotel. The property surrounds a open beamed central building that houses meeting rooms, a soaring two story fireplace in the lobby, a side room with a pool table and bar and an onsite restaurant. Covered walkways lead you a few steps to side buildings holding the guest rooms. All rooms face either the wetlands or an interior view of beautifully landscaped trees, bushes and the occasional squirrel. The rooms are modern, glass, wood and chrome themed. Clean and obviously well cared for. The rooms are so quiet you are barely aware of other guests. A central lounge in each of the buildings holds a fireplace, tv, small library and a refrigerator stocked with all the free bottled water, yogurt, ice cream and string cheese you can drag to your room. Apothecary jars on a counter also hold pretzels, malt balls, chips, etc. Nice. A huge exercise room had every apparatus known from treadmills to ellipticals to free weights and squat racks. One of the nicer properties we've been to.", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cedarbrook Lodge", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d1199588-Reviews-Cedarbrook_Lodge-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$124 - $231*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">18525 36th Avenue South</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98188-4967</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515096", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2d/e7/73/the-setting-for-cedarbrook.jpg"}}
