{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Convenient location and amenities at a terrific price The Keio Presso Otemachi is well described by the previous two reviewers. Convenient to transportation lines, including the main JR station Tokyo. No need for taxis even when coming from the airport with jetlag. Very helpful desk staff, free internet in the lobby, small refrigerator and tea making facilities in the room, incredibly quiet. The croissants were better than many I have had in France. One thing: they served only coffee--no tea--at breakfast. Go figure.", "Date": "Jun 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR658897137", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "emilee_leblanc"}, {"Content": "I would recommend this hotel... I stayed 2 nights at this hotel. This is a business hotel and you can see a lot of Japanese businessmen staying there. It is close to the Japanese Bank. It takes around 5-6 minutes walk to Tokyo station and 2-3 minutes to Kanda station. The room is super clean, with all the amenities that you need. It also provides a pajama. The staffs are very polite and you can enjoy free internet access at the lobby. But of course, you shouldn't expect too much about the breakfast. In general, I would recomend this hotel. The rate is fair, location is good.", "Date": "Feb 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR620342243", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AliceYeung"}, {"Content": "Great Value I stayed here for two days when my favorite Toyoko Inn Tameike Sanno was fully booked. What a surprise. Small but super clean room with all amenities you need, polite and well-trained staffs, free internet access, a phone that you can make 3 min. free domestic calls, and AMAZING croissants for breakfast! (They make it fresh every morning. Japanese are obsessed with good food, so no wonder....) It's in a great location, too. I chose this one among four because it's in a quiet area and close to the Metro lines I often used. I am sure other locations are good, too.", "Date": "Dec 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR671920506", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "catsinbrooklyn"}, {"Content": "\u6dc7\u00b0\u4ed2\u9288\u5908\u5022\u9287\ue042\u4e9c\u9287\u6c47\u4efc\u9351\u6fc8\u5e9c   showReview(21211698, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR762729246", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "\u7f07\u5e9b\u5030\u59f9\u5098\u500e\u9288\u5b2a\u7e3e"}, {"Content": "\u93c8\u6fcb\ue5e4\u9287\u5098\u501e\u9287\u0444\u7278\u7039\u5908\u5153\u6e1a\u57ae\u57c4   showReview(19027807, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR781075951", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "\u9287\u5b28\u4edb\u95c0\u5cf0\u78f6"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d815109-r17381243-Keio_Presso_Inn_Otemachi-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "815109", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
