I know what superb service looks like--and this unpretentious and inexpensive little hotel in the shadow of Seattle's Space Needle has it in spades. My husband had to attend a conference and this was the only place that had room on short notice. I decided to hitch along but wasn't expecting much--I thought, \"Oh, here we go. Another eminently forgettable cookie-cutter hotel for middle managers on the road.\" This was anything but. The location in Belltown is terrific--easy walking distance to downtown Seattle and Pike Place Market; next door to the Space Needle and monorail; and close to some of Seattle's best new restaurants (try Black Bottle and Serious Pie. Yum.) From the moment we crossed the threshold--and we were pretty frazzled after a stressful drive down the I-5 in an unexpected snowstorm--we felt genuinely welcomed. And that attitude continued throughout our stay--the front desk staff made eye contact and greeted us warmly every single time we came within range. Our room (#811) was large, well-designed and tastefully decorated. A bar-fridge and coffeemaker is always a bonus. In fact, we joked that with the addition of a hot-plate, we could move right in and live there! I sleep with earplugs, so the traffic noise didn't bother me at night, but my husband remarked on it being the only downside of the place. The included breakfast was also unexpectedly good--the breakfast room is large and bright and the quality of the offerings--ham-and-eggers, fresh fruit, bagels, choice of juices etc.--sure beat the danish-wrapped-in-cellophane you usually get at these sort of business-friendly hotels. Because I hadn't booked the place, I made an extra effort to find out how much our room cost. I was staggered by how low the price was for what we got and even sought out the manager to tell him how impressed I was by everything we'd experienced and that I wish he would give lessons to every other hotel brand out there in how to do it right! We will definitely be back--and not just for business.

The Hyatt Place was a great location to walk to the Center and avoid the traffic and parking hassles in this busy, urban area. The Hyatt Place lobby and public spaces are very attractive and inviting. The front desk staff were friendly and accommodating. There are no bell staff, however, to help with luggage. There are luggage carts parked near the front door that you can use to cart your own bags to your room. There only seem to be two, however, and they disappear quickly on check out mornings. The hotel parking garage is pricey ($20 a day) and involves a complicated system of key cards and gates. But it beats paying to park near Seattle Center. The room was very attractive and included a refrigerator but no microwave. There was no in room safe. We had one King Bed that is separated from the sitting area. There was one large, HD television with state of the art AV connections if you have a portable DVD player. The wireless Internet was free and fairly fast. The bath room only had a shower. They only provided three towels for a family of four, so we had to stop at the front desk to ask for more. The shower also ran out of hot water with minutes the first night we were there. One of the reasons my wife selected the Hyatt was that it was one of the only ones in the downtown area that had a pool. The pool and exercise room are located on the main floor. The pool is fairly large, but shallow. It was three feet 10 inches at it's deepest end. It was also wasn't very warm although the front desk assured us that it was kept at 81 degrees. There is no hot tub/spa. The Hyatt does offer a free breakfast with breakfast sandwiches, cereals, pancakes, waffles, fresh fruit and yogurt. Be warned that it is a free for all on weekends and seating space can be a premium. Although the Hyatt is located near the Seattle Center, the restaurant choices located within walking distance are pretty limited. Five of the six listed on their Web site are actually out of business. So plan on driving if you want to have dining choices.

Everything about it. This was my second time there. Both times with my family. (2 kids 4 and 6 years old). Good service, the front desk called me in the first 30 minutes to make sure I liked my room. I also liked the security in the elevator where you need a room key to operate it. Breakfast is included and is sooo convenient, and if you have small kids you appreciate the variety and convenience. We took advantage of the complimentary shuttle bus which drove us to Pike Place Market and picked us up from Pacific Place Mall downtown. The hotel is short walking distance to the Pacific Science Museum, Space Needle and EMP. The Walgreen's across the street is convenient and the surrounding neighborhood has a variety of restaurants to choose from. Just ask the front desk to recommend something. If there is nothing you like within walking distance, they will recommend a place where the shuttle bus can take you. I didn't visit the pool this trip, but I did use the fitness gym on 2 occasions. The equipment is great, very modern and very clean. Even the gym towels they have there are very soft and of good quality.

The room had a good working desk & chair, excellent lighting, ample outlets and connections, good wireless and a huge TV. The bed is comfortable and they use pretty good linens for a hotel in this range. I also like the big sectional sofa. Unlike many hotels where you just have a yucky chair, the sofa is actually pretty inviting. Bathroom was the usual, nice shower, good amenities. Love that Hyatt always provides toothpaste. Much better amenity than a shower cap! Continental breakfast was ok, the usual stuff. Hyatt Place lets you order hot items from a computer kiosk. The quality of the eggs I ordered was pretty bad - overcooked with congealed cheese. Ew. (I complained and it was taken off my bill.) The free coffee was fine; I think you can order Starbucks, although in Seattle, why would you get it at a hotel. There is coffee everywhere. My one issue with this hotel is that it's pretty far from downtown and the neighborhood felt a little transitional. Hotel has a shuttle which will take you within a 1 mile radius which is a nice service. It is right across from the Space Needle (which I could see from my room, very cool!) so if you're there for vacation, this will not be a worry. All in all, a nice stay and a pleasant hotel.

PROS: *Location: Close to water front, downtown, Seattle Center. Also the hotel shuttle operates 24 hours a day and will take you within a 1 mile radius anywhere you want to go (which actually gives you lots of options if you don\u2019t want to walk, it\u2019s rainy, etc.). In the immediate area are grocery store, restaurants, drug store, etc. *Very clean property. *Staff was helpful. *Gym was not bad (small but new equipment and very clean). Wish they had a hot tub or spa as well since it\u2019s often cold and wet in Seattle. *Breakfast: Decent continental selection. Personally I would like if they would start earlier on weekdays (say 6am) but at least they have coffee out earlier so a plus there. Some Hyatt places I have been to offer one or two hot things complimentary (like an egg sandwich) but not all: this one does not but you can pay for hot food at a reasonable cost. *Parking \u2013 I think $15 is reasonable for the location and it\u2019s very secure and easy in/out. Just know the spaces are small so big SUVs will take some maneuvering to park. *Rooms: Very spacious for an in-city hotel and the separate sitting area is nice. Nice flat screen with lots of channels that can be turned towards sitting area or bed. Good work desk, big shower. I also have a few considerations for this (see section below) *Business Center: A couple pc\u2019s you can use and a printer for boarding passes, etc. No charge for that or the secure wireless internet in your room. CONS/CONSIDERATIONS: *Neighborhood: As in any big city, it\u2019s a mixed bag. Immediate area is fine (in fact revitalized) however, you can walk a couple blocks and it be in a more seedy area. *Noisy Location: Agree with other reviewers, you will hear traffic, party goers (in a nightlife and apartment area) so bring ear plugs if that bothers you. *Rooms: Kind of a strange layout (not a big deal just some personal preferences). Work desk does not have a way to look at the tv (not that I should watch tv when at desk but I like to). The mini fridge and drawers are by the work desk. Closet is very small and tight next to the sink and hard to squeeze your suit case in there but the plus is, it\u2019s a nice big space for a city room. *Climate Control: Wow, it is quite fancy and updated electronic unit and I figured mine out (with the instructions they provide and some trial and error) but I know several folks struggled with it. Sometimes I think simple can be better. BOTTOM LINE: I would possibly stay here again if wanting to be in the general downtown area. The price is reasonable compared to other hotels in the area of the same caliber.

Upon check in i asked for a room facing the Space Needle as I had read to do from the recommendations on trip advisor. The lady informed me that if i wanted to be on the space needle side i would have to pay $25 for an upgrade for anything on the fourth floor and up. A room was available on the second floor but she warned me the traffic noise from Denny Way might be audible as it was close to the corner. I asked for a free upgrade but she said that wasn't possible. From what i understood the only thing better about the rooms on the higher floors is that they were higher up and may have had a better view. In years and years of checking into hotels I've never had a hotel deny a free upgrade if a room was available. I said i would sign up for the rewards program etc but there was no changing her mind. The room was nice although you could hear some traffic noise. The rooms have a functional layout aside from the sink being outside of the bathroom area. Normally that wouldn't be a bad thing but the sink is at the foot of the bed so it is loud if someone else is sleeping. We found the room to be very large and the TV was a nice 42 inch flat screen. The shower unfortunately, was not clean and neither was the floor of the bathroom. Little curly hairs were all over the shower and bathroom floor. We reported this to the front desk and they said they could send someone to clean it but we decided we were too tired at that point to wait around for that to happen. The other downer about the room was the bed. The beds are very soft and if you are not used to that you will not sleep well. Both my girlfriend and i woke up feeling sore. The last thing which was more of an annoyance than anything was the bathroom door. It squeaked and creaked like crazy. It was SO LOUD it was almost funny. We told the front desk about it and they said they would have someone look at it but upon returning to our room a few hours later it still sounded like a rusty dungeon gate. It was halloween so didn't bother asking it again...it suited the time of year. The hotel offers a nice pool and work out gym but no hot tub our sauna. Continental breakfast is served free every morning but if you are not there for business you will probably miss it as we were told it's only available from 6 to 9am. If you are there to rest and relax like we were, you won't get to taste it. Food is available for sale in the lobby area but there is no room service. Thankfully there are some nice restaurants in the area. The hotel charges $15 dollars per night for parking and although it's not a bad price, it's not a great price either. Other hotels like the Holiday Inn a block away charge only $10 for the same type of underground parking. There are many cheaper parking options around the hotel all within a two block radius. In general the Hyatt Place Seattle is a nice hotel but a lot of little things started adding up.

I booked this hotel on price, recommendations and also the room style. The hotel was very neat and extremely clean. I found that this hotel is one of only a handful that has a fridge in the room. This comes in handy especially if you would like to keep some wine or fresh milk cold. We bought some cheese and wine from a winery tour, and as we had some left it was great to put it away for later. There was also a lounge area that was spacious and nice to relax in instead of having to sit just on the bed. The huge flat screen TV was also a bonus. I had requested a view of the Needle and I got just that - what a view at night! The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were just right and I slept very well. Loved the shower, huge shower head and nice hot water!! I enjoyed this hotel, nothing seemed to be a problem, the free 24 hour shuttle service was really good, as the main center of town was quite a walk. The shuttle drivers were very good, dropping you within a mile anywhere from the hotel. They even came to collect you later when you call them. Another bonus is the free internet access in your room and free local calls. This made it easy to book things for me as I did not have a mobile phone in the US. Breakfast was fine, fresh fruit and yoghurts, cereals, bagels, muffins and juices - all fresh. Coffee was available offered by the way of help yourself in the mornings and you could even take one with you. You could order a hot breakfast for a small fee if you wanted to. There was a small bar area where you could order a drink or a coffee and a samll selection of food and soft drinks that you could purchase. The staff were very attentive and polite, helping you with anything you required. I loved this hotel and would recommend it to all and also happy to stay there again.

The Hyatt delivers on what it offered: the rooms were clean and actually fairly spacious (the bed is sort of sectioned-off from a living area with TV and couch), though bathroom sink is outside the bathroom itself, which can be disruptive for a light sleeper when someone else uses the bathroom and washes their hands in the middle of the night. Some of the nice things the hotel had to offer were its continental breakfast - plenty of fruit, muffins, cereal, bagels, and (for an added cost) eggs. The breakfast room can get kind of crowded in the morning, though, so be sure to grab a seat early! One of the other nice things was the shuttle service that the hotel offered, which took us to and from various locations throughout Seattle. One drawback to our stay was that they were doing maintenance on their elevators so there were a few times that it took quite a while just to get up and down from our room as there was only one working elevator for the entire hotel. The bigger drawback, however, was that we had stayed for about 2 nights, then had 1 night in Vancouver, and then another 2 nights again in the Hyatt. We had no trouble with the hotel finding our reservation for the first two nights, but when we returned from Vancouver, they couldn't find our remaining 2 nights reservation and were fully booked. We had a lot of back and forth with the manager, who tried to show us his paperwork on how we'd only booked the first two nights, but luckily, we're organized people and had our own print outs of the confirmed second two night part of the reservation to show him. We'd booked through Expedia so the manager got on the phone with them (they, too, had their own confirmations on file for the two separate bookings). Essentially, the hotel had \"overrode\" our second two night reservation with our first two nights, and our back and forth with the manager added at least an hour to our already tired day (we had driven back down from Vancouver in the evening and all we'd wanted was to go to bed when we'd arrived). The reason this review gets 3 stars instead of 2 is because ultimately, the manager did the right thing and put us up in another hotel The Maxwell, AND they paid for it. It should also be noted that the Hyatt actually paid for TWO rooms, since our original reservation with them was one room for my sister and one room for my hubby and me. So, even though the process was fairly frustrating, we give the Hyatt credit for ultimately doing the right thing in the end.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "metro NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat value close to Space Needle\u201d", "Author": "canfindaname", "ReviewID": "UR117987343", "Content": "This hotel was a great location for walking around the Space Needle park area, but was pretty far from other hotels and shopping.

We wanted to stay close to the Space Needle, and at least one side of the hotel has a great view of the Space Needle from the upper floors. THE GOOD: -The hotel is relatively new, so everything is in tip top shape. The lobby and room were exceptionally clean and well put together. -The rooms are large, when compared to others. While technically not suites, they are set up in a \"suite-ish\" sort of way, with a partial divider separating the bed from the rest of the room (which contained couches and coffee table. -Hotel management was very good and very responsive. We had a slight snafu during check-in, but the front desk was very apologetic and made things right (obviously, it would've been better had the hotel not screwed up, but they quickly realized their error and went about fixing it). -Good (new) TV system that has tons of open ports to plug in your iPhone, computer, or what not (if you have the right connector - the hotel might have some for use or rent... I never asked). THE SO-SO: The hotel doesn't have a soul. It's very utilitarian; there is no ambiance, other than having a nice clean place. The room decor isn't ultra-modern, classical, themed, or anything, really. Rather, it's just... nice and clean. THE BAD: The hotel is kind of out on its own in an area just southeast of the Space Needle complex. It's a short walk to a pretty good Thai restaurant (nothing fancy, more of a lunch place, really), but there's not much in the immediate vicinity. It's a little bit longer of a walk into the downtown area where you have more options.

The room I had was better than average, however the mattress was on the thin side, and there is no microwave in the room which I thought was an oversight, instead you have to pay $9.90 for a sandwich in the lobby.

So I figured that since I had enough points to get the room, that it would pretty much be all taken care of. When I arrived, I was told that I couldn't check in to my 2 night stay without a credit card. Umm.. Ok. I never had to produce one before in the 20 or so years I've been going to hotels. I just ask them to turn off amenities to the room and be done with it. I get the staff members assurance that only $50 will be held. So I say ok. I'm then informed that parking is $15 per night. So that's $30. My partner went down and swiped the card for food. They said it didn't go through, but it did. So we are up to $50 now spent and $130 being held (That's right. They not only did a charge, but held the same amount). I then find out at checkout that $64 was then held on my account as the final bill. So right now, I have $244 and some change being held by the hotel. This has caused overdraft fees being applied to the account. What? I added an extra $50? I forgot to tell you. They hold $50 a night. When I checked out, I complained about the extra charges in food (being held against my account, but yet being part of the $64). The manager comes over and I think I'm finally going to get this cleared up. He rudely tells me that he needs to talk to me over to the side (talking to me like I stole something). We talk and not a word about how messed up this is. He said that since I had the points, I MUST know their policies and how they were bending over backwards for me. Yeah. Right. As of 2 days later, with 4 overdraft fees of $35 each, I now have paid (for a \"free room\") $204 and a total of $384 still being held. Thanks Hyatt. I wasn't a snob at all when it came to hotels. I can understand when things mess up. But to be treated so rudely by the manager and causing so much chaos with my account that I have now swore off hyatt hotels for good.

Check in was fast and efficient. One of the workers took the TONS of baggage to our rooms. Not only did he unload it, but he also took 5 minutes to tell us everything about our room. (Including how to work the heat/AC.) He was extremely nice. (We ended up giving him a $20 tip because of how great he was!!) ROOMS: Our king bed rooms were FABULOUS! They were very large with a large sofa, desk and chair. The area where the small refrigerator was had a granite counter top with coffee maker, tea, etc. The bathroom was very small and a little awkward when using the toilet facilities, but the shower was soooo roomy that I didn't care about the awkward set-up. The vanity was outside of the bathroom and large enough for 2 people to use at one time. The room was extremely clean. Nice t.v., VERY, VERY comfortable bed. We were on the 8th floor, so it was pretty quiet with an occasional siren or 2. BREAKFAST: The breakfast area put my kitchen to shame! There was plenty of delicious food (fruit, yogurt, cereal, oj, etc.) with the option of buying a hot breakfast if you wanted. Plenty of room to sit down and enjoy breakfast. Very clean and items were continuously stocked. FOOD BAR: One evening, we didn't feel like going to a restuarant to eat dinner, so we ate at the little \"bar\" they had by the front desk. We ordered hamburgers and breakfast items. We were shocked at the reasonable cost and thought for sure the food wouldn't be that tasty. We were stunned to discover that the food was made right there by the front desk staff and IT WAS QUITE GOOD. STAFF: This is an area where the hotel SHINES! Everyone here went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. We did not talk to one unhappy employee. The staff even took time to have personal conversations with us during our \"bar\" meal and the other guests who were there. No question went unanswered and always with a smile. FREE SHUTTLE: This is another HUGE plus for the hotel. They will take you anywhere within 1 mile of the hotel, which is very liberal. We were taken to the Space Needle and Pikes Market. We NEVER had to wait for the shuttle, even when we called from the Space Needle to be picked up. They were always there within minutes. The shuttle drivers were friendly and always went out of their way to answer questions. Marina in particular was AMAZING! She gave us FABULOUS tips on where to go and how to get there when we were dropped off. She was friendly and kind, going out of her way to accomodate us as much as possible. CHECK OUT: A breeze!

Congratulations!!! The hotel is new, the rooms are spacious, clean, modern and the staff extremely friendly. The hotel is close to the space needle and only a short walk or 2 minute ride on the monorail to downtown. The Wifi is fast and FREE... There is a Walgreen's opposite for all your necessities. You must use your room card after 10pm to access the hotel and must use it 24 hours a day to access the lifts to the rooms, this makes for a very safe environment. A continental breakfast is included in the rate and is of good quality. You are able to purchase hot breakfasts at the self serve screen in the dinning room. Coffee is free and in the lobby and dinning room. One evening we ordered a meal from the self serve screen, no problems and I must say the food was tasty, hot and great value for money. The only area of opportunity that was observed is that there is no compendiums in the room to advice you of what the hotel has to offer, I went down stays and was advised it's all on the TV. Maybe on check in they could advise this and advise about the breakfast times and Free 1 mile shuttle transport. We used the free transport and it was no hassle. There are no in room safes but you are able to leave important travel documents in the safe deposit boxes in the office. I have never stayed in a Hyatt Place prior to this and after my experience here I will most defiantly be using them. Congratulations to the Management and Staff on such a well run property. I will be back and will be recommending you to family, friends and business colleagues.

The staff was very courteous and helpful and they will let you store your bags in case you have a later flight out after checkout.

Upon check-in, we were greeted very warmly by the front desk staff. Shinobu was exceptionally courteous and attentive. She gave us a map of the area and information on how to use the hotel's free shuttle (but tip the drivers, please), the monorail, and the light rail system. Our room was located just off the elevator area, but we did not have any trouble with noise while we were sleeping. We had a clean, well-appointed room with 2 queen beds and a sofabed (used all three). The sofabed was a comfortable one. It was easy to adjust the temperature in the room. Hyatt Place has the right idea in designing a room that is both comfortable and user-friendly. Our only concern was that there were no treads in the bathtub and all three of us slipped in the shower. We ended up purchasing a bath mat from the Walgreen's across the street. Oh, yes, having the Walgreen's across the street was extremely helpful for getting those few items we forgot from home. The complimentary breakfast at this Hyatt Place was continental in nature... mostly starches. Fruit and yogurt were also available. There was also a self-serve kiosk where you could order a hot meal that would be ready within several minutes. Several spaces for seating were available in both the kitchen area and the lobby area. The location of the hotel was convenient enough. It's just a few city blocks to the Space Needle and the EMP. We made use of the hotel's shuttle to get as close to Pike Place market and the Washington State Ferry Terminal as possible. We took the monorail from the Space Needle to Westlake Station and then got on the light rail system to get to the Seattle Mariners game. Easy to navigate the public transportation we made use of.

The guest room has the usual Hyatt Place touch, which is efficient, very modern and spacious. However, the guestroom is probaby the smallest of any Hyatt Place I have visited, probably due to it's location being in downtown Seattle. The hotel shares the same building as residential condo, so you have to dedicated elevators which take you to the hotel floors. Rooms are clean and comfortable and if you are lucky, you will have an beautiful unobstructed view of the space needle (sans the neon Walgreens sign) which is just a few blocks away. I was here mostly on business, so didn't get a chance to walk the area but I am sure it's very convenient based on its location. The hotel has more than usual amount of lobby staff compared to a typical Hyatt, but service can be a hit and miss. There has been a few occasions, where I am standing in front of them, yet they couldn't break away from chatting and gossipping with coworkers. Once you get their attention, they are helpful... Breakfast is actually quite nice but can get nuts if there are a lot of guest staying in the hotel. They have the typical continental breakfast items of most Hyatt Place, but they also offer biscuit and sausage gravy, which is quite tasty. They are quite good for a standard Hyatt Place, but can be considered lacking compared to other hotels which offer hot items like breakfast meats and eggs (have to pay for that here). One time, I actually ordered the hot breakfast items, but it was a like 30 min wait from the kitchen. Had I known, I would have just ate the free cold stuff and went on my day. My biggest disappointment is the parking situation. It's an underground parking structure, shared with the residents of the building. There is an overnight parking charge of $15, which is very rare for Hyatt Place. The lot is not huge but very deep, it can be a seemly endless of spirals of going lower and lower into the basement floors. The spaces are tight for parking as well as maneuvering -- definitely have to be careful not to scrape up your car.

Some people complained about the light in the bathroom being dim, but again how long do you spend in there? :) They offered movies on demand. The complimentary breakfast was good if you just want to grab a quick snack before heading downtown. The location of the hotel is not exactly core downtown, but the monorail is 5 min from the hotel and it takes you directly downtown (near nordstorm) in 2 minutes. Also Hyatt offers complimentary shuttle - it runs 24 hours within 1 mile. We checked out the fitness center and it is top notch! They also have an indoor swimming pool but we did not try it out (I am not sure whether it is heated or not) The management team was very accommodating and allowed us to have a later check out so that we can get the most out of our day.

The rooms are spacious with a large seating area and a wall mounted flat screen television that can be swung to allow viewing from the bed. The bed is behind a partition which gives the illusion of a separated bed/living space even though it is technically still one room. Free wifi which I expect now in every hotel I stay in was indeed available and was pretty reliable. There was the typical desk and small coffee/fridge station available which is handy for storing snacks, water and in our case some nice PNW wines. The bathroom consisted of a sink and mirror in the bedroom with a separate toilet/shower room. I am not a big fan of this kind of layout as it makes the shower/WC seem very dark and claustrophobic to me, but it was clean. The walls do appear to be a bit thin. We did hear noise from an adjoining room and from the hallway, but nothing that lasted into the night or disturbed our sleep. We were also on one of the higher floors so we were not disturbed by any street noise. We tend to ask for higher rooms whenever we book hotels, view or no view, for that reason alone. The Space Needle is an easy walk away, we bought a pass that would allow us access the the viewing deck twice within a 24 hour period. This location allowed us to easily take advantage of seeing the view from the Needle in both daylight and at night (highly recommend, the city is beautiful at night). There is a continental breakfast available with a limited dining area or other grouped seating areas in the lobby, for extra $ there are some hot food choices. I personally am not a big fan of continental breakfasts or limited breakfast choices in the expanded menu (I like to choose how my eggs are cooked) but for those who want the convenience it is available. We chose to walk to CJ's Eatery a great breakfast place in Belltown on our way to explore the waterfront. We did a lot of walking while in town, Pike Place Market and the downtown shopping are a bit of a walk away, there is a shuttle service or you can walk a couple of blocks and take the monorail into downtown. A tip for the first time visitor, a great alternative to the harbour cruises is a return trip to Bainbridge Island, less than $7.00 per person for a walk-on return ferry ride with those amazing views of the city is a steal. The area around the hotel seemed safe enough, even when we walked around in the evening (dark) but like any city there are sketchy areas where you may not feel comfortable. Our only real issue was the size of the hotel parking spaces. The parking is underground and shared with another building (you must look for the spots designated as hotel spots on each level) and the spots are VERY narrow. We were driving a mid-sized car and even parking that when the lot was fuller could be a challenge. We saw many SUVs taking up more than one spot in the parking lot or dangerously close to a concrete pole and the car next to it.

This property is fairly new, but with all its apparent problems I wonder how long it will remain open.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Washington", "Title": "\u201cExpensive and small room.\u201d", "Author": "travel201017", "ReviewID": "UR72778408", "Content": "As a retired Travel agent who has stayed in hotels all overy the world, I'd say the hotel itself is nice, the view & location to Space Needle very nice and close. However, the indoor pool was COLD, dark and stuff was floating on the bottom of it-dirty. The rooms were small, the bathroom lighting was very poor-dark and the bathroom door barely cleared the bed when opened. This hotel just opened this summer and has some quirks for sure. One of the elevators was broke, the a.m. breakfast was chaotic, no clean plates, silverware, or tables. Had to ask for them. Then paid cash upon check out for the room and parking, then to find out that they charged my card the same day for the $10 parking!! I had to call the hotel to have the charge taken off. So be careful of being double-charged!!! Not a very family friendly hotel.

Stayed at a Hyatt Place in Boise recently and had a great stay. This Seattle stay was one of my few significant Hyatt disappointments. Part of the problem is the location: it is apparently a hot spot for large family gatherings headed to the Seattle Center, so there are mobs of people and lots of noise. (Room noise was not a problem, however.) One of two elevators was out, so most rides were with a full crew of people who had to wait too long and weren't happy. The complimentary breakfast was a complete disaster: we arrived 30 minutes before it ended and there was, literally, no food except for a few grapefruit slices (the other two fruits bowls were empty), half a bowl of cereal (the other five cereal dispensers were completely empty), and some milk. Bagels appeared after about five minutes. Dirty dishes on lots of tables because the area for leaving them was full. I then talked to someone who appeared to be in charge who gave me a list of reasons why the situation was such a mess (\"things get really busy in the last half hour\" and \"we only opened a month ago\" etc.) , but nothing changed except that he filled some cereal dispensers. Parking is incredibly confusing: guests end up in the parking garage explaining to each other how to get in and out. And the room closet is a complete mystery: it is tiny, you can't really reach half of it, and it is not even as deep as a normal hanger, so you can't slide the door closed without turning the hanging clothes sideways. (No exaggeration.) The air conditioner is about 1 1/2 feet from the bottom end of the bed and you can't divert the air flow. (Good luck figuring out the thermostat, too.) We highly recommend the Hyatt Regency Bellevue -- not downtown Seattle, but always excellent service and comfort with prices comparable to this Hyatt Place and lower than the other two Seattle Hyatts. .", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Key Largo", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "yachtchefKeyLargo", "ReviewID": "UR71843494", "Content": "What a nice place!

The staff were pleasant and helpful, especially with regard to directions to nearby places to see and eat. Our room was perfect, and bigger than we expected. Everything in this hotel is new and clean. There is a small indoor pool, which my kids enjoyed. Wifi is free and there are also free computers to use in the lobby. Parking is nextdoor in a parking garage which connects to the hotel underground and is shared by a condo complex. It cost us $10 per day, which is actually much cheaper than other hotels in the area. There is a continental breakfast each morning, which is adequate but you can pay to upgrade if needed. We ate what was included with the room because the upgrade for eggs, bacon, and other hot foods were rather expensive. Speaking of food, the frontdesk maintains a small snack area with desserts, drinks, and the like, which are nice but somewhat costly. A cheaper alternative is to walk across the street to the new Walgreens and buy something there. Speaking of savings, on the day of checkout, I drove 5 miles to a Costco and purchased three $100 Hyatt gift certificates for only $79.95 each. This saved us over $60 off the final bill at checkout. Ask the front desk staff if you have a rate that allows for such gift certificates to be used however before you do this. When we asked we were told that our room was fine for this type of transaction but that rooms booked through Priceline, Hotwire, and other \"brokers\" do not allow for this because the funds are apparenlty not paid directly to Hyatt. Just a thought. Overall, this place was outstanding. I don't like to think of myself as a snob buy I am honestly picky about hotels and get a bit grossed-out with hotels that are not well maintained. That is not a problem here. I would most certainly stay here again and highly recommend it. I am actually surprised that it isn't ranked much higher on places to stay in Seattle on this website.", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenville, NC", "Title": "\u201cBrand New, Great Location, Would Stay Again\u201d", "Author": "thegov", "ReviewID": "UR70409753", "Content": "I stayed here when this hotel had been open for about 8 days, and got an AWESOME room with a perfect view of the space needle, amazing HD flat panel TV, free wifi, and nice layout. Considering how crazy-expensive it is for hotels in Seattle, I felt like the price was okay, and the extra fee for car parking seemed to be the most reasonable around. I found it very easy to walk downtown from here. The concept here at this Hyatt Place is very similar to an ALoft hotel. Self service check in kiosks, make your own breakfast bar, modern, hip, cool lobby areas, etc. The main thing I would say they need to improve upon is the breakfast. The included breakfast was basically an option of fruit and bread. (bagels, cereal, muffins, toast) It would be nice to have some eggs, turkey, bacon, etc as an option without having to pay more. My only other issue here was that upon check-in, their system didn't recognize my gold passport number, but I just chalk that up to the hotel being new and not having their IT systems properly configured yet.

The beds are comfy and the room has a nice large flat screen television. It is within walking distance to the Space Needle. The staff was very nice. The gym was excellent. The negatives: The breakfast is one of the worst continental breakfasts of any hotel I have stayed in. They could use another toaster and they were constantly out of everything and it was a very limited selection. The pool was freezing; mainly children were in it because the adults all felt it was way too cold. I guess they are trying to go on this plan where people check themselves in but it does not really work. People still come to the desk and the front desk employee is supposed to be a cook and front desk person so the waits were long at the front desk. Our keys would not work to the elevators and doors four different times so this wait at the front desk was very inconvenient. You would wait at the desk for them to be heating up cinnamon rolls for another guest. (Part of their job) This would be acceptable at a budget hotel, but not somewhere that is nearly $200 per night. Hopefully, in time they will work out their quirks. Normally, I would have given them a much lower rating but the staffs there is very nice and so were the rooms but be prepared for the negatives I mentioned.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cNew and quiet place to stay next to Seattle Center\u201d", "Author": "Louise55555", "ReviewID": "UR67137988", "Content": "We stayed in a mini suite with a sitting area and view of Puget Sound and the Space Needle that was tastefully decorated with a good choice of colors.
