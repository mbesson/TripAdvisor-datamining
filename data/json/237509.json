{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Brilliant Location Brilliant location. Open your window and you are looking at the Duomo.The room we stayed in was large and with an amazing view. We slept with the window open as we couldn't resist lying in bed and admiring the changing colour of the Duomo as dawn came about.The hotel is right in the centre of everything. The hotel owner Ermani was pleasant enough and was helpful. It is an older style hotel with a 1am curfew which was not an issue with us.Breakfast was sufficient - traditional european style.Definitely would stay there again.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR249478546", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TassieTigerTasmania"}, {"Content": "Wonderful and Well Located       The Duomo of Florence from the Hotel Villani terrace", "Date": "Oct 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR192914949", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nousingmyrealname"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d237509-r10024417-Villani-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "237509", "Price": "$176"}}
