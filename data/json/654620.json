I will agree with many of the visitors who speak about the friendlieness of staff, its great location and splendid rooms. The hotel lies just off the Via Nazionale which one of Rom'e main central streets and is about a ten minute walk from the colloseum and Roman Forum. By walking through a nearby traffic tunnel, the Trevi is about the same distance away. It is really within walking distance of about every single tourist attraction. We ate every night at one of the small restaurants on the same street as the hotel and had terrific value for money meals. The small shop across the road also had the cheapest wine and beer anywhere around. The hotel itself is small with rooms on the first floor. Breakfast is a very nice continental buffet within a small 'marquee tent' in the rear courtyard. It looked a bit bizarre but was actually very nice. we stayed in room 103 which was situated at the front. The room was larger than I expected with a decent sized ensuite and large shower. I was pleasantly surprised with the the well stocked mini bar which was the most inexpensive I have ever seen. We took a taxi to the hotel from the Leaonardo Da Vinci airport at 40 Euros and the hotel booked a private car for our return at 45 Euros. I definitely recommend this hotel and would certainly return.

It is just like in the photos, in fact better. We thought this Hotel was outstanding. Yes, some of the wall paper in our room was a little warn, but we found everything well maintained and spotlessly clean. The room and ensuite bathroom is more spacious than it appears in the pictures and is very well done. We found the Hotel safe and secure throughout our stay. The lovely Italian family who run this Hotel are very hands on, and manage it all superbly. Our breakfasts were the best in our 6 weeks overseas. A wide range of pastries, cereals, cheeses and cold meats, fruit juices and much more. We loved the way how when we arrived at breakfast, they greeted us with a delicious cappacino or other coffee of our choice. It was even better, than the best reviews here. The art nouveau building was beautiful. As I had broken my foot before our stay, we also appreciated the art nouveau lift which functions perfectly. The Italian family who own and manage this Hotel were exceptional. They quickly figured out that the reason we waited such a long time at breakfast was because I needed to rest before we went out (with foot), and they cleaned our room first without our having to ask. They showed us tremendous care and thoughtfulness throughout our stay. We cannot recommend them highly enough. The hotel is in a fantastic location as it is close to the Forum and Colossum, but off the tourist trap. We dined at all the restaurants in the street over our stay. The Umbrian restaurant is one Italians make a pilgramage to and it is outstanding (as foodies we loved it and dined there four nights and want to go back). But the other restaurants in this street and close to this Hotel are excellent too with top Italian food. We really felt as though we were in the heart of Rome, and central to all the attractions. The taxi arranged by the Hotel to the airport was very reliable. The total experience was top rate.

The staff at the hotel were very friendly, spoke excellent English, and humoured my awful Italian! :) The location of the hotel is brilliant as it's only about 500 metres from the Colosseum. We walked to the hotel from the central Termini on arrival but the hotel has two Metro stops very close by (Cavour which is practically on the same road as the hotel, and the Colosseum stop which is at the end of the road parallel) which makes it easilly accessible to anyone who doesn't want to walk with their luggage. The entrance to the hotel is on the street and looked very pretty with the christmas decorations up outside. The hotel was an excellent starting point to the city and we found most locations were walkable (given a good hike) although you had the handiness of the Metro nearby if your feet started to ache. There were also a good range of restaurants on the same street as the hotel. We ate at 3 of them whilst we were there and they were all very nice. We didn't make it for breakfast on any of the days so I can't comment on that, but we would go back to this hotel in a flash when we return to Rome due to how welcome we were made to feel, the amenities the hotel provides for the cost, and it's superb location.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Placerville, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Wonderful Breakfast, Awesome Hotel\u201d", "Author": "CA_sisterbelle", "ReviewID": "UR121806318", "Content": "We found this hotel on Trip Advisor after many searches.

It was the most perfect stay. From the moment we walked in, tired, hot and dishevelled, the welcoming was warm, friendly and helpful. The hotel is in an excellent location, only a few minutes walk from all the sights, restaurants and shops. It makes a fantastic base to explore the city from, even being a reasonable walking distance from Vatican City, which was the furthest point we ventured to. It is set back on a quiet street, in a deceptively plain building. As soon as you enter though, it is very grand and majestic. There is a small supermarket across the road which was useful for bits and pieces. The service from the staff was fantastic, they were always accommodating, meeting all our needs, speaking very good English, and willing to help and advise on days out, transport and other information. Breakfast was amazing, so much choice from pastries, to toast, to cereals, yoghurts, fruit, meats, cheeses....along with a fantastic cappuccino. Very Italian! The rooms were clean and of a good size, as was the bathroom. The mini bar in the room was very reasonably priced and the air conditioning was a god send. We had a balcony which was a nice extra and the room felt safe and secure. We did however have an air conditioning unit on the balcony, which although covered and not too monstrous to look at, was quite noisy. Due to the heat we slept with the air conditioning on though and it did not disturb sleep. I hope to return to Rome one day and I definitely plan to return to this hotel. I would recommend it as a fantastic place to stay, and say don't be deceived by the low star quality that travel agents may give it - it is purely because it does not have facilities such as a gym, restaurant, bar etc. It is very highly rated on Trip Advisor, and I can't fault it at all.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, excellent location, fantastic breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Dollymox", "ReviewID": "UR121375913", "Content": "Looked at lots of hotels before settling in this one.

A wardrobe with five hangers completed the furniture: there were no shelves or drawers so we lived out of our suitcase for five nights. The bathroom was also tiny, with only a shower and rather thin towels. Having said that, the breakfast was ok, the location is good, the blonde on reception was pretty surly but the other staff (the owners?) we're fine.

The telephone calls I made to Alitalia about my luggage were also charged at very reasonable rates. I was a little suprised at the lack of English fluency amongst the staff, however they were all very helpful, courteous and cheerful. The breakfast included in the room rate was continental only but included a wide array of cold meat, cheeses, yogurts, fruit, cereal and some delicious looking pastries.

The room was spacious for European standards and we loved the feeling of being in a little cobbled street off the main Via Nazioinale and with plenty of local restaurants nearby.

It really is hard to find anything negative to say about this hotel from our experience. The most important things for us are a clean room and friendly staff. We were not disappointed. We were made to feel welcome upon arrival, were even shown to our room and given a street map of Rome. The room was spotlessly clean thankfully and even got the thumbs up from my wife, which is a compliment to the cleaning staff in itself. The bathroom was also clean and supplied with small bottles of shower gel/shampoo, body lotion, a shower cap, soap and two plastic cups (sealed in plastic wrapping). There were plenty of towels too which were replaced every day. The shower was fine: good pressure, easy to control temperature and shower head detachable from the wall. There was a mini-bar in the room and although we didn't use it, there was a price list on the desk and the prices were very reasonable, eg. one euro for a bottle of water. There is a LCD TV with a Sky satellite box mounted on the wall. Obviously most channels are in Italian but there were some English language channels such as Sky News and BBC World News. A good selection of music channels were available too. Films could be purchased for \u20ac5 - \u20ac8. We had a room on the first floor overlooking the street directly opposite the Teatro Manhattan. We were not bothered by noise, the street does not have too much traffic and during the night it was quiet. The windows do a good job of keeping any street noise down as you will realise if you open the window. As we stayed in November we did not need to use the air-con in the room, so I can't comment on how effective it is. As for breakfast, it was fine for us though I suspect it may not be enough for some people. There was a choice of croissants of various flavours, fruit juices, cereals, biscuits, cakes, bread and a toasting machine, some meats and cheese. A selection of fruit/herbal teas were available or the staff would bring you a hot drink if you wanted. The breakfast area was nicely laid out and welcoming. The location is good, a 10 minute walk from the Colosseum and less than that to the Cavour Metro station. There a quite a few restaurants in the immediate area. After checking out we were able to leave our bags in a secure storage area for a few hours before heading off for the airport. We would stay here again and recommend this hotel.

Would we stay longer? We're we pleased with the location, hotel and staff? Absolutley yes! The reviews of Hotel Artorius are correct. We chose this hotel because of the reviews and we were not disappointed. Hotel Artorius is small, family run hotel that is situated on a side street just off Via Nazionale. It is a 10 minute walk to the Colosseum and centrally located to all the major sights of Rome. The hotel is very clean and the rooms, albeit just slightly smaller compared to North American expectations, are well appointed and modern. It is an extremely well kept hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful. Actually...the staff are great. You are staying in a warm, inviting and family hotel and that makes it feel different from a major chain. We felt comfortable, welcome and, in a way, part of the family. You always got a smile and friendly greeting whenever you left for the day and returned. The hotel includes a European breakfast (no ham and eggs for those of you looking for North American style of breakfast). The breakfast features a good, fresh assortment of cereals, pastries, cheese and meats, fresh juices, fruit and they make wonderful cappuccino. As a tourist this hotel is in a very good location. It is, more or less, central to all the major sights of Rome. It is a 10 minute walk from the Metro which we took to the Vatican but then walked back to the hotel seeing sights such as the Spanish Steps, Tevi Fountain, Plaza Navona and a host of other memories along the way. You have to walk a lot in Rome...it's the only way to really see the city and see all the things you'd miss on a bus tour or cab ride. Can you see all the major sights of Rome in 2 days? We did and didn't have to really rush....but to truly appreciate Rome do as we will the next time we visit Rome. We will stay with Hotel Artorius again but for at least 3-4 days. That allows more time to really slow down, soak in the atmosphere that is Rome and take more time at the major sights such as the Vatican Museum. Yes you can get a good overview of the Vatican museum in 3 hours but really...you need 5 or 6 hours for a good visit. (for those Museum junkies...a couple of days to see every nook and cranny and pause to appreicate all that the Museum has to offer). A helpful hint for English speaking tourists; try to learn a few phrases in Italian. We found that most people do speak at least a little bit of English but it is appreciated by the locals if you make whatever effort you can to speak a few phrases of Italian. It shows that you are making an effort to be courteous and that courtesy is often returned. We are tourists in their country so make the effort to be a good tourist.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hope, PA", "Title": "\u201cA great small hotel\u201d", "Author": "PA40Love", "ReviewID": "UR83247615", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights prior and 2 nights after our cruise.

The location was quiet and convenient for walking to the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, etc. There were several good restaurants nearby as well. We'd been concerned that it might be a bit off the beaten path when looking at maps prior to our stay there. While there aren't as many things to do in that area as there are in the Piazza Navona neighborhood, it was much livelier and offered more within easy walking distance than we expected. The relative quiet in noisy Rome and the great, family feel of the hotel made up for it being a little farther from some of the other popular areas. It also cost us less than our stay on the other side of town. The hotel was clean, beautifully decorated and our room (a double) was large by European standards. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast had good options and was a good value. Our only \"negatives\" are minor. The shower temperature didn't remain consistent and the room was a little darker than we would have liked. That was great on our first night in the city as we slept for about 12 hours straight after the long flight but it was a little gloomy for reading, putting on make up and such.

While we initially liked this hotel very much, we departed with an angry attitude about the hotel's very poor reservation system. To start with, we made internet reservations in late February for a 3-night stay at the end of April. Due to their reservation set-up, there was no immediate computer-generated reply to us with information as to dates of stay, room type and rates, and confirmation number. Because of this, we were a little uncertain if it went through. A few days later, we received an email from the hotel that was not readable---it was full of symbols with a few scattered sentences. We wrote back that we could not read it, and asked for a confirmation of our stay. The prompt response stated that we were confirmed for the requested dates. We wrote back again, asking about a confirmation number, but they replied there wasn't one. We crossed our fingers and hoped the room would be waiting for us when we arrived, which it thankfully was. The hotel is located in a very convenient location, within walking distance to many of the historical sites in Rome. It is located on a narrow side street that has several restaurants and a market. Although we were able to locate the place, the entrance is not easily distinguished from the other businesses on the street so you need to keep a close eye out for it. The hotel is very nicely decorated, clean, and our room had all the necessary amenities. Loved the old-time elevator, quite charming---and it worked, too! The outdoor, partially-covered breakfast room was lovely and the buffet was ample and delicious. The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful with arranging airport transportation and providing ideas for restaurants. When it came time to check out, we were once again confronted with the realities of their reservation system. We were shocked to see that our daily room rate had increased from the quoted reservation rate---120 Euros/night---to 175 Euros/night! We were told that the lower rate was the fee for February (when we made the reservation), but the higher amount was the fee charged in April. This higher rate was not mentioned on the web site when the reservation was made; the only fee mentioned was the lower one. In all of the years we have traveled to numerous hotels, we have never encountered a hotel reservation system that quotes you a rate based on when you make the reservation, as opposed to when you will actually be staying there. This is extremely deceptive and is a very questionable business practice. The hotel refused to accept the rate we were quoted at the time of the reservation, and charged us the higher fee. Since they did not issue a confirmation receipt at the time we made the reservation, there was no paper trail that detailed what we signed up for. As stated earlier, we liked the hotel and location very much, so it is sad to say that we cannot recommend it to anyone else, or that we would stay there again. We sincerely hope that they modernize their reservation system so that it is reliable and provides accurate, honest information to their guests.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice\u201d", "Author": "mFeatherst1", "ReviewID": "UR64875029", "Content": "I'd almost like to keep this hotel a secret, but it's far to late for that.

No view from our balcony of Room 109 but it was nice to have somewhere to sit quietly with a book. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very adequate and everything replenished very quickly if supplies ran low. We used the supermarket opposite to buy teabags and milk as there are no tea/coffee making facilities and the hotel staff were happy to supply us with hot water, teapot and cups whenever we asked. Beds were comfy, shower a bit tempremental but fine. All major attractions are within walkable distance and there are some very nice restaurants close by. We particularly liked Chicco di Grano, at 5-8 Via degli Zingari which is just minutes away, a very busy restaurant full of Italians which is always a good sign! Also enjoyed good food at Grillo Brillo which was much quieter. We had the hotel arrange a pick-up from the airport which cost 50 Euros. It worked well but I have to say the drivers in Rome are truly scarey. TWO mobile phones, taking and making calls, accelerating and braking hard, aggressive driving ... Be prepared! To return to the airport a few days later to pick up a hire car for the rest of our holiday, we asked the hotel to book us a taxi which cost 60 Euros. Not cheap! Unrelated to the hotel, there was an attraction we went to see that certainly wasn't the run of the mill tourist attraction. The Capuchin Crypt is located beneath Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini church on the Via Veneto near Piazza Barberini and consists of 5 little rooms decorated with skeletons and bones. It's totally bizarre, perhaps not suitable for all but it's really quite stunning and I'm quite sure I've seen nothing like it in my life, and probably never will.

For August, the air conditioning worked quite well. You need to keep your key in the holder by the door to keep the lights and air conditioning working in your room while you are in it. When you leave the hotel for touring, you leave the key at the front desk. We had no issues with this practice. A minibar is in the room with enough space to chill your own bottles of water. All the staff at the hotel spoke English very well & were always very helpful if you had any questions. You can even buy bus tickets at the lobby desk. Breakfast at the hotel was good - danishes, fresh fruit & juices. The hotel staff puts decorations on your cappucino which are cute! There is a small market directly across the street from hotel which we stopped at at least twice a day to pick up bottled water for touring & some snacks for the room. This was extremely convenient & a bonus for staying at this hotel. They sold everything there from toiletries to fresh sandwiches at the deli counter. They also had cheeses which were vacuum packaged to take back on a plane. There is a very good restaurant around the block from the hotel called Colonne. Its a small family run restaurant and the waitress spoke English. It was around 25 euro per person for the house wine, appetizer, salad, main dish, dessert & cappucino. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain & the Pantheon. If you are not into walking and want to conserve your energy, there is a bus stop right up the street. I would recommend the Artorius to anyone. It is a cute little hotel with a lot of charm & very helpful and cheerful staff.

The first impressions of the Hotel were good as we arrived, although due to road works the taxi didn't drop us particularly near so we needed the map to find it. We just got a 40 Euro taxi from Fluminco Airport, but the central train station is not far away either. The staff were perfectly nice and spoke reasonable English. The room wasn\u2019t huge, but perfectly adequate and clean. The bathroom was very nice for a hotel of this standard and was a good size also. It was 35C+ for the time we were there, but fortunately the air conditioning worked without any issues! The only down side was a noisy air conditioning unit right outside the window, but the window was sufficiently sound proofed to keep most of the noise out at night so it wasn't too bad. But in fairness to the hotel, in compensation for having a noisy unit right outside your window, you do get a roof terrace! I don't think any of the other rooms had a terrace from what I could see, and it was a really nice bonus to be able to sit outside with an ice cream after a long day hiking around before heading out in the evening. Location wise, the hotel is excellently situated for all the major attractions. The Vatican was a fair old trek considering the heat, particularly if you climb the Cupola as well as we did, but I'm not particularly fit and survived OK. You can always get a taxi I guess. The Borghese museum and gallery is also a fair old walk to the north, but again it's quite manageable from the hotel (whatever you do, don't miss it - it's not hard to see why they say it's the favourite museum for Romans today). There are many restaurants and bars nearby; finding somewhere nice to eat and drink isn't too difficult and I think everywhere we went had an English menu. There's also a mini-supermarket almost directly opposite the hotel which is very useful for stocking up on bottled water.

There are busses along this road that go all throughout the city including the Vatican but most sites are in easy walking distance from this Hotel. Via Del Boschetto has several places to eat, a small supermarket and a Gelataria at the bottom which is open late. It is a safe street, no beggars etc. and not very busy with traffic. The only hassle you get is from the waiters at the restaurants asking you to eat at their place but they are very polite. We definitely recommend the pizzeria on the corner of Via Del Boschetto and Via Degli Zingari, excellent food and good value for money but the wait for an outside seat can be long and the service a bit slow. We also recommend the Gelataria at the bottom of the road as the owner always has a smile on his face! The Hotel is small but amazingly clean when you walk in and the staff are very friendly, helpful and do speak English. They gave us a map on arrival which helped a lot! They also took our luggage up to our room while we took a quick walk around the area for half an hour. We were a little early for check in but this was OK. When we were shown to our room there were a bunch of flowers and a bottle of sparkling wine with chocolates waiting along with a note wishing us well on our honeymoon - very nice touch! The room was very clean and well furnished and tasteful with a double bed, bedside tables, desk with built in mini bar (very reasonably priced), chair, wardrobe and chest. All was in very good condition and of good quality. There was also a flat screen TV with satellite although I could only find one English channel but hey, you're in Rome so why watch TV!?!! We left it on as background noise in the morning. The bathroom was, again, very clean with a toilet, bidet, large sink and powerful shower. The room also had air conditioning with it's own control panel. Our room was at the back of the hotel and had a large private balcony - very nice to relax in. The room was very quiet with no noise from Rome and the only time I heard anything was a noisy guest coming back one evening letting his room door slam opposite to us. The breakfast in the morning was in the breakfast room next to the reception and was, as usual, very, very clean. You could either sit outside under a canopy of vines (with grapes hanging down!) or under an awning. All in good condition and tasteful. We had a cappuccino every day with different sprinkles in a shape on top each time! The food was nice, with a selection of cereals, pastries, cakes, meat & cheese, fruit and spreads for toast. Several juices and a smoothie were also available. When it came time to check out we were very sad to go and really enjoyed our time in Rome.

The street in front of the hotel is very narrow and quiet. You can leave your earplugs home, because there\u00b4s just silence in the night.

There are plenty of great little tavernas and ristorantes near the hotel, so you don\u00b4t have to go far to have a good dinner. The personnel of the hotel is very, very kind and helpful. Their smiles are natural, not as acted. The rooms, toilets, stairway and the corridor are very clean. The breakfast is very versatile and abundant and you can have capucchino, espresso, tea, hot chocolate or american coffee. What more? The only thing which wasn\u00b4t as good as in \"our former hotels\", was the view from the room window. But as I said, the street IS very narrow and it\u00b4s just impossible to have a great view.

Highly recommended. Pros: Close to everything, family-run, breakfast included, clean, newly renovated rooms and bathrooms, rooms and bathrooms are large by European standards (especially if you pay a few extra Euros for a triple room). Personal attention and friendly people. Cons: Small hotel, so no large hotel amenities (i.e. no room service, no restaurant). Review: My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Artorius in February 2009. Allesandro (see photo) and his family (and some family friends) run the 10-room Hotel Artorius. Everyone at the hotel made us feel as though we staying with friends in the guest room of their house. Allesandro would make wonderful coffee and cappuccino for breakfast each morning, along with a light breakfast of cereals, pastries, breads, fruits, juices, yogurts and some meats/chesses. The breakfast was served in a small covered dining room, outside in the main courtyard (see photo). The hotel is in the heart of a real Roman neighborhood and is only a couple of blocks to the Colosseum (see photo from one street over from the hotel). The hotel and surrounding area is very safe, just keep in mind you are in the heart of a large city. The hotel is small, but newly renovated. It is located on a small one-way side street, close to the main streets of Rome (e.g. Via Nationale). There are numerous good dining options in the neighborhood. Just walk out the hotel pick a direction, wander around for a bit and you are sure to stumble across a good place to eat. We recommend ordering the house wine at whatever restaurant you eat at. The staff is also more than willing to make a recommendation or reservation for you. Right across the street is a small supermarket where you can purchase everything from basic supplies (waters, sodas, wine, beer) up to a picnic lunch. There is a subway stop only a couple blocks away. The rooms and bathrooms are newly renovated and are relatively large by European standards. We stayed in a standard double room (see photos). Nonetheless, we looked in at some of the triple rooms, and they we considerably larger. If you are concerned about space, it is worth the extra Euros to upgrade to a triple room. If you are not overly concerned about space, a double room should suit most couples perfectly well. Another consideration is that most of the triple rooms overlook the interior courtyard whereas the double rooms overlook the street out front (with the usual Vespa and car traffic). Because some of the other reviews indicated that cabs from the airport had difficulty locating the hotel, we emailed Allesandro in advance of our arrival with our flight information. Allesandro scheduled a driver to meet us at the airport (with our name on the board and everything). The ride was 50 Euros (a standard cab from the airport is 40-50 Euros), so the scheduled ride was well worth it. Another option is the express train from the airport to the Termi Train Station which is about 6-7 blocks (and a 10 minute walk) from the hotel. After staying in Rome for a week, we headed off to Venice for a couple of days. Make sure to check out our review of the Hotel Al Ponte Anico in Venice. If you stay at the Hotel Artorius, make sure you say \u201chi\u201d to Allesandro for us!

Nothing was too much to ask. Breakfast was fresh with enough variety and served in a very pleasant breakfast room. The location for us was perfect. I know a lot of people like to stay by the Pantheon or Piazza Novona but we find those areas to be clogged with tourists day and night. The Monti neighborhood is a \"real\" neighborhood with a supermarket, lots of restauants and non-touristy shops. Especially liked the Spazio Artigiano shop with beautiful hand made ceramics at very reasonable prices at Vicolo dei Serpenti, 13. Via Nazionale is just two blocks. Most sights are easily walked with multiple bus options or metro if you prefer (espically for the Vatican). I have been to Rome many times and cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Some people have noted water problems in the shower and there is some flucation in the pressure that requires you to adjust the hot/cold at times but this seems very minor. The water pressure was wonderful with plenty of hot water at all times. No real negative comments except they could add some artwork to the rooms.

We chose to stay in the Artorius hotel, after reviewing the reviews on Tripadvisor and Venere. What we read had raised our expectations and maybe this is why we can not agree with other reviews. Starting with the positives, location was good. It is centrally located, indeed, close to Trevi fountain, Termini station and Colloseum. It is also very clean. Now for the negatives\u2026 1) The hotel is 2 star, and not 3, according to the sign on the room door. 2) We booked this room from September 7th for the price of 160 euros. We checked the price one week before leaving, and the price remained the same. If looking for a better bargain then, don\u2019t hurry to book. 3) The room (106) was small. I can not compare it with other hotels in Rome but compared to Paris, Prague, Vienna hotels, this was a VERY small room. 4) The bathroom ventilation remains open and you can not close it, resulting in a buzzing noise. 5) You couldn\u2019t adjust the shower in a certain height, because the handle was broken. We noted this after the first day and they said that this was something they could fix. However, up to our last day the handle remained broken. Furthermore, the water temperature in the shower was going from hot to cold and vice versa. So after a long and tiring day staying under the shower for a few minutes was out of the question. 6) The breakfast was very poor, without refilling the buffet. One type of cheese, one of salami, and one of ham, was all we got. When bread was consumed, they didn\u2019t put some more. I didn\u2019t ask for more, maybe they would then provide us some more.

I was amazed to turn a corner and see the Coliseum. The Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain is also within walking distance or you can take an electric bus for 1 euro to get you there. It was a perfect location for me. You are in a real safe neighborhood with cafes and restaurants at every corner. The staff is very nice and helpful with anything you may need. The rooms are so clean it reminded me of my Grandmother\u2019s house where you could eat off of the floors. Anna was especially helpful and set up a few tours and told me how to get around. I loved it and am extremely happy with my choice. The rooms are clean, comfortable with Internet access. They even have Ethernet cables for you to use as well as ac adapters. The shower was great, the breakfast was also really nice and they have a little open-air garden for you to eat in. I booked the hotel through Orbitz and though no fault of the hotel, Orbitz charged my credit card when booked but it did not go through and never notified me or sent the payment to the hotel.

Because we had luggage, we took a taxi from the local train station so we wouldnt have to walk forever to find this hotel. Unfortunately, after the taxi found the street, he couldnt actually find the hotel. He left us off about a block away and we needed to go into another Inn to ask for directions. Sure enough it was indeed on the same street but we drove past it twice and never saw it! Its a small quiet side-street that has only a few Inns with signs. This hotel has a small bronze plaque, so its hard to see. But after arriving, we were greeted by the son (family business for sure) and from that point on we were very very satisfied! The hotel room are mostly on the second floor (we think). There is a broad stairway up, but the son that greeted us insisted we take the ancient lift...which apparently is one of the oldest working lifts in Rome. The second floor had security so things seemed safe. The room was modern and updated with a king bed that was quite comfortable. Really nice updated bathroom (with bidet) and a nice new shower. Very nice marble everywhere. The room had high ceilings, air conditioning, and a TV. All features were quite nice, however the TV was a bit hard for us to figure out. An internet cable was provided for free, so we were able to stay connected. The one window looked out to the building across the street, so there we no view and no balcony, but we didnt care about that given everything else we had to go see in Rome. The hotel is not too far from the Coliseum and the Forum. Its an easy 10 minute walk. Plenty of restaurants nearby....and the hotel has some local favorites that were really really tasty. The neighborhood seemed safe at night too. Breakfast was provided in an outdoor patio - which was clean, refreshing and erelaxing. Plenty of breakfast food - but not your typical \"English Breakfast\". So we are happy to recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

The staff was extremely friendly, the property was beautiful, the breakfasts were delicious, and the room was probably the cleanest hotel room we have ever stayed in. We found our room to be spacious (Room 108) and loved having a balcony to enjoy a gelato or bottle of wine! Hotel Artorius is in a perfect location for seeing the city. It is centrally located within a few minute walk of the Colosseum, Roman and Imperial Forums, Palatine Hill, Trevi Fountain and other Rome Highlights. Having a metro stop near by was also a plus. (If you will be staying several days consider purchasing the 1, 3 or 7 day metro pass.) There are many great restaurants and no lack of gelaterias in the area; we found a gelateria on Via del Serpenti that we visited several times! You will be more than pleased if you choose Hotel Artorius! It is simply perfect! (One note: although the hotel's website directions say to turn right on Via del Boschetto off of Via Leonina when coming from the Cavour Metro stop, the street is actually not marked as such.

Our room was a very nice size and again, very clean. The breakfast was good with pastries, salamis, etc. Typical fare for Italian tourist breakfasts, but there is lots of it and good quality. The staff were very nice and helpful. They gave us excellent advice and directions for getting to lots of places and getting a taxi. For people who are coming to Rome for the first time, the Hotel Artorius is very well located next to the colusseum, forum, and other attractions and a very short, easy taxi ride to other locations. There are also a lot of good food and an internet cafe near the hotel. My husband and I travel with a Guide Dog for the Blind, which the Hotel accepted without even blinking. For the dog, the location lacked grass or planters for relieving, but it is easy for us to pick up and the ease and relative inexpense of taxis because of the location made up for it.
