You're paying the prices of a 5 star hotel to stay at a very basic hotel. Breakfast was basic with the small breakfast room located in the foyer right next to the reception desk. The infinity pool was nothing spectacular but most disappointing was that it closed at 6pm which wasn't really convenient. Our rooms were nice, complete with a nespresso machine but the views were the back of some lane ways so at night when people were walking through or talking, you can hear everything. Most disturbing was we would hear some loud sounds of water?? within the walls constantly while sleeping or watching tv and our shower floors felt like they hadn't been cleaned for a while because it was slimy with orangy mold/soap scum. The only reason we stayed at this hotel was because of it's high ranking and positive reviews on trip advisor and that's because a day or two after check out I received an email from Naumi hotel asking me to review them hotel on Trip Advisor. Overall this hotel is more suitable if you were on a business trips and just need a place to sleep but definitely not if you are on holiday.

Stayed for 6 nights in April. Because there are only 40 rooms, there is no hustle and bustle and it is a very welcome place to return to after the heat and crowds of Singapore. The rooftop pool is deep and has great views. The rooms are very spacious and have everything you need (including unbrella for the odd afternoon rain storm). We took advantage of the full size fridge (duty free beer and bourbon from Changi Airport) and enjoyed the free daily supply of soft drinks and tea and coffee pods for the Nespresso. Very relaxing rooms with two free movie channels plus discovery, cnn etc. You will get to know the staff and they will know you by name. They were always looking for more to do for us. Even brought up complementary Chandon Champagne on arrival to celebrate our anniversary - an unexpected sweet touch. All the advice we received was sound. Breakfast (included) was very good and the buffet changes slightly everyday. The omelette is recommended, as are the chicken chipolatas. For an inexpensive bite, try Swee Kee's (Black and Gold sign) near the corner of Seah St and North Bridge Road. Cheap food and drinks and very nice. All in all, location, accommodation, service was exactly what we were looking for. Peace and Quiet. Only ever saw a max of 4 other guests by the pool. Plenty of room. Those looking for Bigger and Brassier / Hustle and Bustle = better, then perhaps you need to look towards Marina Bay Sands. We are very glad we chose Naumi and would certainly return. One small critique:- Perhaps look for a way to quiet the effect of the closing sliding doors on the bathrooms. You can hear and almost feel the shudder when guests next door or above close the sliding door too quickly / hard. Maybe a thick foam / rubber buffer between the wooden door and frames would do the trick??", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rooftop View\u201d", "Author": "girlgtlondon", "ReviewID": "UR128213085", "Content": "Stayed here at the tail end of our 3 week honeymoon.

The same applies to the eggs request. * Smoke-free hotel - the hotel pushes this however guests seem to be able to smoke around the pool to the smothering level for those of us that do not smoke. Saw guests smoking there while staff were showing potential guests around and nothing was said.Had to leave the pool area at least once due to the smoke level. And also do not sit next to the windows in the restaurant as the smoke from the guests who smoke out the front wafts through the gaps. * Ladies only floor - it isn't.

Please do not advertise something you cannot deliver. * Bed Linen - attached is a photo of the lovely hole in one of the bed linen (duvet cover) also small holes in the pillows were noticed. * Bathroom - bring your own bleach - see photos of the silicon around the shower.

I think I have stayed here six times over the years. On arrival, the check in clerk knew my name, knew that I had stayed before and immediately upgraded my room free of charge. Immediate good impression. The room is meticulously clean. The bed is very comfortable, the bathroom is spacious with a tub and shower, and the Nespresso machine is welcome the morning after a long flight. With a LCD scree that swivels between sitting room and bedroom, an iPod dock should you require background music and very comfortable chairs, it is difficult to see what else you could require. I often keep an eye on the reviews of this hotel and frankly, some of the mealy-mouthed comments are completely unwarranted. This hotel consistently lives up to and exceeds expectations and the staff are always courteous and polite. The pool is the defining moment in most peoples stay.

I stay for business, but I am sure that if were thinking of this as a honeymoon destination, I'm sure it wouldn't disappoint.

In case you are 100% sure that you will be staying at the hotel and that your reservation will never need to be canceled, you can skip this review; otherwise, I hope you will find it useful in some way or another. Here is what happened: I made a reservation at Naumi Hotel Singapore for staying four nights during February 2012 at the normal full-price rate (S$400.18 per night, not the discounted \"Advance Purchase\" rate) through the hotel's own webpage. Unfortunately, I had to cancel the reservation. I canceled it two months in advance (Dec. 1, 2011), immediately received a confirmation e-mail from the hotel, and assumed that everything was ok. However, on Feb. 11, the hotel charged my credit card one night's room fee of S$400.18 anyway. I e-mailed the hotel about it on Feb. 16, and apparently, the information about my cancelation had not been transferred from the hotel's online booking partner to the hotel. The front office manager of Naumi Hotel, Mr. S.T., was very polite and helpful, and assured me that this was an isolated incident. After several rounds of e-mails and waiting patiently for one month, most of the fee was finally refunded to my bank account on March 16. For the record, no future room fee discounts, offers of free upgrades, etc. were given as compensation for the inconvenience caused. Also, I only received about S$385 of the S$400.18 that I had paid because even when the foreign exchange rate remains constant, every bank's buying and selling rates differ so that the bank can make a profit, i.e., if I buy S$400.18 from the bank and then immediately sell S$400.18 back to the bank then I will end up with slightly less money (anyway, that is not the hotel's fault so it's not important for this review). In short, the problem was resolved but it took a long time and it was not done as smoothly as it could have been.

There is a great potential for it to become a fantastic hotel but it is not for the time being. The good things about the hotel: location, people, decoration, quiet, good beds The things that can be improved: sense of initiative (you can stay one hour sitting in the lobby with friends and none would even offer a glass of water), issues with early check-in:late check-out, the service at the swimming pool (there is no-one there, you have to dial reception if you want water or a drink), the tiny gym and most of all, the breakfast buffet is really really bad: at a level of a 2* hotel.

Our meeting package included a set lunch in the lobby cafe/bar, and I have to say the lunch while simple was excellent. We also had drinks in the same area at the end of the day, and in the evening the lobby bar turns into a pretty funky lounge with a cool vibe, attracting a well-dressed business crowd. I'm guessing the room costs are relatively high (accomodation costs in Singapore have just become ridiculously expensive in the past couple of years!), no wonder that the hotel's patrons look to be largely a business clientele, likely frequent travellers (both men and women, as the hotel has a woman-only floor) in search of something out of the ordinary instead from the usual big name 5-star chains. I did not take any photos however the photos on the hotel's website are pretty accurate.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cCourteous staff and great location\u201d", "Author": "Kluiver C", "ReviewID": "UR126183011", "Content": "All is perfect in this hotel.We chose this hotel for its condition , which was spotless, and the professionalism of the staff, which was indeed the case. great hotel", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "M\u00fchlhausen, Germany", "Title": "\u201cMy fav hotel in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "dentcheung", "ReviewID": "UR126127347", "Content": "We have been staying at Naumi Hotel before the recent years.

Spoke to a few locals about it , some heard of it some not , some were vague, so the unsure element remained. decided to take a chance and go ahead with booking the room started the interaction experience with the Naumi Singapore....................... Starting with the phone call for reservation (not naming you here S*****I,) but the promptness and quick assistance and ability to suggest and help set in a feeling of \"being in the right hands\" arrival experience and the already clued on check in staff (hello P**L) was like a fresh soothing feel after a long long flight. (the other two ladies at the check in time who were around , thank you too). Was so intrigued by the \"differentness\" of the hotel and the personal touch (that you will never find in a 100, 200, 700 room one) that made request to see the entire property. The request was promptly heard and looked after and (of course all room were not vacant for a see) was executed as if it was an order. Little things like , tried the room order, just for trying that is the only front desk facade good (like in many many hotels) but was happy to be wrong, what amazing promptness and service. same way necessarily tried to be clueless about getting a singtel sim, and there came prompt assistance with a personal feel that one felt looked after (not like other hotels where attempts are to suggest something over the top or out of budget, where one feels taken for a ride). same way to step out inquired about the train and way about it (although used taxis all the way) but was explained so well and in a nice assistance , that i can guide some one wanting to use the train without actually having used one. ordered room service in wee hours to again check how it lives up to the claims of 24X7 availability, and was pleasantly surprised without having to wait as one would expect when ordering in wee hours of night. Morning break fast service was good, although it was usual breakfast but service by the staff (all on their toes and personally taking care of each guest) was commendable and worth remembering. very small things like checking out experience, leaving baggage after check out for the day, assistance with dlosing a baggage tag, hailing a cab to the airport (the girl who insisted on seating me into the cab and say bye would have been lighter than my bag, but she insisted) making sure what terminal and all goes well. seeing off a guest as if seeing off a member of a family........i mean many many little things that make all the difference and go a loooong mile. over all a FANTASTIC and worth remembering every minute of it experience...... and makes me more than 200% SURE great job team NAUMI keep it up!!! do not not not let the great praise and recommendation make you slip , hold your head high and be just the way you are .

If Naumi Hotel was a hostel and cost like SGD 80 per night I would like this hotel, but about SGD 400 per night for the cheapest room is too much for what they offer (or is it the Nespresso machine which makes the room so pricy??) Now let's begin.. When we arrived i had to push my suitcase myself the small ramp into the hotel. Since we checked in before 2 p.m. we had to wait a little for the room, but that was no problem, we could store our luggage and went shopping meanwhile. Staff at check in was friendly. About the room: very dark with 1960s style furniture... If you look for decoration, you won't find much. I'm still wondering why the hotel won an design award and is part of the small luxury boutique hotel group, because it's not very luxurious!! The bed is comfortable, but you can't get no rest if the housekeeping staff talks loud at 8 am and you hear everything from the outside.. Minibar is for free (Soda, Sprite and Coke, that's it). Room is very dark and if you want light at the wardrobe you have to go to the bedroom to switch it on. If you open the door of the wardrobe, you can't get into the bathroom. In the shower there was black mold... Breakfast: ok... first day we were asked if we want coffee, and the lady offered us cappuccino, caffe latte, moccha etc, another waiter asked us if we want an egg, any style. I offered scrambled egg, got an omelet (which was good). Next day we got just a cup of coffee with no milk, which i had to get from the buffett and we weren't even asked if we want an egg. Bread is under an infraded lamp (?), so the bread is always warm, but the cheese is right next to the bread, so the cheese was nearly melted! Poor service that day! The swimming pool is small, there are only a few sunchairs and due to an construction site near the hotel it was very very noisy. So, since we weren't satisfied at all we checked out after 2 nights and booked another hotel at Scotts Road, which was defenitely better than the Naumi! Would I stay there again or recommend it?

The hair-straightener, for example, was very welcome. Wi-fi was good - though it wasn't turned on the first night we arrived (despite being told it would be) and we had to ask the next day. It wasn't a problem - if it had been, I'd have just visited reception again. Breakfast was good, but the egg-ordering system seems a little chaotic. A group was there whilst we were, and there was a bit of a mix-up with orders, including mine. But no-one seemed upset, and the rest of the service was good. The entrance to the hotel is quite unassuming, but it is the location that we liked. It is easy to walk to nearby places, including Marina Bay, and there is an MRT station (or two) nearby. We arrived after a long flight, both of us exhausted, so ended up eating a room service pizza (which was tasty and all we needed). We kicked ourselves though when the next morning we walked out and found the street is lined with casual eating places, including places with my favourite chicken rice, and lots of other options. As always in Singapore, I wished we had longer simply to eat! The pool looked appealing, and the view is great, though it is a small area. We didn't have time to use it.

The wifi logs out constantly, though this was a minor irritation as it was free and reliable. The quality of the breakfast can be hit or miss, with large variances in whats on offer. Not the most inviting public areas (non-existent actually) and I have to say, the infinity pool is much smaller than expected and overrated. Summary: would I stay here again? Probably.

My \"Small Luxury Hotel\" membership should have allowed me to keep the room to 4pm but this was \"not possible\". In fact none of the SLH benefits I should have enjoyed was offered. I wasn't too worried as I had specifically chosen the hotel for its rooftop infinity pool. I told the staff I'd go there on the final evening before showering and changing to my travelling clothes. BUT at 2 pm on the day of departure I learned that the rooftop - the ONLY outside space for guests - would be closed for a private party given by GeRe company. I was very upset but the reception staff really couldn't have cared less. No apology. Nothing. Not even a soft drink offered. So, in net, I cannot recommends the hotel. If the management is so greedy that it puts the income from a small drinks party ahead of the comfort of its guests, then I dread to think what they would do if there were some real crisis.

However, this hotel is new, clean, decent price, great features. It is small hotel and more suitable for couples with no children on romantic getaway. Room \u2013 I was upgraded to a next best class available and it was great on first impression. The overall impression does not change much as you stay longer and find some things may need touchup, fix, or clean. Regardless, I\u2019ve paid and had a lot worse than Naumi so it does meet my expectation. Rooms are decent sized and comfortable. It has nice working desk along with great coffee machine that takes fresh capsule if you like coffee. The bedroom and living room is somewhat separated but no door available. Instead, there is sort of entertainment center with LCD TV that can be rotated if you want to watch TV from bed. Bathroom \u2013 It has nice tub and also separate shower booth. Water flow is good and towels are good quality. The bathroom toiletries are good quality as well so if you do not pack your own, you can survive during your stay without having to visit Watsons. Internet \u2013 It is wireless and it is about average for Singapore meaning it is acceptable but not fast. It is more than adequate for internet surfing or e-mail use. Don\u2019t expect to download your favorite soap and watch when you get tired of walking around nearby shopping more. Food \u2013 Since it is small hotel, you can\u2019t expect to have a great restaurant. It serves breakfast and I\u2019ve tried it once and it is okay but there are much better ones outside. Some rooms have included breakfast with the room and some does not so it really is up to you. Location/Concierge/parking \u2013 Location wise, it is very close to Raffles Hotel so you can get an idea where this hotel is. Hotel has concierge but since the hotel lobby is so small, it is difficult to call them that. Also, the parking is very difficult for this hotel since space is very limited. If you have friends driving a car and need to pick you up at the hotel, I would just walk outside of the hotel to nearby Main Street and meet them. Technically, there is no driveway like most hotels so during the weekend; it gets packed with pedestrians and cars with no space to wait for you. Pool- There is a nice poor on the top of the building and it is highlight of this hotel. Occasionally, there is a pool party reserved for entire evening so if you are into pool and must visit every day and night, make sure ask for availability. Overall, I would visit Naumi again.

The two bathrooms were amazing and the shower was the best I've ever had. We had a very special moment at Naumi. At breakfast, my 8 year old son was interested in the waffles being cooked to order. So, he went over and placed his order and stayed talking to the person cooking them. We had no idea that the waffle cooker, was the hotel manager Peter Wong! As soon as our son finished his waffles, we went up to our room to squeeze in a quick swim before checking out. We had just got back to our room, when there was a knock at the door and there was Peter and several of his staff with a cake and candles! Our son had told him it was almost his birthday, so they very thoughtfully brought him a birthday cake. We were very touched by this gesture and it was a highlight of our stay in Singapore. It is something my son will never forget. Things like that make a stay memorable and personal and Peter certainly knows how to do it well! We were able to leave our cases after check out, as we had a much later flight back to Australia. They organised a taxi to the airport and could not have been more helpful - even offering a shower room to freshen up in after our day traipsing round Singapore. We wanted a smaller hotel, not high rise, and we got that and more. Yes, the pool is small but it is wonderful and the view is great.

We plunked down for a Corporate Suite at about SGD430 including taxes and such per night. Here\u2019s the quick run-down of what we felt worked, and what didn\u2019t work for us. Starting off with the former: Very friendly staff. No doubts there. Everywhere, we were greeted warmly. Staff was very responsive too, from the point in which we made the reservation, all the way till check-out. Very spacious room. So big it almost felt a little empty! The most comfortable hotel bed we've slept in - ever. Very small hotel of just 40 rooms. No screaming kids, no local families pushing and shoving at the buffet spread, no long check-in\u2019s like a new condo-launch queue. We took our time at breakfast, enjoying its wonderful spread and the wait staff\u2019s amazing hospitality. Someone pointed out too that the the check-in staff was the same person who\u2019d help you with the luggage and the same person who waited your table at the restaurant. We liked it \u2013 true multitaskers. We recognized many staff by face (though did not learn their names) by the end of our stay. Infinity pool all to ourselves! On the other hand: Furniture and setting really looks worn. This was noted in many reviews, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be this bad. The furniture really looked tired, and truth be told, our Corporate Suite\u2019s setting looked drab and almost depressing with those shades of brown. More ambient lighting and wall fixtures would had really spruced the place up. Problematic soundproofing. This was also noted in many reviews, and it\u2019s bad. We can hear persons along the corridor, and on several other occasions, sounds of doors slamming, what sounded like furniture moving about, water rushing down pipes etc. No view. Maybe it was that our Suite was the third floor. But right outside our room was one of those 1940s back alley where we can spot shirtless uncles going about their business of the day. We took one look on the first day and saw enough. The curtains remained closed for the rest of our stay. Missing a few amenities, e.g. no welcome fruit basket (the wife expected it), no newspaper delivery to the room, no baby toiletries (our previous stay at Capella Sentosa had a full suite of these and even a baby bathrobe laid out for our baby girl). Complimentary mini-bar had gassy drinks; a couple of juices would had been great. Housekeeping was inconsistent. This was the wife's biggest gripe. Firstly, we\u2019d expected an extra towel to be in the room as we\u2019d indicated that we had a third guest in the room (our baby girl), but this wasn\u2019t there when we checked in, so we had to call housekeeping for one. On the third day, we returned to discover that housekeeping had removed her used towel without replacing it. Handtowels were also not replaced on the third day. Used cups weren\u2019t cleaned properly. The bed cover was removed and haphazardly thrown into the wardrobe. Right behind the long sofa in the about 20cm gap between its back and the curtains was a lost sofa cushion (all dusty now), and the gap area was terrifically dusty. And one final incident really struck in our mind. On the third afternoon, a staff member rang our door bell twice fairly briskly, waking up our girl from her afternoon nap. Before we could get to the door, the staff had already opened it. Emergency? You could call it that; the staff asked if she could come in to spray the room with insecticide! Oh my. If you were at a hotel where a staff member had to come in to spray insecticide, something is seriously amiss. We declined the offer, only because we were still in the room. In all; if it wasn\u2019t for the friendly staff and that we had a generally laid-back stay, Naumi Hotel would have rated a three star experience. Some of the problems are going to be hard to rectify (e.g. depressing back alley view, sound proofing) but hotel management might want to consider others, e.g. refreshing furniture, housekeeping. We really did expect better for this room rate, but this was really not anywhere near a luxurious five star experience. We both agree that this was a four-stay at best.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "reconvilier", "Title": "\u201cExcellente surprise au coeur de Singapour\u201d", "Author": "flavio t", "ReviewID": "UR121658938", "Content": "super emplacement au milieu de 3 stations de m\u00e9tros (city hall - buggis et marina) !

Location was very good, just 5 min from City Hall MRT station and right behind Raffles Hotel. We arrived at the hotel around noon time. We were fine that the room was not ready so we went out for a walk. Later we returned to hotel and was about to check in. Guess the front desk agent would like to show up to the room while no other colleague was there, we waited for a while sitting at the counter. While waiting, the agent asked us to choose the DVD on iPad which was quite a good idea. However, the movie titles were not interesting to us so we did not choose any. Again, we were pleased to have been upgraded to deluxe room (around 55 sqm). Room was quite spacious and nicely done, though it's more \"hotel-like\" and lacks the surprising elements from New Majestic Hotel. When showing the room, the agent told me that we could not control the air conditioning directly. If we needed to adjust the temperature, we had to call the front desk. This was a bit awkward to me. For the rest, it looked quite fine to me. I was happy to have the cookies and a note from manager on the coffee table as a gesture to welcome us. Later we returned to the hotel, I could not find any slippers in the room thinking maybe they were just hidden. Surprisingly, when I called the front desk, they told me that they were running out of slippers in the hotel...I was paying SGD340++ but not even got a pair of slippers. While looking around the room, I found two personal city guides on the coffee table. The content was quite comprehensive, but I found some of the content were crossed out by ballpen and replaced by handwritten notes. I did understand the hotel might try to save some papers and hence the environment. This handwritten modification just did not look very presentable consider they claimed to be a luxury hotel. What bothered me during the stay was the login of WIFI. Whenever I needed to reconnect to the internet, I had to first open the browser with the login page and key in the passwords. This was not necessary in Wangz Hotel nor New Majestic. It should be necessary only for the first time login. The next morning, I was planning to have a coffee with a local friend. However, the service was not attentive, no waiter/waitress approached us even after sitting down for almost 10 minutes. I could hardly justify the personal luxury the hotel was claiming to provide. Breakfast was among the best compared with the other two hotels, with room for improvement to service. Nevertheless, the rooftop pool did add a credit to this hotel. Though we had tried the infinity pool of Marina Bay Sands last Dec, this pool was also recommended to have a quick swim with the sunny weather we enjoyed. We later checked out and kept the luggage in the hotel. Upon returning, we walked into the hotel and sit down, however, no one acknowledged our presence, didn't expect to have someone to offer any assistance. So we left the hotel without a warm feeling. Overall, I would say this hotel was a bit disappointing in terms of service and overpriced for its offering. If someone would like to stay, location and pool would be two of the very few reasons given other alternatives like Mandarin Oriental and St Regis with little premium in price only.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atyrau, Kazakhstan", "Title": "\u201cFabulous\u201d", "Author": "Stephanie S", "ReviewID": "UR121071354", "Content": "From the decor to the service - couldn't have asked for more.

Consequently felt like a bit of a vagrant in the hotel lobby and pool area during the times we were not in our room. Interestingly another traveler commented when she saw us at the pool area-looking suitably \u201cvagrantish\u201c-that she had had the same problem on arrival from France (she was staying at the hotel for 29 days on business and that because of this lack of early room availability, she wouldn\u2019t be back). Maybe the hotel should have one room it has available for people like us, where we can change and shower (we were offered a shower at the pool, but there was no hair drier so this wasn\u2019t ideal, and certainly wouldn\u2019t be ideal if one was on business).

This great hotel is in the shadow of the Raffles Hotel.. which is very unfortunate. Not many cab drivers know this hotel, so you have to tell them that it's nearby the Raffles Hotel. Two things about the hotel, which I thought was..so..strange.. were the infinity pool and staff's outfit. Infinity pool is much much better looking in the photos posted on the website. It is a tub-size pool overlooking roofs of ugly buildings in the neighborhood. So, don't bother brining your bikini. Secondly, the friendly staff at the hotel do not wear uniform. It is really not a big deal in terms of professional look (because most of them wore suits and looked professional), but when you have to draw their attention, it becomes problematic. There are a lot of business guests in the hotel, so it is not too easy to identify the hotel staff..when they are mixed with the guests. My suggestion? At least wear name tag or something..

Was quite most of the time, with 4-5 people pre-breakfast and even fewer late afternoon. Room service can be delivered and eaten up there.

Language sometimes a slight barrier, but the message is understood and they really do try hard to help whoever possible.

It was spacious, clean, trendy and there was soft music playing in the background which was very very thoughtful as it immediately releases stress n felt as though we werent in the city. Biscuits were served in the room, a nice gesture indeed. Pantry was awesome. What's more awesome was the heat slab to cook food with, towelettes provided in the cupboard, toasters, full set of cutlery, various types of cups, wine glasses, champagne glasses etc.. The TWG teas were aplenty, made me spoilt for choice. Bed, needless to say, was ABSOLUTELY comfy. Not too hard, not too soft. A curtain separates the living space n bedroom. Pool was okay, given the fact that it was kindaaaaa small, will be crowded if around 10 people were in it but the day i went there, there was zero people, akin to having my own private pool. Alas, it was too cold so i only spent like 10mins before freezing my skin off. The things they could have improved however, was that the breakfast selection was indeed quite minimal. Could do with more selections of fruits n stuff. The pool was lacking a \"gradient\" slope, which means either u are on land or immediately 1.3M into the pool which is VERY difficult for me to be suddenly submerged into a total different temperature. I swear my heart stopped for a minute. Other than that, I really liked the room n the way they utilized the space. OH, not to mention the HUGE tub that made me fall into slumberland whilst enjoying my TWG tea n listening to the music. Ethereal.

Excellent choice in Singapore. Its location is excellent, near every attraction you will want to visit in Singapore. City hall metro station is just two blocks from the hotel, but I think you should consider taking a taxi wherever you go, since they are inexpensive (6-8 SD) for almost any destination. But you should be aware that on certain places at specific times, just like on orchad street , taxi line can be enormous. So the cleanest metro possible is a good option. Since the hotel is new, a good reference is Seah street near raffles hotel. Take a hotel card with you. Hotel staff is amazing. Extremely professional and polite. Be aware that there is a credit card authorization charge when you arrive. Do not worry about this. Just remember when checking out to ask the staff about it, though you won't have any problem. The hotel region is safe and you cam easily walk around. Do not miss the five blocks distance Funan mall for computers, cameras and electronics . On the last floor there is an amazing electronics mega store with good prices. Coming back to Naumi, it is a beautiful boutique hotel. Hotel staff will take good care of you and are prompt to help you with anything you want. It is completely different from the huge Singaporean hotels with dozens of people trying to check in. Breakfast is good, with good and health options. Breakfast staff are also very polite. The rooms are modern, stylish, and you will get everything you want.

Arrived at the hotel after an overseas flight to check in only to be escorted to our room at the non-smoking property which reeked of cigarette smoke. Not just a single cigarette mind you, but it seemed as if the previous guest smoked heavily in the room for days. We immediately pointed this out to front desk personnel, who asked us to stay in the hot, smoky room until they sorted it all out. Fifteen minutes later with no apparent progress we went down to the lobby to see what was happening and I basically drew the conclusion that the hotel was likely sold out, there wasn't another room they could give us, hence they wanted to keep us reasonably happy and comfortable until they could figure out how to get the smoke out of the room. Figuring this was likely to be later rather than sooner, and we had just arrived from overseas, we really didn't want to hang around so we departed without staying. I did inform the front desk staff, and they were very understanding. Conclusions: the hotel staff, which was extraordinarily kind, caring and apologetic should have never checked a guest into a room in that condition. Either they were fully aware of the smoke, and should've resolved before letting us into the room or they were completely unaware in which case is evidence of a poorly run hotel. Regardless, hard to believe this place is the #1 ranked property in TA for Singapore. The smoke issue aside, the hotel (apparently previously The Metropole) seemed a bit shabby, and very far from a five star property.

The first impression of this place is 'wow'. It really does say 'boutique' from the moment you step through the front door. Cool furniture, lighting, funky music and a genuinely warm greeting from the Naumi 'aides' all contribute to the positive vibe. 'Twas off to a great start until we walked into the room (#601) which had a very strong musty, mould-like odour. For perspective: I wasn't imagining it; my partner agreed. Allergic as I am to mould, I went downstairs and asked to be moved, which, after waiting a short while for an adjacent room of the same type to be cleaned after the last guests had just left, was done with a smile. The second room (#603) was a marked improvement but there was a feint odor of mould in it also which lingered for the duration of our stay.The other disappointment is the service standards at breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays. Let me begin with breakfast on Friday was out of this world - excellent buffet, well-stocked with fresh food and what seemed like the hotel's entire management team very attentively 'working the room' actually serving guests and chatting, offering travel tips and so on. Quelle surprise on Saturday morning - it was as if we were in a different hotel. The buffet looked like a plague of locusts had stripped it bare. All but one of the four juice containers was empty. Both the buffet and the juice containers remained so untill the buffet closed. The manned eggs-to-order station of the day before had been replaced by a sign obscured among the baskets of a few slices of bread and scattered pastries. I noticed other guests were - like me - lost trying to work out whether eggs to order were available at all. Other disappointments included the elegant cloth table napkins of the day before having been replaced by two small paper cocktail napkins on both Saturday and Sunday! I just didn't get it - surely it's not about not wanting to do the laundry. Also, without their batallion of sartorially elegant collegues from the day before, the two staff who worked the room, seriously struggled to keep up. Instead of being offered coffee or tea when being seated - as had been the case the day before - you had to wave your arms repeatedly to get the attention of the staff who walked around the room with purpose - just not that purpose. Thakfully, Sunday morning was a marginal improvement but still exposed a cavernous service and image gap from the Friday. Truly great service is about consistency and not disappointing - in this respect the Naumi was a massive fail. On the plus-side, the pool is amazing and definitely not to be missed - it's a real oasis on the roof level. The staff - from Peter the hotel manager al the way down - have great service 'bones' and genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs.

I think this would go down as perhaps the \"most friendly and genuinely helpful hotel staff\" in the entire world, heh heh! Likewise, the room was well presented, very clean, and carefully tidied daily. The bed was of first-class comfort and all of the other facilities were just as you would want them. The buffet breakfast each morming had a great variety of offerings, and again, the personal attention of staff was impeccable. The manager kept us personally informed of any special information we should know.

Very much appreciated after a long flight. The taxi ride from the airport was 25 minutes in rush hour and only S$25. We were upgraded to a Corporate Suite purely because I booked through Small Luxury Hotels online (for no cost to join and a cheaper rate!) and were given late check out too. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly, professional staff. I borrowed their check in computer to print off my SIA boarding passes. Taxis were called for us, maps provided, public transport recommendations and directions to the nearest 7/11 (100m away) which stocked fresh cows milk for my toddler, were all given kindly. Room: HUGE, very modern, VERY CLEAN and beautifully decorated. You could live in this place! Twice/Three times the size of your average Tokyo or Hong Kong 4/5 star room! The aircon was fully adjustable and there were good curtains to keep out daylight when we needed to catch up on sleep. The rooms were very quiet too and we heard no street noise or noise from corridors or other rooms. We therefore didn't mind that the view was only of a quiet back lane, nor did we have a desire to look outside! There were electric sockets above the desk for both English/Singapore plugs and Australian plugs which suited me as I had stuff that needed each! There was a large lounge with a long couch, several guidebooks, a 50 inch Samsung LCD showing 14 channels (CNN, BBC, Australia news/kids shows, HBO movies, Malay, Bloomberg, CNBC etc) and BOSE DVD/speaker set, relaxing chair, a desk and chair and multiple choices of lighting that were good for not waking up our toddler whose cot we put in here. The good sized bedroom had a VERY comfortable and slightly firm, king (maybe emperor?) sized bed with lowish soft pillows and toddler cries in the night aside, we slept very well. In the bedroom was a 40 inch LCD. radio alarm clock with ipod/iphone dock, many sets/shades of lights and 3 wardrobes with plenty of hanging space. There was a long, snuggly pillow in one wardrobe which is popular in Asia and for pregnant sleepers. The very large bathroom was as big as the bedroom and had a large rain shower, large bath which was great for both the adults and bathing the toddler. Hair dryer, robes and toiletries were provided as expected from this class of hotel. There was a 5m mirrored hall leading from the lounge to the front door. Near the door were the kitchenette that had a table, 2 chairs, a wine fridge for about 20 bottles should you feel the need!, a large normal fridge and freezer, sink, kettle, 'George Clooney' Nescafe Espresso machine with 3 choices of coffee, and microwave. Cans of Coke, Coke light (diet), sprite, bottled water, diet coke, ginger ale were free and replaced the next day on request. Room service of a couple of free glasses of wine and a fruit platter were given to us due to joining Small Luxury Hotels. There were plates, cutlery, glasses etc which were great as we got takeaway from a popular locals Chinese restaurant a couple of doors down the road. My toddler loved roasted chicken and steamed rice for S$3.80. Also near the front door was a store room where the iron and ironing board were kept and a golf umbrella. We were able to keep our pram in here the room was so big. All in all, the kitchenette, store room and hall alone were the size of some Tokyo hotel rooms! Breakfast: For us was fantastic. Imagine a Hilton breakfast with slightly less hot choices but still so much that you're stuffed for the day but still wish you had room for something else that you saw on your third visit of getting food! There was still more than enough though. 5 hot choices that were changed a little daily (Chinese vegies, sausages in herbs, bacon, hash browns, mushrooms, baked beans etc), eggs freshly cooked on request any way including lovely omlettes, on request hot waffles cooked in front of you, about 5 tropical fruits plus Euro fare of bananas/apples etc, yogurts, mueslis, cereals (no kellogs), Jacobs Creek sparkling wine!, brewed to order pots of tea or coffees, 4 fruit juices, cheeses, hams, salmon, about 6 breads, about 6 Danishes, croissants, a few different muffins, waldorf salad, potato salad and more! The rooftop pool is a great feeling to swim in as you look at the amazing panoramic view of the city, perfect temperature and young kids not allowed. There was a few people sunbathing. It closes at about 6pm and there are sometimes functions there that we saw people arriving for in the lifts but never heard any noise from. Negatives: Despite my glowing review there a few nitpicking things that some people may not like but probably can't be helped and are worth including in case it turns someone off: - Pronunciation of the name! I just got a free map from the Arrivals desk at Singapore airport and pointed to it to show my cabbie. It's one block away from Raffles Hotel. - No washing up detergent provided to wash up with. This was essential for washing my toddlers' milk bottles. However, on asking house keeping, they gave us some. - Aircon resets to 22C each time you take out the keycard to leave the room. This is personal preference but for us, 22C was a little too cool in the lounge and we had to always remember to put it up to 23 or 24. - Wireless internet was free and fast however the instructions on how to use it seemed to be wrong/I didn't comprehend. A quick call to reception had me online in seconds though! - Cost. S$450 a night. It was well worth it but it isn't a price many people are able to pay. - Occasional clunking sound of the aircon getting rid of ice. This was heard about once every 6 hours. If that is the worse we found in a tropical, foreign country, this place should be Tripadvisor No. 1!

We chose to stay at Naumi because the first time we stayed there in 2009, we experienced probably one of the nicest hotel rooms we had stayed in. So we thought we\u2019d give them another go. Also, because they are rated in the Small Luxury Hotels of the World. Check-in/Lobby: The hotel itself is a boutique hotel. It isn\u2019t a Hyatt or Westin \u2013 but that is what we love about it. It is located on Seah Street, and if you catch the MRT from the airport, the best station to get off from is City Hall. If you get off at City hall, it is about a 5-10 minute walk to the hotel. Not a bad walk, and not a big issue. We had 2 full sized luggage bags and carry on wheeled luggage and had no problems. On arrival at the hotel on the 9th of July, we were greeted by a very friendly staff member who was waiting by the door for us, and proceeded to go through the check-in procedures. Welcome drink, Free cocktail voucher, A verbal tour of the room, and more. She was VERY nice and really made us feel welcome into the hotel. Room: We got into the room, and they had given us a free upgrade to a Patio Suite. We stayed in room 403, which was absolutely lovely. The patio is very large, and the room itself is very spacious. The finishes are immaculate and fantastic. The design is \u201cmirrored and PLUSH!\u201d There was a living room, with rotating 50 inch LCD TV, a couch, coffee table, and a kitchen type area with a Nespresso machine, TWG tea, and bar fridge stocked with complimentary softdrinks.

I have stayed in many hotels, but Naumi has by far the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. WOW. The room is well maintained, and clean. Minimal signs of significant wear and tear. Room 403 is BIG! Last time we stayed at Naumi we stayed in an even bigger suite (Also an upgrade) and that one was even more impressive \u2013 no patio, but the useable indoor area was as big as my own homes living space! Bathroom: All I can say is that it is very spacious. Well designed. Only 1 sink, but the room is more than adequate. They get huge gold stars for already having toothbrushes, ear buds etc provided, which just shows that they are trying to make you comfortable. The shower has both a rain shower and a standard handheld, and is clean and has Molton Brown amenities. Robes are big, fluffy and comfy. And slippers are of a beautiful design and comfortable. Impressed. Restaurant: We only had breakfast in the hotel and it was great. They make custom omelettes which were made to perfection. The standard buffet has all what you would expect from a 5 star hotel, and Naumi did well with this given it is a boutique hotel. They had Cucumber juice, which I\u2019d never had before, and this was one of the most refreshing drinks ever. Nothing to complain about here. It was a perfect start to the day. Service: The one thing that I can say about Naumi to convince anyone to stay there is that I have NEVER had better service in a hotel than we did during our stay. The 2 girls at the desk were fantastic. They were attentive, and very helpful. They listened, and seemed to have genuine interest in our day to day affairs without being nosy. They seemed to really love their job and seemed to really be happy to see us. Even more impressive was that they overheard that it was my girlfriend birthday, and on our return to the hotel that day, they brought a Tiramisu cake out while we were relaxing in the lobby area. It was so thoughtful and absolutely beautiful to taste. We were so touched by this\u2026 I am so impressed with this hotel that I can see no reason not to continue staying there every time I stay in Singapore. Both my girlfriend and I put it in our top 3 hotels worldwide, and would highly recommend this to anyone staying in Singapore. It is easy to get around from there. Other hotels that I have stayed in recently: Suba International (India), Westin (Melbourne), W Hotel (Hong Kong), Paramount (NYC), Peabody (Memphis) and in Singapore: Swissotel, Raffles (Crap) and Le Meridien (Kota Kinabalu).

From the time of our check in to our check out, we were made to feel truly special and not just paying clients. Let me start with the rooms. We had a junior corporate suite- beautifully appointed. We are a family of two adults and two small children. Although the suite is huge, with a bedroom, a kitchenette, a big bathroom with a bathtub (gorgeous) and a separate shower cubicle and a living/dining area; there was still no room for an extra bed. We were assured that the sofa would be made up as an extra bed and it was true. The sofa is huge and the bed which was made could comfortably sleep an adult as well! The kitchenette was excellent, with a medium size fridge (big enough for a week's provisions), a hot plate, crockery and cutlery and the icing- your very own Nespresso machine with unlimited supply of coffee capsules. There was free hi speed wi-fi all over. There is an infinity pool on the 10th floor and though it's not big, but it's sufficient and with great views to boot. The in room dining was great, prompt and had VEGETARIAN options, which in Singapore mean a huge lot to someone like me (the only vegetarian in the family). The breakfast is an elaborate affair, with someone always looking after your needs. My fussy <two toddler was treated to the sausages he had to have even though they were not part of the menu that morning. We thoroughly enjoyed it. And the people who keep it all going smoothly- the staff who have been excellently trained. The smile goes way beyond the face, the girls at the front desk never hesitating for even a breath before loading our strollers into cabs or stowing them away for later use!

The service was excellent - what one would expect from a smaller boutique hotel and restaurant. We had a corporate room - very spacious with two large TVs and plenty of area to lounge around. The only negatives were the ordinary view from the second floor (facing away from the street) and being at a lower level you get a few more of the occasional slamming door noises and street noise. For a better view it was worth going to the rooftop pool where there were never any more than a few other people if anyone. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on - I've slept thousands of nights on beds away from home and this one was the winner. The fridge was reasonable sized unit rather than the usual dodgy tiny bar fridge that struggles to accomodate supermarket bought drinks and snacks. There were some very minor maintenance issues (shower handle that came off in your hand etc) , but there weren't any of the usual things that de-rate a room terribly such as cracked tiles or mysterious carpet stains. The price wasn't cheap but no worse than any other hotels in the the same class in Singapore - we had breakfast included. Room service prices were comparable to any other quality hotel.

I arrived early this trip and our room wasn't ready, which was understandable, but they took the effort and time to reassure us that the room would be available as soon as possible, and was in 45 min. By the time we went to grab a bite and came back to our hotel, our bags where already in the room. Check-out is fast, instead of a paper receipt I asked them to e-mail me my receipt, which was done almost instantly without any hassle. I usually stay in the Premier room, which is very spacious. For the price you pay you get a small living area, desk and kitchenette with a Nespresso machine - great value! Sound insulation is a problem - you can often hear upstairs neighbours showering, the hotel is aware of the issue, and provide you with a pair of earplugs for undisturbed sleep. They use Molton Brown toiletries now as opposed to Kiehl's, which was better. Molton Brown has a very masculine smell to it; not as gender neutral as Kiehl's. The complimentary mini-bar selection is also smaller compared to before, but at least they are progressive enough to make the mini-bar free. The inside of the toilet bowl was a bit stain-y, which is something that should be fixed. Water pressure in the shower is great and the tubs are nice and big.

Our last stay was in a 5 star hotel and we thought this year, we decide upon a boutique hotel. I always looked upon Trip advisor for hotel ratings and I\u2019m split minded between Naumi and Quincy. We decided on Naumi due to its overwhelming good reviews. I want to see what that special gem about Naumi is. (18/05/2011)We reached the hotel at 11.30am. One person that I really feel worth commended for is this lady by the name of Yu-Yan and I will tell you why. She welcomed us warmly upon entering the reception. She swiftly does all the documentation needed. It just caught me by surprise that if we were to use a debit card for our stay in this hotel, we have to put a $200 deposit. I never had that experience before with any other hotels but Yan explained to me carefully with detailed explanation on the deposit required. That was over and done with fast too. She could not checked us in earlier as the hotel is full but offered us to put our luggage at the hotel while we could wander around the streets near the hotel. We went to catch a movie. We went back to the hotel at 3pm again greeted by Yan. We were just about to ask about our luggage, she had informed us that our luggage had already been sent up to our room. Now this is what I call efficiency. During my other hotel stays, checking in will be just getting our room keys and we just going up to our room but Yan escorted us up to our room. We had booked the corporate suite and we were put on the 2nd level of the hotel. Yan brought us in to our room, explaining some of the details of the room and comprehensive details about the complimentary espresso and mini bar. The suite is really big. For the amount we paid for, I think we could only stay in a deluxe room in any 5 or 6 star hotels here. Room is spacious, nice living area, huge bathroom and of course the most complimented for, the great comfortable bed\u2026It\u2019s like you\u2019re being wrapped up in a cocoon once you\u2019re under the sheets. We had our unpacking and rest, 45 minutes later, Yan called us and mentioned that since it\u2019s our anniversary, the hotel is sending us up a complimentary cake and fruit platter and let me tell you the cake is deeeeeeeeeeelicious\u2026wonder what cake it was. Around 5.00 pm, another call was received and this time, the hotel offered complimentary welcome drinks for us. 2 staff brought us a fruit platter again and fruit juice. This hotel just couldn\u2019t surprise us enough. Breakfast on the second day was ok, wished there is one main dish like fried noodle or something. But the staffs that served us during breakfast is fabulous. From the moment you stepped in the breakfast area, they serve you up to you stepped out. There is this one Indian lady who is so attentive to our needs, from coffee, to juices, to how we like our eggs\u2026.very impressive\u2026 We went to Universal Studios and only reached the hotel back at around 4pm. Our room had been made, just one thing to point out though, the toiletries are not replenished, eg, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner. Hence, we have to use 1 bottle for our 3 day stay. We went to take a dip at the pool later. Small pool but nice with such a fantastic view. When we reached back our room, housekeeping is doing their evening turning down service. The supervisor was with the housekeeping people and told us that we could still come to our room. I guess the housekeeping is a bit stressed that we are there as they left the room, yes, made up, but with the bathroom\u2019s bin in the living area and replenish us with 1 towel instead of 2, but well, that\u2019s just a minor thing. We were also provided with complimentary mineral water from the hotel. We loaned the X box from the hotel and it was sent up to us quickly. The breakfast on the 3rd day was still ok, variety changed a bit but service is still fantastic. We left the hotel at 11.30 am with much hesitant though. Again Yan checked us out smoothly and called us a cab. To future guests of this hotel, this hotel may not be huge or have a \u2018wow\u2019 building to start with, but to me, the staff completes the hotel. As I\u2019ve mentioned, Yan was worth commended for as she just really took us under her wings and really treated us being special and took care of our needs with a smile. Mind you, in some hotels once they know that we are locals, service provided to us is much lower than provided for the tourists. However, she equally provide us exceptional service leaving us feeling very homey in this hotel.My partner is also in the hotel industry and had worked with several hotels but he himself found this hotel a gem indeed and the gem is indeed the staff themselves. Peter Wong, the GM of this hotel must had put great effort in training his staff and putting this hotel a standout among the rest of the 5 or 6 star hotels in Singapore. It\u2019s a no wonder you\u2019re Number 1 hotel In Singapore. One thing never changed me and my spouse\u2019s mind when we stepped out of the hotel, if we have the chance, our next staycation will still be here\u2026Naumi\u2026its your own personal luxury indeed :) Guests From Room 202.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic little gem n Singapore\u201d", "Author": "JVWDV", "ReviewID": "UR109029229", "Content": "A very friendly and comfortable hotel, next to Raffles.

I especially liked the home made mango yoghurt. Another nice plus is that Naumi offers a lot of extras: Nespresso machine in the room, huge LCD TV, free drinks in the minibar, two free drinks in the hotel bar, free WiFi, free bottled water, free cookies upon arrival, free swimming pool and gym, free iPhone charger, etc. Negative points are few and far between: the airco can be a bit loud, but it wasn't an issue for me.

We truly appreciate this gesture as it shows the staff were constantly thinking about how to make their guests more comfortable. The room was large with separate bedroom and living room, and had a kitchen bar counter with all the necessary appliances (and Nespresso machine!). The bed was extremely cozy and comfortable as well.

However taxis in Singapore are so easy and efficient to use in Singapore I recommend them rather than the highly efficient MRT. Our welcome was lovely and we were upgraded to a lovely suite. It was only one floor up but Seah street is so quiet we couldn't hear the traffic at all. The rooms are very well appointed, with coffee maker, i-pod speakers etc. Bathroom and shower facilities are great and the king size bed was soooo comfy.

You can walk to most areas of town in about 20 minutes and you are literally across the street from Raffles, which has a lovely complex to walk through, especially in the evening (after a Singapore Sling!). The pool area on the roof is also pretty cool, with great views to the Marina Bay hotel, overlooking raffles, padang square and the twinkling lights of the financial district - a small pool area, but normally you have it to yourself, so no problem. Great to enjoy a cocktail or beer as the sun sets. The hotel is a \"design\" hotel - so some cool features - but the rooms have a bit of an ikea thing going on - and as it is now a bit bashed about you can see the fittings are not top quality. Some of the surfaces are stained where glasses have sat too, so my first impression was that the room was dirty, which is was not. The bed we had was large and very comfortable, but the aircon was very loud and we were woken on several occasions by a loud noise we attributed to our neighbour's shower. The management did look into this when we complained, and it did not happen again during our stay - so perhaps fixed. The room was a decent size (I'm told quite big for singapore, but I live in Dubai so the room felt small!), but the ceilings being low-ish (style of the building) meant it did not feel spacious - nor the hallways. Spacious is luxury. The breakfast is ok, nothing special. If you have ever stayed in a 5 star hotel in Dubai, breakfast a Naumi looks very thin. Fruit, pastries, omlettes cooked to order, but essentially the same thing everyday, got bored pretty quickly....again, nice, but not \"luxury\". My husband and I have been spoiled by some amazing hotels around the world, so for us, Naumi comes no where close to a luxury hotel. We thought it was cute, good service, comfortable, great location and cool pool, but we felt it was overpriced and over-promised on the \"luxury\", which it really is not. In fact, it reminds me of the spanish budget chain NH Hotels - only with a fantasy price tag, that we stupidly paid.

All three of the rooms are compact, top class, and again with full attention to detail, the Naumi provides bottles of water, fresh towels and changing facilites in situ. The reception/breakfast/foyer/lounge area is discretely scented with jasmine and lemongrass and sounds oh-so-quietly of cool jazz, and 80s soul which plays positively on your mood before you leave for your city visits or business activities.

Great views over the city, never crowded, always sparkling clean, well above any traffic, and whatever the weather they manage to keep the water temperature at the perfect cooling level.

My niece commented that while it was smack right beside the Raffles Hotel, Naumi Hotel (even though unknown to many of the cabbies) was far from the services of other standard hotels. It was personal, so to speak. It did not echo of in-your-face amenities. As you walked into its ordinary looking but pleasantly smelling lobby, you wouldn't think that the bedrooms were to die for. We booked for 3 corporate suites but got one upgraded to a luxury suite and when we (a party of 6) saw our rooms, we were flabbergasted at the size and amenities here. The 10 storey building houses only 40 rooms (which meant about 5 rooms to each floor) so you could imagine how sprawling the rooms were. Even breakfast was not elaborate but a seriously healthy meal. Although the rooftop pool was small, Singapore was not designed for swimming R&R. The Molton Brown toiletries were there to pamper you. The closets were so huge that you probably could move in with all your clothes for the year. There's a Nespresso and TWG tea at your pleasure. And the drinks in the minibar are on the house. With a smiling face and so much personal touch - from the time you check in to the the time they say adieu, I highly recommend that Naumi Hotel be on everyone's list when they come to Singapore. Raffles is just beside if you want luxury goods and Bugis junction is at the back if you need to shop for moderate items. And the whole Seah street (and its surrounding arteries) are surrounded with great food shops that you don't need to go far just to have a great Singaporean meal. Just a friendly advice - ask a card from the front desk so that you can show it to the ignorant cab driver who hasn't heard of Naumi. Can you blame them?

It turned out to be everything we expected, with many more unexpected pleasures. It's a great little hotel, very stylishly designed with an eye to detail to ensure their guests' comfort, in a very quiet but convenient location next to shopping malls, food courts and restaurants, backed up with very friendly and personalised service. The biggest plus for us was the very large Deluxe room in a 'suite' format with separate living and sleeping areas that can be curtained off, giving one the right balance between space and privacy. The very comfortable king-size bed have a range of pillow options and they ensured we got only hypo allergenic pillows and comforters as I'm allergic to down. The kitchenette area comes fitted with tea/coffee makers, microwave oven, toaster, a large fridge, and a range of stylish crockery and cutlery; there's an ironing board with iron, yoga mat and umbrella; plenty of wardrobe space; a bathroom the size of a small bedroom with separate shower stall and free-standing bathtub, with slippers, robes, hair dryer and Molton Brown toiletries. The higher floor rooms have fantastic views of the Singapore skyline, and an evening spent by the poolside overlooking the dazzling Singapore night lights can be as exciting or as romantic as one wants. The hotel has a lobby level bar and coffee shop, and a small gym and yoga room. No huge lobby, no glitzy shops and restaurants, just quiet and cozy luxury. And all this at a price that's cheaper than suite rooms in 5* luxury hotels in Singapore.

Reading the reviews about the hotel has made me decided to try it. Beside, it also close to Raffles Hospital so it will only take few minutes getting there from the hotel. When I told my wife that I'll be staying at Naumi this time around, she kind of puzzle : What ? Where is it?. Telling her that it near Raffles Hotel and Raffles Hospital make my choice sensible to her. I made online booking, and checked in on Friday, November 19, 2010 for 2 nights at Premium Room. Well, nothing much I can say about this 32 m2 room (the area mostly taken up by the bathroom with standing shower) and the hotel facilities, except that the people serving me are quite friendly. Of course it is very quite. It's a very small hotel and there are only 40 rooms. I supposed to check out on November 21, 2010, but something came up so I have to extend my stay in Singapore for another two nights. Because of my first impression about the hotel, actually at first I decided to move and look for another hotel for my next stay. But somehow, while looking for another hotels, I happened to visit Naumi website and when I checked the room availability for November 21-23, I can get Corporate Suite (60-70 m2) at a cheaper rate that I have paid for my previous room. Well, thinking of the troublesome of moving to another hotel that I might have, then I cancelled my previous plan to check in to other hotel and decided to stay for another two nights at Naumi. I got no complain about the room. My complain is when I am about to check out on November 23, 2010, since I had an evening flight on the way back to Jakarta from Singapore. Therefore, I asked the lady in charge if I can get late check-out until say 3 o'clock. Of course I know that the standard checking out time is 12.00. But hey, its been also countless of time not only in Singapore but also in the other part of the world, the hotels allow us - the guests - to have late check-out whenever it is possible. 1 o'clock is the standard, 3 o'clock is something that you can thanks for the gratitude and 5 o'clock is not something that I never had as late-time check out. Once again, provided there is no guests coming in and will be using your room. Of course the lady told me that Naumi's standard check-out time is 12.00, and there will be new guest coming in and using my room, so I have to leave the room at 12.00. I told her that I know that is the standard check-out time, so I ask \"What is the best you can do for me to have a late check-out as my flight is in the evening\". The same answer she gave me: \"Sorry, there will be a new guest coming in and will be using your room. So the best I can do is for you to have late check-out at 12.30, and you can leave the luggage with us and you can use shower room at the Pool\". Of course nothing much I can say, except that I have to check out at 12.30 at the latest. And that is what I did, exactly at 12.30 I checked out and left the hotel. However, I might have to tell you that before I left the hotel, I checked again the hotel website and when I tried to make online reservation for checking-in on November 23, 2010 at the hotel, hey...there is Corporate Suite available if you would like to check-in on that day. It might or might not be the same Corporate Suite that I stayed for 2 nights, as I don't know exactly how many Corporate Suite the hotel has. But why shall I care? They don't even care to give me another 60 minutes or 90 minutes for the room which I still need, especially when no one is going to stay at the room on that day. I blame myself for too much to expect, but don't blame me if that is the only thing that I remember after my 4 nights staying at this hotel", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cunique and contemporary, fantastic service\u201d", "Author": "missydio", "ReviewID": "UR87947024", "Content": "Naumi Hotel is a beautiful, hip boutique hotel in Singapore.

Those who are suckers for aesthetics (present company included) gravitate to these experiments in accommodation, and often times that's exactly what they are: exercises in form over function. You so badly want to like the place, but flaws in design render the place less than ideal. A bathroom out of Wallpaper Magazine is alluring to the eye...until you find that the shower is such that water spills out onto the main bathroom floor. Or the bed, whose linens you want to smuggle home in your luggage, offers all the comfort of a rec room beanbag. Or the front desk/concierge personnel -- decked out in fabulous ensembles -- have zero inclination to be of help, and lack the courtesy to offer so much as a smile. There are hotels -- many of them of the old guard -- that offer great service. And there are quite a few who give great attention to design. Naumi is the rare place that accomplishes both beautifully. Naumi has only 40 some-odd rooms, which allows the staff to give you personalized attention. Singapore is a foodie's paradise and the front desk was enthusiastic to recommend their favorite local, off-the-beaten-path food hawker centers. Public transportation in Singapore is world-class, but bus maps are difficult to find. No worries: a concierge will give you not one -- but two convenient routes -- to the Botanical Gardens in the more remote/expat area of town. The rooms are, in a word, sexy. Amber back lighting behind the headboard gives the room an attractive hue. The bathroom, even in the smaller Deluxe/standard 52sqm rooms, offers plenty of space (and Kiehl's products...yar!). iPod deck, LCD TV, DVD player, work desk, power A/C, etc. Naumi's rooftop pool is every bit as inviting as it appears on the website. And the location is an easy 3-minute walk to the City Hall MRT stop. ...and Naumi knows all of this. I secured a reasonable \"early bird rate\" in the spring for my 3-night September visit back when Naumi was a relatively unknown quantity. When I contacted the sales manager about securing the same rate on my return trip a couple of weeks later, my request was met with incredulity. She suggested that she had no idea how I got that initial rate to begin with and couldn't come close -- and you can't really blame her. As the 40-room Naumi continues to establish its reputation as the only 5-star quality boutique accommodation in an expensive hotel market, I suspect the days of locking in anything under $315 SG are over. Still, given the exorbitant rates you'll pay elsewhere, the Naumi might still be your best bet -- even at the higher rates.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA lovely hotel - comfortable, friendly, professional with nice little touches to make the stay very pleasant.\u201d", "Author": "SVLT_London", "ReviewID": "UR79199590", "Content": "A lovely boutique hotel - rooms are 'contemporary chic', location is good, staff are friendly.

The lobby is very nice, it also serves as the breakfast room and/or bar. I really liked the white sofas and turquoise decor. The check-in was very easy and the staff was friendly, as expected. I believe we got an upgrade so the room was almost a suite, very nicely designed. There is a little lounge with a flat screen tv that swivels around and faces the bed. There was a little kitchenette in the closet, we did not really need it but I assume it would be useful for a business traveler. There was also a nespresso machine in the room with complimentary capsules, a nice touch. The best part was the bed, it was by far the most comfortable bed I have slept on in a hotel. The bathroom had a shower and a large bathtub and it was full of Kiehls products. The breakfast was cute, but certainly not the type of buffer fair you get in another hotels in Singapore, i.e. Mandarin Oriental etc. Nonetheless, everything was freshly prepared and did not miss anything but it was more in the \"Western\" style, eggs, muffins, cereal etc. Another plus to the hotel is the really cool rooftop pool that they have. We did not manage to go during the day but it was a nice spot to have a drink at night with a view of the skyline, we were lucky because it was not unbearably hot that night.

Naumi is in a fanstastic location, which along with the general design of the place is why I picked it. I wasn't disappointed, and I can't imagine going back to the Grand Hyatt again after such a nice experience - albeit not perfect. Pros: Design concept, rendered consistently throughout the hotel, is lovely. Rooms are exquisite, both luxurious and practical for the most part. Staff is attentive, cordial, and helpful for the most part. Checkin and Checkout were both at strange hours (typical Singapore!), and it was very nice to have a great customer experience at the start and at the end of my stay. I loved the room. It was large, the amenities by Kiehls were quite nice, and the audio/video system had been well thought out. An ingenious 360-degree extra large flat panel Philips screen enables entertainment in both the living area and the bedroom. Another nice touch: you can pull the curtains around to separate the living from the sleeping areas, including a 90-degree, rounded corner. Effect: luxurious. The rooftop pool and lounge area has a stunning view onto metro Singapore. Glass infinity pool with a view - what's not to like? Cons: Food was unimpressive. I had several meals delivered to the room, and was consistently nonplussed. A shame considering the location of the hotel is in an epicenter of good, inexpensive local food. Instead of eating in, simply go out into the neighborhood for great local food at very reasonable prices.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "logesoz", "ReviewID": "UR66813120", "Content": "We really enjoyed this hotel, the small touches were wonderful, good location near Raffles City and literally across the road from the famous Raffles Hotel - went for an overrated, overpriced Singapore Sling there, which could have been avoided, probably been better to stay at Naumi Bar which looked delightful.

The person helping us offered to send our luggage to our room while we went out for lunch. Once the hour was up, and when we returned, we were whisked to our room... It was fabulous! Wifey was impressed with the size of the room, and with the decor. I had mentioned in my booking that we were there to celebrate 13 years of marriage... and then thought nothing of it. Within 30 minutes of checking in, we heard the doorbell go off.. and were presented with a warm chocolate cake! Well presented, warm plate and went fantastically with a Nespresso-brewed coffee and TWG Singapore-spice tea.. Yums! The service was consistently good through the duration of our stay. Other than the mandatory shopping trips, we also chose to hide in our room, going through 3 VCDs of the movies we'd been meaning to catch.... All in, it was a lovely experience... a wonderful 'staycation'! We truely felt like we were in a different world from our everyday Singapore lives. One thing I reallly need to mention is the wonderful mattress and pillows in the room... we found sleep to be easy, and of exceptional quality (perhaps it's because our kids weren't around to bounce in them while we were sleeping? :) lol) I would encourage a stay at the Naumi... it's going to surprise you!", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cBest Boutique Hotel in Singapore - Without a Doubt\u201d", "Author": "Shawn_Zoe", "ReviewID": "UR65851104", "Content": "This place is awesome. Location is just opposite Raffles Hotel and Mall, and also very close to the City Hall MRT station (underground train).

Walking into this hotel, I knew I had made the right choice - classy modern decor, great vibe, friendly staff. I stayed in the Corporate Suite room. Never have I stayed in a room so large (and I believe it is unusual for Singapore hotels to have big rooms). The room had two large plasma screen tvs, automatic controls for everything, modern clean decor, king size bed etc. As I was staying here for a romantic getaway with my wife for our one year wedding anniversary I was very picky about a number of things and had organised a limo service, large bouquet of flowers for the room, bottle of wine, massage, and seafood on arrival for my wife (she deserves it all!). The staff at Naumi organised this efficiently and without any problems. I consider this to be one of the best hotel experiences I have had - in a nutshell, I would describe it as a 5 star luxury boutique hotel experience, but at a reasonably affordable price (i.e. thousands less than the well known luxury hotels). I booked through Trip Advisor & Expedia and saved lots. Other brief comments: the gym is small, which means enough stuff for cardio but if you use weights, don't bother.

For the down side. Because it is an old building, there is quite a lot of noise that obvioiusly comes from shakey water pipes or whatever. Also, the room was spoiled when we opened the blinds.

We were looking for a centrally located, small hotel with some character at a reasonable price, & the hotel delivered superbly on all of these. I would definitely stay here again; it's a great choice if you're an independent traveler & staying for a few days or more. The hotel has a terrific location, within walking distance to major museums, good bars/restaurants & shops. It's on a quiet street right around the corner from the Raffles Hotel. It never took more than 5 minutes for a cab to arrive (easiest if you ask the hotel to call you one, especially during rush hour or rain). It is not a particularly cool or hip place - I wouldn't expect to be hanging out in the lounge here - but it is a quiet place with some character & good service. The rooftop pool is not huge but is nice, with a big open view & great relaxing chairs to hang out on. The front desk staff were friendly & relatively efficient. However, we did have one problem which irked us - we asked for a cab to be called 30 minutes in advance for us, but when we arrived downstairs expecting the cab to be there, it hadn't been called, so we had to wait another 10 minutes for the cab to be called & arrive, which made us late for our appointment. The major positive for us - & the reason why we'd stay again - was our room. It was really spacious, with a comfortable living area separated from the bedroom by a large flat panel TV that swiveled to either side, a large separate work area with professional multi-line phone, & a good-sized bathroom with separate shower stall & very nice, huge new soaking tub. There was plenty of light, & the a/c was easily controlled. There was a nice bar area with sink, Nespresso machine, very nice tea selection, hot water kettle, toaster, burner & even a microwave oven & large refrigerator/freezer! All hidden nicely in the closet. My only gripe is that there was no minibar - only a few sodas in the fridge. We would have preferred the fridge be stocked with more usual items (water, fruit juices, crackers, wine, etc). There was also a yoga mat in the closet, which seemed brand new when I used it. I wouldn't have minded if I had had to stay in this room for a few days or more. The doors are a bit thin so you can hear people talking in the hall, as well as people talking loudly from within their rooms, but I suppose you could just ask for a room farther away from the lift. In general, our room was very quiet, & we slept really well with the curtains drawn. The bed was really comfortable, & it was nice to have a full down body pillow as well!

The mini bar has a microwave oven, nespresso, fully equipped with wine glasses to spoon and forks, at the bottom part of the bar is a wine chiller that I think can hold around 9 bottles of wine. When our guests entered the room, all that I can hear is \u201cOh My God\u201d \u201cWOW\u201d \u201cAMAZING\u201d which made me feel good. After our solemnization we went to the rooftop for a picture taking. We were so amazed and I have no doubt that it has the best view of Singapore. It has an infinity pool and lounge chairs where you can relax while looking at the fantastic view of the city skyline. It is very irresistible to take photos on the rooftop. After a very long day we have accommodated more than 20 guests on our suite, I\u2019m very thankful to the very spacious living room.

The pool is located on the top of the building, since this is a boutique hotel, don't expect a lap pool. Nonetheless, the pool length is not too shabby, you can't exercise in it, but you definitely can swim few strokes inside.

The lobby of the hotel seemed to be bare and uninviting but overall check in was fast, but when brought up to our room it was not ready, not really a big problem but waiting for about 30 minutes can be a bit frustrating. When we got into the our room, we found out that the extra bed we paid for was just a bed sheet and blanket on the in room sofa, which it self is hard. The other chair in the room although looks comfortable is surprisingly hard. The room seemed outdated wood floor was worn but overall decent size and bathroom was big, the bed is probably the best thing about it, very comfortable. Complimentary mini bar is drinks only, no alcohol or snacks as one previous person said, and even tough we paid for 3 persons we were only given 2 bottles of water. If you do use extra glass cups be sure to rinse it cause I don't think they wash them. On our first night there there was a party on the roof top pool, not a big deal but the music was so so loud we could her it from the our room until about 1 AM, our TV was also broken, we called the front desk about 7 PM to tell them, it wasn't until about 10 PM until they got replacement that they put on the coffee table. Some of the the towels in the bathroom had holes in them which I was not expecting considering the \"luxury\" status they claim. Amenities in the bathroom was good but they did not refill them, we had used half of the shampoo and bath gel and did not get replacements. Breakfast was very minimal and on the last day ended up eating outside. The really nice thing about the hotel are the staff, very helpful and always smiling especially one of the waiters. Forgot his name but think he is of Indian decent and wears glasses, always has a smile on his face. They did offer to waive the extra $100/night for the extra person, but not until we complained. Location is nice, not to far from the MRT and next to Raffles, but because Singapore can be hot, we ended up taking the taxi most of the time. Because its a fairly new hotel, not all the taxi's know the location, so just tell them the street.

First, the good parts: the bed, shower, and size of rooms are excellent. The in-room facilities (we were in a deluxe room), and complimentary soft drinks are great, and the rates are pretty reasonable. The rooftop pool is just wonderful. However, on the first night of our stay (when my boyfriend had just got off a 12 hour flight - he was spending 36 hours in Singapore before getting the same flight back) - we were woken up at 11pm by a staff member turning on the light and ushering another couple into our room. We were totally surprised, particularly as the staff just said 'Oh, sorry!' and slammed the door! When I sweetly mentioned what had happened the next morning at reception, I was met with blank, disbelieving looks and 'We will look into that.' We hoped for some kind of apology at some point during our stay but one never came. Breakfast can be served either in the bar/lobby (which smells a bit hospital-like), so we ordered to the room. This cost $70. After 45 minutes, tiny portions of stone-cold eggs, dry cold toast and cold coffee arrived. They had completely forgotten the main part of the set breakfast, some chicken concoction. It was the kind of breakfast one might expect in a 2* Ibis, with butter in tiny tabs. When we sent it back, we got a suspicious chap who actually tested the coffee to make sure we were telling the truth. Very out-of-sorts, we got dressed and went next door to the Empire Cafe at Raffles where breakfast for both of us was $25. After that, we had breakfast in the bar/lobby every morning, which was far more decent and they even considerately put out asprins and vitamins. To cut a long story short, in our experience, this is a good hotel for the business traveler looking for something less corporate in Singapore. It's smack bang in the business district which is central but there's nothing really around it (except Raffles, which just made me wish I was staying there). Nuami is not set up for food at all, and doesn't quite live up to its proported luxury credentials.

I have never come across this flexibility before, especially in the larger more corporate hotels. The pool has a great view and although small was never crowded.

The positives: Check in was quick and efficient and the reception staff was nice without being over-friendly. The room was large (got a deluxe room), the bed was very comfortable and the rooftop pool is excellent with an amazing view of Raffles Hotel and the city - definitely the highlight of the hotel. Wifi was fast and free, and the everything in the mini bar (a few softdrinks) were complimentary. The location was excellent, just right beside the Raffles Hotel and there are a lot of small restaurants nearby and walking distance to several malls. But it's the little details that make a hotel truly a 'luxury' hotel, and unfortunately Naumi doesn't come up to standard. Firstly, some areas of the hotel are starting to look a bit worn, such as the furniture in the lobby/dining area (it's white so shows wear quite quickly), there were a lot of stains on the stone floor of the 4/F hallway (where we stayed, can't say if it's the same for all floors) when you step off the elevator. I notice these things quickly but even my husband who's quite relaxed about everything noticed it too! Secondly, the door to the staff room beside the elevator was kept open all the time, so basically you see cleaning supplies, etc and the staff hanging out there everytime you go to the elevator. It's not too bad but just a bit disconcerting, like seeing a visible pantyline on an otherwise gorgeously dressed woman. Thirdly, our bathroom, although design wise was great, had black mold on the corners of the shower! The area rug in the room also had a few stains and was starting to look worn. Lastly, given that the hotel is not that well known and empty cabs don't usually pass the street, I called the front desk in advance for them to call a cab for me so it arrives at a certain time. I got down to the lobby and the front desk staff only called for a taxi right then! So I was late for the event I had to go to. So if you just need to stay in a 'nice' hotel that's in a good location in Singapore, I would recommend Naumi, but just don't expect \"luxury\" details one would see in a usual SLH rated hotel.

I was particularly happy with the wireless Internet access Naumi provided (because the other two hotels that I stayed at didn\u2019t offer the same service). Also, the universal power socket also made my life a lot easier. * Comfortable Bed - I didn\u2019t even know why I bothered to borrow a DVD from the Reception. The minute I laid myself on that bed, I just felt like sinking in. I fell asleep within a couple of minutes and missed the entire movie. * Infinity pool - Despite that I only stayed at Naumi for 1 day, I managed to visit their pool 3 times. It was THAT lovely. If you are after a good swimming session, I am not sure this is the pool for you because of its size. However, it is perfect for a dip and what a view! I think this hotel delivers everything its website mentions. I would strongly recommend it to all travelers to the Civic District of Singapore.

After the hassle, we finally check in at 2pm into another room as our confirmed room was not available and still \"subject to availability' At 3pm,4pm and 5pm, our 'confirmed room' was still not available, all this time I had guests arriving and arrangements flying out of the window for the 'surprise' party. Finally at close to 6pm, the 'confirmed' room was finally available and we proceeded to prepare for the party, only to find that the hotel had 'ran out' of cutlery, wine glasses and plates. Upon our complaint, the hotel decided to provide a complimentary tiramisu cake for the guest whom we had booked the suite for. The cherry on the cake had to be the very hot and oven-like wine cooler. Despite several requests for it to be replaced, nothing was done, we then had to beg for ice to chill our wine and beverages. The party started and we called for the cake to be sent to the room, when the cake arrived, we were terribly embarassed as the 'cake' turned out to be a deflated piece of tiramisu measuring 4 by 4 inches! I would have rather not have the 'cake' as it was a source of embarassment! Having spent the entire day trying to put the event together despite the hiccups, we were spent and were trying to settle in for the night the night when we lifted the bed cover and there it was right in the centre of the bed, 4 holes in the bed linen.... By then we were too tired to even complain, we just wanted to leave the hotel first thing in the morning.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cFunky and Fabulous!!\u201d", "Author": "SS2", "ReviewID": "UR24525513", "Content": "Funky: Hotel interiors ... super cool lobby, awesome king size bed, huge flat screen tv, kiehl toiletries, open style type bathroom.

Breakfast is in the lobby which some might not like too much and space constraints mean the breakfast selection was short of the typical extensive offering at the Pan or InterCont, but what is there was well considered and the quality of every item was excellent. Also, not having hundreds of guests at breakfast is a very pleasant change, staff are attentive and, significantly, there is none of the usual hussle and bussle around the 'buffet'. Possibly the service isn't quite as polished as at the major 5*s (reception desk is hidden, so they didn't see us arrive to help with our bags) but their personality and enthusiasm MORE than makes up for this Eg. we asked for all our bedding to be changed from feather when we arrived (due to allergies).

The hotel is located in a nice central spot - it's within walking distance to Arab street, Chjimes, the merlion, Raffles Hotel and the City Hall MRT station. One of the things that I noticed pretty quickly about the hotel is the fact that their staff are pretty young and their inexperience did show through at times. An example of this would be the fact that I had called the hotel prior to our arrival to ask if we could get an early check in (as our flight was arriving in the early hours of the morning) and I was assured that it would be arranged, however, when we did get there, we had found that our room had not yet been cleaned up by housekeeping. Another example would have been when my partner had the unfortunate luck of developing appendicitis during our stay. I found when I called reception to find out what we could do about seeing a doctor, they were (at best) unsure of how we needed to proceed to get help.

We also found the cutest bar & dessert cafe called Cafe Doumas at 124 Owen Road (just behind Farrer Park MRT). They had great cocktails and desserts to die for. Can also reccomend Cafe Salivation at 75 Syed Alwi Road which offers chic vegetarian food at bargain prices. Drinks at Loof and New Asia Bar (top of Swissotel) also recommended for the views.

Being a new place, cabbies are not aware of the hotel, but the memorable experience started the moment we reached the premises from the airport. There was a light shower in progress & the proactive staff, spotting us from the lobby, rushed out with umbrellas to take us & luggage dry inside. The second surprise was when they upgraded us from an Executive Suite to a Corporate Suite. The room was fabulous - very well done up, extremely large, awesome bathroom, etc. They even had a storeroom for keeping bags (makes the room very neat) and having an ironing board & iron. The wide corridor had on one side the kitchen platform having the Nespresso machine, stove, fridge, oven, all critical cutlery & a wine humidor ! The living area had a comfortabl sofa & a HUGE plasma TV. The bedroom had its own plasma with enough storage cupboards. Good taste in decor, extremely comfortable king bed. But what takes the cake is the excellent service we experienced in the five days - all staff knew us by name, gave important guidance for travel, etc. Small things like a smiling welcome & escort to the lifts every time you entered the place, \"have a nice time / day\" every time you stepped out - made the hotel stand out from the usual mechanical 5 stars. House keeping was very good - expensive, good quality toiletries in the bathroom. Very simple F&B - the lobby serves as a buffet breakfast lounge (the variety / quality's just right / enough) and at night the same place turned into a whiskey bar with a minimalistic food menu. No pretentions that F&B is not the driver but a support. Place is quite small - believe 40 odd rooms, all suites - hence space allocation is towards room backed by excellent service. The focus is on a quality stay & that makes the price (at par with normal 5 star) all the more worthwhile.

I agree with most of the comments already expressed here in the reviews. As a regular to Singapore and know the hotels and area well, this is my first time at the Naumi and will probably go back. It\u2019s a small hotel not meant to be a resort (aka NO spa facility) but a city (business) hotel. It leans towards being hip & trendy without being over the top pretentious. (Rooms and public spaces are stylish but still very comfortable). The place is efficient but still have some warmth to it and a nice vibe. I also considered the Majestic but in the end am glad that I went to the Naumi (mostly for the convenient location). The location is ideal near the Marina area and just behind THE Raffles Hotel. I didn't have trouble finding a taxi and the hotel staff was always ready to call for one. The location is a short walk to Suntec City (convention area), Esplanade (\u201cdurian\u201d theatre) and Raffles City to catch the MRT underground train. The rooms are nicely appointed, clean, modern and spacious (we were in 902). The all inclusive price was convenient. The room felt like home! NICE TOUCHES: - Large refrigerator - Mini bar included (but mostly soft drinks, water and beer) - Nespresso Coffee Machine - iPod/Clock Radio (plug in your own iPod music!) - Fresh flowers in room/bathroom - FREE wireless internet connection (included with my rate) - Super large flat screen TV and DVD player - Bed was comfortable! - Spacious shower with separate stand alone tub (in Room 902) - Dramatic lighting (too bad they didn\u2019t have a dimmer switch to control the mood) The mysterious \u201cplumbing\u201d noise: Just like someone else mentioned here, we did encounter that strange noise on the first night. We first heard it late afternoon on the day we arrived. It sounded like a jack hammer in the distance. However, the noise persisted periodically through the night. It woke me up 2 \u2013 3 times. At that point, I assumed it was the filter pumps for the swimming pool? We were on the 9th floor just below the pool deck! I mentioned the noise to the staff the next morning, they made a note of it but did not explain the noise? The noise went away! Somehow they took care of it? The following day, the staff asked me about the noise again which led me to believe that the hotel staff is aware of the noise problem?! About the service: Someone else also mentioned the attentiveness being annoying\u2026 We had the same experience. Though I give them credit for the effort and everyone seem pleasant. But most times, it seem \u201cforced\u201d. For example, when you come down to the lobby on your way out, the staff would \u201crun\u201d ahead of you just to open the door for you?! It seem so unnecessary?! Same thing, when you return, they would run ahead just to press the elevator button for you?! At those prices, I would like to see more confidence in the staff (a couple of people did stand out as being more professional?!). But in general, when you ask them a question or talk to them, they seem tentative and nervous\u2026 When they greet you, it felt contrived. It should be more authentic instead of just \u201cchecking off the box\u201d of things to do when you see a guest! Finally: Being on the 9th floor, our room actually had a nice city view (same as from the pool) since we are just below the pool deck. The night time city lights view is great. However, we had our blinds closed most of the time. The building fa\u00e7ade is lit up at night and we have a bright light fixture just outside our window.
