We attended the Sebel for a wedding. The venue itself looks very nice - well maintained gardens, swimming area etc. The meal at the reception was quite nice - although the chicken in the main course was very undercooked. The reception room was set up very well. Apparently the chapel costs quite a bit to hire out, and in my opinion it is really nothing special inside. Breakfast was fantastic with a great breakfast room and wide selection of dishes.We stayed in the Barracks section, which is incredibly overpriced! Whilst the room was clean and nicely furnished, it was incredibly cramped and stifling, with amost no natural light or fresh air. We did not sleep well as there was noise continually echoing from the rooms and corridors outside. We could barely move around inside our room.We were told that our room would be located close to another family member, and as close as possible to the reception room - neither of these things happened. I also emailed the Sebel twice in the weeks prior to our stay with some queries, and both of my emails remain unanswered!Staff varied from going out of their way to be friendly and helpful, to those who completely ignored us - during the night I was moving in and out of the foyer in high heels pushing my baby in a stroller, and on several occasions staff members sat out the front smoking their cigarettes watching me struggle up and down stairs and through the heavy front doors!I was so looking forward to the weekend at this place, and was disappointed to leave with the conclusion that I will not be making a return visit or recommending the venue to anyone.", "Date": "Mar 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR236688011", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lulu1Nsw"}, {"Content": "Loved the Spa! We booked a Courtyard Getaway Package via the hotel website which cost $290 per night, this included a 3 course dinner and breakfast.The hotel is set in very nice surrounds, and as previous people have mentioned it caters for weddings, there was one on when we arrived, but we hardly noticed them at all during our stay. The room was very good and spacious. The room was in good condition, and clean, the bed in particular was excellent. However, the room did not let in much light with some 2 small windows which made it feel a bit dark and dingy during the day time. The room had no bath, but the shower is very big, you can fit 2 people in easily, and has the biggest shower head I have ever seen!The food at the Harvest restaurant was excellent, not good if you are a vegetarian though. The service was very slow though, which they apologised for throughout the night, it sounded like they were busy catering for the wedding as well. The breakfast is also excellent, with plenty of choice. The juice machine which you can operate yourself was a nice touch.There is a small pool in the courtyard, as well as a few sun loungers, no privacy though as its right next to the walkway to the rooms.We also used the Thalgo Spa, which I cannot recommend enough. You will feel pampered and relaxed after your session, make sure you book ahead though as it gets booked up quick.Overall, its a great place to go to relax and play golf with 2 courses within walking distance. The only downside is the service levels, there was no one in the bar when we went, and had to go to the front desk to ask for the bar person. We then went back 15 mins later when she never turned up to ask again!A final word of warning, they also charge 15% extra for service on bank holidays, which I think is a ridiculous practice for a hotel. Which given the level of service there, you will feel particularly annoyed about if you went on a bank holiday.", "Date": "Jan 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR813792067", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "u761154"}, {"Content": "Pretty Good - no complaints really Stayed there for NYE 2007.

(if u love fresh juice in the morning).mix and match make your own juice.the 10m indoor pool is nice. 23-25degC. the spa near the pool is a nice 35deg, just right for me. too hot for some.architecture is nice. had lots of little outdoor furniture where u can chill out (if not raining), reading a book with coffee.there's a little playground area for my kids and lots of fountains.it was just nice and relaxing.Overall i do recommend this hotel and will return again when there's special going on.but will ask for a view first nxt time !!", "Date": "Jan 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR988725804", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sydneylovers"}, {"Content": "wedding factory we were pretty disappointed with the facilities . The fully equipped gym consisted of 2 treadmills a weights bench and an old table tennis table and no air con! there is a small indoor pool. the sauna did not work and if you wanted to use the steam room you had to have a spa treatment. When we booked we were not told that there were any weddings on. There was not one but THREE weddings on one after the other and all three receptions were held there too. I felt rather sorry for the brides! they were even queueing for photo spots around the lake. I wish we had been told this as we were looking for a romance night away from our 2 year old not be thrown into the mix of 3 wedding parties. The food in the restaurant looked good. my husbands dinner was very nice but we had to wait nearly an hour for starters and my main was under cooked.

We really wanted to like the Sebel Spa and Resort. It's in a great location, fire place in reception and friendly staff with pressed white shirts and big smiles. Everything feels right until you step into your room.We stayed in a Barracks Room. The room might have once been part of an army barracks, but right now it has the feel of a cheap motel room that's been given an instant makeover with the finest furnishings from Ikea.The noise from the courtyard came straight through the room. We might have been unlucky - there seemed to be a team building exercise for cosmetics sales people in the adjoining courtyard, making all kinds of team building noises.

This hotel should not be compared with it's counterparts in either Sydney nor the Hunter Valley!My wife and I spent a long weekend here and we have to report that compared to other Sebel hotels and resorts we have stayed at this was very disappointing. Firstly let me state that the photos on the web-sites are nothing like what this place is really like. This four star resort and spa is much more like a Comfort Inn or a Motel and certainly does not justify the price.Although the rooms were clean and fairly large they lacked any character and only accessable by outdoor carpeted walkways! A strange choice of flooring considering it does rain here sometimes.The guest pool and jacuzzi were small and housed in a central building within the small grounds of the hotel. When we went to use these there were cigarette butts, beer bottle tops and safety pins lying around the sides of the pool. Considering there were young children running about we thought this was both dirty and dangerous.The restaurant there is in a best restaurants guide on the web, but again let me warn you not to get too excited. We had a much better meal the following evening, for less money, at a place in Windsor.We had a few other problems while there but are far too petty to go into but just really annoyed us when accompanied with all the other little things.My tip, save your money and go stay at the Sebel Kirton Park in the Hunter Valley. It is head and shoulders above this place.", "Date": "Jun 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR377650278", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "DavidE77"}, {"Content": "Romantic and Relaxing We got married here in September of '03 and celebrated our first wedding anniversary here as well. Both times they exceeded our expectations and we were made to feel pampered. In 2003 they went out of their way to make our wedding preparations a breeze. We don't live in Sydney and when we arrived earlier to meet with the photographer before our trial dinner, they saw that we looked exhausted and lent us a room to refresh ourselves in for a few hours !!! We were so impressed with that. Our actual day was wonderful, went without a hitch and all our guests, most of who stayed the night, felt well taken care of, the Sunday buffet brunch was yummy.In '04 most of the staff had changed but the level of service was that of the same excellence. We stayed in a Suite which was large and comfortable. The expansive landscaped grounds and lakes with a golf course next door just invite you to relax. The Harvest restaurant is reasonably priced. The Villa Thalgo Spa has reasonable rates, wonderful professional service and very clean and modern. Being situated in Windsor, it is not an ideal base to visit Sydney city from but its certainly a secret hideaway spot for those wanting to get away from it all, yet be only 45 minutes away from the CBD. Windsor itself is very quaint with horse drawn carriage rides and most of the architecture preserved despite modern day shop fronts. There are also a few things to do in the Hawkesbury area.The basic rooms might be a little small with small windows (having used to been barracks) However, the comfortable bed and modern bathroom make up for it.
