So, I stay at very inexpensive hotels near the airport. For several months I stayed at the Travelodge until it became far too much to bear. I have traveled all over the world \u2013 and spent a decade working in the hospitality industry. By far this is one of the worst hotels in existence. While many air travelers stumble upon this inexpensive option, a notable portion of the clientele is comprised of prostitutes, drug addicts and gang members. For this reason, the property has many security cameras onsite \u2013 many of which seem to point directly into guest rooms. The walls are extremely thin \u2013 if your neighbor watches television at 3 am, you\u2019ll hear it. If a john is beating on a hooker at 3 am \u2013 you\u2019ll also hear it. If a K-9 unit is searching for a drug suspect, you\u2019ll hear it. Guest privacy and security is of little concern to the management. Contrary to privacy standards for many hotels and motels, the front office uses stickers to write the room number on the guest key. If you lose your key and are away from your room, any of the sketchy characters in the neighborhood would know exactly where to try using it. The locks in the room are extremely questionable \u2013 some are broken, some require pushing against the door with one\u2019s knee or a chair in order to get it to lock. With guest room numbers easily seen from the street, anyone can phone your room without going through the front desk. On one occasion I l received a call at 11 pm on the landline in the room. It was a hooker cold calling guest rooms to offer services. I kindly declined but made sure to script the conversation on Facebook. It\u2019s easier to laugh off when you are a single man traveling alone \u2013 but if I imagine this would be very disconcerting for families with children or women traveling alone. Cleanliness is also of little concern. The chairs and carpet are horrifically stained \u2013 probably with fluids one can easily imagine. On more than one occasion in more than one room I have woken up with bed bug bites. This led me to start traveling with Cedarcide and spraying down the room before I slept in it. The smell is often whatever is being pulled through the bathroom vent. Bathroom drainage and hot water is erratic and varies greatly between guest rooms. I always check in with the same front desk agent who is always rude, defensive and curt. The guest is always the first to initiate a conversation - contrary to the most basic hospitality standards. I have never seen her smile. Once I phoned the hotel from work to ask if I could use the microwave by the front desk for popcorn. Instead of putting me on hold she accidentally left the line active. I listened to her interaction with another guest which was almost identical to my experience. She claimed to not be able to find the reservation \u2013 a common issue apparently as I book my reservations 6 weeks in advance and she almost always has difficulty finding it. Do not stay in this hotel.

Breakfast was less than mediocre: cheap white bread for toast, gas-station style boxed mini danishes, and a cheap version of frosted flakes. No waffles as shown on the hotel website photos. Hotel service was amazingly bad. This wasn't customer service, this was combat. I hung a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door since I didn't think I could trust the cleaning staff alone with my luggage. I asked the front desk clerk for a towel and he snapped back, \"where are the towels in your room, why do you need more?\". Begrudgingly, he said that he would have the towels delivered to my room. After half an hour I asked again if the towels were on the way and he said that the housekeeper had to leave to pick up guests from the airport. I checked back later and found a new front desk clerk that wasn't told that I'd asked for towels. She basically told me there is nothing she can do about it because the last clerk screwed up and that I'd have to wait for a housekeeper to get around to it. Finally, an hour and a half after my initial request, a housekeeper knock on my room door ang hands me a single washcloth and (unsolicited) tells me that if I've been having problems with the staff I need to talk with the morning front desk manager. I walk by the office in the morning to hear the manager literally yelling into a phone as a family with kids waits in the lobby. The staff jumps at every opportunity to put guests on the defensive. Maybe this is a cost saving measure for them as guests are quickly conditioned to not ask for services. If you decide to disregard hotel reviews and stay here bring your own sleeping bag and do not disturb the staff. I was surprised that a large chain like Travelodge would allow such poor service but this hotel obviously doesn't cater to repeat customers (with the possible exception of the prostitutes upstairs).

We flew in from Sacramento to go on a cruise to Alaska. We had found the motel on the internet and figured that it looks ok from the photos that we saw and the price was good. It took us over 45 minutes to get from to the motel waiting for the shuttle. The shuttle driver and woman in the office were rude. We were given a room upstairs on the backside of the property. We had noticed the sign mentioned in above reviews about the safe. We dragged our four suitcases up the stairs after walking clear around the building from wrong directions from staff. We got to the room after passing several rooms with people just hanging out with the doors open. That made us feel uneasy. the security metal pin that the bar latches to keep people from opening the door was broken and missing. We noticed dirty walls and stains on the bed, and bad smell. We realized that this was not a situation that we wanted to put ourselves in. We did a good search on our phone and found a list of other places to stay. We called and eventually found a place that had vacancy's. We notified the office that we were canceling our reservation and stay. We also canceled the reservation for our return trip from our cruise. Not sure if we will get the money back. We had the shuttle driver take us back to the airport. From there, we waited another twenty minutes for the F airfield Inn Shuttle driver to pick us up and took us to the hotel. It cost double the money, but was well worth it. Much cleaner neighborhood, and property. The shuttle driver was very nice, and the Desk and security staff. Yes they have security staff. The room was very clean, and flat screen TV, refrigerator and microwave. You get what you pay for.

The T.V. did not work very well, picture was hard to see and the speakers were very messed up, you could not hear the tv very well. The issue I have with this hotel is the fact that as a women with 3 female daughters, we were put in the back part of the hotel where there isn't very good lighting and scary looking people constantly roaming that part of the hotel parking lot. You never knew who was actually suppose to be staying there in the room next to you because people were coming and goign ALL the time. On the first night we called and asked to get some extra blankets and pillows(they only give you one flat pillow per side of bed) They refused to give us the extra items we requested. I had really loud noise coming from the next 2 rooms next to us ( we stayed in room 506) all night long there were people coming and going, banging on the walls,doors etcetera. Loud music being played. I called and complained to the night clerk and she told me to deal and they couldn't do anything, if I was bothered by it the I could ask them to be quiet. Being a female with 3 girls, I was NOT about to open my door and ask a bunch of scary drunken or drug induced guys to stop making noise. About 2 or 3 in the morning I had several loud knocks on teh door and it would not stop When I appeared out the window I could only see the back of one guy, peering out the door hole you could not see anyone. I didn'tr answer the door. About an hour later, there was knocking again, this time in a leep deprived stuper I opened the door with the door jamm in place and there where 2 big guys on either side of my door. I quickly closed the door and called the front desk, the guy at the front just apologized. The following night again we called and asked for more pillows and blankets, we only recieved 2 pillows and no blankets. Again the noise was very loud people coming and going it was like DeJaVu all over agian. Me and my girls finally fell asleep around 2:30ish just to be awoken by some lady screaming at the top of her lungs 'call the police, please somebody call the police, I saw the blood, please help\" i called the front desk and asked them mto please call the police, he told me to do it and then after I called the police we heard teh lady wimper and cry out, a door slam and dead silence. Needless to say my daughters were scared pout of there mind! The police arrived 9did not announce who they were, banging at my ddor) When I realized it was the police i opened the door explained what had happened, they started to go room to room but that lasted about oh maybe 5 min the most and they jumped into there cars and took off. No word as to if they got him or found here or whatever, The hotel clerk called and asked if the room was alright, Of course your Damn room is allright! nothing happened in my room he didn't ask if anyone needed help he just wanyed to make sure the room was alright since I was the one that called the police. needless to say myself and my daughters could npot get back to sleep the rest of the morning, During our stay on several occasions we had peole try to get into our room, by turning and pushing on the door and or using a key card, at one point we had soemone try to climb in through our window. ( he said he thought it was his room) the morning we were leaving my girls were stil getting ready and I started to load the car. there was a big scary looking guy that was standing at the room next to mine and he was (trying to get in ) it looked like. When I came out he asked me if I was Angel, I told him no and he kept asking if I was for sure and he was walking toward me, I told him he was completly mistaken ( mean whilemy hotel door is wide open with my 3 girls in there) he approached me and asked how to work the key card( this key card was a very old one) he acted like he was tryuing to look into my hotel room I yelle dto the girld to shut the door. Thankfully some cop came driving by at that moment and I was able to go back to my room.

Nothing decent to eat (i.e. food that wouldn't make me sick or that was even remotely digestible) except raisin bran, but no milk, even when we came back half an hour later. At least there was coffee. We ended up eating deeply into our food budget the whole time because this \"free Deluxe Continental Breakfast\" was entirely unreliable.

How, I ask you, is it possible to get away with STEALING from YOUR CUSTOMERS??? Thanks a lot, thieves. Way to run a business. I guess it's just a perk of the job eh?

Shuttle was slow and took almost 30 minutes to arrive, but we were not in a hurry and waited patiently. Drive to hotel took about 5-10 minutes. Check in was easy and staff was courteous. Upon entry into the room we found it clean. No foul odors. No crime scene tape. Bed was made, no hairs or stains on sheets. Bathroom tub was large but did show significant wear to the tub basin. Since I planned on taking a shower only it was not a concern. Shower curtain was clean. No hair or soap scum in tub. Toilette clean. Newer heat/AC unit that worked perfectly. Door latched securely. Some street noise due to proximity of major road though nothing significant. Neighborhood was a mix of some run down buildings, but many newer, clean and landscaped buildings also. 5 minute walk to the light rail that will take you to downtown for $2.50 person. We never felt unsafe while in the hotel or walking around. Note: They automatically charge you for use of the room safe as stated on a sign in their lobby.

It makes you wonder how it could ever have been ranked #119 of 128 hotels in the area. It seems to me that only Hades could have been panned worse. Actually, the place seemed to me fairly typical of cheap hotels in airport zones in the U.S. I hadn't planned ahead of time to stay in the area, but airtravel difficulties forced me into an unplanned stay in Seattle past 1 a.m. in the morning, and I picked up a copy of the coupon book in the airport to find a cheap place, not looking for Shangri La. I'd tried another cheap place about a month ago in the Seatac area for the same reason, and stayed at America's Best Value Inn on the same highway, just south of the airport rather than north. They had a coupon for a $40 night and the Travelodge had one for $55. I expected it would be somewhat better, but for all intents and purposes the two places are about the same. If you're trying to go cheap, go to the Best Value or the Motel 6, both of which offer rooms for $39.95 a night. I was quoted $59.95 on the phone when I called for availability at Travelodge, but told the man I had a coupon for $54.95 and he said OK. I was never asked to show the coupon. The shuttle came for me without much of a delay, which was fine. The driver was the same as the night deskman. He had to close the office to pick me up. Same situation as the Best Value Inn. Both motels have terrible breakfasts. This place offered wheaties, cheerios, a bagel, pre-packaged cheap muffins like you'd find in a gas station, and a couple of juices. One reviewer complained only dry powder was available for the coffee. I'd suggest using the milk from the carton. It's at the very low end of \"continental breakfasts\", but what do you expect for bottom-feeding rates? I'd say skip it and walk to the pancake house about a half a block away. The airport highway both north and south of the airport isn't exactly a nice neighborhood, no matter how you cut it, and that goes for all sorts of hotels/motels near Seatac. Prostitutes, druggies, and people looking for the same ply the roadway. I found the room to be satisfactory so far as cleanliness went--what furniture there was was cheap motel drab. A round table was provided with two padded chairs. The TV was on top of a dresser. The TV gets cable, but the HBO which is listed on the card is not available. Nevertheless, you could get decent reception, which beats the TV at the alternative Best Value Inn. The bathtub is typical for a cheap place--no way to stop up the water so as to make it unuseable. If you use cheap places in general and like baths it's a good idea to carry your own rubber stopper. I improvised one and had a bath anyway. I didn't experience any horror with the management as others have done, but that may be because I expected nothing and didn't ask. I did have a coffee maker in the room and it worked. There were two bags of caffeinated coffee and none of decaf, which was fine with me. That decaf wasn't available is probably just indicative of sloppy maid service, which you can surely expect at this place. Parking here seems to have been a problem for some. That's probably because the hotel offers travelers flying out of Seatac parking for $6.99 per day whether you stay in the motel or not, which is a very good price for the area. That's why parking is difficult--the places are being taken by people not staying in the motel. No papers are offered. The \"business center\" is a computer with internet access in the office waiting area. For a cheap place to stay in an emergency, this place is all right if you don't expect much. However, the $15 more for this over the Best Value Inn translates into no appreciable difference whatsoever. TV is better here if you're a watcher. I'm not, so didn't care. The Best Value Inn has a 24-hour I-Hop half a block away. There's nowhere near this place late at night except a drive-through MacDonald's a block away. I thought Travelodge was a chain--now I understand it's an independent franchise operation. These folks don't care. Don't expect an average Travelodge. The company should disassociate themselves from this operation--it makes you suspect all of them, although I never expected much of the chain in the first place.", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cSurly staff\u201d", "Author": "fishdoc07", "ReviewID": "UR21750700", "Content": "Staff was very unfriendly and unhelpful.

I said I didn't want to use the safe and I was told that if I didn't use it it would be refunded in the morning. I didn't use it and the $3 was not refunded. I was asked what time did I need the shuttle to take us to the airport and was told it ran every half hour 24/7. I said 7am would be great only to be told that there is no 7 am shuttle and it would have to be 6.30 or 7.30. I chose 6.30. Why then tell me that it ran half hourly 24/7? Then was told that we couldn't have breakfast or given antything to eat as it didn't start until 6.30am. If I had known this I would have stayed somewhere else, but I was assured on the phone 3 weeks before that it was fine and they would supply us with breakfast. There wasn't a coffee maker, coffee, sugar etc in our room so I went to reception and asked to please give me one as I wanted to relax with a cup of coffee as we'd had a very long and busy day. The receptionist didn't believe me and looked at me as if I had taken it but said she would send me one. Made several more trips to the reception desk as my phone calls were not answered and each time was told it was on it's way. After more than 3 hours and still no coffee machine when 2 males came to inspect how come there wasn't one. Another hour passed before we finally got one but were given dirty looks. About 10pm discovered that there were only 2 very thin pillows on the bed, so back to the reception to ask if we could have an extra 2. More dirty looks from the receptionist and again had to wait quite some time to get them. The next morning about 6.10am, I went to the reception to use the computer to check on our flights when I overheard a man telling another, that the driver of the shuttle which was supposed to start at 5.30am had not arrived and didn't know if he was coming in at all. He offered the man to drive him to the airport so I asked if we should wait or go with him. He suggested we go with him as we could be stranded with no one to take us. So no breakfast, no shuttle, no coffee machine, rude staff, charged an extra $3 for nothing.......NEVER AGAIN!!!
