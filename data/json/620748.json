My room mate and I arrived after just upping and leaving from another place (because it was so awful) without having another place to stay. We rolled up on their doorstep before they were even open to see if they had rooms spare. Straight away we were given a place to put our massive suitcases and offered drinks despite them being officially closed. This hotel is set on three floors. We had a twin room on the top floor - it was basic, but very clean and wonderful compared to our previous place. The walls are white, there's a fridge and a TV, limited hanging space and some storage by our beds - again it is small, but I think other people's reviews are harsh...show me a room that doesn't need a lick of paint now and again! Yes there's some noise, but come on, you're in the middle of the city, of course it's going to be noisy!! However the noise we experienced was city noise - traffic and people, and nothing from the pub down below. The owner Steve is fantastic and went out of his way so many times to help us, helping us sort out our month loing stay, whilst his team including Sam the caretaker (fab and only a phone call away) and Elliot, the very kind bar person that also helped us out. This place really is wonderful & I would recommend it to everyone. It's in the perfect location - you can see the tube station from the window and several bus stops are nearby - and the team that run it are fab.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201csmelly and noisy\u201d", "Author": "hotelsmotels_12", "ReviewID": "UR126210225", "Content": "Be prepared to rough it at the Wynyard.

They even took our bags up to our room.. If your looking for somewhere just to sleep, then its a great hotel.. I did take my own pillow after reading other peoples reviews but it wasn't really necessary.. The meals in the hotel were no worse than any other hotel we had dinner at while there..

I have absolutely no idea why. My toom was a twin. It was on the third floor which was good because there was no noise. However it took me about 10 minutes to lob my 25kg suitcase up all the stairs. The room was actually fine and quite clean however my light didnt work... there was no remote for the tv... and no coffee making facilities. The kitchen was absolutely horrible. The window opposite the stove and sink lead to some kind of dingy hole. There were flying bugs gallore flying through onto the dishes and the food. Nobody had bothered to replace the sponge which smelt like baby vomit despite the fact that there was a fresh one under the sink. I would not eat the stale 'continental breakfast' so I bought my own food. The girl at the bar who checked me out was strikingly rude, it was unbelievable. However there was a nice blonde girl who helped me take my bag back down the stairs. I did only paid 60 bucks for one night (thankgod it was only one night).

The management made it very difficult to get my money back and I had to forfeit a nights rates. Anything to get out and get a decent nights sleep !! The breakfast was ok and the bathroooms were ok but for $30 more per night I got a beautiful, large and quiet!! room just 100m up the road. The bar staff were actualy quite friendly and the counter meals are good, its just a shame they flog off that 1st floor accomodation to any sucker that will pay for it.

We were only supposed to stay 5 days but we still got the lower week price. The lower floor is a restaurant/bar with good offers like 7 dollar meals. There is often a lot of people but it never got messy or annoying. The thing to understand is that it is a kind of backpackers with shared bathrooms but without the noise and mess and you get the benefit of room cleaning and towels. The rooms are small but they are cleaned every day and you get a TV with cable and a fridge. There is a fan in the roof that works, light on or off. It can get noisy in the rooms but what to expect when you stay downtown in a large city, that's what earplugs are for. We stayed on the third floor so we did not notice any noise from the bar The location is probably the greatest part you are situated minutes from Darling Harbour, and in walking distance from Norther Quay and Chinatown. The staff was friendly, manager to cleaning lady. Breakfast is milk, toast,jam, juice and cereals served all day in the kitchen. No problems with the shared showers or toilets. The rooftop veranda was great for a late night beer. Thats also were the washer and dryer was located, which was free of charge.

You would be better in a Backpacker hostel. I had come to come online and write a review on every website where someone could possibly book this hotel. Unfortunately, the site we booked it from didn't have any reviews so we went on the information provided by the Hotel. We arrived at the hotel and couldn't find the front door, called the phone number and a man came down in full casual dress and opened the door which lead to a very steep staircase. My Mum went up the stairs with the man to our room. There was no lobby, no real entrance. The room was the width of a double bed. You opened the door and the double bed was within one step. I guess that is what \"Double Room\" meant. The window was open as the only source of air with no fly screen, there was a fan on that only worked with the light on. No room for our cases either. The bathroom and toilet were communal and across the hallway. The \"free complimentary breakfast\" included (per Door man's exact words) - \"there's milk in the fridge and help yourself to the container of cereal in the kitchen. We immediately left and got a room at the Menzie's Hotel - might have been more expensive but there was no way on earth we were staying there.

This place was the WORST place we have ever stayed, and we've stayed at a lot of hostels/budget hotels throughout Europe and Australia. Basically, the rooms are literally above the bar/casino and although we were aware of that upon checking in, what we didn't realize is that at about 7PM they crank up the techno/club music that was so loud it literally vibrated our room until 3AM. Needless to say, we didn't get much sleep and the outside traffic noise was so loud that we were awoken by 7AM (after just 4 hours of sleep), so we checked out that morning because we couldn't bare to stay another night. What's worse, we were booked for four nights and the manager refused to credit us for the remaining 3 nights, and would only give us 2 nights credit so we basically ended up paying $180 for 4 hours of sleep. (By the way, our replacement hotel turned out to be terrific and even CHEAPER than The Wynyard - stay at The George Street Hotel if you're on a budget and still want a clean, quiet and convenient place to stay - we highly recommended it!). Back to the Wynyard, the bathroom was so disgusting, I wouldn't even use it. Basically, it's an open room with two toilets and two shower stalls with flimsy, moldy shower curtains that offer no privacy whatsoever. The supposed \"continental breakfast\" turned out to be stale cornflakes stored in filthy tupperware containers.
