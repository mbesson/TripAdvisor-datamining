This is a bare bones property, without any amenities. The room contains a bed, one uncomfortable upright chair, no reading lights, no desk, no table. Only English speaking TV station we could get is BBC. Room was fairly clean. Walls are very thin and you can hear everything that is going on in the room next door. While the staff is courteous, their command of the English language is very poor. The hotel is located in a busy area of town and thus very noisy. The hotel has a policy of locking the front door of the property and it cannot be opened unless you have a key. We tried to get out of the hotel at 5:30 am and could not find the night manager who has the key to the front door. Supposing there was a fire?

We like its spacious breakfast room and the variety of breakfast items very much. The rooms are large and clean. Before we went to Florence, I checked on the user reviews on this website and noticed some complains about sewage smell in this hotel. Having this in mind, I paid special attention to this complain when we stayed there. We stayed on the third floor and our room is facing the street. We didn't find any sewage smell at all. However, our friend who stayed in a room facing the inner courtyard did notice a slight sewage smell early in the morining coming from the bathroom. After they put down the toilet lid at night before going to bed, they noticed that sewage smell disappeared the following morning and didn't have the smell for the rest of the staying anymore. My suggestion is to ask for an upper-floor room that faces the streets, not the inner courtyard. Personally, I wouldn't hesitate to stay in this hotel again should I go to Florence in the future.I guess the sewage smell is a general problem in Florence as I smelled it very often while walking in Florence even in March.

Very clean, had two twin beds, satellite tv, armoir and dresser. Our bathroom was tiny, but clean, and had a shower and even a (crazy box on the wall, not too strong) hairdryer. We slept fine, rooms were quiet. The breakfast buffet was also decent; cereals, breads, fruit, of course meats and eggs. The staff there was very friendly and helpful. The hotel isn't very deep, but it's tall--3 or 4 floors, with one elevator. It's a pretty little place, with arched doorways and sudden little sitting areas on stairway landings.
