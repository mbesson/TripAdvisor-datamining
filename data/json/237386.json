The hotel website quoted us \u00c2\u00a3425 for a 3night stay for 2 people in a double room including breakfast. We booked through hotelopia.com 2months before our trip for \u00c2\u00a3255 so we made a considerable saving. The hotel room was acceptable and ok because it was spacious,clean and in a good location. I would have been very unhappy if I had paid the hotel website price for the stay so I would say that it is over priced if you are paying over \u00c2\u00a390 per night. I must admit that I was a little disappointed on first impression as it was not, in my opinion, decorated in a traditional antique way- rather an old, dated decor that made it seem shabby and in need of modernising. For a 3* hotel in Venice its acceptable but the hotel room could do with a newer bathroom suite and furniture to bring it up to date. It was tired looking rather then charming which contradicts other reviews but we all have different standards of decor etc.. The bathroom was clean, towels were changed every day even if they were hanging up to be used again and the soap & shower gel was restocked daily too. The bed was a large queensize that was firm and comfortable-the best I have ever slept in! The bed linen was nice quality and clean. The room didnt seem to keep noise at bay, this was not a problem for us as we were up and out by 8am but if you are the type to want a lie in or have a daytime nap then room 102 wouldnt be ideal-the windows are directly above the hotel entrance doors and the bedroom door is next to the store cupboard which the maids use from 8am. The hotel receptionists were neither friendly or unfriendly,they literally just checked us in and out and that was all. The restaurant breakfast staff were good-breakfast consisted of hot drinks(from a machine),fruit juices(from a machine),yoghurts,toasts,jams,pastries,cold meats and cheeses,fruits. Boiled eggs are the only hot food available. The restaurant lunch and dinner staff are excellent-very friendly,efficient and nothing is too much trouble. Starters cost between 6-12 Euros,Mains 8-18 Euros,Desserts 5-10 Euros. Wine prices vary between a modest 16 Euros up to 70 Euros. The red cabernet franc was excellent and good value at 18 Euros a bottle.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cVery good location\u201d", "Author": "Ditte_from_Denmark", "ReviewID": "UR13863676", "Content": "The Malibran hotel is extremely central located, but at the same time very quiet - no noise from the streets, as it is situated in a little hidden square. The only sound came from a church that started ringing its bells at around 7am - a bit early perhaps... Our room was clean and had sufficient space for two.. The bathroom, however was tiny, but for us that was not a problem - we didn't go to Venice to stay in the bathroom... The price included a buffet breakfast, which was fine - bread, cheese, ham, cereals, jam, tea, coffee, juice fruit etc. We only had breakfast there, but the restaurant was always full, so perhaps it was good?. Staff was friendly, although a bit indifferent... In sum, it it a good hotel with good value for money with a great location!", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cCute.\u201d", "Author": "LoooveToTravel", "ReviewID": "UR11173074", "Content": "So I'm a little late in writing my review since we stayed at Hotel Malibran in early May 2007. Our travel agent found this for us since we really didn't have a clue where to stay. We paid about 250 CAD for the room for one night :( but Venice is alllll around expensive. From the Santa Lucia (train station) we bought a vaporetti pass (24 hrs was approx. 12 euro). Number 82 takes you to the Rialto Bridge. Once at the Rialto you need to go through some side streets and plazas (past San Bartolomeo) but we had a map so it was relatively easy to find. BUT difficult if you have heavy luggage that you're pulling because the streets are quite bumpy, crowded, and you need to go over a few little bridges to get there. Overall, I thought the hotel was satisfactory. I mean the location was awesome (5 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge, close to lots of stores and restaurants and bridges)! The hotel has a very small elevator (think one person with two pieces of luggage) but it was no big deal. The room was very charming. Bathroom was TINY. There was a slight problem with the air conditioning. Breakfast was mostly sweet foods. Upon arrival, the hotel arranged a tour of a glass factory in Murano for us. The glass was amazing! MY TIPS FOR YOU: 1) Don't forget bug repellant and/or allergy pills! There is lots of pollen and bugs in Venice!!!!! 2) In my opinion, you don't really need a lot of time in Venice....but have fun, walk the streets, have some gelato and a nutella crepe (or 2 lol), go to St. Mark's Square, go to Murano...", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value in Venice\u201d", "Author": "Laulaa", "ReviewID": "UR10032431", "Content": "My mother and I stayed at the Hotel Malibran in July 2007 as part of a 50th birthday trip across western Europe. First off, the hotel was in a perfect location for us, fairly quiet, near great shopping and lots of restaurants, and only about 10 minutes from the Rialto and the vaporetti stop there. We stayed in the newer annex on the third floor. There was no elevator, but the front desk agent carried our (extremely heavy) suitcases up for us without us even having to ask. The room itself was very modern-looking, clean, and very basic, but with a large bathroom with a big skylight, and had GREAT airconditioning, which is a must in Venice in July. Sound carries pretty easily in the building, but we found the other guests to be pretty quiet, especially in the evening. We tried out the restaurant attached to the Malibran, and my mother developed a huge crush on a very charming waiter, who was very helpful with his recommendations as well as very attentive with service- and prices were surprisingly reasonable for Venice- we had three courses each, plus a bottle of wine, for under 40 Euro. Food was unexceptional, as is usual in Venice, but definitely edible and the baked pasta was very good, incredibly fattening and tasty. They've also got a nice little courtyard for dining al fresco. We also had breakfast included, which was good and varied. There is also a WONDERFUL English bookstore right beside the hotel- the owner is very friendly and helpful, and they've got a good selection of new and used books (and do trades, too.) We also felt very safe walking in the area at night- something I always want to mention, as we were two women travelling alone.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedfordshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat central location\u201d", "Author": "CaptainBedfordshire", "ReviewID": "UR8646429", "Content": "Our room was in an annexe to the main hotel, on the third floor with no lift. The room was very small with what appeared to be a folding bed and little wardrobe space or shelves. The bathroom was tiny with room for only one person at a time, the toilet pulled out from the wash basin but the shower was fine. The room did have air conditioning (vital in August) as well as a full sized fridge (very useful) a full sized sink/drainer and a small electric hob. There did not appear to be an escape route in the event of fire and no smoke alarm. Breakfast was fine and the food in the hotel restaurant good. The situation of the hotel is superb, very close to the Rialto Bridge and a short walk to St Marco's Square. As we spent little time in our room it's shortcomings were not a major problem. We felt that we had value for money but I suspect a room in the main hotel would be better.
