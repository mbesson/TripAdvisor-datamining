The location of the hotel itself is great, less than a 5min walk from Victoria Coach. Also, the wi-fi internet was fantastic. My problems with this hotel are as follows: 1. There is a very narrow staircase and no lift. We had 2 large bags weighing over 30kgs which I had to carry up on my own. I am a large man at 6'5 and 100kgs, but I doubt many other people would be able to do this. 2. The room itself was tiny. After we moved our bags in, there was very little room to actually manoeuver your way through to the bed. 3. The room was very dirty. There was a problem with ventilation, which made it very difficult to breathe during the night. We had to have the window wide open to let in the 4 degree chill. 4. The linen was not clean. There was a distinct stench of tobacco in the sheets. My partner and I both found this to be repulsive. My advice would be to book well in advance, in a much nicer hotel.

They assured us that they were equal in every way and that in fact, our room would be better at Airways. Yikes!! Where to start? The lights in the room flickered on and off. The shower filled up so quickly with water that we had to take very quick showers and also turn the water off while we shampooed and soaped up so as to avoid the stall from overflowing. The mattress was so thin that we could feel every spring in the bed. In fact, we laid a blanket down between us and the mattress because some of the springs were painful. There is no air conditioning (rather common and not a problem in and of itself). Normally opening the window would suffice.

Apparently he was having a great deal of trouble transferring money to his parents back in India and was deeply unhappy about the poor customer service he had received. We did not appreciate the irony at this point, but certainly do in retrospect. About fifteen minutes later, he deigned to finish his call and pay attention to the paying customers wilting in front of him. It was around 11.45am by this point, but we were not able to check in until 1.30pm. Despite the fact checking out time was half ten in the morning, the fastidious cleaning team was clearly still beavering away, ensuring every room was sparkling clean. We went for a bit of a walk (the local Sainsbury's is a tourist attraction to rival the Royal Wedding) and got back to the hotel about fifteen minutes early, I'm not sure if this timing error is connected to the fact we were then quickly dispatched to the Hanover Hotel over the road - in fact we never received any sort of explanation for why we had to go to this hotel - but over the road we went. The Hanover Hotel is truly a sight to behold. Or a sight to avoid, A sight, either way. The receptionist shuffled a stack of room keys in front of us, giving us a seemingly random choice, but a choice we later realised was the worst room in the hotel. Any hotel really, We suspect they try to palm this room off on most guests to see if they can find someone meek enough to put up with it, as they quickly moved us when we complained. A dank room on the fourth floor, only accessible by climbing a staircase suitable for penitent pilgrims, the filthy window was almost entirely blocked by a slab of concrete and the three or four beds had been crammed in to allow little room for movement. Following another trek down the stairs, taking in exposed wiring and building materials along the way, we were presented with our next option, on the second floor. This room, while not quite as bad as the penthouse purgatory we had previously been presented with, had its own problems. It contained a double bed and a single bed. The single bed had been propped up on one corner with a magazine, perhaps to account for the bizarrely sloping floor. The double bed had a ripped sheet with a suspicious brown stain. The floor under this double bed had clearly never been vacuumed, displaying travel cards and sweet wrappers from some previous victim. The windows were coated in thick grime and the curtains were not much better. My personal favourite was the plastic glasses displayed next to the kettle. They can't have been intended for human use, so were perhaps the result of some desperate attempt to manufacture antibiotics in order to ward off whatever exotic infection had afflicted the last \"guests\". The surface they were placed on was thick with dust and the cups placed next to them were thick with... well, something brown. Following another complaint (the phone in the room didn't work, so the complaint involved another trip down the stairs and through the building site) we received two visitors. The first brought our plastic glasses and cups back, having swilled them out with something I assume was at least liquid, if not actually water. The second came brandishing a sheet, looked at the brown stain and said \"Oh, it's only a little mark...\" It was about four inches long, which is a little over my limit for brown stains. We actually had to persuade her to change the sheet by pointing out the numerous rips. Perhaps someone had previously considered ripping it up and forming it into a rope in order to escape through the window, only to have thought better of it upon being presented with the sludge adorning the glass. She eventually changed the sheet, tucked half of it in and departed in a huff. We spent the next half an hour or so searching the internet to find another, more hygienic hotel that we could afford to move to. Luckily I had a 3G phone as nobody had bothered to give us the WiFi password. Everywhere under \u00c2\u00a3150 was full, so we decided to cut our trip short and get a bus back to Manchester. When we got to the reception to ask for a refund, it was just before 3pm. We had checked into this hotel at about 1.20pm. The receptionist's first response upon hearing we wanted our money back was not to ask what was wrong, not to apologise, but to say, \"You've been in the room for three hours, you can't have a refund\", and then, \"If you want a refund you need to contact your travel agent\". After much arguing, he miraculously managed to find us a room back over the road in the hotel we had originally booked, the Airways. Reception in the Airways was full of many unhappy looking travellers. I can only begin to imagine the indignities they were in store for. The receptionist appeared a little stressed - maybe something to do with Western Union - and quickly gave us a key to our third room. Amazingly, it was reasonable. The floor appeared to have been cleaned relatively recently, the bedsheets were apparently clean and someone had replaced the plastic glasses with mugs, giving us four mugs between two people. The manky blue blanket was still present, but this was swiftly dispatched to the wardrobe. We even had a balcony, of sorts. We suspect they keep this room back to placate angry customers, of which there must be many. Admittedly, one of the windows was cracked and - hilariously - had an elastoplast stuck over the crack to prevent it spreading, but as cheap hotel rooms go it wasn't appalling. A minute or so later, we received a narky phone call from the receptionist, asking how the room was and saying that we would not be allowed to change again if we accepted it. I did feel terribly guilty about the horrible inconvenience we were causing them for not wishing to sleep in filth, but I tried to not let it colour my experience. The night's sleep would have been better if we trusted the blue blanket thing. They clearly don't believe in wasting money on luxuries like heating, so the pair of us shivered under a single sheet. Also, in the hour we spent in the Hanover Hotel, we managed to be bitten repeatedly by something unpleasant, resulting in a great deal of itching. Breakfast was your usual weak coffee, stale croissants and bland cereal, but livened up by reading the faces of the other guests and wondering who would be the first to snap and start breaking furniture. Sadly, as far as we know, nobody did - at least not that morning. My girlfriend skipped breakfast, which was good as otherwise she would not have had the unique experience of a mirror nearly falling on her head as she removed a plug from the wall. We initially thought half ten would be a bit early to check out, but somehow managed to motivate ourselves to be through the doors by nine. We booked this hotel through a cheap hotels website, which offered a \"mystery three star hotel\" at a discount price. The mystery is how they got the three stars in the first place.

After the first night (just nine hours in the room) we spent the next day scratching as a number of lumps started to appear on our bodies (it felt like a heat rash). Not sure what it was, we continued with the trip and our booked events. The next morning we were horrified to find that we had again been the delight of some bugs dinner. After complaining to the management, they offered us another room which upon reflection was not one of our better decisions. Whilst packing up our belongings to move on, not only did we find two dead bugs under a pillow, we also found a newspaper and a transport ticket dated the previous month down the back of the bed. Futher investigation of the room identified that the curtains were dirty and the carpets were grubby, the housekeeping was only surface clean. We were not allowed into the new room until the room had been treated along with the one we had vacated.

Due to the time gap since I left the hotel, I didn't initially think that it was related. So I spent about 4 hours thoroughly cleaning my bed and room. Needless to say I found nothing suspicious. Further internet research revealed that after bed bug bites the onset of symptoms can be delayed by up to 9 - 14 days in some people. I found this info in a 1992 publication by JE Sansom et al.. I also saw it mentioned in publications of the United Stated EPA, an info pack for overseas US military personnel and a New York City bed bug advisory board report. So, adding that to the insects I saw in the hotel room, it's obvious that bed bugs were feeding on my flesh and blood while I slept at the Airways Hotel Victoria. To sum up, I would never go to this hotel again. Neither would I recommend it to anyone. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Asides from the bed bug infestation...

So, we (me and my sister) got to London and we took a tube to Victoria Station. The hotel was quite difficult to find at first, because the street (St. George's Drive) was kind of devided in two parts (the name of the street changed into some other name in the middle of the street and then back to St. George's Drive) but after we found the place it was easy to walk from the hotel to the station and back and it didn't take more than a few minutes. So the location was good. Our room was in the basement. Although it was just below the ground floor it was rather difficult to find it. After finding the room we had difficulties with the key card but after some brain work we got into our room. It was a tidy, small room with a bed for two. We had a bathroom with a shower. We took showers daily and the water was hot each time. We stayed 5 days and our sheets were changed while we were gone almost each day. They also took the rubbish out and changed the towels. We tried the breakfast at the first morning of our stay. After that we bought the breakfast outside. The breakfast was basically just cereals and toast. We couldn't finish our coffees. The service was quite good though noone really seeked to help us with bags for example. There was an internet access in the reception for the charge of 1\u00c2\u00a3/\u00c2\u00bd hour.

The location of the Hotel is spot on and is a very beautiful part of the city and as we approached the hotel were quite excited to be staying there. On check in the hotel policy is to pay up-front, \u00c2\u00a3355 for 3 nights for the 4 of us (1 under 5). The small reception was clean and seemed appropriate. Hindsight is 20:20, I should never have paid for the room up-front. When we got to our room via a dank corridor and down murky steps of carpet that had not been cleaned for some time (it was tacky and stuck slightly to the soles of your shoes). At the time we got to the room there were workmen and so there were materials all over the floor. When I opened the door I was shocked and felt ashamed that I had booked this room for my family. The room was in the basement, there were 3 single beds (2 pushed next to each other trying to be a double bed) and 1 double bed. Apart from that there was very little in the room as there was no space for anything else, I can't believe the beds were managed to be squeezed in. The decor was sparse, no bedside lights, the room was grubby, there were some bugs in one corner of the room, the TV did not receive any picture. The room was advertised as en-suite, what was there was a small cupboard that had been converted into a shower room. The shower was broken, it did not mount on the wall. The electrical wiring in this part of the hotel appeared to me to be dangerous (and I suppose there is no reason to suggest other areas were better, I just did not see them), the main fuse box was open with paper, coke cans and other rubbish stored in there, exposed wires. The mains wiring around was hanging off the wall and skirting boards. The whole place had not been decorated or cleaned in a long time. The room was adjacent the breakfast room and food preparation area, so at 06.00 am we were woken by the staff starting to prepare breakfast. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as on the first night I took the opportunity to look at the breakfast room and the food preparation area. The breakfast room was as clean as the stairway and if the food preparation area passes any hygiene test or Health and Safety regulations I will be amazed. Such was my concern I did not let my family eat there. The floor was filthy, the work-tops the same. The cooker needs disposed of, it was obvious that the same grease and fat was used more than one day to prepare the full English breakfasts, storage of food, cleanliness of utensiles .......I can go on and on. I complained on each day about the TV not working. At check out I asked for a discount and the response I got was 'it was not hotel policy'!!!!! It is very obvious that once you check in and pay up-front then your money is gone. For the sake of 3 nights I did not want to spend our first day of our break trying to get my money back and finding another place to stay, we only spend our evenings there from 10.00 pm until 09.00am next day. I did also witness another person who had checked in on Thursday complain bitterly at the room she had been given in the same tone of this note.", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, England", "Title": "\u201cThe nastiest hotel on the planet\u201d", "Author": "katwilbo", "ReviewID": "UR7750661", "Content": "We had originally booked to stay in a hotel down the road, but when we got there we were told the boiler wasn't working so we were being moved down the road to The Airways. When we got there first impressions weren't that sparkling (needed serious updating) but we had paid already through Lastminute.com, and it was half-term, so we didn't fancy trawling London for alternative accomodation. The gentleman at our original hotel and the one behind the desk kept saying it was better facilities and a brand new room. We had to walk up 7 flights of stairs to get to our new room and the sights along the way were nothing but shocking. Leaky water pipes, bare electircal wires, badly fitting dirty carpets, dirt and dust everywhere. All the bedroom doors on the way were filthy and had big gaps in the sides of the frames. On the final flight of stairs there was no bannister! There was no carpet on our landing and there was big gaps in the floor boards. Around the corner from our room, which we discovered later on, was a big drop of about 6 feet! When we reached our room, it was surprisingly clean and was indeed newly decorated. However it was the smallest room I have ever seen! The window was tiny and our view consisted of a peeling wall, there was not even any curtains. There was no hanging space for clothes and the bathroom was so small, you could not even sit straight on the loo! There was just a sheet on the bed, we asked for blankets, but they never materialised. They are obviously refurbishing at the moment as the noise was appaulling, and communal areas are as filthy as a building site. Also, which is the most shocking part, there was filthy old beds and mattresses blocking the only fire exit and there was no fire evacuation policy in the room. We were only staying at this hotel one evening, but I have never been so glad to leave a hotel in my life. We had breakfast included in our deal but there was no way I was going to eat in this filthy hovel. This hotel is not only dirty but it breaks every health and safety regulation in the book.

It was supposed to be a romantic weekend away in basic, but clean accomodation. We joked as we walked towards the hotel that the Airways sign was half falling down. The reception was Ok but the attendant was not particularly friendly, and what struck me as excessively keen to obtain our money. The alarm bells started ringing when we wer given directions to go down stairs to our room to what appeared like a basement beside what appeared to be a fire exit next to an alleyway, filled with bags and refuse. We entered our room and the carpet and bed looked as though it should have been replaced many years ago. The bathroom was mouldy and and not very clean. The prospect of spending two nights here really was offputting. The accomodation fell severely short of the image portrayed by the website. We asked for another room and were given the key to one on the first floor. It had a window to the front but was much smaller than the first, had not been cleaned and looked quite pitiable. We kept the first room and immediately went to find another hotel. Cost no longer appeared to be the issue. We were fortunate enough to find an AA rated hotel only a few metres away which had a small but luxurious and new room for only 12 pounds extra per night. The value-for-money was incomparable. Our weekend was saved from ruin. We returned to Airways to ask for our money back but were refused our first night's deposit. In my view this is dishonourable business conduct ... the only way this place can survive. That is the reason why I thank TripAdvisor for providing the opportunity to warn other people from falling into the same pitiful trap. I am sorry for those that have no alternative.
