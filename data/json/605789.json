However, if you need somewhere easy to get to, clean, with your own bathroom and breakfast included then this is it. I had a delightful little time, I was just in the area for the night and this was perfect for getting my head down. The entrance to the hotel isnt the nicest but who cares. The price is brilliant. I have paid much much more money and stayed in much much worse places than this while in London. The staff were lovely and helpful. Breakfast was even more than i expected, there is the usual choice of cereals, but then you can sort of have a fry up made to order (without the meat). I had eggs on toast, a bowl of cereal, some OJ and some lovely fresh coffee. Perfect. No hassle check in, rooms clean (although one of the pillows smelled of sweat - but theres not much you can do about that! I just changed the pillows around. Small but perfectly formed en-suite with a good power shower). If I had to pick holes, the bedside lamps didnt have bulbs in them and there was no spoon for my tea! Did I really care about this? No. The bus stops are a minutes walk away and easy to find once off the underground. I would definitely stay here again.

I booked it as I was on a limited budget for a last minute jaunt to London and it was pretty much the only hotel in my price range. We couldn't find how to get there at first and pulled into the garage. As I walked up the road I could see it behind the garage and worked out that you had to turn down the little road to the right of it! You then turn immediately left into a tiny entrance which leads to the front of the hotel. There's no car park as such, you just park on the concrete to the side of the hotel. The location isn't very pretty but the owners try & cheer the outside up with big pots of flowers. The reception area and communal lounge were clean as were the hall and stairs which are marble. The guy on reception was a bit hard to understand and didn't really have a personality but we were checked in with minimal fuss. The corridors to the rooms are clean and the carpet looks fairly new. Our room smelt of cleaning products when we entered which was encouraging! It was indeed clean and to my surprise we had a little air con unit. Everything is very basic. There's no kettle or wardrobes, just a chest of drawers. Like the carpets in the corridor, the one in the room seemed quite new and was clean. The double bed seemed on the small side and was a bit uncomfortable, mainly because the plastic undersheet and pillows made a noise every time you turned over! There was also an awful (rather pointless) head board. It was covered in stains!! The curtains were very odd. There was only one per window which you could not draw as both ends were attached to the curtain pole! The bathroom was fully functional and soap and shampoo was provided. There was a big damp patch on the ceiling but the rest was clean. You can hear the people in rooms around you clearly so don't expect a quiet stay! Overall, as my title suggests, you get what you pay for. It was \u00c2\u00a352 for the room (\u00c2\u00a35 of which was a charge for paying by credit card) I have paid twice that for a worse room in London.

The location of the hotel is not the best, its hidden away and finding the entrance is a bit of an exercise.

Now down to the gritty part, the rooms are worse than living on the streets, at least on the street you can pick a semi clean floor. The carpet was filthy, and not fit to walk on bear foot. The curtains were stuck together with chewing gum, no wardrobe to hang any clothes, the walls had an unusual pattern on them, I think they call it splattered food and drink. The bathroom was tiny, the sink was dirty with the previous customers hairs still present, the shower had lovely yellow taping holding the shower head on, and the drains omitted a lovely stench of blocked drains. The bathroom being bad enough we thought, then came the bed, apart from the obvious very yellow stained headboard, the bed linen had not been changed from the previous customer. We asked for clean sheets, which the porter insisted on doing, while changing the bed, the mattress underneath was covered in blood, with no mattress cover on.

During my week stay my room was cleaned and towels changed as and when i requested. the room was of a reasonable size and clean shower was working and hot water at all times no matter when i used it. which is a plus point as it was very cold outside. overall my stay was pleasnt and i would stay again. a good standard for the price paid", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA / Slovakia", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for...\u201d", "Author": "John_in_Slovakia", "ReviewID": "UR21813376", "Content": "I started reading reviews after I had already booked it.

The staff was actually friendly and polite; however, I didn't need anything extra from them. They were a little slow at breakfast, but they were trying. The lobby and stairwell is quite nice as others have written, but the rooms need work: The headrest was disgusting, the shower a little dingy, the room small with no wardrobe or closet.

Be warned! They will make you pay upfront and sign a Terms & Conditions form that waives your right to a refund for any nights you do not stay at the hotel. We were booked for 4 nights, signed the form and paid upfront. It's only once you've signed do you get a chance to see what you've paid for. If you don't like the room and they will not change it, then tough, you've paid and your money is theirs. Obviously they've had a number of people come and go earlier than they planned so now they need to secure the income on the room (even though they can sell it to someone else after you checkout early and make double the amount of money!!!) As for the room. It would be okay for a backpacker or someone who prefers not to sleep on a park bench. The TV is a waste of time - I was lucky enough to have a remote, but the batteries were dead. And the picture - awful!!! The shower head holder had been broken for some time so it made showering difficult. The bathroom is SO small that you have to push the door open with your backside if you want to rinse your face in the sink. There was hair all over the carpet and plenty of dust to go with it. The windows were all open in my room obviously trying to air the room out because of the musty smell. You'll also have the added luxury of one dining chair and a chest of drawers - the wardrobe is the bathroom door. The staff try to be helpful but I'm sure they don't really care.

The bethnal green tube station (central line) is about a 15 minute walk away up one long street which was OK but isnt to walk if you are going to be with kids, elderly or disabled etc. The staff where polite but could of been a bit friendlier at times, I was surprised when I arrived at 140pm that I was told to wait until 2pm to check in. We didnt eat but the lounge and reception areas where also clean and tidy and presented much better than I expected.
