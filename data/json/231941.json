A not unpleasant walk, well worth it. But guess what. It is the restaurant that blows me away. Chef Dario Colaricchiovi (spelling?) is a master. I have written to the RSVP column at Bon Appetit magazine to ask them to request his recipe for the Tagliata (even though I also had the vermicelli with bacon, seafood and asparagus six nights in a row - amazing, this guy).

The one knock against the Sheraton is that it is difficult to get to from the Rome city center. We were not flying in or out, merely taking trains, so the location was not convenient at all. The shuttle to the hotel supposedly runs a few times per day, but after exploring the web site and communicating with the front desk, we were not able to figure out where exactly the pick up was. (They used landmarks for directions rather than subway stops and streets.) Instead, we took a 30Euro cab ride from the city center to the hotel.

Expresso and cappucino can be provided, if you make the request in Italian to the staff, otherwise only filter coffee is on display.The bar is nice but quite expensvie compared to ordinary bars in Town. I can't comment on the golf since there was snow in the region and it was just a whitish huge field outside. I cannot say it was a bad hotel, it is just that I did not feel like living a great moment while there. In fact, the place was too far to go anywhere by walking alone, Rome city center could be reached by a shuttle. Internet rates are outrageous: 18 to 21 Euros for 24 hours wifi.

The free city shuttle is why I didn't ask to change hotels, however the shuttle service was scarce after 2pm, and after waiting 2 hours for it to arrive, there were enough passengers to fill 2 buses. They do not allow standing passengers, so some were left behind for another 3 hours! Taxis to this remote hotel location, at least 15km from the city, would have cost too many euros. As for meals, well the buffet breakfast was standard buffet fare, no complaints about that really but dinner was pricey, and as they didn't open the main dining room at night, eight of us (3 groups) were seated in lounge chairs at coffee tables, just off the main foyer.Uncomfortable, AND overpriced. There were no facilities to fill the time at this hotel in the complex. A paved courtyard, very hot in August, was used mainly by smokers and that made it very unpleasant, also no shade. An area on the other side which probably should have been garden as it had shrubs and un- mown grass, wasn't accessible.The pool was at building 1, about one km away by shuttle, available when you requested it.We weren't given any information about it when we checked in, and didn't go out of our way to use it.

We use this hotel regularly for our overnights when departing from Rome FCO on an early flight and It is VERY convenient for that purpose. We have also stayed several times with large family groups as a base to visit the city as nice Rome hotels are quite pricey and this has a little more room to roam (remember that in MOST hotels in Europe you cannot have more than 2 people in a room or there is an extra charge - same is true here) We have stayed in all 3 hotels that make up the complex so have a lot to say. As we usually use starpoints to book this one is a deal to stay at (except when you have to book extra rooms or extra beds for those kids). The pluses: 1-just 10 or 15 min to the airport 2- They do have a free large and comfortable shuttle bus into Rome for those wanting to get one last dinner in Rome or for those who would rather just stay outside of the city. The bus obviously runs on a schedule, so you do have to plan around it. 3. Pools and outside area in buildings 1 & 2 (but not nearly as much as it appears on their website :-) 4. Free parking - but only in buildings 2 & 3 - see minuses for building 1 :-) The minuses: 1. The worst is that you do not know which building you will be in. So you have to guess and drive up to one and go in to reception to find out if you can check in there or have to move on. NOT FUN if you have already unloaded your bags...so this is an IMPORTANT thing to remember! 2. No pool in building 3 - so if you have kids wanting a swim try to request building 2 (if you have a car) or building 1 (if you don't - nicer pool) 3-As other reviewers have said - the food leaves much to be desired - figure out how to get somewhere else for that last memorable dinner!! 4-free parking in building 3 - well basically there is none! They have a pay lot which you have a meter box to pay for (can't even put it on your bill). When we complained and asked about free parking they told us it was across the street.

We had an executive room in Hotel 2 which was very good...nice lounge area, comfortable 'King' bed and spacious bathroom with a seperate shower. The TV, while being a good size wide screen had a very poor programme selection, no popular sport (football, F1, etc) or even Italian football, only eurosport in German. No BBC World even, only Sky News which becomes repetative after 10 minutes. Food is variable, breakfast in Hotel 2 is overly busy and fast paced with a fall off in quality. All the hot food becomes cold because the lids are never closed on the food warmers, the queues for coffee, toasters and juice dispensers are very irritating, but there are plenty of pastries and cakes to fill up on. For an evening meal Hotel 1 is a better proposition, run by a very efficient and charming restaurant manager, if you are in the hotel for a number of nights chef will cook you a meal of local dishes as the set menu is not at all extensive. I have not mentioned hotel 3 as it was closed through our stay with its entrance blocked off by a car to prevent any one parking there. It is the newest hotel and it is strange to see it standing empty...it is a shame its restaurant was not opened for breakfast at least which would have relieved the scrum in hotel 2. We chose the hotel as a base for Rome and Lazio, for which it is ideal, sitting just off the Rome Ring and airport motorways. We did not drive into Rome although we had a hire car...driving in Rome is requiring nerves of steel - we had an escorted tour for two days, picked up from the hotel, the tours were tailored for what we wanted to see at about \u00a3250 a day. That may seem alot but it is well worth it, we chose 'Discovery' tours and our driver/guide could get to places that large groups could only dream of, this cost included a personal guide around the Vatican. We used the Hotel coach on another day which leaves the hotel about every 75 minutes from 10.00, this drops and picks up from near the centre of Rome. Although the coach was not full on the day we used it, I noted on a couple of other days that the early buses do fill, especially if touring parties are in the hotel. On both occasions a back up coach was sent for. We used a car to visit the countryside around Rome...I recommend Lake Bracciano, Ostia, Anzio and Bagnoregio. You do get used to the driving style...honestly...just remember most Italians do not use indicators, do not give way....etc..The motorways are very good, but many of the main roads are in a fairly poor condition. Make sure you have hire papers and driving license with you as traffic police gave me a very difficult 15 minutes while they checked I was who I said I was...they could have fined me for the hire agreement not being in the car.

There are no shops nearby. When i explained to the hotel what I needed, their only suggestion was for me to take the hotel shuttle to a nearby shopping center- about half an hour each way. Given that I was there on business, it was not very convenient to have to leave the area for some basic hygiene items.

When I inserted the plug of my laptop at 10 pm into the wall socket in my room, the power went off completely. It took 15 min before a technican came to my room and restored the power.

We were on a Make A Wish trip for our youngest child, age 16. So there were five of us in our family, including my husband, and daughter, 21, and other son, 18. I mention that, because we had not chosen the hotel, but were very happy with the location. The 12 miles from downtown Rome scared us, but the hotel had a free shuttle that would drop off and pick up at only one location west of the Coliseum. They give you a schedule and you need to watch the times in the evening to return if you want to go in for dinner. But to go anywhere in Rome for the major sites it costs no more than 10 euros for all of us. You must have a cab that will fit 5 people, as most carry 4. It costs no more, but you may have to have a restaurant or the hotel call one for you, especially on the weekends when not as many cabs run in the summer. The beauty of the 12 miles out is that when we had to leave to get the the airport early on the last day, we had a shorter ride to get to FMO airport and then we needed a van called for us and our luggage. That was about 70 euros and we weren't that far, about a 20-30 min ride away. It was 150 euros from Civitavecchia port to the hotel, which the ship allowed us to use their phone to arrange a few days before debarking. I did write a comment that the hotel should provide a shuttle to the airport, but they don't. They had a small van which I inquired about, but they said it wasn't for the airport and couldn't be hired, even though it had their name on it and they must have used it for someone. maybe it only went between the 3 properties. If they had an airport shuttle, I would consider staying there again. As it was, it was expensive enough for the airport van two ways and it would have paid for another night or a fabulous dinner, so in the end, we all weigh our options! The rooms we had were the better rooms near the pool with french doors to the patio, great beds, nice bath amenities, safes, and great cleaning staff. There was an ATM in the lobby, but our cards would never work in them, as it was an Italian bank or euro system only. But a 3 min walk to an ATM in front of the small movie theater, shopping pizza place, stores open late, worked just fine. The hotel wants you to eat in their restaurant at the adjoining golf course, which is very nice but pricey. They told us there was nothing close for restaurants. Later we saw a 20% off for the meals, but our kids and we were very happy one evening with pizza and beers near the movie as I needed the cash for the van to the airport. The Sheraton has 3 properties on this same road that seems to be in the middle of nowhere, but I'm sure you can find things within a mile or two with a cab. I'm not sure about the others, but ours had a wonderful pool, with poolside drink and food service. So refreshing and not crowded after a hot day walking around Rome. There are protected swallows that make their mud nests under the eaves of the hotel and we saw a heron of some type on the roof also. We never golfed, but the course is very nice and we walked before dinner one night along the edge which was so peaceful near the ponds. We do golf, so it is apparent from the club, club golf shop, and restaurant, ( as well as the nice cars parked outside) that this is a nice place. I had envisioned a 15th century hotel in downtown Rome overlooking a piazza, smelling garlic from the restaurant below through open french doors and a flower box laden with geraniums, but the reality is that the shuttle was reliable, the hotel we stayed in was quiet, well run, clean, had a pool, and it is close to the airport, so we were happy with our stay. It was mostly business meetings with many Italians (many Japanese while we were there for a conference and pilots and flight attendants. The hotel was small and the buildings were at most 2 stories high, so not a huge, impersonal, hotel, but rather intimate and the real Italy. Breakfast was a gorgeous buffet. I asked if it was included, which was no, but it was so nice and complete with bacon, eggs, pastries, potatoes, coffees, juice variety, cereals, yogurt, cheeses, etc, that we opted to all eat there and enjoy a meal before the airport food!

If you want a more upscale choice, you can refer to the other \"Sheraton Roma\" hotel. However this remains a good choice for a good hotel with a moderate price point. If you book in advance you can usually find pretty competitive rates. This premise is necessary to understand my review. I was in building #3, the newest I suppose; other buildings are completely separate hotels with their own reception and facilities. There is free covered (solar panels), unguarded parking on the hotel grounds. Everything was quick and smooth at checkin and checkout. The room was comfortable, wooden floor, quiet and I enjoyed a great sleep. All common amenities for 4* were available: laptop size electronic safe, air conditioning, minibar. The TV was a modern LCD of medium size. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom had all expected amenities, although the usual large facial tissues were replaced by a tiny package of micro paper tissues. In my room the fixed shower was in the bath tub and had a curtain, a less than optimal, although much common, solution. The room and the bathroom felt new and were in perfect conditions; however they were on the small side. Despite the relatively little space, everything found its place; there is a wardrobe, a desk, a little mini sofa. Overall, it was a comfortable room with everything needed but not much luxury, nor much space. This was the standard room \"superior\", not \"deluxe\". Breakfast was sufficiently good, choice of yoghurts, limited choice of fruit, good choice of pastries and cakes. However at 7:30 the room was quite busy, the few attendants struggled to quickly clean the tables and serve the guests for special requests. This hotel seems to be popular with large groups and it was fully booked, so the breakfast conditions may be excusable. The price for breakfast, if not included, was moderate (14\u20ac I think), which justifies the available quality and variety. Checkout was sufficiently quick, despite the large crowds from bus groups. If you are looking for a cost effective solution outside of the city (it is near the GRA, the highway ring), this is an excellent choice with international level facilities at a moderate price. If you don't like small rooms, try the deluxe ones. Don't expect top 4* luxury and you will not be disappointed. I see this as a very good choice positioned between the cheaper \"four points\" and the more expensive \"Sheraton\".

Maybe it's because of its size and number of large tour groups staying there, but service was rather impersonal. No recognition of Plt status aside from asking what Plt amenity I wanted. On check-in, I was not told where or when breakfast was (rate incl breakfast). I was also not instructed on how to use the internet (free for Plt). I had to call Guest Services to get the information. BTW, the free plt internet is LAN only. WiFi is charged. My Plt room: I had a very lovely view of the road outside the hotel. The room and bathroom were very large, esp for Europe. Despite checking in after 5 PM, my room was not quite ready. Housekeeping was still in the room when I arrived. The bed is quite comfortable and the room quiet. Rome was unseasonably warm, in the 80's. Unfortunately, the air conditioner did not work well and none of the windows opened (nights were very cool). Front desk service was OK. Many times, it was understaffed. Despite tour groups and airline personnel checking out simultaneously in the AMs, only 2 ppl were at the desk. The hotel is very inconveniently located. Despite my conference being only 3 km away, taking a taxi was a minimum of 10 euros. Taxis have to be called by the front desk, which starts the fee at 6 euros. I had the misfortune of running into 3 dishonest taxi drivers (out of 6 used!). One claimed that he was not the taxi called for me. He stood around then went to check with the front desk, all the while the meter is running. He then told me he would take me - the starting meter was now 10euros! I refused to go with him unless he reset it. He refused. I got out. One had set his rate at 2 (daytime/weekday rate is supposed to be 1), so the price came out double. i didn't realize this until later. Another had \"fixed' his meter to run extra fast. The same distance and faster time to get to my hotel cost twice as much as usual. i had checked that the rate setting was \"1\". There are no restaurants nearby. So you are stuck with the hotel's restaurants or taking a taxi somewhere or taking the free hotel shuttle bus into central Rome. Breakfast is plentiful but a madhouse.

The metro has a three day pass - 11 Euro - can get only through machine - exact change needed. Overall not a bad place to stay if you plan your transport into Rome properly.

I stood in front of the reception for at least 5 min with zero acknowledgement). In order to get a taxi you usually have to wait in line then ask for a taxi (a few days I waited for people to check in before I could call a taxi). If you\u2019re looking to be near the downtown area the drive is about 30 min by car. Anytime I needed something whether it was to ask a question or order room service it took forever and most of the staff were unfriendly. Some of this is cultural but I do expect with an international hotel such as Sheraton that there would be proper training and staffing to accommodate guests. The hotel itself overall was clean, modern and spacious. The root cause of the issue comes down to process issues with the hotel itself and service not meeting my expectations.

Location- in the middle of nowhere. 50 euro by taxi to the airport (in case thats why u were thinking of staying here, incidentally, u can fly low cost from rome to istanbul for that much). 30 minutes to the city centre. no public transportation options. u will never feel u are in rome. they have a golf course, if all you want to do in rome is play golf, good for you! The hilton is better for catching early flights. we stayed for a conference at the fiera di roma...there can be no other reason to stay here...and even then I think we went with the wrong hotel. rooms- spacious and quite nice. but for 314 euro a night, no tea/coffe maker!! no free internet!! go figure! difficult to operate airconditioner. bathroom- and i love this part- obsolete bath fittings. the water plug in the bathtub and basin and bidet ( all 3) cannot be removed by any standard system such as a chain attached to it or the normal push/pull lever behind the tap. so after u've had a bath/wash... explore the murky waters to struggle with the plug with ur fingers to lift it and drain the water!! but they have heated towel racks...how thoughtful! service- this beats everything.. our room was beside the pool with big french windows facing it...and no heavy curtains... so all night the lights of the pool/lawn kept entering with no way to shut it out! they have a special phone line called \"guest services\"- I guess precisely because the hotel is so devoid of it- we called 7 times, no kidding, 7 times. no use. same the second night, calls to the reception went unanswered. then i actually personally struck up a conversation with the hotel porter who had it fixed!!!! room service- they never pick up the phone. reception- they pick up the phone 1 out of every 3 times. room service gives tea in the room free... but with a 6 euro service charge per cup!!!!!!! no one in the hotel considers english a language worth speaking or understanding!! there is always a mile long line at the reception if you need to ask anybody anything. this hotel is SERIOUSLY UNDERSTAFFED. food- did not bother. there is a pizzeria next door which serves great pizzas. others- nice lawns. good arrangements to sit in the outdoor lawns beside the pool and watch football on a big screen..we were there when spain played portugal... nice touch with a plate of fruits in the room...thats all. our worst hotel experience in 2 weeks in italy. if u think i am biased, pls check my reviews for hotels savoia and jolanda venice, berchielli florence and trilussa palace rome ( will be up shortly)...all found from tripadvisor and excellent. if this is really a Sheraton, china will win the football world cup in 2014!", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cBig spacious Hotel - very far away from the City\u201d", "Author": "deepakmalik1", "ReviewID": "UR68715229", "Content": "Rooms were decent sized, amenities were good.

This was our first time to Rome with a small child and we were keen to have something quiet, but with easy access to the city. The Sheraton Golf had both of these. Negatives: The hotel is quite old and run down and the grounds in particular are in need of some love. Our room had a balcony (of sorts) but with a 7 foot high wall, you could see nothing but sky and only then if you looked directly up! When we stood on a chair we could see the neighbouring block which had been used as a dump for building waste - not very pretty. We ordered room service on the first night as we arrived around midnight. Our meal was terrible, but filled us up, the worst thing was that our room service tray sat outside our door for the next 2 days as did 2 or 3 others along our hallway! There is also nowhere (other than the adjoining golf course) to go in the area so unless you spend all day every day in the city you will be disappointed by the location. We were a little surprised that our room did not have tea and coffee making facilities, nor an iron and board. Positives: The staff on the front desk and all of the restaurant staff were lovely, spoke excellent English and were very accommodating to our needs with a small child. The buffet breakfast was good and included in the rate. Our room was COMPLETELY dark and very sound proofed and the bed was quite comfy so we slept very well. The double brick construction also meant there was no need to use the air con or the heater as it was a lovely temperature inside at all times. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus (48 seater coach) to the city each day on a very regular schedule. This was fantastic and another reason we chose this hotel. The drivers were never friendly, but the coach was clean and comfortable and meant we didn't need a car at all. Our room was clean on arrival and serviced well each day.

The hotel we all checked in to is this hotel. As we checked our room, it was alright. The only thing is it's kinda small. But it doesn't matter, since I was ok about it & just the right room for both of me & my mom. And so, both of us went to the center of Rome & went sightseeing. Now here's the horrible thing that happened to us. It started raining that afternoon, and both of us were rushing to the shuttle bus to our hotel. Then, when we arrived at the spot of the shuttle bus, we saw some people trying to get in the bus, but were pushed over! I don't know what was wrong, but I guess it's because the bus is so full. So, with people still trying to get in the bus, the bus suddenly left us! I mean, it's not the proper way to treat a guest of that hotel! Don't they realize that someone could get hurt in a very dangerous situation like that, especially in a rainy day, where people are most likely to fall off in a slippery road? So, what did we do? We just took the other shuttle bus to Sheraton Roma, and from there, we just took a taxi cab to Parco Medici. As we arrived at the Sheraton Roma, my mom convinced me to go along with some of the flight attendants she was working with, who also stayed at Parco Medici. Then, as we arrived at Parco Medici, the flight attendants started complaining like crazy about the hotel's shuttle bus! I want to complain about it too, but I guess it'll be ok in the next day.

There were many problems with the hotel. As mentioned by another reviewer, the hotel comprises 3 buildings, about 800m to 1.5km apart. When you book, you are not told which building to arrive at & can go from one to the other until it is solved. I arrived at 10pm & the staff in Bldg 2 told me to walk in the dark, on a public road to get to Bldg 3. It was only when I insisted, that they offered me a lift in the hotel's shuttle car. The second day I was there, there was no water for several hours - the staff seemed uninterested in the problem, rudely saying \"it will be back on in 1 hour\". Another reviewer has mentioned the lack of ironing facilities - if you stay in Bldg 3, you have to walk about 800m to Bldg 2 to use the single iron available. Many times in the week I stayed, I called the \"Guest services\" number, but it was never answered. One day my room wasn't serviced when I arrived back at 9pm. Despite staff saying they'd service the room immediately, it still wasn't serviced at 10pm. After complaining a second time, it was finally serviced. The Hotel supposedly has a Turkish Bath/Sauna complex, but it is closed. Others in my conference group also had problems, such as: burst water pipe, flooding room. In shower, only scalding hot water available. Lost luggage - luggage that did not arrive on a flight was apparently delivered the next day to the hotel (airline apparently had a receipt proving this), but hotel denied having received luggage. Took several days to \"find\" the luggage & hotel manager apparently wasn't helpful, telling guest rudely \"just claim on your insurance\". The Hotel is isolated. There's really nothing around, except parched fields & an expressway. There is a small cinema complex about 2-3km away - I never went - movies apparently only in Italian. The hotel offers a shuttle bus to/from Rome, but the times are a little limited. I heard guests say they had turned up for the bus in Rome, but it was full, so they had to take a taxi from Rome to the Hotel (about 30 euros). Breakfast buffet is modest, but there's nowhere else to obtain food.

The staff are doing the best under the circumstances, but as a guest, you'd be better staying somewhere else until the kinks are ironed out. Arrival experience: the resort is divided into three main buildings, without proper walking paths between them, and all about 500m to 700m apart. Problem 1 is that when you book, you are not told which of these three buildings, each with it's own reception area, you are booked into. You can only find out by trial and error. I tried all three, dragging my baggage between them, before I got lucky. There was a large conference group at the resort when I stayed for three days, and having found the right building, check-in took 20 minutes of queuing. Services: Broadband internet in the room via cable was not working, but via wireless was. Unlike some hotels in Italy, it is an extra charge of 22 Euros per day. Connection was quite straightforward. Unlike getting a shirt ironed. Despite the hotel services brochure stating overnight laundry service is open until 10pm, it was closed when I inquired at 8.30pm. I then asked if I could have an iron and ironing board sent to my room. This was not possible either. The only option was to use a makeshift 'ironing room' (actually a staff locker) in, you guessed it, one of the other buildings. Another 500m hike, just to iron a shirt. Shuttle buses: There are shuttle buses to drive guests between the three buildings, but they are 'on demand' and are too few, so that waiting times can be so long you are better off hiking yourself. Other similarly spread-out resorts have regular shuttle runs between buildings and attractions, and the Sheraton Golf doesn't seem to offer it yet. Walkways: As mentioned, the quickest way to get between buildings may be to walk, but the resort is not designed to allow you to do so. To get from my building to the building where I had to do my ironing, I had to walk through a carpark, across a road with no pedestrian crossing, and through a dark car park. I would not recommend this to single ladies. Room appointments: are new, and comfortable, with spacious rooms as other reviewers have mentioned. The hot water in the shower has temperature settings that only seem to vary between HOT and VERY HOT, so washing my hair was a scalding experience.

They do have a shuttle bus but it is a lengthy ride to town. 2) Very overpriced....eg. a 300 ml. bottle of water cost 3 euros while it costs 0.15 euros in a grocery store. 3) The golf course is nothing to write home about....and why would you go to Rome to golf anyway? In the 3 days, we saw zero golfers. 4) Staff is moderately unhelpful which I found was unusual for Rome where generally people are very helpful. 5) Conference facilities are fairly limited.

The Kleenex tissue was small--about half of a normal tissue in size. It is probably part of a trend toward smaller canned drinks, cars, bars of soap, and bags of peanuts.

A reservation cannot be changed without a cancellation charge of one night, which is why I will stay at a different hotel next time.

Our room and the other rooms have an Italian flare to them whereas the rooms in the newer building look more modern at least on the Sheraton website. The room was kept very clean and there were enough towels for us. When you arrive, they give you a little bag for toiletries containing a razor, shaving cream, mouthwash and a comb. There\u2019s one for women and one for men. They also give you slippers and a robe which was a nice touch. There is a mini bar in the room but don\u2019t touch that unless you really need to. The prices are high. There are no vending machines to be found here so if you get really thirsty, you may pay a high price. The hotel area is very quiet at night as was the building itself. There is a pool and a garden area which was very nice. The pool was a bit small and not very deep but good for cooling off after a hot day in downtown Rome. Food: There is a free breakfast buffet each day. It was fine. It has eggs, bacon and sausage as well as plenty of pastries and danish. It was fine but during an eight night stay, got pretty boring. There is a restaurant in the old building. We ate there on our first night as we were tired and didn\u2019t want to go anywhere. The food was fine as was the service but the prices are way too high. The same goes for the bar and pool service where a burger will run you around $20 American. Bar prices were also pretty high. If you are in the old building there is a shopping area nearby and is about a five minute walk. There you will find a supermarket, which is very handy to get drinks and snacks for your room at very low prices. By the movie theatre, there is an American style bar and a pizza place. Both are good and the prices far lower than at the hotel. The pizza place was better. Both are full of locals so if you are a tourist, it\u2019s a nice experience. Service: The front desk staff were fine. Our room was not ready when we arrived due to it being a Saturday and a lot of people were checking in or checking out. That took an hour but we were given complimentary drinks from the bar while we waited. The front desk staff all speak English well and are very helpful. The bell staff, cleaners and wait staff speak enough English to at least get by. Airport Transportation: Coming in, you\u2019ll have to take a cab. It will cost you about 40 Euros. We lucked out as I spotted someone from the hotel walking around wearing a Sheraton Golf uniform. He was helping with guests going on a cruise who were staying there for one night. He was making sure that they were getting on the right bus to the hotel. I asked him if we could do that. He said no but said he would be glad to give us a ride in the hotel van. We did that and I tipped him 10 Euros as a thank you which is what I think he was looking for anyway but it saved us 30 Euros which was nice. Leaving, there is a free bus at 8:00 a.m. from the hotel. That didn\u2019t work for us as we had an earlier flight home. It cost us 55 Euros in the cab. That\u2019s more than usual but they were still charging night fees. It takes around 15 minutes to get to or from the airport. Downtown Transportation: There is a free bus that runs roughly every 90 minutes. It leaves you in a pretty convenient location that is not far from the Colosseum or the Roman Forum. The first one leaves at 9:00 a.m. and the last one back is at 10:45 p.m. It\u2019s a big bus and we never had a problem getting a seat. They are sometimes late going back due to traffic but it will show up. If you miss the last bus, a cab back will run you about 50 Euros. The drivers were fine. The guy in the morning was okay but watch out for the guy at night. He can be a bit nasty at times but usually was pretty pleasant. If the traffic was bad, he was grumpy. There is a caf\u00e9 by the bus stop. This is very handy if you just missed one and you can have a cold drink, snack or an ice cream while seated outside while you are waiting. There are also some good restaurants right in that area which are conveniently located a short walk from the bus. A few times, we went back early, cooled off in the pool, showered, changed and took the bus downtown for dinner and back again. A lot of people do this. The last bus at 10:45 arrived like clockwork each time. You can get a taxi from the hotel but be careful. If the front desk calls one for you, the cab\u2019s meter starts running when the call is received. Don\u2019t be surprised to find a few Euros on the meter when it arrives. Depending on the time of the day, your best bet is to wait in front as, during the day, plenty come in and drop people off. At night or early in the morning, you will have to have the font desk call for one. Tours: The front desk can book bus tours from Rome for you. We took three. The company will pick you up but not always at the hotel due to its distance. Twice, we had to go to the Sheraton Roma which is about a five minute cab ride that will cost roughly 12 Euros. We had one pick up from the hotel but they never showed up. When I told the front desk, they called the company who sent a taxi to take us there at no charge to us. If you do a tour, have the bus company drop you off at the stop for the hotel bus when you get back to Rome. That will save a cab ride from the Sheraton Roma and allow you to get dinner in Rome before heading back. On one occasion, the bus company told us they would drop us off there and that was fine with us. Guests: During the weekdays, the hotel was roughly split evenly between tourists and business travelers. The hotel is popular for business conventions and there is a big office complex nearby. The hotel is also used for overnight stays by touring companies or tourists who are going on a cruise. The front desk and lobby area can be very crowded and noisy when they arrive or depart. Overall, a nice stay and I recommend staying here. Be careful with the prices in the bar and restaurant and take full advantage of the downtown bus. We very much enjoyed our stay here. Sure, it wasn't that close to downtown Rome but easy to get to.", "Date": "May 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cVery Inconvenient Location\u201d", "Author": "JellybeanSeattle", "ReviewID": "UR7636624", "Content": "We stayed at this Sheraton for the Rome portion of our trip. We had gotten a good priced Expedia package. I knew the hotel wasn't in Rome central, but felt comfortable because of the shuttle and what I believed was relatively close proximity to Rome. I made a horrible mistake in booking a room here. First of all, we found out that there were really two parts to the hotel, the older hotel and the newly renovated hotel. Can you guess which part we were in? One of the reasons I booked at this Sheraton was because it was advertised as modern with air conditioning. There was nothing 'modern' about our room, and the AC was so weak that we had to open the window, but was forced to close it because we were getting mosquito bites. We informed the front desk, they sent someone over to check it out. While it was slightly better, it still didn't cool our room very much. It was quite warm when we were there at the end of April. There were alot of big tour groups that came in, I think to just spend the night before heading out to the airport. Breakfast was included with our room, and it was a really decent breakfast, but it got quite crowded with the tour groups and lots of stuff was always running out. The worst WORST part of it was the shuttle that takes guests to Rome. The shuttle, actually a big tour bus that seats 48, departs every 90 minutes, starting at 9am. I initially thought it would be quite ideal, to stay in a quiet place, have a leisurely breakfast, then take the free bus to explore Rome. Well, there were more guests then seats, and if you couldn't elbow your way into the bus, you were just out of luck. You either would have to wait 90 minutes for the next shuttle, which could also be full, or take a taxi in, which was about 20 to 25 euros. The bus sometimes came nearly full because its first stop is at the newly renovated part of the hotel that is about a quarter mile away. So once you're in the bus, you're driven into Rome, which was about a 30 minute drive. We were dropped off at the same place only two out of the 6 days we were there. It is not a problem if you're dropped off and told your drop off point is also your pick-up point. Not helpful when you have to take a taxi into Rome because the shuttle is full and that is the day they decide to switch locations. The service wasn't horrible, it was a great value to have a breakfast buffet included, the room was a typical European room that came with a TV and a decent sized bathroom with a tub/shower. All in all, it wasn't too bad, but our experience with the shuttle casts a negative shadow on our memories of our stay. Unless the only reason you're in Italy is to golf, don't stay here. You can find a comparable hotel for the same amount in Rome Central.", "Date": "May 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cSheraton should be ashamed of the service here\u201d", "Author": "Clevelandtravelers", "ReviewID": "UR7631351", "Content": "We chose this hotel for the last night of our 3 weeks in Italy, because it was close to the airport.

The price we were quoted of 116 euro per night for a 3 night stay, inc b/fast, with tee times booked for 18 holes on 2 days was a bargain so it's worth checking the hotel booking websites. We arrived at the hotel ( taxi fare 30 euros from airport, this included extra for 2 sets of golf clubs on top of our luggage so v reasonable ) 2 hours before check in hoping it would be quiet and would be allowed to check in early, we were horrified to find at least 200 other guests had arrived litterally minutes before us on 4 coaches and the reception lobby was mayhem, luckily they were being directed to one of the many confrence areas and not to the check in desk , checked in early no problems and was given a room on the second floor. It was clear from previous reports and the photos on their website we were in the older of the 2 hotels Sheraton have in this area (there is third hotel nearer Rome centre) but the room was fine, clean and bright, serviced every day and was more than adequate for our needs.

Didn't have time to try the restaurant so cannot comment on this. We are high handicappers and the course was a joy to play, we did not get the best of the weather but we managed to get round both days, the worst of the weather held off until we got into the centre of Rome late afternoon each day, we had terrible rain and hail storms on both days which did spoil the sightseeing. The shuttle bus is a real must as you are a good distance from the centre, try and avoid coming and going between around 16.00 and 20.00 as the rush 'hour' lasts forever! also, try and avoid the cafe directly at the bus stop, we did expect to pay over the odds in the centre of Rome for drinks but 14 euros for a can of Coke and 2 small local beers seemed a bit of a rip off! I think the paying customers inside were unfairly levied for the many other bus passangers taking shelter under the cafe's umbrellas outside.

Here is a recap: Positives: - Used starwood points. This was a great deal at only 4,000 points per night. - Requested a \"new\" room and it was beautiful; large with a nice bathroom; separate shower and tub. King bed and rollaway were very comfortable - Hotel is about 18 miles from the center of Rome; we used the shuttle each day. It was very comfortable, reliable, and drop off/pickup is in a central location at Piazza Venezia. Expect to spend 45 minutes to an hour (depending on traffic) for the commute - Management was responsive and very appologetic for several mishaps (see below) Negatives: - Booked through a starwood customer service representative and was not told that there is an extra charge for rollaway; be careful in Europe (as we found out the hard way) rollaways are typically only free for children 12 and under; older children count as third person. We discussed this with the clerk at check-in and she agreed to waive the charge because of the starwood mix-up. However, we were charged 70 Euros per night (ouch!) for our 15-year old. Fortunately, we noticed this on the video bill early on. After much discussion with clerks, management, and Starwood customer service, the fee was waived. - At reservation requested non-smoking room but got smoking; there was no smell, so no big deal; this mix up was one of the reasons the rollaway charge was waived. - Had problem with shower (water wouldn't drain); took three repeat calls for an improvement (drained better, but never great); this was also one of the reasons the rollaway fee was waived - First shuttle doesn't leave for Rome until 9 (count on getting to Rome by 10). We're early birds, but adjusted without much trouble. - Hotel is far from restaurants, so you're pretty much forced to eat there. The only choice at breakfast is the buffet, 11 Euros each. Good food with good variety between hot and cold foods. However, hot foods were the same every day. By the fourth morning we were tired of bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, and hashbrowns. Two garden salads, water, a glass of wine, and fruit salad at dinner were 43 Euros. Overall it was a great stay and well worth the points; don't know that I'd feel the same way if we paid the extra 70 Euros/night for the rollaway. As an aside, beware - taxi drivers have a scam going. We were charged 60 Euros for a 15 minute ride from the airport. That's about double what we should have paid. Apparently, drivers can choose if they charge you rate 1 or 2. Rate 2 doubles the price. As we found out later, we should have refused to pay it and threatened to call the police.", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sheraton Golf Parco de' Medici Hotel & Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d231941-Reviews-Sheraton_Golf_Parco_de_Medici_Hotel_Resort-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$121 - $245*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Viale Salvatore Rebecchini, 39</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00148</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "231941", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b6/b1/b6b1672988866bd84a3f98c750377f2d8large.jpg"}}
