If you want your room to be made, you have someday to ask it twice. The night service ? Forget about it. We stayed 5 days : the night service was not even made once. You travel with children ? Ok, they can guarantee you a connecting room, and that is a good thing. But everything in that mather stops here. As the front door, the welcome your receive each time you walk in is not the one you can expect in a 5 stars hotel. Some of the rooms you can rent are like a basketball hall : high ceiling, but every sound is like a nasty noise in a cathedral. Some parts of the hotel seem not to be have cleaned the last two weeks. It is a real shame. You may think that these kinds of \"stuff\" are not a problem for you. You are the judge, but keep in mind that you are supposed to be in a 5 stars hotel. It was clear in my mind that you can just not compare a London 5 stars with a Berlin 5 stars hotel, but here the difference is just too big not to tell it. Try to eat at the hotel restaurant, the \"Parioli\", and you will find out what kind of hotel you are staying in. The deco is nice but... If like eating out in fast food, this restaurant can be for you, except for the bill. We were there with a family of 3, and by paying 350 Euro, we expected to have some quality food. Forget it at the Parioli. I don't want to describe here the quality of the food, it was so awful. My advice here is simple : avoid booking a room in that hotel. Continue to browse through the tripadvisor website to find a better one. I will never book this hotel once again, but I will also never book a hotel with the same brand in the rest of the world.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPlesant Business Stay\u201d", "Author": "LondonKiwigal", "ReviewID": "UR128056706", "Content": "This hotel is spectacular from the lobby and the service is unbeatable.

The restaurant staff were helpful, but perhaps a little more training might not go amiss. They felt a little inexperienced and some requests would take ages to be dealt with.

While not sorry for this decision, the moment I walked into the Adlon I could feel the weight of history on me and loved it. Those sink into chairs, the old fashioned lights, the woodwork, etc provided an ambience that was really lacking at the De Rome. While one can see its history (including the bullet marks on the stony exterior) somehow the Adlon seemed to devour one with its past.

Check-in was a slightly prolonged affair as we asked to be shown a couple of other room types other than the one we had booked. We settled on Room 101 (which from what I understand is the second best room in the hotel). It has an imposing giant double door as its entry and is in the original part of the hotel. It is interesting to think of the conversations and meetings that were held in this grand room when it was the Dresner Bank. The entry leads into a magnigicent lounge area which is covered in beautiful wood panelling everywhere, including the ceiling. This is contrasted with some funky modern lounge chairs and a dining table. The bedroom is also a generous size with a king bed, again in a modern style. Bathroom was a good size and had a separate washroom, complete with bidet, which could also be accessed from the entry. The highlight had to be that we dicided to host some friends for dinner in the suite. They set up a table for six people respendant with tablecloth and all the trimmings. The food orders were from the in-room dining menu (which was very reasonably priced I have to add) and served by one member of staff. They did a fantastic job and nothing was too much trouble.

Although I always wanted to stay at Hotel Adlon, I did not select it in the end, the style of decor kind of put me off, too german 1930s middle class as I see it. I Was happy I did, as I discovered that it was unification day, and the Pariserplatz aera would have been an absolute mess. On the other hand, Hotel de Rome is situated a 10-minute walk away from Pariser Platz, off Unter den Linden, both extremely quiet and close to everything really, that is except the West part of town. We checked in a little bit early. It was a breeze and our room was nevertheless ready. We had a Junir Suite on the top floor, 512 is memory serves me well, located at the side of the hotel, overlooking Edwigskatedral (windows open, we could hear the roaring organ during mass), and the TV tower a little in the distant. Pretty large accommodation . large foyer with storage, big room with king bed, 2 armchairs, sofa, desk, and chest of drawers. Large bathroom with heated floors, separate shower stall no enclosed toilet. Loved the toiletries, and found the Rocco Forte logo on the slippers and robes stylish, for what it is worth. Excellent lighting everywhere. Reproachless soundproofing. The overall style of the hotel is a killer. Mixture of understated colors with bright accents, beautuful textures, Four Seasons style flowers. All contained in a historic building looking perfectly ay place with its new destination as a hotel. We thought they did a great job at renovating the place. Really top tier, on a par with the best Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton or mandarin Oriental, with a little extra glitz. Great service . knowledgeable concierge did good restaurant recommendations, and reservations ; only wished they had let their hot vibe go loud, but perhaps they are too German, and/or we feel too conservative. Spa is beautiful, for what we tried, namely the changing facilities and the swimmimg pool, set up in the ancient safe room. Worth a visit if only for the tiles ! Excellent breakfast, even when it was back to the normal fare on the monday, following the sunday brunch. Great buffet selection, along with a la carte. Only wished they would arrange the food on buffet in greater dishes. Would avoid the staff constantly checking on the supply, running for more, not avoiding the unavoidable momentary out of stock situation. The USP (top feature) of Hotel de Rome is the rooftop terrace. We were blessed by amazingly mild weather for october (24\u00b0C during day time), and took great advantage of it -when it was not hep for private parties (honesty has it, for a limited amount of time). It is set up with quality furniture and greeneries, high seating on stools or in plush sofas. Nice although limited drink menu, obviously sponsored by Veuve Clicquot champagne, not the worst of class. Nice and friendly attendants here too. Sipping champagne at dusk, with a commanding view over the roofs and monuments, was a highlight each day of our stay. They could possibly improve it, with later hours (think after dinner coffee/drink with a cigar), adding some gas heaters. I know this is Germany and not environmental friendly, but then, Germans are the ones speeding around in Mercs and Audis, not us !

There are many restaurants a few blocks away, and a main shopping street with high-end stores in about a 5-minute walk. The hotel is located away from the main streets, so it is relatively quiet. The hotel staff is very welcoming, from the doormen to the front desk. We arrived early from the United States, so our room wasn\u2019t ready. We were able to change in the restrooms in the lobby and grab a quick bite at the restaurant before we headed out. There is also a bar in the lobby that has a nice atmosphere to it. The bar closes at 1AM, and they like to clean up a few minutes before hand, so don\u2019t get there right at closing. We were on the 4th floor, Room 435, which had a nice balcony. The keycard has an RFI chip in it, so all you have to do to enter the room is pass the card by the doorknob. The entryway is fairly large, and there is a closet off to the left. The restroom is fairly large, with heated floors, heated towel rack, separate shower and bathtub, and a bidet. The bed was very comfy. There was also a TV in the room and a desk. The overall d\u00e9cor was very modern and comfortable. On the 4th Floor, there is a rooftop restaurant and bar, which can get packed on a nice day. It was very nice to eat and drink, while overlooking the relatively short Berlin skyline. There are many different types of seating areas, so guests can pick one that suits their mood. The food at the restaurant is the exact same menu as room service, and the prices are the same. The hotel has complimentary shoe shinning service, a spa, and a gym. The one drawback is that there is not an ironing board in the room. So if you want to get anything ironed, you have to go through housekeeping, which can get pretty expensive.

I would rather like someone to ask \"is there anything we can do for you to make your stay more comfortable\". All in all very disappointing and the fact that they have so many external guests coming in to eat breakfast at the hotel so thtat they have to seat people in the lounge (!!) makes the experience even worse. But once again, the SPA area (sauna and pool) was a joke!

Not so with the Hotel de Rome - it was perfection! From our initial contact with the concierge to our departure everything was just so. We were on holiday with our 11yo son and stayed in a classic suite. The suite was beautiful with a red and grey colour scheme. Plenty of room for the rollaway bed too. There was a tv in the living room and one in the bedroom which worked well for us, especially given the xbox 360 that was thoughtfully supplied for our DS's use! The suite had an enormous bathroom with an adjoining dressing room. I made contact with the concierge before our visit to get restaurant recommendations and arrange for some amenities to be in our room for our arrival. Communication was good, with emals responded to promptly and written in a friendly manner. Breakfast, which is included in the suite deal, was excellent a good range of buffet items with additional menu for eggs and other hot dishes. The location of the hotel is good, being close to Freidrichstrasse for shopping and close to Germandmenmarkt for restaurants and cafes. A two minute walk takes you t the Unter den Linden where the 100 bus takes you to the Zoo (and the K'dam) and to Alexanderplatz in the opposite direction. Museum island is about a five minute walk away. There are two underground stops within a few minutes walk too. We ate at a number of restaurants within walking distance if the hotel and the standard of food available was excellent. Berlin is a super City and the Hotel de Rome is a wonderful base from which to enjoy it!

Big, with a great shower and bath, a powerful hairdryer, plus all those lovely free cosmetics hotels of this calibre come with. The Rome is super modern but manages to still be very comfortable with a luxurious feel, in the way that some of the Schrager hotels fail. One of the best features for me (aside from the great bathroom) is that in the mornings the hotel was wonderfully quiet. Some places, despite being pricey, have an irritating array of vacuming and cleaning noises in the passages outside your room making it difficult to have a well deserved lie-in.

Arrived by taxi and the doorman already knew my name - no doubt he has a list of guests and their ETAs but still pretty impressive. The location is brilliant, 15 mins stroll to the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag and Berlin Tower; around the corner from shops like Galeries Lafayette and 5 mins to a bunch of musuems. No problems with taxis as they wait outside at all hours. Friendly and efficient check-in and escorted to a room with abysmal views of the other side of the U shaped building. This meant little natural light and no view, which was very disappointing but rooms facing the front wont have this issue. The classic room was large, with soaring high ceilings and was obviously touched by fancy interior decorators. The TV gives access to an extensive inbuilt CD library and free internet access to some email sites. The bed was some distance from the TV however so it wouldnt hurt to get a bigger TV. The \"King\" bed was actually two singles pushed together, very comfortable but rather disappointing and not what you would expect. Bathroom was impressive, stunning design with beautiful marble everywhere, heated floors and a vanity mirror that stays constantly illuminated. Water pressure was great but the temperature seemed to be limited to scaldingly hot or ice cold with not much in between. Generic toiletries are disapppointing though.

They can rely on their looks, so they don\u2019t need to be particularly intelligent, funny or interesting. Plain-looking women, on the other hand, usually figure out that they need to have a great personality if they want anyone to pay attention to them. The combination of both beauty and depth is rare and narrowly escapes the Hotel de Rome in Berlin. On questions of design and aesthetics the hotel is difficult to fault. Its designers have seamlessly converted a chunky old bank (and filming location of the movie Run Lola Run) into a sleek modern luxury hotel. A magnificently-lighted pool, spa and ample fitness facilities occupy the former vaults in the basement. Our room\u2019s design and layout were also effortless, modern and stylish. The beauty is apparent at first glance and never fades. Then you get to know her a little better, and the Hotel de Rome begins to disappoint. Underneath the bedspread are two twin mattresses pushed together, not a single king. In the bathroom, the marble, mosaic tiles, large bathtub, heated mirror and ingenious toilet-paper dispenser are delightful touches. But they are overshadowed by the shower\u2019s reluctance to provide more than lukewarm water, even when ample hot water is available from other faucets. The Italian food is colorful and flavorful whether served in the restaurant or promptly in the room. But characteristically, the vermicelli with shrimp lacks meat and substance, with only a single prawn perched on a bed of pasta. With passive-aggressive flair, the room service staff never fails to ask when they should return to retrieve your tray, and then consistently fails to actually return. It\u2019s unfair to cite that single example because the hotel staff was usually extremely courteous, helpful and unobtrusive. But sharing a bathroom proved complicated when the cleaning personnel left a bottle of cleaning fluid next to my mouthwash. Finally, it became frustrating to be asked to pay for every little thing, particularly internet and phone at unreasonable prices (20\u20ac/day and 2.50\u20ac/call to a free 08 prefix, respectively). Even when paying with company money, a twinge of guilt accompanies the use of these basic services. When will luxury hotels realize that these services are, in the 21st century, analogous to indoor toilets in the early 20th century? Just as we don\u2019t worry about fees to use the toilet, we should not have to deal with fees for basic communication services, particularly in luxury hotels that should make life easier.

My room was fairly large with a contemporary design, new furnishings and very clean. The room was very quiet (not surprising being an inner room). There were three issues I had with the room: 1. There is no iron. It costs 6.5 Euros to have a shirt pressed. If you come is late at night with an early morning meeting, this could be a problem. I always think it is a bit of a scam not to provide guests with an iron, in addition to being a pain. 2. There is no alarm clock so you have no idea what time it is during the night (the clock on the TV goes off when turned off) and you have to use wake up service. The front desk attendant seemed very surprised when I suggested it would be nice to include an alarm clock in the room. 3. The hotel was formerly a bank and the bank design, particularly the large halls, gives it a certain grandeur. There is a problem with this however, when you stay in an inner room. There are a couple of atriums which gives the inner rooms light. The rooms are at two ends with large hallways on each side (perpendicular to the rooms). The hallways have windows which allow a line of sight into your room. Thus, you will have to decide whether you want light or privacy. Not a choice you should have to make in a 5 star hotel. I would not stay there again if I had to have an inner room. The spa also has a modern design. The gym is furnished with high end equipment including treadmills, cycles and stair climbers. There are only three types of weight machines (chest press, leg press and shoulder press) which only perform one type of exercise so a full weights workout on machines is not possible. There are dumbbells but no other free weights. The room is very small but it was empty when I was there. The indoor pool area is also very small with one 20m lane to swim. I do not think there is any food/drink service in the pool area. The water was pretty chilly. The steam room is small and okay, the sauna nicer. The gym is provided with robes and slippers.

Here's another ridiculous example of their great service: We asked for rush laundry service since we only had a couple of articles of clothing, and they quickly obliged. When we looked around and saw that the fee would be outrageous (70 Euro) for a few pieces of clothes, we asked them to cancel, and they agreed. Instead of canceling the service, they finished laundering, and took the fee off our bill. There's a reason you pay up a little bit (and by the way, we paid much less than the rate advertised on their website by booking through Expedia--a rate also available on Tablethotels), but in return, you get so much more. Not only would I recommend this hotel to anyone who will listen...I would return to Berlin...endure 20 hours of flying...just to stay here again. The only small very minor points that I can complain about (oh so minor), are that they could have a little bit more thorough gym equipment, and ditch the scratchy linen sheets. But everything else was splendid!!!! (We had drinks at the bar and watched football and chatted w/ the bartender....the list goes on and on)", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExpensive but great!\u201d", "Author": "WaldronofLondon", "ReviewID": "UR16665721", "Content": "An excellent hotel - quietly located in the Mitte district (within what used to be East Berlin), opposite a quiet square and Humboldt Univ. About 10 minutes walk from Brandenburg Gate, about 10 minutes walk from Museum Island, about 15 minutes by taxi to Kunst Forum where the superb and newly built Gemaldegalerie and Neue National Galerie have excellent art collections. About 20 minutes from Tegel airport by taxi at 6pm in the evening (cost E20 which we thought very reasonable) and about 40 minutes from Schonefeld airport (cost us E40 to get there for our return flight). Much larger hotel than the other Rocco Forte hotel we have visited (Savoy in Florence). Also has outside space (4th floor terrace and bar) which was much appreciated as weather was in the high 80s (in May!!) Extremely stylishly decorated, pleasant bar with live music in the evenings, extensive (but expensive) breakfast buffet. We had lunch there too in the Parioli restaurant (Italian) - very good. In room internet is expensive E20 per 24 hours. Wifi downstairs free of charge but did not try this (if you are on business, you will be in your room!). We had deluxe rooms - extremely large and airy. Not sure I would pay the extra as we heard standard rooms are pretty good too, and we did not spend long in the rooms. Bathroom was perfect - up to date, absolutely clean, and separate shower and bath. We paid E400 per night including breakfast so we had high expectations. Did not visit the Spa. Staff a mix of other Europeans and Germans - without exception they were friendly and pleasant. In the vicinity, there is the Michelin starred Vau restaurant (rather expensive but with a pleasant courtyard for warm evening dining) about 5 minutes walk. Other restaurants a short walk away - mixed quality. Concierge gives good advice. Not perhaps the most exciting place for younger people to stay (no local buzz) but extremely comfortable for middle aged folk. Those of us who like swirly carpets and \"traditional\" decor might be better off at the Adlon but we would certainly return if in Berlin again.", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bristol", "Title": "\u201cExcellent RF as good as ever\u201d", "Author": "markq3", "ReviewID": "UR14453873", "Content": "We used to love the Forte hotels and some how Rocco Forte carries on where they were when taken over.

The breakfast is exceptional with a huge array of fruits , fantastic bread, bircher muesli, meats, cheeses, juices, smoked salmon, great coffee and a huge selection of teas. The spa is really great and when we were there it was practically empty. But best of all is the concierge service which is the most helpful I have ever come across. Get them to make restaurant bookings for you and I heartily recommend San Nicci on Friedrichstrasse and Nola's am Weinberg in the park on Veteranerstrasse for the best authentic brunch among the beautiful people of Berlin.

We were upgraded to a superior (De Luxe) room overlooking the square, which was very quiet. Both room and bathroom sizes were huge, very comfortable bed and top class bathroom fittings including double walk-in shower. Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, but did stop a while at the very trendy bar with pianist and singer where the beautiful people seemed to congregate.

I have also stayed at the Rocco Forte Villa Kennedy in Frankfurt, and was very impressed with both.

All service experiences were fast, friendly and perfect. There is currently some construction going on in the street in front, but not an issue (although I don't think my room faced it). The hotel is very close to many of the key museums and momuments. A few notes: high-speed internet in the room is LAN, and not free. Valet parking may be required; I'm not sure but the valet said \"We would like to park your car for you.\" I didn't mind, so I didn't dig into whether I could park it myself if desired. Room service food quality was good, but not great, and the menu fairly limited (I recall the same at the Villa Kennedy).

Great dining nearby at Lutter & Wegner, Boca di Bacco and drinks at Newton bar. Our conceirge staff was excellent- made all our bookings and confirmed all on line. Rooms were spotless, immaculate (new), we had a deluxe room - spacious, modern- great bathroom with all the amenities. Flat screen plasma TV's- limited English speaking stations (CNN, MSNBC, BBCnews), unfortunately no CD player although the TV has an available music playlist (too bad you can't dim/ turn off the monitor). Request room on floor 1 and 2 beautiful high ceilings. Pool, sauna, spa- Ok if fee is included in your rate--small pool, good workout equipment. Difficult top boook treatments due to limited staff--- Restaurant staff was excellent, outgoing- menus are limited. Lunch in restautant is Italian and limited to a more formal experience. Dining with children can be difficult here as the options are limited. Room service menu however was wonderful and service EXCELLENT. I usually avoid room service except at breakfast but did eat in on arrival night due to luggage not arriving. Hopefully they will expand their menu options.in the restaurant. In contrast to other RF hotels I've visited , the staff at the de Rome was a bit more formal--perhaps they are being cautious in their initial days. I am sure as their confidence grows their service will become more natural. What's needed to make it truly exceptional is the human touch.

Also the pillows whilst being of the highest quality were too thick for my liking. The aircon was difficult to work out as there were no temperature markings and it was not possible to open the window only a little. The bathroom was very luxurious but the towels did not smell that fresh. The decor of the hotel is minimalist and beautifully colour coordinated.

Breakfast is charged extra and you can help yourself from the buffet for 19 euros or have cooked stuff as well for 26 euros.
