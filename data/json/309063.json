{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved Lusa The hotel Lusa is great value for money. The rooms are cleaned every day and the newer rooms have a more powerful fan that keeps the room as cool as possible when staying in 34 degrees! The best thing is the lovely swimming pool with sun loungers so you can kick back after a morning surfing. The free breakfasts are not amazing but they do the job to fill you up! The staff are very helpful and friendly and are always happy to help. Overall our stay was very pleasant and we will definitely be coming back next year to stay in Lusa. Just really is the best value for money with an awesome location, close to the beach and the main shopping and food areas :-)", "Date": "Oct 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR437666926", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "UkTravelBunny"}, {"Content": "Roaches Galore The website makes the hotel look very nice, and that's why I booked the hotel - but it is oh so misleading. I stayed in a fan/hot water room. I've stayed in guesthouses throughout Southeast Asia.- The fan barely worked - there were many times it was cooler outside than it was in my room. - The windows also don't have nets, so when I tried to cool down the room at night time by sleeping with the windows open, I got eaten alive by mosquitoes. - The worst part, however, was my encounter with cockroaches. I stayed there for 4 nights and I saw 3 cockroaches during my stay. Twice, the roaches crawled up out of the bathroom drain while I was taking a shower. This is unacceptable.- The hotel never sent a driver to pick me up from the airport as promised. - While the hotel is tucked away in a nice corner, close enough to Poppies and the beach, it's not quite. There's a karaoke bar nearby and the singing is very, very loud.The hotel did have some good parts. - It's very cheap. - The staff is not rude - not friendly, but not rude.- Breakfast is included, and while it's no feast, it's good enough.- The swimming pool is nice.", "Date": "Dec 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR493600764", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GoddessKris"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d309063-r21157371-Hotel_Lusa-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "309063", "Price": "$57"}}
