I was travelling with my teen-aged daughter and we both value comfortable and familiar surroundings in a hotel. Our hotel stays are a large part of our 'experience' of a place and not just a place to sleep. This Hilton Garden Inn provided just what I'd hoped for in Vegas. We wanted a non-smoking, non-casino hotel that was off the main part of the Strip (but not too far) as this was our first trip and we didn't know what to expect in terms of noise, crowds and sensory overwhelm. We did not have a car during our 4 day stay and found that it is indeed possible to get around the Strip happily using the hotel shuttle, the trams from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur, and Monte Carlo to the Bellagio, the occasional taxi and, of course, walking. There are food options within easy walking distance from the hotel. The hotel also offers meals--as HHonors members, our breakfast was included, and one night we had dinner, reasonably priced and very good. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful; dining staff happy and solicitous, and the shuttle drivers were awesome. The shuttle is free and leaves for Mandalay Bay on the hour; pickup from MB is on the quarter hour (call to request); also will take you to Town Square Mall (different from the Outlet Mall just 2-3 blocks away) with the same pickup option. We were upgraded to a junior suite but found the larger air handler in the room disturbing to our sleep (not excessively loud exactly but something about the fan and the pitch was distressing to my ears) so we went to a regular room, facing the front of the property, which we loved. I used a google map to 'view' the area around the hotel before we left, and was a little distressed to see empty stretches across the street--looked like the middle of nowhere. However, once at the hotel, this was my favorite part--the view of sand, surrounding hills, and the big sky was beautiful! and an intriguing change from central NY. I would definitely stay at this hotel again! and highly recommend it for anyone looking for an inexpensive, quality stay off the main Strip in Las Vegas.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cThe Good and the Bad\u201d", "Author": "pleasetakemewithyou2", "ReviewID": "UR123132567", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel as part of a group with three kids.

We understood the notion of bringing out family and friends would be good for the hotel business wise, which in turn would supply a level of comfort, service and amusement for us, but the treatment we received went far beyond our imagination. For instance, upon our arrival at the airport, the shuttle expediently picked us up, and took us to the hotel, and to our surprise we were 3 hours ahead of check in time, the staff accommodated us by sending our bags up to our room anyway. Suggested a wonderful Italian restaurant next door and promised our room would be ready after our meal, and boy was it! The suite was incredible; clean and inviting...from our balcony we could see the strip! The cafe service and food was great! The shuttle takes you to and from the strip. The staff was very accommodating in every way. If there was need of any kind, they went above the call of duty to fulfill it; and not in a jumping through hoops way, yet fond, engaging and in an enjoyable manner. They really give new meaning to \"service with a smile\". As stated this trip was a personal event, our wedding. Jennifer and Ms. Joni (of LV Wedding Connections) truly made our big day a divine and magical experience that we will never forget. Following the ceremony was our reception and it was a blast, due to the wonderful decor and service provided. I would recommend any and everyone to HGI South for their day!

I called the front desk to ask wh (hoping they would bring one up), but instead I was told they don't do that because they can't slip them under their doors. It may sound petty, but I had three issues with that - first, some pizza delivery place had slipped an ad under my door the previous day (I informed the front desk clerk of this), second, she didn't offer to send one up, and third, their check-in brochure specifically states that they will deliver your statement the morning of check-out.

Easy to drive down the Strip to Mandalay or Luxor and park in their garages to walk that end of the Strip. There is a shuttle offered from the hotel for free to Mandalay Bay for those without cars or who want to save gas.

Do not expect overboard amenities---there was shampoo & conditioner and soap, plus a hair dryer. Same rough white towels you find everywhere. There is a sitting area when you first enter the room, with a sofabed, small desk and wet bar. A very large flat screen TV separates the sitting area from the beds (we had a double-double). The TV pulls out and pivots slightly so you can watch it in bed. There is no restaurant or casino on site, but you can buy food in the lobby. They also serve a free continental breakfast. There is a great German beer hall restaurant right next door which was a lot of fun and had very authentic food. Also, the Hard Rock is catty-corner from the hotel. The free shuttle to the airport only runs once per hour, but you are literally two minutes from McCarren. If you are in Vegas to live it up, this may not be the place for you.

What an excellent value! Hotels more than twice the price don't always achieve the level of satisfaction offered by this hotel. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to/from the airport and also to/from Mandalay Bay. Free internet. Walking distance to an outlet mall, and also to a drug store, fast food, etc. The hotel lobby has a living room type area with big comfy sofas in front of a large fireplace - looked so inviting - but unfortunately a big screen TV was blaring from over the fireplace - chasing me away. There is an in-house restaurant serving breakfast and dinner, and a tiny bar with a small TV blaring from the wall. There was an outdoor pool with a bit of nice landscaping, a laundry room, mini snack/beverage sale nook near the front desk and an exercise room. The hotel common areas were pleasant and clean. The room was clean, fresh and airy. The 1 bedroom, 1.5 bath suite was HUGE. The full bath was spacious and equipped with a separate shower, a whirlpool bathtub, hair dryer, Neutrogena toiletries (including shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, lotion, bar soap, q-tips). And best of all - wonderful, soft, stretchy bathrobes!! The half bath off the living room was roomy also. The living room was set up with work desk/chair, sofa, chair/ottoman, flat screen TV, mini-frig, microwave, tiny sink/counter area, coffee pot, complimentary tea/coffee, 2 phone lines, etc. There was iron & ironing board in the closet. The bedroom, again enormous for this price point, was set up with a comfortable king bed, nice linenes, flat screen TV, 2 chairs - one with ottoman, etc. The balcony contained 2 chairs and a side table. The bedroom and living room had separate temperature control, which was quite nice. The hotel was wonderfully peaceful - even though it was fully booked during my stay. The only complaint I would have is very minor - that the bathroom fan is linked to the light switch - so there is no draft free bathing allowed - unless you do it in the dark, of course!

The furnishing were in great shape and the room was clean and tidy. It's located 2 1/2 miles south of Mandalay Bay, so the loacation was just what we were looking for (quiet).

I have to warn you that they are expanding the hotel and are doing a lot of construction work. I at no time encountered problems with the construction or any noise associated with the construction.
