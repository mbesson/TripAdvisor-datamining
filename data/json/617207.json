Having stayed at many Istanbul hotels over the last twelve years, this gets particularly high marks for being quiet (trust me, this is almost unheard of in the Sultanahmet area). Yes, you hear the mosque if you have the window open, but other than that, it was lovely and peaceful, and there seemed to be no noise at all from other guests, so the rooms must be pretty well soundproofed. The staff are extremely accommodating, particularly the breakfast staff, who run what is a very small restaurant in a very efficient manner. There is a very good breakfast buffet and a choice of eggs, whichever way you want them. They also serve freshly squeezed orange juice - a lovely change from the horrid sugary 'squash' that is generally served up elsewhere in Sultanahmet hotels. Reception staff were very welcoming and helpful, right up until checkout, and the room staff were exemplary - most days we got back down from breakfast to find that the housekeeper had already been and gone. My only very small comment is that our room could have done with a little bit of a facelift and some better storage. The carpet was stained (not generally, just one or two bits where a previous guest had obviously spilt something and the housekeeping staff haven't been able to get it out), but the cupboards were awful. There was an OK wardrobe with plenty of hangers, but that was about it. Other than that, we had a dressing table with one small drawer and what looked as though it would have been more at home in an office - a kind of small bedside-type unit with one drawer - a decent set of drawers would have been great - we ended up leaving our stuff in our bags for the whole five days, apart from the bits that needed hanging up. Having said that, it is a very minor issue, though something that could easily be put right. Other plus points were good sized rooms and very nice bathrooms with good showers. We loved the hotel, especially the nice touches like being able to help yourselves to complimentary tea and coffee in the restaurant at any time of day, plus the means to make coffee in your own room. The location was fantastic, right next to the tram stop and with loads of restaurants on your doorstep. The Blue Mosque is literally just across the road. We will definitely stay there again on our next trip.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "la haya", "Title": "\u201cGeweldig vriendelijk en gastvrij\u201d", "Author": "zoefje", "ReviewID": "UR126616172", "Content": "Very nice hotel excellent service ,friendly staff.

The room was lovely, spacious and modern and the staff were a delight, each of them took the time to learn our names and greeted us personally each day. My only slight issue was that the bed was very hard for my liking and I didn't get the best nights sleep because of it but there isn't a mattress to please everyone I guess! Breakfast was plentiful and tasty with lots of cheese, ham, fruit, bread etc and eggs done to order any way you liked. Best of all was the freshly squeezed orange juice...lovely!

However, if you arrive towards the end of the sitting you may find that the more popular items on the menu have run out. The rooms are quite nicely furnished and clean. The major drawback is their size - they are very small and not really big enough to house more than two people. We booked a room for 3 and the room was so cramped that there was not enough space to move around without bumping on beds or bags etc. The lift is tiny - the smallest I have ever seen - and not able to hold three people with their bags.

Also the breakfast, while not being the widest choice I've ever seen in a European hotel, was pleasant enough with a freshly cooked omelette cooked to order and delicious freshly squeezed orange juice. The bathrooms also come with a jacuzzi bath which is a nice touch. However, there are some down sides. The terrace bar (which has a stunning, if slightly obscurred, view of the Blue Mosque) closes at 11pm which, while in keeping with other businesses in the surrounding area, is a little early to close up in my opinion. In any case you're better off heading down to one of the bars or restaurants under the bridge where the beer is much cheaper (6TL for half a litre of Efes) and are open to the small hours. Also the beds are VERY hard. Not impossible to get off to sleep but I had fitful sleep every night. And I wouldn't describe the rooms as air-conditioned as they have extremely inefficient air-conditioning systems. Don't expect an icy cool refuge from the heat of Istanbul here.

The hotel also claims to have a 24-hour terrace restaurant however the terrace was only open from 0700-2300hrs and the only food available was breakfast.

The rooms are adequately spacious, the bathrooms newly remodeled and impeccably clean, and we could hear no noise from the street despite the central location of the building. It was wonderful to walk to the Blue Mosque in five minutes as well as enjoy the view of the city from the roof terrace at breakfast of for a night drink.

Tan Hotel was a hidden gem at Sultanhamed neighborhood - walking distance to the most important tourist spots in town. Do you want to visit Blue Mosque? Well, just cross the street. Sofia ? A few more steps away. Topikapi? Five minutes walk. Have a good meal? You don't even need to cross the street. There are several restaurants nearby and most of them are great. Want to be pampered by a nice Turkish welcome? Stay at the hotel and drink a haki (the local and delicious Turkish drink) at Tan Terrace enjoying the stunning view of the mosque. It's the same view you will get at breakfast - the best way to start your day. Have a talk to the recepction staff and get very nice hints on how to spend your vacations. Congratulations! You made us feel at home. By the way, I was travelling with my wife and my parents. My father is 91 years old and they give him a very special attention in every detail (like booking proper tours for elderly people, reserving lower floor's room, being considerate at his breakfast choices, etc) Longer stays at the hotel include free transfer from the airport.

My only complaint was my bed was a bit hard but each to their own, after a long day of walking I was out like a light anyway so it didn't affect my sleep too much. Also the TV had very limited channels, but again we weren't really there to watch TV! The room had free Wifii which was also brilliant and very handy! The breakfast on the terrace was lovely and had a lot of options. Athough if you stayed for longer than three days then perhaps it could get quite repetetive. Overall the hotel is in a fantastic location, it is literally a two minute walk to the tramline which takes you to all the sights and costs about 0.70p one way. Also a short walk to the kapalicarsi and the Sultan Ahmet Mosque is literally across the road and can be seen from the roof top terrace of the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in the middle of everything and have easy access to all the popular spots. I would stay at this hotel again as the staff are so friendly and helpful, the hotel's manager even helped us with our luggage to the car! Haven't had that kind of hospitality before!

I guess my only two complaints is that our room sometimes smelled like someone was smoking which I probably would contribute to someone down the hall and that the tv has limited channels-both very minor things. We weren't able to connect to the internet since our laptop had some weird safety features but there are 3 computers for everyone to use. Excellent free breakfast 7:30-10:30 am consists of fresh pomie or oj juice, eggs made any style and a load of options-bureks, yogurts, nuts, tea, coffee, bread, etc. The breakfast staff is really great and friendly. Oh and great view of the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sofia from the terrace!!

There is an internet computer in the bar at roof level and one in the lobby bar, I understood that there are connections in the rooms but I overheard one guest saying he had been waiting for two days for another guest to release the cable! The breakfast was very good and included in the price, eggs anyway you want, bread, pastries, yogurt and friut., fresh juice every morning. The hotel offered a free collection from the airport if you stayed more than three nights, ours was a three night stay and they offered the collection at 25 euros (for 4 persons) and a return at 20 euros - we thought very good as our flight was dealyed by 1 hour but the driver was waiting. The view over the roof tops of Istanbul from the breakfast terrace is amazing - the Blue Mosque and HS close enough to touch - almost. The rubbish on the roofs spoils some of the aspects. The roof has part outside tearrace - but we were inside as it was Fbruary and raining. The metro is a good way to get around 1.5 TL (about 60 pence) is good value. The spice soul less intimidating than the Grand Bazzar. Go over bridge on the tram to Karakoy and go down subway trun left coming up on the other side wall a few meter and take small tunnel train to the top of the hill to Tunel - walk back down to the Galata Tower - view form the top fantastic. Great city, great people - beware of the manic bazzar traders, friendly but very much in your face and no matter where you come from they will know it, have a brother, daughter, uncle, grandfather - who has been there, stayed there or has a house there!! You do not need (or want!) a car in the city, lots of restaurants close by. Good European food - not cheap \u00c2\u00a325-\u00c2\u00a330 for evening meal - you can get cheaper.

The driver met us at the airport with a smile an a handshake despite our plane being over an hour late. The Tan is quite new, but small enough that it has the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boutique\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel, so guests get personal attention. The staff, from the chambermaids to the manager, are friendly and helpful, seemed like old friends by the end of our visit. The decor is clean and simple, the beds with their snowy duvets comfortable. There is no charge for the in-room safes, or use of the computers in the lounge and breakfast/bar area. The complementary breakfast in the scenic roof restaurant is generous, with cheeses, cold meats, yogurt, pastries, crudities, cold cereals, juice, coffee, and eggs or omelets cooked quickly to your liking. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is ideal. Since it is off the main street, tucked into a short cobblestone alley lined with small restaurants and shops, it is nice and quiet, but still is within walking distance of Aga Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Ethnic Museum, and even the Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar and Topkapi Palace. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like walking, the tram stop is only a half minute away. Although the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t serve lunch or dinner, there are plenty of restaurants nearby, including sidewalk cafes serving delicious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Turkish pizza\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on fantastic pide flatbread dough. Also within a block or two are a currency exchange, a pharmacy, an ATM and a shop that serves up really great ice cream. In the middle of our visit we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d taken a 3 day tour, based at a really bad hotel in Kasadusi, and returning to the Tan was a huge relief, like coming home! They even gave us a suite when we returned, at no additional cost to the single room rate. I highly recommend this great little hotel to anyone visiting Istanbul.", "Date": "April 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201ca great talent arrived at tan hotel\u201d", "Author": "sakurasakura", "ReviewID": "UR15122101", "Content": "I and my husband used to travel forgin countrys and Istanbul is one of our favorite city.

There is nothing that I can say to fault this hotel... location is excellent, being right on the doorstep of The Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, The Underground Cistern, Grand Bazaar and metres away from the Sultanahmet tram stop on Divan Yolu. The hotel itself? Impeccably cleanrooms, very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable staff, superb breakfast which offers both Turkish and European cuisine. Rooms all have the expected comforts of a boutique hotel... including mini bar, wireless network and safety deposit box. Even though Tan is in the middle of Sultanahmet, being tucked away on a side street off Divan Yolu ensures that anyone's stay is a peaceful one.

I've been to Istanbul many times and it is always a pleasure to get back to this amazing city and to one of my favourites - Tan Hotel. It offers very good value and makes the stay in the city very pleasant and easy. The atmosphere in the hotel is warm and friendly, I felt instantly welcome when I first arrived there. I recommended this hotel to several friends who all shared my opinion. The best things I like about it: - location, in the very heart of Sultanahmet. You are absorbed by magic sights and sounds. All historical highlights (Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazar) are within easy walking distance; also the tram line is only few steps away which makes it very convenient to travel to other parts of town; - breakfasts on the roof terrace with great views over Sultanahmet. It is such a pleasant way to start the day in Istanbul :). The food is delicious, so are the views :) - the staff. Everyone in this hotel was so welcoming and nice. They do arrange pick up from the airport. I usually take a cab but my friends used their service and were satisfied. The reception, Cihan, is always ready to give updated info on what's happening in Istanbul and help with directions and any other questions. The Manager Tahir is a great guy who makes everyone very welcome. I particularly liked that he knew so much about Turkey in general and he gave me some very useful tips for other cities / places I wanted to visit there. I hope to be back to Istanbul soon and I will definitely stay in Tan again.

Before we had this excellent experience honestly we were not sure about our choice. Now we are pretty sure about Tan Hotel. We decided to stay at Tan because of its location but beside this we surprised about the modern and elegant decor with, high quality service and also friendly stuff. A hip boutique Hotel like New York sytle. Our room was a suit room which has seperate relaxing room with TV, confortable couch and mini bar. Also safe was in the closet. Room and bathroom were clean and all the stuff we need as towels, shampoos, soaps, sleepers, toilet papers were replacing with the cleans daily. After exhausting day relaxing in the jacuzzi was fantastic. We were having breakfast at the roof restaurant which serves open buffet breakfast that I can not forget. Especially delicious white Turkish cheese and special omlettes. I want to mention that the room service is avaliable 24 hours. The stuff is really helpfull about everything. Loundry, mails, maps, historical tours...etc. If we decide to go to Istanbul we will definitly stay at Tan Hotel. And we recommend it to all tripadvisor members.

It's a little hard to find the first time, but it's in a great location - easy walking to everything in the old city, Topkapi Palace, the great mosques, Grand Bazaar, etc. We even walked back from the Spice Market and Galata Bridge one night. The tram is just steps away. And there are good restaurants, wonderful bakeries, a great Turkish Delights store, banks and souvenir shops within blocks. And the hosts are really nice people. The room was very quiet, except that we had to keep the window open at night, and were wakened early by the morning call to prayer. That's because the central air conditioner was turned off too soon, and it was pretty warm at night. Also, there were too few hooks in the bathroom. Breakfasts were complete, generous and very enjoyable, made more so by the views from the top floor. We even sat outside on the top-floor patio one afternoon, just to relax.
