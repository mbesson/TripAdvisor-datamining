We checked in and the service was great, if slow, because almost everything is still written down and not computerised. We were given a \"Garden Room\" (room 334), also known as a ground floor room with a 2sq.m. pavement with a table and chair (not exactly Gardenesque). We put our bags down, put money and passports in the safe and went for a walk. It's a 10min walk to Circo Massimo and the Metro, and another 10mins to the Colosseum, so the location is good but the roads and pavements around the hotels are badly cracked and in need of repair, so walking with bags was troublesome. When we came back, our room had ants all over the floor, the shower leaked BADLY and the bath wasn't sealed at all, and worst of all the safe wouldn't open as several of the buttons wouldn't register. We eventually changed rooms, got everything out of the safe and got an in-hotel room next to the dining room (room 331). We were greeted to a damp smell as the room hadn't been aired due to the bathroom having no exterior window. The bed was comfortable but the shower wasn't confined by a curtain/glass and the floor wasn't angled to allow the water to drain, so the water went everywhere and we had to use towels to mop the excess in order to use the toilet and sink safely. The staff at night as they were setting up the dining room for breakfast were very loud. The breakfast sucked! There was no type of juice (only a sickly sweet \"fruit juice\"), only two types of cereal that were very bland, the croissants/pastries were soooooo dry that I had to take a sip of coffee (the quality of which differed day in, day out) with every bite to make my mouth remoisten, the bread was very dry (no choice of type; only white) with only ONE 2 slice toaster available, but there was a good selection of fruit and yogurts. Lastly, the airport transfer service that the hotel ordered for us on the return started to take us to the wrong airport despite my confirmation several times with the receptionist that we were going to Ciampino. The driver confirmed on the booking sheet, signed by the hotel, that the hotel had stated the wrong airport. Lovely. Basically, for about 110\u20ac a night + \"Rome Tourist Tax\", I expected a lot more. Would I stay there again? No. The hotels nearer the city centre were slightly more expensive but after speaking to other travellers that we met about their better experiences, we would consider spending more for more comfort and better value if we visited Rome again.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, California", "Title": "\u201cUnbeatable location\u201d", "Author": "Bob W", "ReviewID": "UR127274142", "Content": "This is the second time I've stayed on the Aventine Hill, and I will never stay anywhere else.

This hotel is one of three (the Aventino, the San Anselmo, and the San Pio) in a quiet residential area on a hill that overlooks the Circus Maximus. I was working at the FAO building, and it is a easy to do 20 minute walk from the Aventino to FAO through quiet residential streets and then past shops and restaurants. Most of downtown Rome is within range of a walking tour with the Circus, the Forum, and the Coliseum within easy reach - and sites such as the Spanish Steps and the Pantheon and shopping on the Via del Corso certainly do-able if you want to stretch your legs. No health club, and only the Pio has an attached restaurant - but elegant surroundings, spotless rooms, good beds, and plenty of hot water in the showers. And the shining star is the staff, who within a day will remember what kind of coffee you want at the complimentary cold breakfast offered in each of the hotels and who will know you by name not long after that. The concierge will gladly recommend a restaurant, talk about things to see, or negotiate a better price for your taxi to the airport. The rooms are small , taken up with the(very comfortable) king sized bed and a small desk - but there is cable tv and wireless offered without extra charge in the rooms and a modern bathroom. You need to go out to eat or to see Rome - but you are a 10 minute walk from shops and restaurants. This is a great way to see Rome, and it is really nice to come back to someplace as welcoming as this. Good for singles or couples - it could be a very romantic get-away, but not really set up for a family with children", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonds, Washington", "Title": "\u201cThe Beautiful Aventino\u201d", "Author": "baggagecarrier", "ReviewID": "UR119755630", "Content": "The Hotel Aventino is one of the three under the same ownership set in the midst of the beautiful Aventino Hill.

The hotel is in a really lovely setting, very quite neighborhood, very green and calm. The rooms are nice, not overly large or luxurious but are more than adequate with a desk, wardrobe, table, and in my case a small balcony with table and chairs. There is no restaurant, but there are a few choices nearby, and the sister hotel is a short walk away with a nice restaurant if you want to stay in for dinner. Trastevere is a short nice walk away, with the opportunity to stop and see Santa Sabina church and the spectacular views over Rome - if you go at sunset it is really beautiful and you get to see the swarms of starlings in the fall - really a sight not to be missed. Likewise, heading the other way you are a short walk from Circus Maximus, Palantine Hill etc etc., the metro is here as well. Staff were to a person lovely. I needed to stay in for dinner one night and do some work and so brought take away in from the grocery store. The gentleman at the desk took me to the kitchen used for breakfast and heated up my meal, got me set up with plate, utensils etc and brought me a wine glass to the room, all with good humor and helpfulness. Others staffing the desk were equally helpful as was the woman managing the breakfast room each morning. Free wireless in the rooms and lobby. Not a very strong signal. Also a free computer terminal in the lobby if you don't have a laptop with you. Breakfast included, very typical to what you will find in European hotels, good coffee, yogurt, fresh fruit choices, cereal, bread, pastry, cheeses, meats, juices. All you could want...... It is a bit off the beaten path and is an uphill walk home (not too bad though) or a quick taxi ride. If you want a peaceful setting combined with ease of access to the city this is a good choice.

However, it is too far away to walk to or from any of the main touristic attractions of Rome. We timed it and it takes 16' on foot to get from the Circo Massimo metro station. There are some bus lines that stop a few blocks away from the hotel but they aren't very frequent and you have to wait 10' to 15' at the bus stop. To get to Trastevere you need at least 30' on foot. The rooms look luxurious on photos but at closer inspection you realise that most of the furniture is rather cheap. The hook for the shower in the bathroom was loose and the taps in the sink and the bathtab got stuck all the time. Minor details that are unacceptable for the rates this hotel is charging you. Not to mention that the curtains hadn't been washed for a long time. The buffet breakfast is only decent: you can have croissants, boiled eggs, marmelades, cereal, milk, juice, cake and of course coffee. Although there is someone at the lobby/reception desk, not all of them speak English fluently. In conclusion it's a rather expensive hotel, that it should offer more for the price you pay, too far away from where the action takes place in Rome.

Because we were staying a comparatively long time we were very careful in our choice of rooms because we wanted a large wardrobe. We also noted in other reviews that some of the rooms were on the small size. We were advised in our email conversations prior to booking to go for room 338 and that certainly met our needs. It also had a small balcony which we greatly appreciated. We will certainly go back to the Aventino Hotel when we next return to Rome. We had actually booked to stay in the Tower Room for one final day before flying home, following a week out of Rome, but this was in Rome's low season in mid August, and we were offered an upgrade to a lovely room with a terrace at the Hotel San Pio. That too was a lovely experience. We are still keen to spend at least one night in the Tower Room. Certainly the views from the communal terrace at the San Pio were wonderful - looking out over southern Rome and into the Alban Hills. And so if the views from the Tower Room are similar, that would certainly be worth paying the extra for.

(The pictures on the internet do not do it justice - imo). The hotel Aventino is set in a residential area about 10 minutes bus ride from the Colosseum and about 15-20 minutes from the city centre. It is not located right in the city centre but is in a good location on the outskirts, which allow you to escape the hussle and bussle of the city while still letting you enjoy the romanesque feel of the citys surroundings. We booked two rooms one for double use, and one for single. We at the time of booking requested that they be near each other and that they be up on one of the higher floors, both requests were satisfied without problem on our arrival. It was perfect for what we wanted as it was quiet during both day and night - and we were able to open the windows (in fact one of the rooms came with a small balcony with double doors leading out to it, which was great due to the summer heat) there was also an air conditioning system in both rooms but found ourselves not needing them! Each room came with lovely big beds, tv and good sized bathroom! The breakfast each morning was continental, it was nice and fresh served by the friendly staff! There are transport links near the hotel such as the bus (no.75), which goes to and from the termini and there is also a metro located at the bottom of the hill around the main street area (about a 5-7minute walk away from the hotel) which link to the main attractions and other city centre places. We found that the bus was the best way to get around as it helped take in the sights while on route. If you are planing to use taxis as a method of transport for any reason, I would encourage anyone who stays here to keep the hotels name and address on a piece of paper and to take it with you while out, as the hotel is quite a well kept secret even amongst local cab drivers who didn't even know it existed - and kept getting it mixed up with the sister hotels \"san pio\" and \"anselmo\" (which are only around the corner btw)! Our stay in this hotel was very enjoyable due to its beautiful setting, quietness, cleanliness and helpful staff.

In ten minutes you can reach Circus Maximus and in fifteen the Colosseum on foot. There are a number of decent restaurants, mainly informal places and also a supermarket just down the hill from the property. The reception help is a bit surly but professional and helpful.

It really is a lovely little hotel located in what seems to be a nice Roman neighborhood.

Rome is such a busy/crowded city that you really appreciate staying in a place like this to get re-invigorated for the next day.

The TV was tiny, but we didn't travel all of the way to Rome to watch TV. It was unseasonably hot (in the 90s) in Rome during our stay, so the air conditioner came on every time we returned to our room. (The electricity to your room is turned off unless your card key is in the entry socket, so the room was always warm upon return but cooled within an hour.) Air conditioning would not have been on option in the heat & humidity during our stay, and we had heard horror stories on TripAdvisor about other properties who skimp on a/c.

My wife's lost luggage arrived (finally ... after 9 days of the airline's incompetence!) and the concierge made sure that it got to us as soon as we got to our room.

You will do significantly more walking around the Roman sights than you would if you stayed in Piazza Navona, Campo di Fiore, or the Spanish Steps.

If you want a hotel right in the middle of the action, this probably isn't the best choice; it's very peaceful and a short stroll from several ancient churches off the beaten path, but the trade-off is that it's not directly on a bus or Metro line (though there are several bus routes and the Circus Maximus Metro only a 10-15 minute walk away). Still, considering how chaotic Rome is, a quiet refuge at the end of a long day of sightseeing is worth a lot! The Aventino Hotel is the bottom-rated property (but still 3 stars) of 4 or 5 properties on the Aventine Hill, all run by the same owner. We were there during the off season, so our room cost half what it would during the summer and was a pretty good deal all around. The other guests we saw were mostly German-speaking, with a few Italians and Spanish as well. We had a vastly overpriced dinner at a nearby 4-star hotel run by the same owner and we noticed that all the other guests at that hotel were English-speaking (mostly Americans). We loved the little breakfast room at the Aventino and enjoyed the delicious spread each morning, but they do not have American-style offerings. The hotel is very clean and run by an excellent staff. My wife got the flu while we were in Rome, and the staff went out of their way to help us regardless of the time of day or night; the night porter even stood outside in the cold with me at 2:00 AM to tell a taxi driver where to take me to find an all-night pharmacy. Not all of the staff spoke English, but we managed to communicate nonetheless and found most of them to be very nice. Ours was a standard double room, simply furnished and quite small but with a nice bathroom. The bed took up most of the space in the main room. Because it was winter and rained a lot while we were there, the room was often quite damp, and this was not good for my wife's flu but couldn't be avoided; the room didn't seem to be very well-insulated, but it did have heat and air available on a wall thermostat. We splurged on this trip because it was our honeymoon, and if we were to go back to Rome we would probably stay somewhere cheaper. I wouldn't be able to bring myself to pay their summer rates, particularly since it's not located directly in the heart of the action, but overall we enjoyed our stay and can recommend the Aventino very warmly.

It's location on the Aventine is mostly residential and while there are no nearby restaurants or shops without a lengthy walk I felt it was a good trade-off. You can find a wide selection of shops and restaurants to the southwest - down the hill to Via Marmorata. There is a restaurant next door at the Hotel Villa S. Pio, but it is pricey and the food was so-so. Its ambience however was spectacular. There was a lush entrance garden, solarium-enclosed dining room and wine cellar-styled bar. The Aventino's amenities were above average and the service was efficient. Breakfast included a decent spread of pastries, fruit, juices and cold cuts. My room had a wrap around balcony with a superb view and two sets of ceiling to floor shuttered doors. (There is only one balcony room on each floor so make your request early!) Sleeping was a dream with no noise and the CH/A worked very well. See my pics for a better description of the room. There are a few sights right around the corner from the hotel worth mentioning. I found one of the best panoramic views of Rome from the citrus grove churchyard of Santa Sabina. Also in the neighborhood are the pyramid of Caius Cestius and a very pretty, yet very useful pedestrian-only road leading to the Tiber. It's a great shortcut down the hill. Find it past Santa Sabina to the North off of Via S. Sabina. The most exciting walk for me was a relatively short walk to the Northeast down the hill. Right before your eyes is the Circus Maximus, Palatine and a little bit further the Forum and Colosseum. I had a wonderful stay here. It was nice to come back to a quiet area and get some peace after a long day of walking, dodging traffic and being around other tourists. If you want the hub-bub this is not this place for you, but if you're looking for a tranquil, graceful escape to pretend you're not a tourist then this is sanctuary.", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cA Gem!\u201d", "Author": "ladyrenoir", "ReviewID": "UR6452707", "Content": "We thought this was was a wonderful place to stay!

The hotel is a 10-15 minute walk to Trastevere, which we loved and spent lots of time in. The location of the hotel was fine for us, we walked just about everywhere, enjoying the sights and daily \"life\" of the locals along the way. There are taxis everywhere if you want one, costing 6-10 euro to get just about anywhere. There are also buses one can catch just down the hill (10 minute walk). We loved being out of the hustle and bustle of Rome in this beautiful, quaint little neighborhood. The breakfast was more than adequate - pastries, breads, rolls, meats, cheeses, fruit, juices, cereals, tea and great capuccino. The restaurant at the San Anselmo (sister hotel) was the best dinner we had in Rome, we recommend it! You will be greeted with complimentary champagne and bruschetta, followed by an amazing meal in a small, intimate atmoshpere. The restaurant is just around the corner.

The breakfast was very pleasant, particularly by Italian standards as breakfasts are not usually that important in Italy. Having said that, the orange juice was an unusually artificial concoction - bright orange or bright red. And the lacy paper doily under the breakfast plate was a bit of a misstep in such stylish surroundings, but perhaps I was missing the irony! The hotel is a little bit out of the way - surely one of its main attractions - but the Via Marmorata (5 minutes walk down the hill) has plenty of buses, the routes 176, 23 and 75 stop here. The routes 175 and 715 take you part of the way up the Aventine hill. Piramide is the closest Metro stop. The streets behind the Via Marmorata have some very nice restaurants if you don't feel like going back into town.

Quiet and peaceful, yet close to the sights. We couldn't have asked for a better location (although because it is in a residential neighborhood it was difficult to find a restaurant on our first night in Rome when we did not wish to travel far for dinner). Just something to be aware of if you do not wish to head out into the chaos of the main city right away. Breakfast was great, and the staff were friendly and met all needs. The room was nice, very elegantly decorated. The disappointment was that the room was located not in the main building but in a little area next to the main street. There are only two rooms in this area. Our door opened right outside, like a motel rather than a hotel. The windows were barred and shuttered and we could only open a little window on our door to let in some sunlight. It felt too closed in and not a place where we could relax after long days of touring. I wasn't expecting a grand view, but it would have been nice to have something. Also being that this was Rome, I at first felt uncomfortable that we were not in a safe location for our items since we were not in the main building. The fear was calmed once I realized what a safe quiet neighborhood we were in. To be fair, I did not complain to the front desk about this or ask to be moved as I did not want to create a fuss. I'm sure that they would've moved us if there was room elsewhere if I had brought it up. I will definitely stay at this hotel again. It is a lovely hotel in a lovely area. However, I will specifically ask to stay in the main building and would recommend that others do the same. I was not aware that there were any rooms not in the main building until we were shown to ours.

It's the smallest of the Aventino S. Anselmo Hotels, which are right around the corner. Our room was the \"attic room\" and you actually had to ride the elevator or walk to the third floor and then go outside to a private courtyard and up a little flight of stairs to the room. We really enjoyed the quiet and privacy of this suite. The only thing that was a bit of a nuisance was that the key card had to be inserted to turn on any lights in the room. (This didn't allow you to leave any lights on for the evening.) The room was beautiful, and very clean, with white crisp sheets changed every day on the king-sized bed. The up-to-date bathroom had a large, vertical spa shower with adjustable jets. A typical Italian buffet breakfast with meats, cheese, luscious fresh fruit and warm cornetto was included in the room rate and you can enjoy it on the terrace. The one desk clerk can be a bit un-friendly, but if you do ask questions, he will answer them in a helpful manner. There is a nice restaurant in one of their larger hotels around the corner, Villa S. Pio, and he can make the reservation for you. We specifically chose this hotel to be away from the city and there are a few sites to see in the area,(the keyhole with a view to St. Peter's at the Piazza dei Cavalieri di Malta was a favorite and the Colosseum are close by) but you should be prepared to either walk or take a taxi to get into town.
