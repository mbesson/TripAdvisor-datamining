{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent choice Concur with the previous poster, an excellent small hotel close to the airport.I had a two nght stopover in Bali enroute to Malaysia and booked after reading the last review. The hotel is very good value for money and delivers on their advertised services - a rarity!The rooms were a good size and overlooked the pool, aircon was great, good hot  cold water pressure in shower, very good range of tv channels and the meals are spot on. Offers all business class hotel amenities - same day laundry, in room safe, free wifi access, minibar, complimentary tea/coffee making facilities in room, in-house spa massage.Don't stay here if you want proximity to the beaches, but for a few nights it is spot on.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR884078368", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "craig2007"}, {"Content": "Good enough to return to Aston       Pool, swim-up bar and Hula cafe", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR352907861", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "finsyar"}, {"Content": "Nice and Clean Hotel Small hotel but stylish. The room is very clean, but the aircon took a long hours to make your room cool. So on the next day, I inserted other card in the electricity panel, so the aircon stil on while we left the room. The staff are friendly, helpful and full of smile. I tried the balinese message in their spa, uhm...nice but not excellent. If you only looking for a clean place to take a rest, this is the right place. But don't expect a good view, cause they has no garden. Only small and clean swiming pool at center point.The location is far from the beach and shoping area. I only can find nice supermarket Pepito in walking distance.", "Date": "Oct 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR475106861", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "BungaJakarta"}, {"Content": "Aston Inn Tuban       Bathroom", "Date": "May 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR965839444", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Vicki_tan"}, {"Content": "clean, simplicity, stylish, but a little noisy It's very new in Kuta area.
