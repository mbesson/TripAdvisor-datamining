{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent Value The hotel is located centrally in the Ginza area. It is around 10-15mins walk from the JR Shimbashi Station or else it can be reached easily by the metro line. The room is the standard compact size, we booked the semi-double room and is enough to fit me (size small) and my husband (size medium) comfortably. The hotel provides free coffee and internet access, which makes the value we paid a bargain !!", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR592259307", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bunnyegg"}, {"Content": "Good choice for Ginza This hotel exceeded expectations. I think it is better located for strolling around Ginza than the other mid-range hotels in the area. It is a step up from a business-type hotel - rooms are compact (not much floor space or room for baggage!) but comfortable and well fitted out. The people were helpful and efficient. Breakfast was very good.", "Date": "Apr 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR366790388", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Dann58"}, {"Content": "Excellent Location One couldn't ask for a better located hotel than Ginza Washington Tokyo. Steps away from the immaculate streets of Ginza, you are near a myriad of restaurants, cafes, bars  shops. All the big names are there of course, but aside from this, there are also tonnes of smaller shops which offer a diverse mix of goods. It is also a few minutes walk away from the Ginza Tokyo Metro station which makes it accesible to all the main areas such as Shinjuku, Roppongi, etc. Also, for those going for the 5am jaunt to Tsukiji fish market, a taxi ride will only set you back by approx USD$8. The hotel itself is practically brand new. The rooms are in excellent condition! Fans of minimalist style would approve as the colors are pared down and earthy and the furniture has simple design but ultimately elegant  tasteful. The room uses custom-made roman blinds instead of curtains which adds a nice modern touch overall. In addition, service is excellent - free internet connection is available dowstairs at the lounge. So is coffee! I couldn't praise this hotel enough!", "Date": "Oct 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR990822623", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "chocfudge"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel for the money Three friends and I stayed at the Ginza Washington Hotel Sept 07. We had booked four single rooms and were expecting tiny rooms and tiny beds. But although the rooms were small, the beds were nearly double size. The hotel is actually easy to find - two blocks souht of the Ginza metro station (Exit A3), and behind the Lion Beer Hall.The hotel is fairly new and the staff all seemed to speak reasonable English. THe rroms were in great condition and had a small fridge, LCD TV and a hairdryer.It is very convenient to all the shops and restaurants around Ginza - we even found an Italian bar close by that served one of our really fussy eating friends (doesn't eat Japanese food) a pizza at 11pm.Overall the Ginza is great value for the location - it would be difficult to get a modern room for less.", "Date": "Sep 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR786021512", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "camsoph"}, {"Content": "Good comfortable hotel       Same room, different view", "Date": "May 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR853490240", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Jade97"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u5d83\u5022\u9287\u52e9\u4ef9\u9287\u693c\u4ee7   showReview(20499942, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR529430419", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AXNX"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d628577-r23340701-Ginza_Washington_Hotel-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "628577", "Price": "$180"}}
