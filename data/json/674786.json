{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Student share house I have read a few of the other reviews and they are fairly accurate. Bottom line this place is a shared flat with locked bedroom doors. Don't forget to put your name on everything you leave in the fridge. If your sharing with Keira Knightley or some swedish backpackers the place would be excellent. On the other hand you could have Jeffrey Dahmer in the next room. Almost forgot, the place comes with the classic share house furniture piece - a black vinyl couch in the residents lounge.

I've never stayed at a Hostel before, but i can think that this is comparable. My mother has worked in the Hotel Industry for over 15 years, and these people are not helpful at all. The pictures online do NOT match the quality and the image of the actual product--the rooms were housed in a 'private residence' tower, and you would share the apt unit with six other rooms--basically, the apt was divided into six to eight rooms, without any common space, and if it wasn't b/c we had a Ensuite, we would be sharing the Kitchen and W/C with the rest of the other units. There were fleas on leather couch, baby moths in the sink and bathtub area, and the Grounds Manager pushed away all responsibilities for any type of 'concierge' services. The WiFi was also so spotty, that someone had to come fix it the second night we got there.

The place itself is not that terrible. The service is.We called the reservation line to indicate that we wanted a room at a certain location and was subsequently billed. Although prices were NETT on the website, we had to pay an extra 7% on what the customer officer claimed to be for use of the facilities (?!?!). We didn't argue and paid accordingly since the place was close to our wedding venue.Only after I gave feedback on the whole incident that we were told that we could pay by GIRO. This would make sure that prices were NETT. Now who could have known since no one had offered this to us. It was not even on the website! The 7% apparently were for credit card charges. Again, this was not communicated to us.The next day I was given a payment request. One service consultant confirmed that our payment did go through, but another from the billing side said it did not. Our credit card showed that the amount was deducted, causing us anxiety and confusion especially when they did not get back to us quickly. It took us a while to sort it out with them.Then they gave us a wrong billing receipt for a location which we did not want. We finally got it changed after much tussle.On the day itself, no one was there to help us check-in even though we had indicated that we wanted to check in at noon. We waited for an hour before we got assistance. Like some others who booked with them, the lines were engaged or cut off unexpectedly, leaving us stranded with our luggage. On our wedding day.When we got to the room, it was not what we wanted as we had booked a deluxe ensuite. We were given a budget room and the main light was not working. All this happened even though we had clarified with the grounds manager on what we had wanted at least a week ago. Worse of all, all this was clearly indicated in our booking receipt for a deluxe ensuite at a certain location. And they were adamant that we had actually booked ANOTHER site instead. Imagine our frustration.It was only at night that we managed to sort things out. Only Marie, one of their staff, sympathised with us and helped us. Otherwise our wedding day would have been ruined. She let on that the staff turnover was very high. I reckoned that is why they were inadequately handling our affairs.When I gave them feedback subsequently, I was accused of twisting the story. This coming from someone leading the Front Desk  Reservations Management Team. I was flabbergasted since it seemed like I was the victim of the bad communication between staff.Moral of story, I will not ever consider booking this place even if prices are reasonable for the location. You will always wonder if you will be given what you have booked, or if you will get a shocker that will spoil your holiday, thanks to the communication between staff on ground and in headquarters.", "Date": "Jun 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR245581864", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "popicool"}, {"Content": "Affordable and a 5 minute walk to Orchard MRT! Maybe Asians are not to open to this new concept of serviced residences but I love it! I was actually lookin for a place at Far East Apartments and another one called Fraser something..but they were so pricey it was just way out of my moderate budget. Then I visited the Singapore Tourism Board as it was just around the corner and asked the staff on duty where can I find affordable accomodations in Orchard Road not above $200 SGD. She thought for awhile and then said  You can try The Hotel Alternatives, they are quite cheap.We have a number of tourists who have stayed with them. She gave me a number and I called, it was either engaged or the mailbox was full. I didnt give up cos they are good so that's why everyone's callin them! I hope...Finally Anne, the reservations staff answered and I got to reserve my Luxury Ensuite at the Horizon Towers.I did a phone booking and the normal credit card process and 15minutes later checked into the Horizon Towers assisted by a very warm lady called Marie. She was my  Grounds Manager  whatever that means. My ensuite on the 18th floor was lovely! They even had a DVD Player and free movies! I didnt bring my laptop but they had wireless internet. I could surf a little on my iphone but got bored and took a stroll down Orchard Road. Very interesting location, to the left would be Ngee Ann City and to the right would be Great World City. I stayed 7 Nights and explored both sides.I paid only $180 SGD per night and I loved it cos it was very near the subway, very near shopping malls, was in an upper class neighbourhood and I lugged at least 5 huge shopping bags of stuff I bought from the sales I found on Orchard Road.I'm not too sure if the LVs and the DGs I bought are genuine or not but I guess there is a higher chance of them being genuine than if I bought them in Hong Kong. I like Singapore and they are'nt as uptight as I thought they would be. I'll be back for the F1 and I hope The Hotel Alternatives will still be affordable then.With Best Regards To Travelers Of Singapore!Amanda Kepley, NYC", "Date": "Jun 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR372403539", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "iheartnewyorkcity"}, {"Content": "This Is Too Important Not To Be Told       For SG$ 200 ???", "Date": "Jan 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR634896209", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "nizora"}, {"Content": "Love The Location        Boutique Ensuite In Tomlinson", "Date": "Dec 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR929781646", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "supermodelscloset"}, {"Content": "Comfortable, Secure, Affordable  Comfortable and secure property close to all the major Orchard Road Malls, 5 star hotels and other wonderful shopping and eateries.

Several weeks ahead of time, I booked into an ensuite room for 5 nights from 30th September. 2 days before arrival they emailed me that the room was no longer available, but offered an alternative. With little time available I tried to call them. 78 times I tried to call them. Not once did they pick up the phone in spite of advertising 24 hour service. I emailed them several times but only received automated replies. No human contact was available.Then I received a demand for final payment, although I had paid a deposit several weeks earlier. I had no choice but to pay.On the day of arrival I received confirmation that the reservation was complete via an SMS message. (again no human contact, inspite of asking them to call me and even offering to pay their costs in doing so.)On arrival (at the new address) there was no-one to meet me, but eventually a 'Grounds Manager' arrived to inform me the new address had been double booked and I could not stay there. It also emerged that what I had booked constituted flatshare rather than the serviced apartment which their website would lead you to believe. The manager offered me a cash refund or to show me another apartment. I opted for the latter, but frankly I have not seen anything so bad since I was a student 35 years ago. This facility was available at a lower rate (unspecified) but was clearly unsuitable for anybody travelling on business as I am.I then opted for the cash refund which was immediately forthcoming. I had no 'hotel alternative ' at 9 o'clock at night after a long journey but to check into an expensive hotel.What have I learned? Hotel Alternatives has an appalling booking system which avoids human contact whenever there is a problem. The customer is the last person they think about. By implication, if they run away from problems as they clearly do, their management must be appalling.They are unreliable.They do not have rooms available which they advertise.Their website advertises special discounts, but the rooms are not worth what they claim.I am astonished that an upmarket designer operation like LVMH would allow itself to be associated with this company.Overall, they have cost me money in the form of being forced to stay in an expensive hotel at short notice and the cost of all those phone calls. Not to mention the aggravation.I believe their behaviour is indefensible, but would love to hear what they have to say.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR773644289", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "SurreyStroller"}, {"Content": "Singapore Hotel Alternatives, Very Affordable  My parents and in laws come visit every year and this year the hotel rates were crazier than our rentals! I was very unwilling to spend SGD$350 a night each room, SGD$700 for 2! My family would stay at least 2 weeks! Do the math! Surfed the net for serviced apartments and they were even more ludicrous at SGD$700 to SGD$800 a day!Almost giving up I typed hotel alternatives singapore LOL and behold! My prayers were answered at 2am on a saturday morning! Eagerly clicked on the link and was very pleased with what I saw, prices ranged from SGD$100 to SGD$200 maximum.The company manages private apartments professionally, mainly providing affordable short term accomodation to businessmen, professionals on assignments, company interns and expatriates in the midst of relocation. I called and spoke to the customer hotline and wanted to come down for a viewing but she turned me down saying the company only allows paying customers enter any of the apartments and this is done to protect the privacy of their present guests. I felt a litte annoyed but liked the fact that they were disciplined.So I went online and booked myself a Budget Boutique Suite for the next day.I received an email with the address and contact numbers. The external of the apartment building was old and not very attractive but it was still in District 9 and like they said, it was opposite the Four Seasons Hotel.Staff were very friendly and polite.Stepping into the apartment, I liked it on sight. Apartment was designed with alot of emphasis on privacy, a warmly lighted walkway led straight to the boutique rooms. The only common areas were the kitchen and laundry room.I was shown the Budget which I purchased and requested an upgrade as it didnt look too comfy. Their Boutique Ensuite is a very nice large room with everything and more than a hotel room. I requested for 2 in the same apartment but they only have 1 boutique ensuite in most apartments, the rest were Standards or Budgets.I had a wonderful time with my family and I saved a total of SGD$4200 I have already booked for this coming Christmas as my sister and her family are coming to visit.
