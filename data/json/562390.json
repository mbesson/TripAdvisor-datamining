It was a lovely, nicely presented boutique hotel with uniquely styled rooms for extremey reasonable prices and situated on the edge of China Town making it accessible to walk to most places. However the best part of this hotel was the staff. They were extremely nice, helpful and did everything to make your trip the best possible experience. We arrived extremely early (6am) and were not meant to be able to check in till 2pm, however because the room was free they let us check in early at no extra cost. The Mini bar in the room was free with the exception of alcohol and a few snacks (this is what I mean about little things that just add that extra touch) On our last day our flight wasn't til 11pm at night but we woud have to check out at 12pm. This wasn't going to be a problem as we were going to sight see all day and collect our bags on the way to the airport. Unfortunately I was extremely ill through the night and the next day. We had checked out because we were meant to but I did not feel well enough to leave the hotel. Sitting in reception with 11 hours to kill and not feeling great the staff were concerned that they came over to offer a room for me free of charge so that I could feel more comfortable and rest - when it was time to leave for the airport we tried to pay and they would not allow it as I had been ill. They went above and beyond to make our trip great and it was truely a lovely experience to stay there - we definately wouldn't stay anywhere else if and when we return to singapore.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cQuirky and fun\u201d", "Author": "Annika L", "ReviewID": "UR127961855", "Content": "The staff here were amazing (although I only met 2 reception girls) The rooms are very quirky although on the small side.

My wife did struggle getting in and out of the shower though which even if you have long legs is a bit of a challenge. The only negative we encountered is outside the hotel's control however is a downside to it's location. Sound insulation is minimum both from outside and inside the hotel. On Friday and Saturday night we were kept awake until after midnight due to the noise coming from the bars around the hotel. On Sunday night we slept lightly due to noise from within the hotel - chairs moving in the room next door / above, toilets flushing etc. As one of the main criteria of a hotel room is sleep quality we did not experience that. If noise was not an issue we would easily rate the hotel a 5. However after 3 nights broken sleep we can only rate the hotel a 3. If you are not a light sleeper we definitely recommend the hotel.

Unfortunately, our stay was marred by a number of factors: 1) I deliberatley booked the Premier Garden room but we were given an Aqua room instead because apparently the garden rooms were all booked out. While this was described as an \"upgrade\", it simply wasn't what I wanted. Given that the hotel sells itself on the unique character of each room, I would assume customer room choice would be of utmost importance when confirming bookings. 2) Nearby construction hammered away all day long at the back of the hotel - I know this isn't something that the hotel can manage, but be sure to check to see if it's been completed before you book. 3) The nearby pub was EXTREMELY noisy until the early hours of the morning. The Aqua room fronts the street so we heard every lover's tiff and drunken argument, and the street lights blazed into our room despite the shades.

Location is much better than Wangz Hotel because it's less than 5 min walk from Outram Park MRT station. First impression was good, as our room was ready even it was at 10:XX which was quite early in the morning. Due to certain connection, I was glad to be upgraded to \"the most expensive room in the hotel\" as the front desk claimed. She then showed up to the room and introduced a bit. The suite on L4 was quite impressive in terms of design, with lots of \"Double Happiness\" words in Chinese all over the room. It seems like it was for a couple I believed? There were two bathtubs in the open bathroom (though with a bit funny face on the wall). Bed was lifted up so we had to climb up the ladder for the bed which was quite a new experience for us. After spending a day out, we returned to the hotel in the evening. We asked for newspaper at the front desk, who informed me that it was already placed in the room. However, when we got to the room, there was none. I called and asked if they had a spare copy. Unfortunately, they told me there was only one copy left in the lobby and asked me to go down and read it. Consider it was already 21:XX at night, I did not see anyone (or one or two like me) would ask for the newspaper. I wondered why they did not send me the last copy instead of leaving the newspaper idle for the rest of the night. It's the matter of flexibility of service. If they did send me a copy and there was another guest asking for it, would they try to look for one somewhere else? So I was a bit upset about \"NO\" in the first place. Later when my partner wanted to have a shower, she found out there was no hot water. Just before I was going to ask, I found the switch for hot water. What? I have never stayed in a hotel which I have to turn on the heater before shower. It made me feel like staying in a hostel, given that I was paying for around SGD300++ for a room. With the heater on, we would like to try the double bathtubs, however, no hot water was available after 15 min. At the end, we gave up this idea. After shower, we would like to watch DVD since I saw there was DVD player in room. Unfortunately they did not have any for rental when I called, so I needed to use my mobile to watch the TV drama for the night. The next morning, we tried the infamous Majestic restaurant for breakfast. Maybe it was complimentary, the selection was a bit small. Later, we went to try the pool, though not big, we were quite pleased to swim there. Overall, it was quite good to try this hotel since it's something special compared with other traditional hotels.

For me personally, the negatives far outweight the positives and I would never stay here again. First of all - a major problem not only with the noise but the area in general is the huge construction project going on directly beside the hotel and renovations within the hotel. Even if you want to stay here (which I cannot recommend given other Singapore/Chinatown options), don't even think about it until all the construction is complete. No assurance by hotel management about trying to minimize convenience can make up for the substantial loud noise that starts very early and goes on until past dark. Here is a clue from the room - a card on the desk states \"We apologise for the noise outside. It is beyond our control. It is however, our duty to make it better for you. Here's something from us. Hope this helps.\" You guessed it - a pack of foam ear plugs!!! OK, besides the noise - the other negative comments I read on here are extremely accurate as well - inadequate hot water. One person can barely finish a shower without running out of hot water and if you are in one of the garden rooms with the tub outside, forget about being able to use it because there is not enough hot water to fill it. There is a switch on the room water to turn on/off the hot water heater. So, evidently there is one small hot water heater per room. This was very annoying to have to rush through showers for SGD 310 per night. Another annoyance - the internet speed is practically dial-up speed. Sure, it is free but it is practically useless. If you have to connect to TS/VPN type connections or use Skype/Exchange, forget about it. I ran speed test that were below 0.5mbps download. I called to complain and obviously management is used to these complaints from their reaction they said its the best the hotel has to offer. Also, the A/C cannot be controlled adequately. The vents were blowing cold air down onto the bed and the room was freezing. The in-room thermostats do nothing but raise/lower the fan speed (front desk verified this) so there is no need to try to control the temperature. The front desk told me to call down each time I wanted the A/C in the room on or off! Yes, no in between - either on or off. So, during my stay I would let the room cool down then call down and they would switch it off remotely (instantly). Then when the room got hot I would have to call again for them to turn it back on. So annoying. Restaurant/breakfast reviews on here speak for themselves. Not worth wasting your time writing about this. Marginally o.k., but in some ways just bad. Room was tiny - not any place to even put a suitcase. Overpriced basically. Staff generally were very pleasant and tried to be helpful - but I could tell they know what the problems are - they simply smile and do their best to cover up the flaws. I think most irritating on here is reading all the management responses, and how they tend to pick up on the positive things, especially on the negative reviews, and say \"we look forward to your return\". Why they can't see that these negative review actually matter and mean that people who have negative impressions will not be returning is beyond me. It is like management has their head stuck in the sand here and don't want to acknowledge the major issues. Hope this review is helpful. I managed to stick out the stay just because I didn't want to pack up and move to another hotel, but this place is not worth the price and has some major issues that anyone taking the time to consult Tripadvisor for advice will need to heed.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cCool room\u201d", "Author": "denisenah", "ReviewID": "UR120700161", "Content": "I am a big fan of the hotels under the Unlisted Collection group.

The rooms, while amazingly stylish, lacked basic features which make a room comfortable. Bed was hard and too short (I'm not even 6 foot and my feet hung off the end). There were no bed side tables (one side had a nook in the wall) and only one side had access to lighting apart from the bedside). There was only a tiny space for hanging clothes up and nowhere to put suitcases other than under the bed. The bathroom also offered nowhere to put any toiletries and nowhere to hang a towel. The hot water also seemed to run out quickly. While the hotel can't be blamed for construciton noise in the area (construction is everywhere in Singapore) it did detract from the hotel experience (pool area, outside bath were both made far less relaxing) as the construction is right next door, at times very loud and goes on until quite late at night. Also, at check in we were put into a Premier Pool Room despite having booked a Premier Garden Room. The staff quickly moved us into the right room, but i have to recommend against booking the Premier Pool room for any more than one night, it really was tiny. I think the New Majestic would be fine for a short stay of one or two nights. Location is great and it really is a stylish hotel. If you are planning a longer stay where you spend time relaxing around the hotel you would be better off looking elsewhere, at least while the construction work is still going.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel, a real find in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Numptyheid", "ReviewID": "UR119535820", "Content": "Husband and I stayed at the New Majestic for four nights, whilst stopping over en route to Sydney. I chose the hotel based on previous reviews and the price, especially when compared with other hotels in Singapore. It turned out to be a brilliant choice! Plus points: gratis early check in, much needed after a 14 hour flight. Staff could not be more helpful, patient and willing, such a nice change! Room was small but practical, spotlessly clean, had everything we could need including an espresso machine, kettle, hairdryer, mini fridge, safe. Bathroom was incredible, HUGE shower, loads of clean fluffy towels, soft bathrobes and plenty of gorgeous toiletries from Kiehls (check out the RRP of these products, they are expensive!) Mini fridge includes FREE bottles of water and juice. Given how much liquid you consume in the heat and the prices in Singapore, this was very much appreciated. Great to be able to set out with a cold bottle in your bag so you don't have to spend the first half hour of your day looking for a shop! Amazingly comfortable bed, despite all the fabulous things to do in Singapore, this bed made it hard to get up in the mornings, it was so comfy! Five minutes walk from the MRT, two stops away from Clarke Quay, the centre of everything in Singapore. Quiet location - because it's off the beaten track slightly (ie not in the middle of the high rises with the other hotels) it's lovely and quiet and we never had trouble with noise. And it's still so close to everything in terms of the MRT so best of both worlds. Pool is lovely, has a whirlpool function too! PLUS we were allowed use a room for a shower before we headed to the airport for our late night flight! I cannot tell you how amazing this was after a days' sightseeing in the heat, we really didn't fancy getting on the place in our grubby sweaty clothes! Cons - not really a huge con but breakfast needed to be replenished more often. We were up early and often the ham and cheese was gone or almost gone. Staff were very obliging and got more when asked, but it would be nice if they kept a closer eye on stocks. Saying that, breakfast generally was plentiful and provided cereal, cooked brekkies, muffins and pastries, salads, steamed dumplings, several different types of bread for toasting. So really it was just the cheese and ham! Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, the staff were so charming and genuinely friendly, nothing was too much trouble, so obliging.

I called the front desk and they explained to me that the building's hot water heater is not capable of heating enough water for more than half of one tub under ideal circumstances. Maybe potential customers should be made aware of this before booking. This was a huge disappointment.

We loved the New Majestic instinctually from seeing it so often in our travel and design magazines. But, the reviews on tripadvisor are definitely not what we wanted to see. We knew that Raffles and/or Orchard Road area would be less than appealing for us- we would not think of staying in Times Square when we travel to New York or Union Square in San Francisco, so we always try to stay away from the touristy/shopping areas when choosing a hotel. However, that left us with few options. Although the Naumi's location wasn't great for what we were looking for, that was our other option- it seemed like a great boutique option, and the reviews are great. However, something kept drawing us back to the New Majestic. In the end, we are so glad we chose the New Majestic! It was exactly what we were looking for. The detailing in this hotel is absolutely amazing. We were extremely satisfied with our room- especially for a boutique hotel, the cleanliness throughout the whole hotel, including our room, was excellent. We stayed in a garden room, with the romantic claw foot bath outside. On our last morning we drew up a fantastic bubble bath. The ambiance is just great- I definitely recommend this style of room. The service was excellent- we arrived around two in the morning, and we were still able to have fabulous cocktails at the adjoining bar. Check in was fast and easy. The staff were friendly, accommodating, and charming. Throughout our stay, they answered our questions, made restaurant reservations and recommendations, and were generally very helpful. The pool is amazing- we took pictures of each other from the peep holes in the restaurant, which turned out great! Both days we took a break from the city by lounging at the pool for two hours. The staff complied quickly with our requests for cold beers to be delivered pool side- so refreshing. On both occasions, we were the only guests at the pool. How fun! The breakfast was great- excellent espresso. Gym was great as well. On our last day, they allowed us to store our luggage, then when we got back to the hotel to pick it up, they let us have one last swim, then gave us a room to use to shower and freshen up. We LOVED the location of the hotel- I would have been so disappointed if we stayed in the more commercial center. The street the hotel is on is filled with interesting restaurants, an awesome German wine bar (a must!), cute boutiques, and it's just a three minute walk to amazing Chinatown shops. We loved exploring the area. It really made the trip for us. One final note- our water pressure was amazing in our shower, and we didn't ever run out of hot water, even when we filled our bath.

The bed was comfortable though and it was thoughtful to have water and macaroons laid out in room for when we checked in on a sweltering day. The shower however ran out of hot water pretty quickly and, if two are to take a shower one after another, the second person doesn't get any hot water at all unless you wait for 20 mins. That's fine in a budget hotel but didn't seem right in what is billed as a style conscious, modern hotel. The corridors look like something that wouldn't be out of place in a conference centre, and the swimming pool is more a shallow plunge pool than a proper pool. Also, the day we got there, the lift was out of order which made for a really hot trudge up and down 4 flights of stairs till they got it working again. All in, seeing as this hotel is featured in several design lists, fine if you want the kudos to say you've stayed somewhere directional in otherwise staid Singapore; as hotels themselves go though, it's style over substance which is fine flicking the pages of a glossy but not a ton of fun if you want to bed down.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best.....in asia.........\u201d", "Author": "Barcelona_boys", "ReviewID": "UR34202714", "Content": "We stayed for two nights at the end of a 3 week tour of asia...our room was fantastic, out door bath and terrace great fun.... very nice touches in the room, nespresso etc..

I tried two rooms (after asking to be moved away from the noisy room, and having to pay 90$Sing extra for it).

Having booked it, we then found some reviews in some high end magazines, so hoped we would not be dissapointed. We were not! We booked a Premier Garden Room (outdoor bath). Whilst there was no view from the terrace (we were no expecting one and I do not think the purpose of an the outdoor bath is not to look at the traffic...), it was in fact a great spot to relax. The room had a big shower with a variety of types of water sprays from the top and the middle of the shower. There was a LCD TV at the foot of the bed and also in the rooms were the most comfortable bath robes ever... (we even tried to purchase one, but, unfortunately they did not have our size). You can reach anything easily in Singapore by Taxi, although, we did fnd ourselves shuffling between the Raffles Plaza area and the Hotel on a few occasions. However, the happiness of staying at a boutuqey style of hotel out won the extra couple of taxi rides. The staff were always helpful and happy. Also, when I asked if I could use the internet I was delighted to be given an Apple MacBook just to borrow, which they said \"just bring back when you are finished\"! This was perfect as there was WIFI throughout the hotel lobby and in our rooms. We did not use the pool, although only because of a lack of time.... However, it was a cool design in that the bottom of the pool has circular windows over the restaurant! Overall, a great hotel to use as a base! Breakfast was substantial and the room was spotless. The rooms are all themed and we had the big goldfish room (photos attached). It made for an enjoyable stay and we would happily stay there next time in Singapore.", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta", "Title": "\u201cLOVE the unique boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "blv_beetle", "ReviewID": "UR18379759", "Content": "Although I have read not-so-nice reviews abt this hotel, I've decided to be brave; given that awards this hotel have received.

I actually re-scheduled my trip and ended up staying an extra day. Hotel rooms are generally smaller in Singapore (I suppose because land is scarce). The New Majestic hotel employ artistic props to make as if the room is bigger than it truly is! During my Singapore trip I also stayed at The Scarlet.

Loved the hotel, especially the open-air (during the day) lobby. Was nice to be in a 'funky' but very comfortable place in an up-and-coming area of town while my colleagues were in big boring corporate hotels. Took me about 7 minutes in a (cheap) taxi to get to Suntec centre each day. Bed was v. comfortable, Kiehl's products a nice touch, shower amazing, food at the restaurant downstairs very good, staff excellent. My only complaints are: -for some reason I have noticed this trend in new Asian hotels: lightswitch weirdness. The lightswitch for the bathroom is neither in, nor anywhere near the bathroom--it is above and to the left of the headboard of the bed. Why?? -Air conditioning: you can adjust the temperature in the room,but as I wanted to open the windows and enjoy the tropical breeze at night I had to specially request that the front desk 'dismantle' the A/C. You can't turn it on/off in your own room. -Restaurant: food was good but the only in-room dining options are set-course menus. Not convenient when it's 10pm and you just want to nibble while writing a business report. I just went downstairs and ordered a la carte in the restaurant. All in all those are just minor gripes.

Located in Chinatown right next to the Outram Park subway station (which also offers easy access to the airport), it is in a good spot with lots of atmosphere and food options away from the somewhat \"heartless\" business district. The hotel's design is unique and fresh, rooms are small but clean and bright and cheery and very well equipped. Some details are not very functional and sub-standard for an upscale hotel, such as hot water boilers that need to be turned on half an hour before taking a shower (and have a pretty small capacity). Switching lights on and off is a science in itself. But those problems seem to be common among designy hotels. The staff tries hard but overall seems somewhat helpless and unprofessional. Obviously not recruited and trained to standard. Breakfast is limited and nothing to write home about, but also not essential in a large city with tropical climate. Despite those drawbacks, the New Majestic offers excellent value for money by Singapore standards and has much more personality than the big chain hotels in the business district.
