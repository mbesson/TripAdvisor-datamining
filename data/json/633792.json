Location is really good, just 3 minutes walking from Termini Central Station. But receptrion staff was not quite friendly. They were politeenough but the feeling is strictly bussiness like, not what you expect at a hotel though. The room was on the ground floor and I had some reservations about noise and safety, but did not have a problem at all. It was comfortable, noticeably renovated recently, particularly the bathroom, that worked perfectly. Wi-fi was fast and good. Breakfast just bread and again, the awkward feeling that you're just another business for hotel and not a guest.

Rooms are clean, bathroom is correct - TV is a little bit small , but you don't go to Rome to stay in your room watching TV ^^. Breakfast is simple : a caraf of fruit juice - a cornetto - a panino - 1 biscotte - botter and marmelade at choice - cereals - yoghourt - some cheese Just enough to start the day The breakfast takes place in the reception or you can have in your room The reception is small - only 3 little tables.

The room was clean and moderately spacious; the water pressure was excellent; I felt that my belongings were secure for the day while I meandered around the city for a few hours. However, I would not recommend this hotel for a longer stay in Rome. Being so close to the Termini means it's loud at night - even with the courtyard that did an excellent job of blocking out much of the noise. The streets around the Termini are crowded, noisy, packed with vendors and other characters who want to part you from your money - both legally and otherwise. Even just a few blocks away makes a huge difference. I was informed upon check-in that I needed to pay in cash, even though I had confirmed my reservation online with a credit card. The desk clerk said that the credit card machine was broken; when I told them that they had my credit card information on file and could just charge me once their machine was working again, I was told \"No, this is not possible.\" I had time to go to an ATM machine, but it was an inconvenience I would have rather forgone. Other than that, the service was fine. Romantic getaway? Not even close. But serviceable, for sure. ***NOTE: after reading other reviews on TripAdvisor and Venere.com, I discovered that they've had a \"broken credit card machine\" since at least 2007. I've changed my mind and would not recommend this hotel to anyone, even someone just staying overnight, based upon this piece of evidence. Hotel Chicago: either start accepting credit cards, or stop accepting online reservations. Misrepresentation through lying is both unethical and distasteful.

We had just one day to stay in Rome and wanted to make it the most productive. Though we did not expect any luxury for the price, several things are unacceptable at any price.

After breakfast the attendant informed us that we \u201cshould have been informed the previous night\u201d that the creditcard machine was broken \u2013 and we would have to pay cash (Checking the site http://www.trav.com/wri-7031/HotelChicagoRoma/Reviews you can see this problem is chronical, at least since april 2007, so there seems to be no interest in solving it \u2013 WHY?).

It is well located near the termini train station with easy access to Rome's sights. Our room was clean and cheerfully decorated. The bathroom was adequate. The two twin beds were the narrowest -- and hardest -- I've ever slept on. I imagine this is what you get in jail. The first time I rolled over, I landed on the floor with a thud. That's how narrow it was. The hotel doesn't really have a lobby. You leave the \"office,\" where the front desk is located, go outside and enter the hotel itself via another door. There's no elevator. There are several rooms located in a pod. To gain access, you have to be buzzed in by the front desk. The entrance is in a small courtyard with apartments and businesses on the opposite side. This isn't so great if one of your neighbors decides to play loud music or have a loud conversation into the wee hours of the morning. That happened a couple of nights. The breakfast isn't worth the trouble. The guy at the front desk demanded payment in cash. He claimed the credit card machine was out of order. At first, I refused, but finally acquiesced.
