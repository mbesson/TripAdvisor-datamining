{"Reviews": [{"Content": "You'd be crazy not to stay at the Holiday Inn Regents Park I've been taking groups to London for the past 15 years and this was my first experience with the Holiday Inn Regents Park. Our travel agent made the arrangements and I read the reviews on tripadvisor.com (some of which were quite negative)--plus, I'd just had another group in London the previous June staying elsewhere and it was awful--bad rooms  surly attitudes--so I was prepared for a similar experience. There were 32 people in my group and we stayed for a week. This hotel is located within easy walking distance of the Great Portland St and Warren St tube stations, minutes away from all of London's attractions.The rooms were large by London standards, and although the bathrooms were small they were clean and modern. Facecloths were provided and the maid service was excellent. Breakfast was also outstanding and the usual selections were nicely prepared and everything was kept fresh.The staff, however, was what made my experience with a group of 18 teens and 14 adults such a pleasure. They were helpful, (even to the point of sending someone to a room if the occupant hadn't responded to his wake-up call), and we were provided with continental breakfast bags with a generous selection of items on the two mornings we had to leave early to catch trains. We also celebrated a birthday on our final night  arranged for a dinner with a birthday cake. The meal was excellent, reasonably priced, and they even provided party favors along with the cake.If I return to London with or without a group I plan to stay at the Holiday Inn Regents Park.

It exceeded expectations in every respect. Our room was huge, the design aesthetic of the whole establishment was cool and understated, our room even had copies of recent local design and architecture magazines. Sure, as some of the other reviews noted, there was some peeling paint, but really who cares, we thought it added to the art deco charm of the place. It is in an interesting part of Sydney, close to lots of happening eateries. The staff were all friendly, helpful and knowledgeable with recommendations. Highly recommended.", "Date": "Oct 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR788997479", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "m_242"}, {"Content": "A little tired, needs a refurb before the competitions opens. Regent's Court used to be a hip boutique hotel. John Cleese and a bevvy of friends had proceeded us and had all liked and recommended this hotel. Sure it's in a good location, close to restaurants and bars in Kings X and Potts Point. We had a suite room on the top floor and while the room was large, the decor was tired and really needed an upgrade. The carpets needed replacing, the airconditioning unit produced enough white noise to drown out the adjacent courtyard noises, the veneers on the cupboards and the pull down bed had seen better days and the table and chairs in the kitchen area were cheap and should have been replaced along with the carpet. The bed was just a queen and could have been more comfortable. The linens, towels and coverings just a little more luxurious. The bathroom was small but adequate, just like the towels and the toiletries. There were no robes, no free paper in the morning (the in room magazines are good) internet access on the wireless service costs $10 per day and the cable TV choice was limited. The lift is an old Waygood/Otis manual door and requires a little effort to get open. All of this is shame because the place has so much potential. Nice lobby and shared lounge area. Guests services were great and all the staff were friendly and helpful. But for the $195 pricetag plus parking, we could have cut a better deal at the Sebel or the Stamford. All in all it was disappointing. Someone is building a another boutique hotel down the street, so it would be nice to think this might give Regent's Court a reason to get hip again.", "Date": "Apr 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR721437321", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "spbyrne"}, {"Content": "I think it's been refurbished Very unobtrusive hotel from the street, but great place inside. Staff are wonderful and reception room looks good. For the price I paid, I think the bedroom I had was fantastic - includes mini-kitchen and decent bathroom. Bedroom itself was very big (similiar to some large 5 star places in European capitals) and wall decoration wasn't just a bland formula. The best thing is that if you're into restaurants, they have a great review guide in the rooms, and the staff are happy to try to get you in to restaurants that are notionally full - I'm referring to the places that charge up to AU$200 per head for supper. OK, so if you look really hard you probably can find somewhere a little bit better in Sydney, but I'd guess you'd probably pay a lot more for it", "Date": "May 16, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR979820219", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "pmbma"}, {"Content": "Don't Believe the \"Hip\" Hype It was probably very hip when it opened over 10 years ago, but it doesn't appear much has been done to keep the place up since then.We booked this hotel because we found it in a book on Hip Hotels of the World, and it looked very slick, clean and generally well-run. We paid extra for a larger room on the front, and it was in desperate need of some work. The carpet was very worn, the paint was beginning to peel, there were cracks in the plaster, and the bed was so soft or worn out (or both) that we rolled into the middle when we laid on it (since we were down in Sydney to compete in a run, and we both have bad backs, the bed was a problem).King's Cross is an interesting, if perhaps a little dicey, neighbourhood, and it would have been alright if the hotel had been better. Having said that, the staff were very friendly, but held us to their 2 days notice of early check out policy. I wouldn't recommend the hotel, at least until it's undergone some serious refurbishment.", "Date": "Oct 10, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR908279302", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d258089-r15001076-Regents_Court-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "258089", "Price": "$250"}}
