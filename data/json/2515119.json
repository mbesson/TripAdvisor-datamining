While the room was small It was neat, clean, modern and well equiped. It even had a small fridge but that had to be removed from its cupboard in order to get it to work. Staff were very friendly and professional. While the room was small and the price high, that is what is to be expected in central Paris. The location is excellent with easy access either by foot or Metro to all the major sites. We did not partake of their morning breakfast, seemed a little expensive, so we can't comment on the food but the breakfast facilities looked pleasant. We would stay here again without hesitation if we return to Paris.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cQuirky but cute\u201d", "Author": "MLC1234", "ReviewID": "UR117495637", "Content": "I work in Paris on average 2 days per week and have a list of preferred hotels. However this week they were all massively overpriced due to Paris events so the best price i could get was in the Triangle D'Or. Overall i was impressed by it and i would stay there again. I work about 2 mins away and can confirm this hotel is in a very upmarket district. There is one boarded up sex shop across the road but this is not a sleazy area of Paris. The rooms are quite small but not the smallest i have had in Paris and adequate for a short trip. The decor is very quirky including bright yellow hands on the front door, the sequined lift with a glass door, the piano tiles in the shower and the painted music decor on the walls. Overall the effect is quirky but charming. This isnt a massive hotel with lots of amenities like big bars and restaurants. But it has all the basics and its newly decoated so everything is clean and tidy. I also liked the IPOD docking station on the TV so i could play my music. I dont know if they responded to previous comments or whether i was lucky with my room but i had a shower screen - no flooded bathroom like previous reviews.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cSmall rock n roll themed hotel close to all the sites, has wifi and decent breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Chris_helen90266", "ReviewID": "UR117425897", "Content": "I stayed in the Rickie Lee Jones suite and enjoyed the vibe, if your are looking for something elegant and grand, this is not for you.

Triangle d'Or is a music-themed hotel that's a bit of a museum itself but manages not to be annoyingly chic. Our room was small, even for Paris, but comfortable and quiet (we requested a room on a high floor facing the courtyard and had one waiting when we arrived late on a Friday). Good beds, brand-new bathrooms, a/c, gorgeous design. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Only a few drawbacks: not a lot of space for the price. If my husband and I had had luggage -- instead of small overnight bags -- we'd have had trouble moving around. Also, there's no shower curtain or door, so the bathroom flooded whenever we showered. The bathroom needs more hooks for towels. It's a new property, so they may still be getting the kinks out. Overall, it was a delightful place to stay.

We loved the hotel and its Madeleine locale where there are great shops, good local restaurants which are also reasonably priced and of course, right around the corner, Fauchon which has very good coffee and food at a premium price. (Paris is notorious for very bad coffee virtually everywhere!!) (Tip within a tip: really great coffee can be found at the cafe restaurant atop BHV, rue de Rivoli, which has to be one of the best department stores anywhere - better than Printemps and Galeries Lafayette!!) Hotel du Triangle d'Or offers a 15 E breakfast which is a great way to start the day and this includes good coffee! Staff are excellent and personable.
