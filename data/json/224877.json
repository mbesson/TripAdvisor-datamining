I've stayed here four times, three times for business and once for a good friend's wedding. The construction/design, amenities, and most impressively, service, are all top notch. Pros: * Fantastic service. Gracious and low-key, but clearly willing to help with whatever you can dream up. My personal experience was excellent -- my friend who was married here had over-the-top service. The entire staff knew him (they most have taken a picture of him and distributed it) and he was addressed by name everywhere he went. * Fantastic design aesthetic. It is the typical MO Asian theme, but sleekly done and contemporary. The hotel is very new, and the design feels like it (although the service has the polish of an older venue). * Very nice sized rooms, and it appears that most (all?) have private outdoor space. * The restaurant and pool are both fantastic. Service, again, was very good, and I found the sushi to be top notch. Drinks were also very good. * The food on their events floor was very good, both for business conferences and the wedding. * As a wedding venue, it was superb. The staff was excellent, the setting was great, and the large outdoor terrace was put to good use for a superb scotch and cigar bar. * I was also impressed with their use of the beach area for a welcome dinner. Cons * Location, sort of. It is a prime business location on Brickell Key. However, it is a long way from South Beach, so if that is your scene, choose elsewhere. * While they do their \"beach\" area well, the reality is that you can't get into the water from the beach. It is really just a sandy area on top of a concrete sea wall. Excellent execution of the concept, but the concept has the inherent limitation of not providing access to the water. Not sure you'd want to get in the water right there anyways, as it is right at the mouth of the river and in the middle of a relatively busy boating thoroughfare.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brooklyn, ny", "Title": "\u201cWhen you want the best service, quiet location away from busy South Beach this is the ultimate place to hang around.\u201d", "Author": "loverofdogs", "ReviewID": "UR125207864", "Content": "I've stayed at this MO several times and love the location.

Hotel is in a great location, on a man made island to the south of Miami, and a short walk over the bridge takes you to some groovy and lively restaurants. Welcoming friendly front desk staff and porters, but had possibly the rudest man ever on the phone trying to sort out the wifi, and had to hang up on him and take ipads etc down to the front desk to get connected. But the nasty guy aside, all staff who we actually met were very good indeed. Which brings me to the cost.Mad $15 charge for wifi connection in the room. And the rooms are mega expensive for the rather ordinary standard. Every room boasts a view but we were on the Miami side of the hotel and the view over the entrance was slightly forlorn, and from a rather Spartan little balcony. Room was fine, but little details let it down, like a glass vase above the bath clearly meant for flowers, but not containing any.Slightly tatty furnishings, but clean enough, and exceptionally nice bath robes. The location also makes it really convenient for the airport, which is only about twenty minutes away, but that sadly means it's also on the flight path, so expect a lot of aircraft noise from very early in the morning. Breakfast is taken on rather a lovely terrace overlooking the bay and was fine, but again very expensive. To sum up, it's obviously catering to one night pre-cruise clients who don't care very much about this leg of their journey, and so standards are perhaps not as high as other hotels in the chain.

It was a stunning view. The bed was large and comfortable, spotlessly clean room. The bathroom was missing a wall next to the bath so you could watch tv but had a blind that could be pulled down for privacy and the toilet was in its own room. The room felt expensive and it was worth the money. We booked through ebookers who hadn't stated that there would be an extra $70 per night tax charge. Internet was $35 for 3 days. I was charged an additional $10 for having a package delivered. The a la carte breakfast menu worked out at $90 for 2 people as every little thing was charged as extra. Dinner in Azul was nothing special but came with a very special price tag of $220 for 2, we only had 1 cocktail each and a starter and a main!!!! We had breakfast and other meals outside the hotel for the rest of our stay. The hotel makes as much money as possible from you. The only problem I had with this hotel other then the additional costs was the noise. The 2nd night we were woken at 6am by hammering, by 6.30am I couldn't take it any longer and called reception. They said they would get it stopped, it did for 10 mins and then started up again. Another call, another stop for 10mins then restart again. We went down to reception and found the front door covered in a big black cloth with no work men. We assumed the front door was damaged and they were fixing it and that was what all the noise was about. 3rd night 6.30am the hammering starts again. A very angry call to reception it stops and then restarts again just quieter. No work was done when guests were actually around in the lobby only when they were trying to sleep and the lobby was empty. A major complaint to the manager and all we got was $90 off our bill of $2630 as compensation, big deal!!! What about my lack of sleep when I was on holiday??? When we left we asked the bell boy what had actually been going on and he said the door wasn't broken they were replacing the carpet for tiles in the hallway. So the manager decided that rather then make noise when guests were in the lobby they would make noise when guests were sleeping. I am so angry that I was paying that much money per night to have my sleep broken for something that did not need to be done and could have been done during normal working hours.

I stayed for 1 night and was upgraded to the Deluxe Veranda room. While I appreciated the upgrade at the time I probably should have kept my standard city view room. First, the veranda is not very private, only a plant separates you from your neighbors. Second, the veranda has a lounge chair which is nice to relax on but the way the hotel is designed the veranda extends outward one floor lower than the lowest floor of hotel guest rooms. Therefore, everyone on the balconies above (25-30 floors of them) look down on you and after I glanced up twice finding people staring down on me I wondered why I paid over 300 dollars to feel like I was on display. Thirdly, when I called and asked for a thirty minute late checkout, I was told no because the \"room type I was in was limited and sold out\". I understand checkout time is checkout time but come on, I spent less than 24 hours in the hotel and hundreds of dollars for a five star experience, and I wound up rushing myself to checkout after a phone call ran 20 minutes long and again thinking, for the money, this was not worth it. Now if you want a view of the downtown Miami from your balcony this is the best you'll get. The view is limited since the hotel is built kind of u shaped so depending on where your room is the view is still stunning but not grand. My advice is for these prices to stay in south beach, and if you want a great view of Miami take a 4 mile walk (one-way) across the Venetian Causeway. It's free and just as private!!!

We stayed in a Jr. Suite (#1716) and had views of both from our room. The skyline lit up at night was great. The hotel is on a little island just off the coast so you have waterfront views and a 5 minute walk to the city. We visited the spa each day, took a taxi to see the Biltmore in Coral Gables &to see South beach, walked from the hotel across a short bridge to the Mary Brickell shops and restaurants (and Starbucks!) which was only 5-10 mins away. We walked the path that goes all the way around the (mostly residential) little island the hotel is on, and walked about 3 miles over to the nearest bridge we could see south of the hotel. That path is partially waterfront. There is no access to the water, but there is a waterfront beach area to sit near the water. Also a pool that you can see the water from. We dined at Azul for dinner one night and the food and service was great. For men, there is a closed toe shoe dress code which my husband wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared for, so we bought a pair of shoes at the shops we walked to. (They remind you when making the reservation of the dress code so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem we could slide by.) Breakfast was room service and was good. However, lunches were a letdown as they are primarily sushi which is fine for one or two meals but I was really ready for another option. We dined by the pool and in the caf\u00c3\u00a9 for lunches and dinners . We found our male caf\u00c3\u00a9 server to be brash and preferred the pool dining, which had a better staff--even though it had fewer menu options. We had some outstanding service here\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand some not so good experiences too. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to be expected as good people really do make a difference in any industry. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend NOT booking your massage with your room reservation on the Mandarin website. (They offer you a 10% discount if you do.) But then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no mechanism for actually scheduling your massage after you select to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153add it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to your stay\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand we must have spoken with 5-6 people to actually get the 10% discount that booking the 80 minute massages with your room reservation is supposed to get you! So frustrating. We asked for a coffee maker in our room after reading in other reviews that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not standard\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand they supplied us with one. We were also treated with an anniversary bottle of champagne in our room and a desert at Azul one night for our anniversay\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnice touches. One night we were woken by someone knocking on our room door despite the hour and despite the fact that our do not disturb light was on. With hearts beating out of our chests thinking there must be some kind of emergency, we went to the door to find an employee telling us he was there to remove some table. We think he had the wrong room. We also requested a copy of our bill a day in advance, were told it would be slid under our door at 3pm and it never arrived. So the service had its highs and lows but we were happy overall. We liked the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location better than we did the actual comfort of the room itself but our view made up for it. The bathroom had that weird open wall between the bathtub and bed, very limited counter space in the bath, and a small shower wedged behind the bathroom door so that it had to be closed to open the shower door. This was in a jr. suite too. I wouldn't rate it great value for the money by any means. (We've had plunge pools in our rooms for the price we paid for the jr. suite!)

I agree with most other reviews regarding that the rooms are OK and that the service is indifferent. But really what has bothered me this time is the incessant noise coming from the lawn, where they are building a tent for what seems to be a big event... Same thing was happening when I attended a luncheon in December. It seems like the management at this hotel values their event guests more than their hotel guests. To make matters worse, there is some MAJOR CONSTRUCTION going on at the building next door to the Mandarin and there is heavy drilling non-stop from 8AM to 5PM. Both of these construction projects make it impossible to enjoy the peace & quiet that $400/night should get you! I am very disppointed in this hotel for not being able to secure a quiet and peaceful environment in the middle of such a great location. WILL NOT STAY HERE IN THE FUTURE, or recommend it to Miami visitors. If you are thinking about booking this hotel, ask them about the construction going on... It is deafening.

The rooms were well appointed and clean. There were a few things that were off-putting though. First, there was a blind that was meant as a privacy screen between the tub and the room. The screen was short about an inch so we had to pile up towels for our length of stay for privacy, we mentioned it to staff who said they would send someone up but either they didn't show or couldn't fix it but either way, it was not addressed so the towels were there the whole time. This wasn't a big deal but it wasn't nothing either since my entire family loves a bubbly tub. Second, the thing that makes it desirable (being cut off) also makes seeing the rest of Miami very pricey as a car is needed everywhere, everywhere charges for parking and nothing is easily within walking distance. Third, and I don't know if this is a Mimi thing or particular to this hotel but they were very grabby about money, almost on the verge of seeming beggarly which was just icky. To get to our room the desk person walked us up = tip, the bellmen (2) then brought us up and gave a tour (2 tips) and every little thing in between felt like a tip was expected which meant we called as little as possible. Also, EVERY luxury in the room seemed to come attached to an exorbitant price-tag, so much so that we didn't dare touch the chocolates which may or may not have been complimentary because I was afraid of getting a $50 bill for them LOL. The vibe was just way too grabby. I suppose one could write this off as a luxury hotel thing but we spend a great deal of time in upscale places everywhere for business and pleasure, NYC being a fav spot, and never before was I so uneasy and I didn't like the choice of feeling of being either cheap or ripped off. I guess this place is fine for people with hundreds dripping out of their pockets unnoticed but for families and normal people, well I'd skip it next time around, the vibe was just 'off'.

When we got to our room it was on a lower level (I asked for a high level) and it was really close to the street.

First they told us they had another than the front desk manager told us he has to check and finally he told us that they had no other room only 2 very nice rooms but they were much more expensive. We told him that we are not willing to pay $ 300 more for a room and that we will leave and go back to west palm beach. He was very sorry and asked us if he could show us the other rooms but we said no we won't pay more, this room was expensive enough. 1 minute later (I was already on the phone with the hotel in West Palm Beach) he called again and said he has a room for us on the 18th floor with a nice view. It took us another 2 hours, but then we had the room we wanted to have! After that our stay was really nice. They had a big wedding on our arrival day, that's why everything was so packed. We still think that the pool area is to small and the service there is a little bit slow, but the beach area is really nice, the spa was wonderful, the bar is ok but it's more a business hotel than a beach hotel so you have to expect things like this.

I was not given my requested room at check in and was given a shuffle u til I was able to get the correct selection.i thought that perhaps it was an oversight and quickly forgot about the incident and when I went to get my car the following morning I was impressed to see the hotel general manager personally shaking the hand of the bell staff , doormen and parking attendants and wishing them a good morning. I arrived back to my room late in the afternoon and my room had not yet been cleaned despite a notice t\" please make up the room and refresh the towels. I called housekeeping and and was assure that this was an oversight and that I should leave my room and it would be serviced within an hour. I decided to go to the lobby bar to have an espresso but was told that the coffee machine had been broken for at least week and they could not get it fizzed quickly and was sent to another hotel cafe in the lower level where the service was incompetent , rude and very overpriced for the lukewarm and poor quality . I returned to my room to shower and dress for an evening reception only to find that the room still had not been serviced in over one hour and there were no clean towels or fresh soaps etc. I again callled housekeeping and could not get a straight response. I then contacted the front desk and was given an apology with a promise to have housekeeping bring fresh towels and service the roomAnother no show. I next attempted to call the hotel manager who I had witnessed in the morning greeting staff and guests. I was told that he could not be found , but was pormised and immediate callback from his secretary or assistant. Needless to say the call never came and my room still remained dirty until the turn down servic3 appeared. The following day I returned to my room in the late afternoon with my wife and had just exited the shower and was lying on my bed with only a small towel covering my \" private components\" when ther was a knock on my doorway followed by the announcement that it was hote Security. I was told that they had to come into my room to install a new hotel movie and entertainment system and he was accompanied by 2 maintenance men . We wet told that they would be there for just a few minutes as they modified the TV and then due to complications had to remove drawers in which our clothes were placed in order to access the electrical components. Needlesss t o say,the three men remained in my room for a good bit of time after which I told them that this was unacceptable and after all of the other mishaps I told the security man that this was an invasion of our privacy and that this event was another example of how this place does not have their act together.after they left our TV never worked properly and we called them back. It then failed to operate properly and rather than complain again we just said the hell with it and vowed never to return and continued to enjoy ourselveses away from the hotel. I noted my concerns to another hotel employee who had also worked for the Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons chain ans clearly noted a lessor attitude of service and staff training. I have never had such disappointing service at any other hotel, even the much lesser priced chains . I am sure that this is unlike any other Mandarin Oriental Hotel that I have stayed at and unfortunately I will have second thoughts about ever staying in one of their signature properties again. I hope and trust that my experience here was just a rarity and if not, management should open their eyes and ears and take action.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cShocking experience. Please Read!\u201d", "Author": "AlejandroAlcaraz", "ReviewID": "UR120047416", "Content": "We checked in at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami on October 21st we were kindly picked up with a limousine service at the Airport and greeted at the hotel lobby, the front desk assistant was extremely kind and gave us a beautiful room on the 8th floor overlooking the wonderful Brickell bay. We had a lovely Junior Suite given that we made all our reservations through the American Express Platinum Travel Services and of course they have certain perks. So far our experience was really lovely, the reason why we were visiting Miami was because my girlfriend and I were celebrating her birthday and it was her present, aside I took the opportunity of meeting up with few business associates. During the early morning of Monday the 24th of October, I got up from the bed and was hoping to start our day, however as the blinds were totally closed the room was dark and I misstepped on some silky pillows that were on the floor, given that they never came to do the turndown of the room, (usually around 18hrs they remove the silky decorative pillows as well as the covers and prepare the room for sleep). As a result I fell head first broke the fall with my arm groping on the desk in front of the bed where the TV was placed. I was startled from the impact and due to the obvious noise I woke up my girlfriend. Once we turned on the lights we saw that my hand was slightly bruised from the impact and of course since I am not a light guy 110kg of weight the result was an impact against the TV screen which ended up broken. We had informed the room service, and security came to inquire and inspect and make pictures. More concretely 2 security staff and the manager on duty. The security staff asked some questions and provided me with some ice for the hand. They told us that it was a clear trip and fall and they accommodated us. The manager Mr. Hendrik Grebe on the other hand did not show any concern nor did he tried to communicate with us. Security came again minutes later to help us fill in a report and we of course did it following their advice. We were told that they will get back to us for the matter of replacing the tv and whatever else we could need for such incident. The evening of the same day we came back to our hotel room and found that the tv was not replaced nor has the room been made up. Moreover there had not been a single attempt to try to clarify the situation or see if we could need any further help. We contacted the front desk about the tv and we were told that they just don\u00c2\u00b4t have a replacement tv, instead I had to request to be moved to a different room. Approximately an hour later they provided us with the same kind of room on a different floor. The day after it was our departure date and I was having breakfast with some business associates at their restaurant and while I was walking my guest out of the Mandarin one of the security staff approached me and said that the manager on duty would like to have a word, which obviously created an awkward moment. Furthermore the manager on duty Mr. Kelvin Jiles came to speak to me and informed me that I was going to be charged 1.300 usd aprox for the tv, given that the manager from the day of the incident reported it as property damage. Of course I did not expect this, nothing was communicated to us, and no one ever made an effort to clarify such a situation. Obviously I had several questions of my own as to why this incident was treated in such a manner with the lack of communicating and unprofessionally of the Mr. Hendrik Grebe\u00c2\u00b4s part. I was told by Mr. Kelvin Jiles that it would be possible to speak to Mr. Grebe later in the day and requested me to come back at 3pm. However Mr. Grebe never came out to us, instead we spoke to the head of security for the hotel. Previously we were able to read the internal written report supposedly written by Mr. Grebe where he defined the situation as I was caught by a housekeeping staff who brought our breakfast and I declined or pretended I never ordered, later in the report they said it was a mistake from room service obviously I never ordered such a breakfast, on top my girlfriend was referred to as a friend who spent the night in my room, also they insinuated that I could have been drunk, and worse was there could have been a case of domestic violence. That has been the most insulting situation I have ever found myself in not to say how ashamed I was when my girlfriend read such a report. I of course was told by every person who approached to us from the staff that they absolutely understand our disagreement, and confusion of such an absurd situation. They repeatedly told us that the charged were done on my card and kept on apologizing. We are usual costumers of the Mandarin Oriental more concretely we had just been 5 days at their hotel in NYC. We feel horrified at the treatment and lack of professional approach and we still haven\u00c2\u00b4t been given a proper or justified answer to the events.

This is a top rated hotel marketing itself as a luxurious place. The hotel is very nice, well kept, clean and elegant inside. From the spacious bright lobby to the shops and restaurants and pool area with private beach, all are definately luxurious quality. The location in brickell is definately in a nice safe elegant area of Miami. All the staff from doormen to checkin to concierage were helpful and pleasant. The pool staff were also very helpful and friendly, particularly when a large iguana strolled by our sunbeds frightening the life out of my wife and the pool attendant was very reassuring that we were in no danger. The room was spacious, clean and had a large bathroom (though don't forget to close the blind before hopping in the bath as there is a clear view from the balcony!). The TV worked peferctly and there was an integrated entertainment system that we could connect our iPod to. Now, to the reasons for 'average'. Well, personally, when I stay in a luxurious hotel, I like to feel that I am getting value for money. What didn't deliver this for me in the Mandarin Oriental was the 'extras'. Wifi was not free and was about $35 a day to use. Considering the Starbucks and pubs within walking distance of the hotel all offer free Wifi, it was frustrating the hotel didn't offer this. The price of items in the mini bar were very expensive (as is frequently the case in hotels - it is almost like they don't want want people using the mini bar). There were no tea/coffee making facillities in the room. Again this felt like a rip off as you had to go to the bar to purchase tea / coffee when it is custom to have such facillities in your room. There were also two problems in the bathroom. The shower door leaked quite badly leaving a large puddle in the bathroom after each shower. Secondly, the basin would not stay filled draining away in seconds. This made shaving both awkward and not very environmentally friendly as I had to leave the hot tap running. Finally, not a big deal but I was asked on check in what paper I would like each morning and I never once got a newspaper delivered. I wouldn't have minded this if I hadn't been offered it initially. All in all, a nice hotel but if you want to hit the high standards of luxurious, I think all areas need to be perfect and I did not feel like that here.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWOW - yes, details, hmmmmm\u201d", "Author": "verogal", "ReviewID": "UR119877580", "Content": "We travel quite a bit and I must say, this hotel certainly has the \"IT\" factor. It is stunning location on Brickell Key, Miami is unbeatable. Water surrounding this little oasis makes every view beautiful every hour of the day or night. Service was excellent from the first encounter with the valet parking to every clerk, hostess, cleaning person or food server. Staff seemed genuinely caring and attentive. The Oriental decor is so tranquil and stunning in its simplicity. Our room was also decorated minimalist, but perfect. The bed was very comfortable with superior luxurious linens and a large selection of pillows. The bathroom is almost as big as the bedroom. It is huge with a great soaking tub and a large shower for two and a generous supply of huge soft fluffy towels. Matching robes and slippers add to the relaxing options. We ate in two of the hotel restaurants which were delicious and also had great service. So why doesn't the Mandarin Oriental get a perfect score? The following items diminished the overall experience: The bathroom scale is a nice touch, but it was broken. The batteries in the TV remote were dead. The flashlight in a closet is a good idea, but it didn't function. The stereo system didn't work. The refrigerator cabinet was missing one wine glass. The sink in the bathroom is beautiful to look at, but the design of it creates a direct backsplash as soon as you turn the water on that splashes directly out of the sink and all over the place. Finally, my pet peeve is NO in room coffee. I simply must have my coffee before I face the day and it bothers me to either have to call room service or get dressed and wander out to find my first cup of java for the day.

More seriously, a billing issue stunned me. When I checked rates to consider the MO over another hotel, the hotel's sales rep gave me a clear quote for \"both\" rooms.

We were first assigned to room 1010 and as when we got there a maintenance man was changing the lightbulbs, he was so apologetic and quickly left the room. (no big deal) although we still decided to change out of this room because even though it was a bay room category it was facing more of the city and downtown area also there was a really bad smell that came from the water by the bridge going into the key (not the hotel's fault i'm sure but still not nice when you are paying that type of price for a hotel.)My husband spoke to the front desk and they immediately changed our room without any hesitation. They sent the bellman up with the new cards immediately. OUr second room was beautiful and it had an amazing view! The bed was amazing and the pillows were great. The room decor is asian modern which is very relaxing and beautiful. Great stocked mini bar! I think I even saw an outlet converter in there. The soap and other bath products were so amazing!!! Kind of minty and it is sets you in a very relaxed mood. The soaking tub was kind of narrow, cant fit two people but one person was fine. The down service was so beautiful... they made a heart with rose petals and left us a beautiful dessert for our anniversary with even the ice bucket prepared. We also went to the beach area and the pool which the service is was impeccable. They even had complimentary sun screen (which was helpful since I forgot mine) Overall our experience was amazing. The only con for my taste is that pets are allowed. There was a hollowing dog at various points through the night on our floor and you heard scattered doggie yapping. But I have to admit that you would never know the hotel allows pets if you don't see or hear them. The hotel is very meticulously clean and it does not smell like animals.

I was convinced that I had put it in the safe on our arrival but it simply was not there. I was very upset to lose so much money. We searched the room and then called the security manager who promised to look into it for me. The following morning, after we had checked out, we received a phone call to say that the envelope containing the money had been found; it was tucked up against the side of the safe and was difficult to see due to the fact that the envelope was the same colour as the safe wall. After we had left, an enterprising chap called Troy, had searched our room again and discovered it on his second search of the safe. How fantastic to find such honest staff!

It starts with Azul, the signature restaurant at this hotel There is something amiss when the menu in their featured restaurant is so odd and unappealing. the restaurant was unable to accommodate a 8:30 reservation but could squeeze me at 8:00... only to enter a restaurant that was only 1/2 full and remained that way for the duration of my stay. The menu suggested a chef who had lost their way and was trying to offer 'inventive' cuisine to a narrow group of clients. We were hard pressed to find a single item to choose from and that has never happened top me anywhere, in any setting. After searching and considering options , we politely departed without eating. We sought other choices ...ultimately to land in their Cafe a casual dining site where at least the menu offered options; although all with a singular Asian flair. The music noise level was unacceptable and ill suited for conversation and if we had not found such an accommodating manager - we would have landed up in our room using room service. Avoiding the restaurants, we took our breakfasts nearby and traveled 10 minutes to eat lunches and dinners in Coral Gables-a far better choice. Accommodation were upscale but not warm or truly luxurious. Impossibly uncomfortable lounge chair that really offered no option for the second person in the room except the desk chair. Mattress was fine yet the pillows were all of the very soft type which left one of us uncomfortable throughout the night. The singular and most redeeming feature in the hotel is the staff. They are clearly among the best trained and pleasant team I have experienced. But for them, I would have checked out after one night. Recommendation -ask the concierge how to get to nearby Mary Brickell village - not great just good but at least there are multiple dining options. Lastly, when a premier hotel asks a guests opinion.. never answer with a stock form letter. Better to say nothing ...then to treat a comment with a standard reply after a guest takes the time to offer their comments...take the time to reply with a personal note. Unless the number of negative comments is so overwhelming , the honor of a personal reply from a member of senior management would be more suitable to a hotel seeking premier status.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore", "Title": "\u201cFabulous stay with a fantastic view\u201d", "Author": "soma90", "ReviewID": "UR115106721", "Content": "Chose hotel based on a friend's recommendation and backed up by Trip Advisor rating.

Immediately upon our arrival at the hotel, we were made to feel welcomed and were offered a glass of tea by the cheerful reception clerk. After checking-in, we decided to walk around and explore. The hotel has a small private sandy beach. Very lovely and private for couples but there's an area which is ideal for families too. The surrounding area is perfect for a picnic and you watch the ships sail by. Lots of trees and very pretty landscaping. The spa was amazing. The food was delicious. The view of the city/harbor from our view was spectacular. We had dinner on our balcony overlooking the harbor. The rooms are very spacious and the marble bathrooms are a nice luxury all around. Loved soaking in the tub. We requested extra pillows which took more than several calls and attempts to get them delivered to our room.

The conference itself was excellent. And the conference food was certainly a notch above what you expect. One of the most interesting surveys I conducted at break was how many of the convention goers bruoght a spouse. Highest number I have ever heard. Almost everyone staying more than a night was being met by their spouse. That is almost unheard of in most conferences, and a testament to how much people enjoy this hotel. Particularly since the conference was international and most spouses were coming from far away at the attendees personal expense. I love this property. The staff are uniformly pleasant, gracious, etc. Every part of the common public areas are immaculate.

The service at the Mandarin Oriental was also outstanding, as were the fitness facilities, the spa and the food at the restaurant.

Perhaps the most disappointing was the patchy service- with the exception of the excellent concierge desk I had service issues that were not resolved with the hotel trying to extract more money from me for anything I asked for such as a late check out or a room with a better view (I was told many times that this was because I was on a corporate rate).

This property has large, sleek rooms, beautiful views, excellent service and top-notch facilities. We had a Deluxe Bay View Room. It is worth paying the extra money for the bay view, as opposed to the Deluxe Skyline View rooms. The Deluxe Skyline View rooms look out over the bridge that connects Brickell Key, the island on which the MO is located, to downtown Miami, and as a result, you are exposed to the attendant traffic noise when sitting on your balcony. Deluxe Bay View rooms are further from the bridge and provide better views of the Biscayne Bay. The higher the room number (i.e., Room 1717 has better views than Room 1711), the better the view. The rooms have been recently revamped and are in like-new condition. They are spacious with the all the modern conveniences and luxuries, including large Sharp Aquos flat screen TV, Denon iPod dock, multiple phones, plenty of storage space and separate tub/shower/water closet. The rooms have a Asian design aesthetic, which is consistent with the feel of the MO generally. The only gripe I have about the rooms is that the bathroom offered a one sink vanity and lacked sufficient storage/counter space for two people. We traveled with an infant, and the hotel set up, as we had requested, a crib, mini-fridge and microwave, all at no cost and with no fuss. The pool area is plenty spacious and the pool, despite what some reviewers have said, is sufficiently big to accomodate all types of guests. The views from the pool are are nice, but the view from the \"beach\" are even better. We preferred the beach area because we found the sun loungers to be more comfortable, and there was generally more space to move about. Service at both the pool area and beach was friendly and efficient, with good food and drink service. The gym at the hotel appeared to have almost new equipment--the cardio machines all had TVs and the weight machines were in great shape. The gym is constantly cleaned and refreshed, and offered complimentary scented towels, hand fruit, newspapers , headphones and bottled water. The gym also happens to look out over the baby, which is a nice change from the many subterrenean gyms that I have visited. Brickell Key is a nice place for families, offering a 1.5 mile jogging/walking path free of cars that is great for pushing the stoller and enjoying the weather. There is even a grass field and playground--try finding that so close to a 5-star hotel in South Beach. We ordered a number of room service meals and the quality of the food was uniformly excellent, the value propisition reasonably good and the service exceptional. The service generally was outstanding, from the valet and bellhops to the concierge and front desk staff. My wife had a treatment at the spa and was very impressed. The hotel offers complimentary access to the spa facilities for hotel guests, a policy that I applaud. Hotels that charge guests to access the spa facilities cheapen the overall experience. The locker rooms offer a steam and sauna as well as an experience shower. I found the spa facilities to be perfectly adequate, but not exceptional in any real way. There is no comparison to, for instance, the spa facilities at the Landmark MO in Hong Kong or the Ojai Resort and Spa. I found that they could have tended to the locker rooms a bit more than they did--in the afternoon, there were many dirty towels scattered about and things were generally askew. All in all, this MO meets the standard set by other MOs where we have stayed, including the Oriental in Bangkok and the Landmark MO in Hong Kong. I highly recommend this resort.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chattanooga, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cI didn't want to check out!\u201d", "Author": "Winetastindiva", "ReviewID": "UR92797740", "Content": "My daughter gave us a weekend and dinner at this awesome hotel. We arrived at a busy time, so we checked in and was escorted to the elevator within five minutes. When we opened the door, we found a heart made of rose petals on the bed and a smartly decorated room. The wrap-around balcony allowed for views of the city and Bay. It was love at first sight. If you are traveling with a spouse or partner, you might like the view of the bath from the bedroom. We had the tasting menu at Azul that night for our anniversary. The food was excellent. I don't eat much Asian or Med inspired food, so the tasting menu was ideal for us. You can pay a little more and have it paired with wine. The Sommelier there is great and will suggest the wine to make your dining a pleasure. He suggested a champagne for our toast that we normally don't select. Yes, the tab and tip was more than I normally pay, but the experience was worth the extra expense. It is definitely a special occasion restaurant, if you are on a budget. We then spent time in the lounge listening to live music. The area is tastefully appointed and it gives you a calming, zen feeling. This weekend was the most relaxing hotel stay that I can remember. When we returned to our room, we found chocolate-covered strawberries and our bed turned down for a relaxing evening. The breakfast on Sunday in the casual restaurant offered menu items and a buffet choice. The buffet offered assorted breads, waffles, pancakes, eggs benedict, bacon, eggs,etc. I would have preferred a good egg white omelet. On Monday morning we ordered off the menu, because the offered a Continental Breakfast Buffet. The Cuban Omelet was great. The food is great and expensive compared to hotels where I normally stay. We walked across the bridge to another hotel to compare prices and decided we would rather eat at our hotel. The pool and service was great. We ordered Mojitos and shrimp wraps that were very tasty. We had Kobe beef burgers for dinner in the casual dining restaurant. I have not figured out the beach without being able to go into the water, but I enjoyed a swing or two in the hammock. There's cabanas, and lounge chairs available for guest, as well. Despite losing a small bag between South Beach and Mandarin Oriental, I had such a great time that I didn't worry that the bag was missing. The bag was not found but the clerk took my info in case someone found it. Can you believe that I order lunch to go? The homemade chocolate from the restaurant went on to South Beach with me, too.

It made our stay in Miami, so much we ended our trip there as well. The hotel was simply fantastic, very relaxing and not at all corporate to the level you may think, it's not south beach, but if you want a few days in fab surroundings in a relaxed chilled out stay this place is fantastic. We stayed for 5 nights at the start and 2 at the end. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms are lovely. We had 2 rooms with balconies facing the water and it was a fab view, particularly at night to see the city lit up. The location may not suit all as its on the edge of the financial distriict so its a 15 min drive to key biscayne or 20 mins to south beach, but if you want tthe benefits of Miami on your door and a 5 star hotel this is a very good choice. The hotel sits on a small island with 3 or 4 residential expensive condo buildings, there is a 1.5 mile running track around the island/hotel. MO its own artificial beach which is actually very good, but its not a beach where you'll find jet skis on it etc. However if you want a view of the water and sand beneath your feet then its a very relaxing place to soak up the sun and makes a nice change from sitting at a pool. The MO pool is an ok size but its not huge, the restaurants were very good indeed for both breakfast and for Azul for dinner. We had room service a couple of evening and one evening it wasn't particularly good, one of my party wasn't well the next day, however the management dealt with this very quickly indeed and could not have resolved my compliant any better. As we came to the end of out stay we cancelled where we had intended to stay and came back here for the last 2 days of our stay. Summary: Great city/water hotel Fantastic water views Good location but you will need to take taxi's or car hire for trips further a field to south beach etc Very relaxing Nice pool Not for those who want to stay in South Beach type location, with large hotels with extensive pool complexs etc Fantastic rooms Good management Overall great experience Easily recommend to others", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cHotel is great, Spa is NOT!\u201d", "Author": "Muccimooch", "ReviewID": "UR85631890", "Content": "I live in Miami and stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for a weekend this summer to experience the spa and feel like a \"tourist\".

There is NO whirlpool. Let me repeat...there is NO whirlpool. I could not believe that the hotel touted themselves as having a 5-star spa, because this was a 1.5 at best. I discussed this with my massage therapist, and he told me that EVERYONE who comes to the spa complains about it. He also told me that the spa was just about to be renovated, and I just checked the website, and it says that they spa is undergoing renovations. My opinion is, unless they are going to knock down some walls and create about 20,000 more feet of space, then the place is still going to be like walking into a basement closet.

If you are coming to Miami for the nightlife you may want to stay somewhere alittle closer. The grounds are really nice and the entire place has a very peaceful oriental feel to it. Both of the restaurants in the hotel are really good, and the MO bar makes one of the best Mojitos I've had. The pool and private \"beach\" are awesome and feature great skyline views across the water. The staff is among the friendliest and most accomodating of any hotel I have stayed at thus far. The little things (like leaving cold water in your cup holder when they bring your car around) really made a difference. The concierge also opened the gift shop up for me at 11pm and brought me a pair of black socks (because I failed to pack mine like I always do)... The rooms are excellent, and very simple.

The Mary Brickell shopping area is well within walking distance, as are several wonderful restaurtants locally within a few blocks away. I found the staff to be warm and friendly to myself and very helpfull even though I may not be a demanding guest. The rooms are clean and elegantly appointed and of a fair size.

I requested a room with an bay view and was told that it would be a $25 surcharge. She must have read the expression on my face and quickly disappeared coming back 2 minutes later to proudly tell me that the manager comped it for me. Bless her but if I were at the Ritz Carlton I'd been given a suite without ever asking. When we entered the room i found that the balcony the so much spoke about could only seat one person. My wife called the front desk and managed to movevus to a different room. All was fine until 1:00 am when a group of South American teenagers on the next floor had their music so loud that the walls were vibrating. It took half hour to get that under control but it was the same story the following night. The conference room the next day way uncomfortably warm before 25 people entered it. The thermostat could only be operated by engineering which took half hour to show and an hour to cool the room. The restaurants were marginal, not terribly clean and the staff left a lot to be desired. To top it off, while attempting to have a quiet breakfast on the terrace on a Saturday morning, there were workmen running power tools nearby. That on top of the boom box through the night was a bit much. At 1:00 pm web thought we'd take a break by the pool. No space was available and there was water spilling from the pool all over the deck. Again if this were the Ritz, ten attendants would be working on the problem. We went to their \"beach club\" which is a half acre of man made beach withnnice lounge chairs and 4 cabanas. It was mostly empty. I asked for an umbrella but could not have one because it was broken. The other two were in use. Are you serious? All 4 cabanas were empty and available. I asked, and was told that I can have one for $150 for half day ($250 full day) but that includes a fruit platter and two bottles of water. I thought of offering $50 sans fruit and water but I knew the answer. Mercifully it started to rain and we left. This is almost comical and could be enjoyable if it were not the Mandarin. We later went by the pool and managed to get two chairs under an umbrella. Within 10 min a South Florida rain storm was passing over and we were thoroughly enjoying it under the umbrella, when the pool staff lowered the umbrella exposing us to the rain. I asked why, he said he had to. Who runs this joke of a place? But it is, so I have no sense of humor left.

We asked them to file a report with the police, which they agreed to. 15 minutes later, a security guard came to our room to have us fill out a report and asked us if we wanted to call the police. Confused because I thought this had already been done, I said yes and that we already made the request. 30 minutes later, I called security to see if there were any updates; the man said no but asked if wanted to file a report with the police. At this point, I could see we were getting nowhere - clearly the staff was not communicating with each other. Half an hour after this (at this point about 1 1/2 hours after we made our first report), I decided to call the manager - it was then that I realized that I had not received one call or visit from the manager since we reported this incident. I explained the situation to her, and her response was that she thought only our sunglasses were stolen. More miscommunication. We had the police called and when they arrived, they said that the hotel staff had informed them that stuff was stolen out of our room. It was at this point I became very frustrated. Clearly, no one was talking to each other, the manager seemed to care less about what was going on, and even the police seemed shocked at the hotel's reaction. The entire thing was handled so poorly, my husband and I decided to go to the Four Seasons. The only resolution the manager on duty offered us was to comp our $25 lunch and drinks at the bar. Um, thanks, I guess? The only hotel employee who even offered an apology was the receptionist at check out. This whole issue is not about what was stolen - it's about service. An employee should be on site at all times. The manager told me it is okay for them to go back and forth to the pool area, leaving the \"private\" beach unattended. Had an employee been there, non-hotel guests would not have walked in and stolen our stuff. Besides, why isn't an employee on site during the hours of operation in case a guest wants a towel, drinks or food? I believe the hotel should put a sign up informing guests that employees are not always present and inform the employees themselves not to tell guests that leaving their stuff on the beach is \"no problem\". Don't get me wrong - the hotel itself is fine and Azul is a great restaurant. I'm just shocked at how this was handled, when a simple call from the manager and basic communication skills would have sufficed.

The property itself, which is located on a private island, is lovely, as are the rooms. However, the service is not nearly up to the standards that one would expect at a hotel of this caliber. On our second day at the property, we were enjoying the beach club, which is theoretically private for hotel guests only. We had ordered lunch, but it started to rain so we decided to eat our lunch by the pool, which was covered. Before we left, we let the staff member at the beach know that we were going to leave to eat, but would be returning shortly and consequently were going to leave our beach bag at our seats. She indicated that this was fine, and we proceeded to enjoy our lunch. However, when we returned, there were no staff members on the beach and our beach bag (including an iPod and a Blackberry) were gone. Despite repeated attempts, it took approximately 15 minutes for any of the staff to pay any attention to our concerns. In fact, the waiter who had been helping us previously continued to close other guests' bar tabs even after we told him our items were missing. Eventually, security was called and it was determined based on conversations with other guests who had been at the beach that two individuals had taken our items while we were at lunch. While the mere fact that there were not staff members monitoring the supposedly private beach at all times would have been disappointing, we do understand that things happen. However, it was the hotel's subsequent response that was truly galling. At no point did the hotel apologize or take any responsibility for the incident, nor make any attempts to make the situation right, and at one point the manager on duty even essentially told my wife that it was our fault for leaving our items unattended. Had the hotel responded appropriately (or even politely) we could have salvaged what remained of our stay and even left with a more positive impression of the service, but the utter indifference of the response was so shocking that it caused us to cut short our stay. We left the Mandarin and moved down the street to the Four Seasons, which was spectacular from a service perspective and even repeatedly apologized for our experience at the Mandarin. Overall, with the ample number of luxury hotels in Miami, including the Four Seasons down the street, there is no reason to stay at the Mandarin Oriental, and, in light of our experience, I am highly doubtful that I will stay at a Mandarin property anywhere else either.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA solid five star hotel experience\u201d", "Author": "Fun_Fily", "ReviewID": "UR70406220", "Content": "Very much enjoyed their great service and friendliness of hotel staff.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cCool hotel with a 90's modern feel\u201d", "Author": "eaglebac", "ReviewID": "UR70328929", "Content": "I enjoyed this hotel.

Our family booked with AMEX so we had the added benefits of a $100 spa credit, $200 resort credit, breakfast for 2 every morning and a 4pm checkout. We had 6 people so we had to book two rooms. I thought about booking us on South Beach but with these benefits, I decided to try out this hotel. It is located on a little island but it is not far away from shopping and restaurants. Bayside Marketplace is about a 5 min drive from here. We were greeted very nicely by the valet and bellhop. Checking in went smoothly. They showed us to the elevators. Pros: Rooms were what you'd expect from the Mandarin Oriental. We were upgraded to a Deluxe Skyline view and were able to see the city and the bay! Amazing view! There is a table and two chairs out there for those who want to sit there and enjoy the view. Could see the pool and the little beach from our balcony. Had breakfast at Cafe Sambul the next morning. Very delicious breakfast! We bypassed the all you can eat continental breakfast and ordered something off the menu. Prices are not cheap though. My mixed berry juice was $6. That morning we had 5 and our bill was about $135 total including service charge. I wouldn't normally pay this much for breakfast but we had the free breakfast credit and the resort credit to use. I really like the lobby. They burn incense inside so there is a light smell. I loved it though. Cons: There were somethings I didn't like however but it didn't ruin my overall experience. In the room, the bathroom and the main room are open. Meaning you can totally see in. However there is a blind you can pull down for some privacy. However that doesn't mean you can't hear what's going on. I'm sure it's fine for couples and families but if you're not too comfy with your roommate, it might be weird. In the room we were provided with one umbrella. We had two rooms so we had two umbrellas. However we had six people total. One day we went out and it was raining. We just needed one more umbrella and would just have two people per umbrella. We went to the front desk to ask and the lady said we were only allowed one umbrella per room and could not give another!!! Unbelievable. The rooms are $500+ a night and we just asked for an extra umbrella to borrow for the day. Surely they can afford umbrellas. I was disappointed. This class of hotel seems to go out if its way for the guests but in this instance, I don't understand what's the big deal with just one more umbrella. Also like many have said on here, it's crazy to charge $15 for Wifi when the rooms and everything else inside the hotel costs so much. Valet parking is $34 per day for example. Budget hotels give away free Wifi. Don't understand why the expensive hotels need to charge when they're already making a lot of money from other areas. We never used the Wifi. Overall, our stay was nice. We slept well every night. Staff was friendly. Didn't get a chance to enjoy the spa. Food tasted nice even though it is pricey. Luckily we had the resort credit. Would I stay here again? If I'm just going with my girlfriend, we would look somewhere else cause of the price. But because my mom went and a family friend from overseas, sp we stayed somewhere nicer.

Neither of us had been on vacation in quite some time and so we wanted perfection and at Mandarin Oriental, Miami we got it. Arrival: From the moment we stepped out of our taxi, everything was absolute bliss. The charming staff treated us like royalty, they learned our names, and made themselves available at any moment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith a sincere smile. The lobby has fantastic views and smelled incredible\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI was told it was some jasmine incense, I don't usually like incense, but this was instantly relaxing and therapeutic. We had arrived approximately an hour before check-in, which was not a problem as they upgraded us to an available room for free. After being brought some delicious peach tea blend, we were shown our room. Room: Our room was stunning. Plenty of space, quality furnishings, very comfortable bedding; it also had a unique layout where the bathroom opens up to the rest of the space\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyes; the water closet is still separate. The vibe was very romantic\u00e2\u20ac\u201drelaxing and exciting. The huge flat screen television and ipod/iphone dock with a Denon sound system were nice bonuses. We used that iPod dock nearly the entire time, but when we didn't, the hotel was dead quiet\u00e2\u20ac\u201das if we were the only ones there. The view from the 18th floor was surreal\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe entire downtown Miami skyline. I did have one serious issue with the room\u00e2\u20ac\u201dNo HDTV. A 40\"+ flat screen television looks pretty bad without a high definition signal. I noticed there could have been more counter space in the bathroom. Leisure by day: While I had planned several day trips and nights/dinners out, after being at the hotel for only a few hours we had little interest in leaving. We spent our 5 days and 4 nights almost exclusively at the hotel. By day, we split time between the infinity pool and the hotel's private beach along the bay. The pool was clean and very refreshing. I did not understand how they overlooked the pool nets and floatation devices on the fence that interrupt the view\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut at this point I was being very picky. The private beach was like stepping into another world\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlaying out on daybeds over white sand in the middle of a gorgeous city skyline. The staff, as always was very attentive to us. When my girlfriend would mention to me she was thirsty, seemingly out of thin air was a staff member with ice water. When I would start to sweat, someone was there with a eucalyptus-scented cold washcloth. The drinks were a little too sweet for my taste, so I asked them to make them a little bit stronger\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfrom then on we never had to ask again. Being a hotel guest you can use the spa facilities any time for free\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtake advantage! Steam room, sauna, oversized towels, plush robes\u00e2\u20ac\u201da great way to relax pre-flight as we did! We got a couples massage. While I get intense bodywork once a week\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI had never been so relaxed as I was after our couples massage. It was pricey, perhaps a little over-the-top for my budget and the changing room was a bit small, but a nice way to spend a cloudy afternoon. I would highly recommend a day at South Beach. The water, the sun and the people are beautiful. The concierge gave us directions for a great drop-off location close to the best shopping and dining in the area. By night: At night we would sit out above the pool area in the chic M-Bar; watching the distant thunderstorms, listening to the sounds of the rolling palm trees, enjoying the warm Miami breeze, sipping from one of the hundreds of cocktail offerings. The server at M-bar found out I had been to their Riviera Maya property and had a special drink he concocted for that menu. Ask for the Riviera Maya! We utilized room service every night to some degree. Yes, it is expensive\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut not unreasonable. Our meals, the presentation and the friendly staff delighted us. The hotel is a bit secluded\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso late at night room service is the only option unless you want to walk about 15 minutes. I believe all the food is served from Cafe Sambal (one of the two restaurants on-site). The Pad Thai is incredible (best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had), and we couldn't get enough of their Sushi. The Sushi is perhaps the best 'value' on the entire menu\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfresh, flavorful and delightfully presented. We spent our final night at the hotel's signature restaurant, Azul, which I have written a separate review for. You cannot stay at the Mandarin Oriental, Miami without spending a night dining at this restaurant! I could not have asked for a better vacation. I realize that this review lacks much negative criticism\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut it is simply a difficult resort/hotel to find fault with. Yes, all this luxury, pampering and decadence, comes with a hefty price\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe left feeling like we received an excellent value. We sacrificed a couple nights stay somewhere else to afford what we had at Mandarin Oriental, Miami\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut it was well worth it.", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Cayman", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel - true 5* experience\u201d", "Author": "Mark2211", "ReviewID": "UR43712926", "Content": "We had a very enjoyable stay at the Mandarin.

For a luxury hotel, the pool/\"beach\" area looked pretty average. The pool was really small and there weren't many chairs around it. The \"beach\" area, which is just basically a giant sand pit with beds on it, was SO big, yet the pool and pool are was SO small. My husband and i were really underwhelmed and based solely off of that, since relaxing outside was our sole purpose for going to Miami, we decided to move over to South Beach and stay in a hotel on the beach. I dont want to comment on the food or service or anything else. Im sure it is all up to par with the Mandarin chain and we had a fine experience with the service, the short time we were there, but it just seems weird to go to Miami and not be near the ocean. In the end, I think that this hotel should have an amazing, palatial pool that is up to par with the mandarin name and it just isn't.

We were there for 3 nights. Room\u00e2\u20ac\u201dWe specifically asked for a room without a connecting door, was assured at check in that the room we were assigned didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one, and when we got there, there was the door AND a card addressed to another guest with a plate of chocolates for that guest. A bit bizarre---did we get someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room? Why was there a connecting door when they were so confident there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t? We called down and they changed the room, and our bellman handled it all with ease, but it delayed our getting comfortable/settling in. The room was beautiful, beds comfy, and quiet. In terms of the room layout, the only concern, although it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem for us, is that there is a large opening between the bathroom (sink/shower/tub) and the bedroom (toilet was enclosed in its own area). They had a shade that could come down, but if you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t with your spouse, it may be a little strange to hear someone in there showering and using the sink. Turn down service was excellent. Staff---friendly, helpful, welcoming. Beach---So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd beach but a large man-made sanded area on the intercoastal--- there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of sand to feel like a beach, but you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go in the water. But it met our need to lie out in the sun, the big beds are wonderful. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appeal to children. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located on the major thoroughfare for boats leaving the harbor. Nice to see the boats, big and small, go by, but there was a frequent smell of fuel. There was a lack of service on the beach---all 3 days there was no one there to set us up and we needed to go back to the pool to get someone. We were never approached on the beach to see if we needed water/drinks/food. Obviously this was not the level of service we expected or have experienced at other hotels at this level. Restaurants---All food was wonderful. The sushi in particular was stellar. Because this is a very international hotel, we were one of the few tables speaking English at any meal---this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem, but may be for those used to a more American atmosphere. Wine list seemed to be limited with a focus on California and European wines. The only white we drink are Sauvignon Blancs from New Zealand, but there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even one on the menu. A short walk over the bridge brings you to a few nice restaurants (we went to Rosa Mexicana---excellent margaritas and guacamole). Azure was great. Pool---we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend any time at the pool. It was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intimate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (small) and not what you would expect from a resort. There was constant music there, which we found irritating. This seems to be a bad trend at many even high-end resorts---it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that everyone at the pool likes the same music, and most people travel with iPods these days, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an irritating waste. Fitness Center---was well equipped for weight lifting, which is what we wanted. Spa--- I usually get a massage twice per month at home, so I am always interested in the quality at a high end hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spa. I got a 50 minute massage and it was just OK; she seemed to spend a lot of time on pressure points, not really massaging. They went on to me that they just got some elevated rating for spas but I found that the common areas were new, but not unusual or anything special (common sauna and steam room, two showers that had a curtain, not really private. The one I was in wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean and had a draining problem). I was not invited to use the shower in the massage room. Overall---A mixed bag, what was positive was great.

Having spent 30 nights there over the course of the past 3 years, the Mandarin is my favorite. The main drawback as most people familiar with Miami know is that the hotel does not have a real beach. Also, the pool is a little small. Other than those two things, the hotel is excellent. The staff are very good. Very helpful and friendly. While the staff at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Sambal are quite good, they can try to be a little more proactive. For example, at breakfast they see me carrying several plates from the buffet back to my table for my kids and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t volunteer to help me, however, when I ask them they do it very eagerly. At breakfast (especially during holidays) it gets crowded and the service can be slow and a little frustrating. The room service menu is VERY limited after 11pm. They are in the process of upgrading the AV equipment and during my most recent stay the equipment in the connecting room for my kids was upgraded but not in the suite. The SPA is AMAZING one of the best in the world. The ambiance is very relaxed. One of the things I look for in a spa is a separate locker/shower from the gym and the pool and at the Mandarin spa the facilities are top notch. They have a large number of treatment room and therapists on hand so getting an appointment is not a challenge. Even though it does not have a real beach its is on a small key/island and is very well integrated with the surroundings. There is a very pleasant walkway circling the island and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good 30 min walk. There is a small park with kids playground that the island residents use and my kids love going there. The concierge were very helpful in making my arrangements but they really put a big surcharge on transport and car hire. The hotel has an amazing lobby with breathtaking views of the ocean and the Miami skyline. During prior stays it was very lively with good food and beverage service and live entertainment (afternoon/evening), however, during my most recent stay I hardly noticed any live entertainment or food service.

Front Desk left a lot to be desired, especially considering the usual standards of Mandarin Hotels. We asked on numerous occassions that the luggage needed to be brought up, but time and after time they forgot and we had to call and ask again.

True the hotel is a spectacular building in a fabulous location however the moment you enter you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but feel that something is missing. The entrance lobby is has floor to ceiling glazing which offers fantastic views across the bay but little else. The large open space doubles as the hotel bar which lacks any kind of atmosphere, that been said, the rooms are large and very comfortable with fantastic bathrooms and great views from the balcony. The pool area is small and the pool (almost an infinity pool) is not heated and is consequently pretty cold. Incidentally the comments from other tripadvisor reports is unfortunately inaccurate, the service around the pool area is not just poor its pretty much non-existent. On all but one occasion I had to make up my own sun lounger and get my own drinks from the bar, my only comfort was the fact that this was the case for most pool users, unless they happened to look like a movie star or a model. With the exception of a couple of the valet parking guys I would best describe the Mandarin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff as being aloof and unhelpful. There are on two restaurants plus pool caf\u00c3\u00a9 at the Mandarin which given the fact that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located on an island and a good walk 10 min walk from alternatives, means that choice is strictly limited. Despite this fact the food is very good, expensive but very good. I would strongly advise making a reservation at the Azul restaurant as this does get very busy especially over the weekend. A great alternative to the hotel restaurants is the Island Market Place, a small super market / deli that serve good coffee and hot food as well as some fantastic sandwiches. The Island market place is a short walk form the hotel towards the centre of Brickell Key \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would urge you to try it. On a number of occasions I found myself being disappointed by the Mandarin. These disappointments largely relating to the fact that I felt I was being exploited. For example; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms or complimentary drinks in the lobby which means if you fancy a drink you have to pay $7 for a coffee from the restaurant. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Distilled water was placed in the rooms however if you wanted spring water it was in the mini bar and was chargeable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c penny pinching! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Internet access was charged at $15 a day. I would expect the above to be complimentary in any half-descent hotel, but for some reason the Mandarin considers itself to be far too superior to offer these amenities to its guests. The Mandarin Oriental Miami could be a fantastic hotel it has a great location and has good rooms however the attitude of the hotel staff really lets this place down.

Obviously the Mandarin needs to sound proof it's rooms, as should most hotels. Service around the pool is terrible. If you can get the attention of a waiting person, they will often nod their heads and say yes, they'll get your order - and then it doesn't appear. Some friends of ours arrived and wanted a drink above the pool, and had all manner of problems getting served there, including being ignored. When eventually they got a drink the champagne was served in a plastic glass, even though they were well away from the pool. Not good. Other than that, it was a delight to be able to go to see Lauran Childs' art studio again in South Beach (www.MiamiArt.biz). One evening we went there and bought a couple more paintings, then went on to Prime 112, which had wonderful food, of course. Service in the Mandarin is slow and often inefficient - for example room orders were often not quite right, although I might specify, for example, that I want warm milk with my coffee, then cold milk would arrive.

The people in the lobby were helpful (although a little too helpful wanting to take your luggage for the tip). We checked into our room and it was beautiful - the bathroom especially. There was an opening between the room and window that could be closed with a shade. A glass shower, tub and bathroom closet. The not so good things - Pool is NOT what is pictured on their website. I was expecting a huge large pool, but it was really small. There weren't that many chairs, and if you didn't get there in time there was no room. Drinks were way overpriced. The private \"beach\" area they claim to have is just a small man made area of sand (no water to even go into) and some beds / chairs. Hotel is very far from everything else. Very few restaurants in walking distance and cabs were really expensive to get into the main part of Miami.

We found it difficult to get service at the pool or beach and the food was very slow in the restaurants. We also had to call three times to ask for help with our luggage. We ended up carrying all of our heavy bag ourselves. Not what one would expect at a 5 star hotel. The prices for food and amenities (not to mention the rooms) is astronomically high...and I'm comparring that to NYC. I also found it irritating that the service was already included with each check. That standard gives very little credit to the customer. I also think the hotel is too small. Granted it was New Year's weekend and one would expect a large crowd of families and europeans, but the pool was jammed packed all day as was the so called \"beach\". These areas are just far too small to accomodate the hotel sufficently. The service could not manage to take care of everyone' s needs and keep the place clean. The pool area is way to small. It was difficult to even walk past the pool without almost falling in. The beach area too - Guests would leave books and such on the beds early in the morning and then not show up to use the beds till the afternoon. Subsequently there were not even enough beach chairs for everyone that wanted to sit on the beach. Some these things are understandable and I am not that high maintenance of a travellot.

I especially liked the marble bathrooms! The beds were very easy on the back and the sheets and linens have thread count galore. Maid Service--One of the best parts of the hotel. Rooms are cleaned in a timely fashion and requests can be made with ease for both daily housekeeping and turn-down service. Who can resist the little orchid bud they leave on your bed each night? Restaurants--Quite tasty. Good Asian fusion and we like how grams of protein and calories are listed for several of the choices. Azul is quite upscale, but the cafe downstairs is simple and consistent. Public Spaces--I loved going down for coffee each morning at the coffee bar across from the front desk. The lobby is filled with light and the faint scent of something delicious always hung in the air. The tranquil music was also a good touch. Service--Yes, yes and yes! Miami is not known for its excellent service, but the Mandarin delivers here. Everyone is gracious and willing to work with you to get it done. Price--A bit tricky here. The hotel isn't cheap and the constant add-ons--from the morning coffee to the expensive lunches--added up fast, but it was worth it.... Interesting Side-Trip--Check out the Casa Casuarina, which was the Versace Mansion on South Beach. Now it is a private club and hotel. For $175 a person you can spend the day there through an agreement they have with the Mandarin. Yes, a bit pricey, but when else will you be able to swim in Versace's pool replete with gold tiles?

The hotel itself is situated on Biscayne Bay. I was fortunate to get a room facing the bay and took full advantage of the private balcony that comes standard with every room. (Have a room service breakfast on that balcony and you'll know what I mean) The room itself was done in rich mahogany and the bed was extremely comfortable and very sleepworthy. The bathrooms were superlative and done in marble. It was really a nice treat to sleep at night with the windows to the balcony open and the ocean breeze blowing in. In regard to items outside the room, the lounge on the lobby floor of the hotel was superb and as you would expect also provides great views of the bay. The pool scene is also top notch, but the wait service by the pool could have been more timely. There is a walking/jogging path that winds around the hotel and hugs the bay through some adjacent condo buildings. The only minor downside I would state is the ability to walk to anywhere notable from the hotel. Its location on the bay also puts it at almost a required taxi (especially given Miami's heat) to anywhere notable. But taxis are always available and immediately summoned by one of the valets. However, given that significant upside of the views based on the hotel's location, this would be a trade-off I would make anytime. In terms of security, this has to be one of the most secure hotels in which I have ever stayed. First the only reason you would be on the road to the hotel is to visit the hotel---so there is no drive-by traffic at all. In addition, there are security/concierge staff all over the lobby and curbside areas and they know what they are doing. For example, I went out for a run and exited through the back of the hotel but entered back in the front. I looked less than attractive upon my return, but the hotel staff opened all of the doors upon my arrival no questions asked. On the other hand, one of my clients who was dressed in a business suit who was not a guest at the hotel was questioned (in a subtle gracious way) if \"they could be of assistance\", which is hotel code for \"What the heck are you doing here?\" Finally and certainly not least is the staff. Absolutely first rate and ranks with the best I have ever experienced. Everyone at the ready to assist, with attentiveness that was both subtle and gracious. As an example, I walked up to the concierge and asked him to FedEx a golf club. (Do you know how hard it is to package a golf club?) Rather than the anticipated drill of filling out numerous forms and time taken for them to find materials, the concierge simply took the club, had me fill out the destination for the club and that was it!!

From start to finish the experience was dreamy. I had read that service could be iffy, that the pool was small and cramped, and that the bill might include extra charges. The pool was area was small and cramped (but the pool itself was empty), but the service was fantastic and the bill was correct. When we checked in we did not wait at all, and the very friendly man at the front desk (Raul) brought us up to our room, which had been upgraded to a junior suite with a huge balcony and a great bathroom. It's true that the bathroom (tub, sink, shower) are open to the bedroom with a screen that can be lowered, but the toilet is separate and has a door. We liked the unique design feature because it made the room feel even bigger (but then again, we got up at the same time as each other). The TV was old and had no movies (but we weren't there for that, so we did not mind.) Five minutes after we entered our room, just as we were cracking open some champagne, room service brought up a delicious birthday cake as a surprise! (There was also a box of chocolates, which I presume is always there.) Turn down service that night left us bottles of designer water as well. That night we ate at Azul, and the great service continued. (Another birthday surprise after dinner too!) The 2 sommeliers were attentive and helpful. The food was delicious - I particularly recommend the rainbow of oysters appetizer if it's still on the menu, ditto the salmon tartare and the surf and turf. The scotch selection was impressive. The scotch was brought along with a cup of ice each, so we could control how much ice we wanted - nice touch. The cheese selection, on the other hand, was weak. There were only 5 options, and 1 was out. Still, overall a fun, delicious experience. The next morning we ate at Cafe Sambal. The food was good, but exactly the same prices as room service - in other words, overpriced. It was a bit chilly in the morning and the maitre d' noticed I was cold and offered to bring me a wrap - another nice touch. The individual syrup was also warmed up - again, nice touch. The buffet did not look particularly appealing, so we ordered from the menu and were happy with what we received. We spent the day at the beach, enjoying the raised beds and hammocks. The attendants were great - not intrusive, but they did bring us water frequently. At the pool (where we went to each lunch and to swim a bit) the attendants provided ipods, magazines, water, mango sorbet, etc. For lunch we ate sushi which we found generally to be overpriced and not particularly appealing. After the beach we took advantage of the spa by booking a couple's suite for a few hours. As spa waiting areas go, I expected a bit more, but it was relaxing. There are two showers, which separate the sauna from the steam room. No jacuzzi. I would have preferred to have showers near the lockers & vanities. The 2 toilets were also separate from the lockers & the showers. The relaxation area itself was pleasant, although there was a guest snapping pictures, and talking on the phone! Anyway, the couple's suite massage treatments were delightful. We started out with rose petal foot treatments, while we watched dolphins dancing in the bay below. Next we chose to have sea salt exfoliation scrubs, then massages (aromatherapy & hot stone & swedish for me, deep tissue for him), then clay scalp massages. In between the salt exfoliation and the massages, the massage therapists exited the room so that we could shower (in the suite) and return clean to our massage tables. An absolute delight.

For my long weekend stay, was given a Bay View King room on a lower floor, which gave good 90% view over bay towards Miami Beach, and a decent sized terrace with loungers. Room was asian-infludenced in style and consisted of large room with separate bathroom with a bath and a shower. Room amenities were a bit sparse for a 5-star room (standard shower kit, etc.) with no handy extras (razor, ear-cleaners, etc). Also the TV only had standard cable channels (plus a couple of premium movie channels) but no pay-per-view. Pool and outdoor area are small and slightly cramped - we visited during half-full weekend and by 10am all the beach chairs were full and packed in like sardines. The beach-area, outside gate across path, with a few cabanas and beach-beds, is much better - it gives you a better view, is quieter and you have more space and sand between your feet. Pool menu is asian-based and while not extensive was of a good quality. Breakfast at Cafe Sambal is a good option - an extensive menu at decent prices and there's both inside and terrace tables - note: the outdoor tables get very busy and the queue one morning was 30 mins. The 2 main bars at the Mandarin (Lobby and Bar M) are small and disappointing and should be avoided for all but an emergency last-minute drink. Service was impeccable at all times - e.g. lady delivering breakfast set up the table on the terrace at our request, and upon spilling a few drops of milk on the table, came back 5 minutes later with more milk and a few extra pastries.

You can't get access to the ocean from here, but the view is relaxing and they do a nice job pampering the guests. Pool: smallish pool with lots of chairs packed in. We opted to hang at the \"beach\" instead but the pool area was very popular. Service: The only down side. Although room service is very quick, the front desk staff is not up to the same level. We had to call down several times to report that our neighbor was smoking a pipe in his room (we were on a non-smoking floor) and the smell was coming into our room via the balconies.

I saw for exemple many daybeds reserved for an entire day without anybody on them...and some clients could not enjoy the beach, ridiculous !

Room service will charge you even a glass of milk for your baby (10 US $) if you don't make complaints to the manager. Service at the Cafe Sambal for breakfast is very good and the buffet too. Sushis are very expensive (almost 100 US $) for one party ! There's a very good market on the island where you can eat or buy food and drinks. Read carefully each line of your check when you checkout, they tried to put 1500 US $ not due (like valet parking, mini bar, ...)

The gym is OUTSTANDING. The Spa is luxurious (expensive, but worth it in our opinion). The bedding was extremely comfortable. And, the service was very, very good. However, the food was not perfect: The casual restaurant is nice -- not great -- but nice. \"Azul\" (the fancier restaurant) is above average... not excellent (we actually bellied up to the bar and had the very knowledgeable bar tender wait on us one night, which was the highlight of our Mandarin dining experience for the weekend). The pool-side bar/restaurant is below average, which is consistant with the pool in general....which is why we give this hotel a rating of \"above average\", instead of excellent. If you are looking for a beautiful, spacious pool with wonderful pool-side service, this is NOT the place for you. The pool is almost laughable, so it was a good thing we weren't banking on that for the perfect vacation. For the size of this hotel, they should have a pool that's triple the size with five times more lounge chairs. As well, if you are looking for onsight consistant dining options, this probably isn't for you either. We ended up hiring a car service to bring us to South Beach for dinner (which ended up being worth the 30-40 minute car ride). Bottom line -- if you want a hotel that has a really terrific spa, very nice service and a great gym, and you are ok with 'average' onsight dining options and a below average pool scene, this is a good option for you.

A waste of money. Stay somewhere else. My stay was a huge disappointment to my sister and me. We were staying for 5 days. Already at the check-in they assigned us to wrong room. We had booked a deluxe twin bedded room. And we got a king bedded room, but had to change it into a twin bedded room, which they managed to do - after a long wait!! Further on, there were not much deluxe over the room. On the positive side the room was large and had a nice balcony. But it had only very basic things; like an old fashioned television, a cordless telephone (which did not work) and a radio. There were no dvd/cd-player in the room. No international plugs. Nothing extra at all!!! The beds were fine and good size (but I have experienced better beds). But lightening in the room were terrible, no bedside reading lights, and so on. Also, terrible bathroom solution...I mean the bathroom in itself was beautiful, but only thing that seperated the bathroom from the bedroom was a single, thin and sliding screen. So it was impossible to have an early morning shower without waking up my sister. Cause all the bathroom noise goes out to the bedroom. Not very smart solution!!! I prefer privacy when I am in the bathroom and beside this stupid screen there were no locks on the bathroom doors.... The housekeeping in this hotels are the worst ever housekeeping I have experienced in any hotel. And it is such a shame that a hotel like Mandarin Oriental offer so poor service to their guests. The second day there were no towels provided, the third day there were no toiletries provided, the fourth day there were no water provided, and the fifth day there were no newspaper provided. I had to call for everything. This is not up to the reputation of the Mandarin Oriental. The business center was nice, but kinda pathetic that they charge you for using the internet there. I think it was 6 USD per 15 minutes, which is very expensive. Food was so-so. Tried the food at the beachside \"restaurant\" and in the Sambal Cafe. The sandwich at the beachside \"restaurant\" was very plain and tasteless, but the lunch in the Sambal Cafe was quite good. A nice feature on turndown service is that the hotel provides complimentary water from Voss. The onsite spa and pool was very nice, and the best thing about this hotel, I think. The service here is very slow and extremely inefficient. It took them like 30 minutes to get some towels to my room. The doormen outside are more busy talking private stuff, than opening the doors for the guests, you have to stand in line to talk to someone the front desk (which is unusual for a MO-hotel), the concierge is good (when he is actually on his desk). I also find some of the employees to have attitude-issues, which is not proper for a 5-star property. The concierge for example was kinda unpatient and rude when I wanted to ask about the limo-service. And an evening in the pool I was approached by a member of the security staff, and he told me in a very rude way: \"You have 10 minutes to leave the pool\", I think it is kinda rude to talk like this to guests. Where are the humble hospitality?? I was told at the check-in by the manager on-duty that I the pool was official closed at 9 pm, but I could use the pool at my own convenience after this. So, I did at 11 pm. And then this happened. I tried to explain to this guy that I was told something else by the front desk. But he told me something else, and that I had to get out of the pool. I think this guy was very rude, and it is incredible that this can happen. All this made me very angry. I also notified the front-desk about the phone in my room was out of order. They said they would send someone up to look at it right away. But it never happened. I think I reminded them about 4-5 times during my stay, but NOTHING happened. The location of this hotel is depressing and out of nowhere. There is nothing to do there. You better have a car, or prepare use taxi every time you want to go somewhere. You can still walk downtown or to Bayside shopping, which is 25-30 minutes walk away. This was my first visit to Miami, and next time I go to Miami I would rather stay in South Beach/Miami Beach area (Delano Hotel/Setai/Loews Miami Beach Hotel), cause there you will find the points of interests. There is nothing to do downtown, and there are no good shopping options around (except Bayside). You have to go up North Miami or down South Miami or to Miami Beach:) I think this hotel are on a very wrong course, and that the management should be replaced. This is far by the worst 5-star hotel I have ever stayed in, and it is incredible that this can be a member of the MO-chain. Well, I will never return to this hotel. I'd better stick to Four Seasons Miami - which is a beautiful and a serious hotel. Great service at the FS too!!

Problems started upon check-in - I explained that I wanted high floor, quiet and great views of sunrise - as was off-season was offered upgrade to junior suite for slightly higher rate, accepted, went to room and realized it was handicapped accessible and for some reason had a crib in it, and the only views were of the skyline! They found me another room - not a jr suite - but said could see sunrise and had good views. Next morning, I realized the sun was rising on the other side of the hotel!

When got to desk, manager apologized about all issues and said she had upgraded me to best suite in hotel and could stay for my remaining two nights at current rate. The suite was amazing. They did not have to upgrade to this extent - I just wanted a room with no ants.

GOOD: Rooms - large, renovated, nice amenities. Manager - really trying with service, manager I spoke with seems very competent - hopefully she can get things turned around in service area - she was excellent. Food - good, quality as expected.

First, the island was riddled with mosquitos at the time. When we ate breakfast at Cafe Sambal, I was eaten alive. But the worst area was the man made beach. When we went down there, mosquitos swarmed around us to a horrific level (picture 6-8 on your body at once), and we turned around and ran back to the pool and jumped into the water for relief. I guess I would have thought they'd post a sign or something at least to warn patrons they were having this problem! The other issue is that instead of locking my purse up in my room while I went to the pool, I buried it in the bottom of my garment bag. The day before we checked out, coming home from the pool, I noticed my bag had been tampered with, but I didn't think anything of it.

Here's my review: Arrival: We arrived at 11 am on a Friday via cab from the airport (about $35 including tip). When we arrived, the attendants were there to greet us and immediately took advantage to look at our luggage tags to identify our name and call us by name as they asked how our trip was (pretty classy). I don't know if the staff has a listing of the expected guests, but it's a nice touch. As we checked in, we were OK if the room wasn't ready. We could simply wait, hang out at the pool. Reception offered us a choice of rooms, so we decided to take a room we could get in immediately. An attendant was immediately available to take our luggage and take us to our room. Room: We had a city view with balcony on the 11th floor. The bed was very comfortable. The attendant introduced us to all the amenties of the room as well as telling us to use the direct connection to the internet. He retrieved ice for us and insisted we call them if we needed anything. The room overlooked Brickell Key Bridge. It was nice enough view of the city and partial bay. We weren't concerned about the view as much as the relaxation aspect of the hotel. We put on our suits and headed down to the pool Pool: The pool area is small. I was surprised by how small the area was. They had nice 70's 80's music playing around the pool. It wasn't obnoxious, but occassionally the blender would override the music. They offer complimentary ipods, lotions, cd players, water, sorbet, so you really won't need to want for anything. We would have liked to ordered some drinks, but our attendant never asked if we needed anything for the 2 hours we were there. She simply continued to walk by us. (I'll get back to this later). The menu at the pool has some unique drinks. The primary food served is sushi and it was great. They also have sandwiches and some salads, but nothing like chips/salsa, nachos, or any mexican flair. It is primarily a sushi bar with nice salad presentations, which I believe is perfect for the setting. The \"manmade\" beach is nice, but there are several boats that patrol in and out of the bay area. May get a little annoying, but with an ipod, who cares. An attendant can help get you set up for your own private bed to catch the rays, but in the heat of August, it's nice to have the pool nearby. Recreation: The excersize room is mainly for cardio. They have some free weights and some other life fitness machines. It's true you can watch t.v. while you're doing cardio. They provide some fruit and water for your pleasure during your workout. I would have liked to have a few more \"weight machines\", but my workout was just fine. They also have a great little outside walk that runs around Brickell Island that is nice to run. It's a little over a mile, but a great running/walking track. Attendants in the work out area didn't smother or bother you. Depends on what you're looking for. There is a small playground for children, but other than that, there is nothing for them to do. This hotel DOES NOT cater to families. It is designed to be an oasis for the business or weekend travelers. Room: Room was nice. Comfortable bed with lots of pillows. The attendant was very good. They had pull down service at night. There was a little switch you could push if you wanted or didn't want them to make up the room each day or night. Issues: I was surprised to see that the television did not offer movies as an option. The television was your basic television. Someone mentioned the bathroom shower door being an issue, we found that as well. Water would fall off the door onto the floor causing a slippery service. Neither of these were of particuliar concern to us. Room was pretty much what you see on the website. Restaurants: We didn't do Azul's, but we did eat at Cafe Samba. Service was a bit slow but breakfast was good. We didn't do the buffet. We ordered ala cart. We decided to venture out for dinners. We chose Duo on South Miami, a small restaurant with a nice \"brazillian\" environment. They offered a variety of foods from seafood, to steak, to lamp, to pork, to duck. The salmon and steak were delicious. I would highly recommend this. We walked BACK from to the hotel after dinner, about 6 blocks. Tab for 2 including drinks $122. The following night we ate at Mortons, about 4 blocks from the hotel. Mortons, is Mortons. I believe I would prefer Duo's. It's nice to walk the streets of Downtown Miami back to the hotel. There's a nice breeze along the bridge back to the Oriental. Issues: We had some issues at the pool. The servers aren't very open to asking you for orders, similar to what you may have at a restaurant. They pretty much leave you alone until you tell them you need something. Some people may like this, but when you can't get one to stop by and offer anything, it's an issue that I raised with management which they addressed and made sure they met with me before leaving. On Sunday, it seemed like family day at the pool. It may have been a layover hotel for the day for these families, but kids were all over the place, the lobby, the pool, the restaurants. These families basically took over the pool and made things very loud. I have 4 kids of my own, but if they get too loud, and they are bothering other people trying to relax, I say something to them. These families didn't do that, so we eventually left and went back to the room. Would we stay there again? Maybe. I think we would try the 4 Seasons or another more \"posh\" South Beach hotel.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westchester, New York", "Title": "\u201cCl;ose To Perfection !\u201d", "Author": "jwsmd3", "ReviewID": "UR5593522", "Content": "Why is it so rare to leave a hotel feeling as satisfied as I was with MOMi?

We left the Ritz early because of the poor service, small rooms and because the management was requiring guests to wear permanently attached orange vinyl type medical bracelets to access the pool and beach areas. We had American Express' Fine Resorts and Hotels program cancel the rest of the Ritz stay and move us to the Mandarin Oriental Miami. What a wonderful decision that ended up being!!!! The Mandarin Oriental Miami is just simply OUTSTANDING, they truly understand customer service, their 5 star rating is richly deserved. We were warmly greeted and treated as we entered the hotel. When we checked, in our room was upgraded to a Brickell Suite (via the AMEX Fine resorts program), they told us they had other rooms available if it was not to our liking. As the bellman took us to our room, he was careful to point out the fire exits on our floor, certainly a sign of a well managed hotel. One should note that on the higher floors that the fire escape path may actually lead across the exposed roof of the lower floors. The room was a joy to behold, bamboo flooring, a large living space with couches, chairs, TV, guest bathroom, desk and balcony. This was separated from the sleeping quarters by a very nice piece of cabinetry with sliding rice papered glass doors. The bedroom was equally huge with a wonderful feather bed, nice sound system, TV and balcony. The bedroom had direct access to the master bathroom with a free standing two person tub, dual sinks, and separate shower area. The entire bathroom was well finished with a nice Spanish marble. The bed was VERY nice with a soft feather top. The crib that was sent up to our room was just glorious, a wonderful chrome design lined with goose down, our daughter loved it. (certainly much nicer than the ratty wood thing the Ritz Carlton had) The lovely view from the room was of the bay and the Miami Skyline. My wife enjoyed the spa services. The Spa keeps an oriental motif, the lighting is low, the fragrances are earthy. The steam room and sauna are nice, the whirlpool is outside though, by the swimming pool. The showers in the spa come at you from all angles. The spa has a nice feeling to it, it certainly does not have an industrial feeling. The private island is nice too, there is a running path all the way around the island, a playground area for the kids, and a man made beach. Please note however that there is NO ocean access from the beach. If you want to swim in the ocean, go to the concierge and he/she can set you up with passes to one of the beach clubs in South Beach. The hotel pool is nice, but not huge, it does feature an infinity edge. Dining at hotel was also a treat, first we tried the Sanibel cafe, the food was interesting and the views were relaxing. I suggest trying the mildly hot banana ketchup, and the boneless beef ribs. The service was relaxed, but probably only rated 3.5 stars. The kid's menu was standard fare. The only negative thing I saw at the hotel occurred at the cafe, the sight of an anorexic european woman rubbing her pregnant belly before she lite up her cigarette was unpleasant enough to kill my appetite. We also had dinner the Hotel's 5 star restaurant, AZUL. It defiantly has earned its 5 stars. The food was interesting with a lean towards a seafood bent. The service was just truly gracious. The kids menu is shared with the cafe and again is standard fare and certainly not 5-star. In summary, almost every bit of service in this hotel is spot on perfect. They actually understand what service is, they don't just mimic it.

Private Beach was very nice as well. Though the real highlight of the MO was the view from our room. We booked a Deluxe Bay View ($330, great value, normally $500+) which had a spacious balcony overlooking Biscayne Bay with the city in the background. The city lights at night are spectacular! The room it self was unique and flawless. Loved the complementary truffles on arrival, very elegant. They also had complementary milk and cookies for my kids, nice touch. Bathroom was stunning, one of the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ever seen. My one complaint was the hotel's shampoo, definitely a man's shampoo, did not like the fragrance. Though I guess it is a man's business hotel after all. Azul was also a wonderful experience. In my opinion not overrated at all. I forget what we had for appetizers and entrees but it was some of the best food I'd had in a while. Had a very extensive wine list, definitely right on par with The Inn at Little Washington. I loved the $15 Vanilla souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with raspberry sauce, really hit the spot. The bill of our party of 4 (on child) was exactly $330.

They literally took 30 minutes to bring it and then both items were cold and weak. Cost $26 (on saying this, on departure we mentioned it and they very kindly discounted it from our final bill). *On leaving our room we turned the \"do not disturb\" light on.

There's also an easy jogging path around Key Brickell (about 1.3 miles) which the Mandarin gives a small map for. I've tried the Ritz Carlton in Miami as well with friends and I have to say I like them both equally but for different reasons. They are both high quality hotels well worth their 5 stars, but if you're looking for some privacy away from the crowds, then the Mandarin is a better bet. And yes, they brought me a lovely cake while I was away as well as received a lovely happy b-day message from their GM, Jorge Gonzales.

The room was beautiful with a view of the bay and had a large balcony. The bathroom was amazing; all marble with a stand-up shower, a bathtub for two and they provided the most wonderful bath products each day. We arrived quite late the first day, after midnight, and therefore ordered room service which was quite good and I didn't think badly priced ($15 for a huge chicken ceasar salad which we ended up sharing). We ate at Cafe Sambal every morning, the food and service was very good. Overall, the staff was wonderful, especially Carlos at the concierge desk, I cannot say enough good about him - he took care of all of our requests, some of which were a little extreme, with such ease and always with a smile. Everytime I picked up the phone for anything at all, I felt like someone was knocking on our door before I could hang up the receiver. Everywhere you go, the staff always stops to great you, from management all the way down the chain. The infinity pool was beautiful, get there early on the weekends before all of the chairs get taken though. The food / beverage service at the pool was a little spotty - we had to ask for a menu four times and wait 20 minutes for the waitress to finally come over. We ordered a cucumber - avocado roll and they forgot to roll the avocado in, when we brought that to their attention, they just put some chopped up avocado on top of the roll rather than roll a new one which was a little disappointing but in the scheme of things not a big deal at all. Our only complaint about our stay was when we had our final dinner at Azul, the only AAA 5 Diamond restaurant in all of Miami. We sat outside which I would not recommend unless it is a little cool because there is no air circulation at all. The food was wonderful, as a matter of fact it was the best meal we had down there and we consider ourseleves to have fairly sophisticated palates. The server who took care of us was, in the kindest word I can find, ATROCIOUS!!! We ate there on a Sunday evening and earlier in the day had brunch at the Biltmore where, anyone who has had the brunch there can tell you, you practically have to roll out of there you eat so much. Since we were not starving, we decided not to order an appetizer which our server clearly had a problem with, mind you this was right after we selected a $150 bottle of wine. Everytime we had a question about the menu, he had something obnoxious to say, for example when we were looking at the desert menu I asked what exactly the peach melba was, he responded with such attitude, \"It's peach!\" That was it for us and we made a complaint to the manager on duty and eventually followed up with the hotel General Manager the experience was so upsetting. Overall, we enjoyed the hotel very much but our experience at the restaurant always pops into my head when people ask about our mini vacation. We will definitely stay at the Mandarin Oriental again but we will NEVER eat at Azul again, there are so many wonderful resturants in Miami that will not treat you the way we were treated when you spend $300 on dinner so I suggest you spend your money elsewhere.", "Date": "August 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic... ,ade our honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3698205", "Content": "I cna not praise this hotel enough, the staff the quality of food, service, rooms, facilities.

Turns out they charge $10 for mixed drinks, ridiculous. Room service was also overpriced, 2 dishes of ice cream later in the evening came to $35. My wife is a diet coke addict so we had to purchase a few while there, they were $3.50 for one of those small 8 oz bottles.

We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental from 5/11-5/13/05. It was a hefty price to pay for the two nights but it was so worth it. As soon as we arrived our bags were taken away immediately. When you walk in to the Mandarin it smells like aromatherapy. The oriental music is very soothing to the ears. Right when we first walked in, we were on vacation. The Mandarin sits right on the bay so as your walking in all you see is water. Our room was not ready when we arrived b/c normal check in time is 3pm. So like kids in a candy store we looked around. The pool area was beautiful.. There is a pool side bar for all your beverages needed to relax. They also serve lunch poolside also. We decided to have lunch at Cafe Sambal. There were no outside tables available so we had to take a table indoors. The food was more like Japanese, Thai and Chinese I guess. I really didn't care, I was just hungry. The staff was very friendly. We did wait longer than normal for our food. When it finally came out it wasn't worth the $67.00 we paid for our tab. The tea was good though. We managed to finish lunch right b/f 3pm and our room was available. There was no wait on the elevators, very fast. The hallways are kept very dim. I guess that's a way to get you relaxed. Got in the room and awaited was complimentary chocolates and a welcome card. After being in the room less than 2 minutes the door bell rung. (Yes there is a door bell) It was our luggage. The linens were all in white. The furniture was white. The bathroom had an enormous soaking tub with a separate marble shower for two. The whole bathroom was marble. There are robes available and slippers. You can keep the slippers. The soaps and lotions given are not your average. All play a major part in smell. All aromatherapy! Yes! Finally a hotel that knows how to spoil you. We chose a Deluxe Skyline Bayview Room. Excellent choice. The view from the balcony was excellent. I couldn't submit all the pictures but you get the point. Let's see there's a turn down service with a lovely flower everynight. We did order room service and it was not that good. Don't order the Turkey BLT. The bread is as hard as a rock. It was $52.00. I wasn't impressed at all with the sandwich. Ladies.... The spa is out this world. I had a spa appointment at 5pm for a Luxury Facial and a 80 minute Swedish Massage. When you walk in to the spa the hallway is very dim. They ask you for your name and quickly seat you. As you wait they come and take your shoes and replace them with spa shoes. From there you are lead down a dim hallway with sounds of oriental music and water sounds. Very relaxing. Your given a keychain for a locker and you slip into a comfy robe. From there you go to a waiting room where you are greeted and asked if you would like tea or water. Again sounds of relaxing music and a water streaming down the wall. There are steam rooms also. I didn't wait that long b/f they called me. The massage was good. If you don't have deep muscle tension, I would not recommend the swedish massage. There is pain associated with this massage b/c it deals with pressure points. The facial was ok. I thought that there would be extractions. So if you get the luxury facial it does not come with extractions. You do get a neck, scalp and shoulder massage though. Oh did I mention that this hotel also has their own man made beach. It has many cabanas and hammocks to rest the day away. The breeze was amazing. On our final night we decided to eat at Azul. This resturant is also located inside the hotel. Very pricey but worth it. We noticed that a lot of people spoke spanish. The money was worth it . The attire is casual. You can not wear shorts in this restuarant. My husband made a mistake and wore shorts and the attendant privately asked him if he would change to pants. Check out was fast and easy. This hotel was so worth the money. I would stay here again. There were so many plus factors here. If we could have changed anything, we would have rented a car to see more of the city.

This is more of a business hotel than a resort hotel, but perfect for staying a couple of nights to see Miami. They have a great walking trail around the hotel.

The decor everywhere is simply breathtaking. I had a beautiful king sized bed, a nice sitting area and a glorious bathroom with wonderful Moulton Brown toiletries. The quiet of the rooms is remarkable. The terrace with its skyline views was a wonderful place to chill out as was the lovely pool and the artificial beach. I also appreciated the absolute calm of the place and the crowd that stays there. Since this was a business trip, I needed the services of the Business Center and everything was handled with great efficiency and, like everything else at the Mandarin, the service is first rate. Even the maid service is remarkable. It seemed done before I even came back from breakfast...which is particularly nice when you are using your room for work part of the day. The turndown service was equally well timed--although I must confess to having provided one maid with a fully Monte when she came into the room after a single bell ring. The food is good but pricey. I found dining outdoors on the terrace perferable to the somewhat noisy Cafe Sambal. The Martini Bar off the lobby is fun. The pool Sushi bar is a great place for lunch. And then there's the spa. A truly wonderful place where I had a treatment that was simply unbelievably good and incredibly expensive. But I would have to say worth it. Finally for the guy who groused about the lack of nightlife, there's the Friday night party at the Beach--now one of the hottest tickets in Miami. The night we were there the crowd was gorgeous, swaying to latin music and just a lot of fun to watch. As a hotel guest, you have instant entree to what is a undoubtedly one of THE weekly events in Miami. Now one other thing....South Beach has had it. I have seldom seen such a really dreadful looking crowd anywhere--a lot of Europeans enjoying their inflated Euros and dressed so badly....it was very sad to see. We were initially supposed to be there but I am so glad we had the luxe and the splendour of the Mandarin to look forward to. I'd go back in a shot...even if I were paying for it myself.", "Date": "March 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chevy Chase, MD", "Title": "\u201cMostly excellent, just a few negatives\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3253862", "Content": "Just returned from a 4 night stay--very pleased overall with the service, room (cheapest room still had a nice view of the Bay), breakfast was outstanding (full American breakfast was included in our rate booked on the hotel's web site).

There were several conferences going on at the hotel but it didn't seem to affect the service. Particularly impressed with the wait staff at the Cafe Sambal and the concierges. Now just a few small things I noticed: the furniture in the room looked a bit worn and cheap for a luxury hotel, although the bed was extremely comfortable with topnotch linens. The desk clerk at check out was very nice but there were a lot of mistakes on the bill--ie charges for breakfast that was included in the rate still appeared on the bill; minibar charges appeared and we did not even open the bar.

It felt luxurious walking into the lobby and seeing the great views of the bay and the skyline. My room was what I expected but I have to admit that the room size was not worth the price tag of $495 plus a night. Prices are high during this time due to peak season. I was welcomed with a greeting card and Joy of Life chocolates which were superb. The marble bathroom is fantastic and huge compared to most hotel bathrooms. I received the best service from the valet attendants, room service staff and maids. For example, I returned to my room while the maid was still there and I was going to go get some ice. The maid insisted on getting the ice for me and she did which was very nice. The valet attendants were very nice as well. The Front desk clerks were less attentive in their service. When I checked out, the front desk person didn't even ask how my stay was or if everything was met to my expectations. I also tried the Ayurvedic Holistic Body Treatment at the Spa in the Hotel and it was definately different than a regular swedish massage. I really enjoyed the spa lounge rooms with its sauna and steam room. The treatment room that I was in had it's own shower inside! I also ordered room service and the food was fine but nothing special. I would recommend getting the sorbet medley as a dessert since it was delicious with coconut, rasberry and mango. My stay was relaxing and very quiet. I never heard any noise from any of the rooms next to mine. The hotel is very close to all the freeways that lead to Miami Beach and you will get to Miami Beach in 15 minutes with no traffic. I noticed that traffic started between noon and up going to Miami Beach. Don't get scared away that you have to pay 20 or more for parking at Miami Beach. I parked at South Point Park for only $5.00 for all day and walked my way all along Ocean Drive and up South Beach. The real down side is that you have to pay $24 plus tax on valet parking at the hotel. The hotel is also located very close to Little Havana so you can grab lunch or dinner there too. I would stay at this hotel again since I did not experience any rude service or noisy atmosphere and the rooms were a delight.", "Date": "February 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cSweet and Sour\u201d", "Author": "matthew.cronin", "ReviewID": "UR3018113", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for two nights in January, each separated by a week as we traveled abroad.

Room service was great and, I thought, very reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly and gracious (void of the South Beach attitude). We left the next morning very much looking forward to returning for another night a week later. Unfortunately when we returned we had a completely different experience. The staff seemed completely inundated with a conference that was being held there and we were obviously not the priority - we didn't even get assistance with our luggage. Our room was right next to the elevator despite the fact that I had specifically requested one away from the elevator (and it's in my 'profile' with MO). When I asked the manager if another room was available he said he could give me a suite \"for a good rate\"!!! They tried to up-sell me after giving me exactly what I had asked not to have - I felt like I had been scammed. An experience I would never have expected to have at a service oriented 5-star hotel. That experience burned me so bad I'm not sure I'd go back, despite having had a wonderful stay on the first night. My advice - ask if there will be a conference while you're there.

Bellman/valet service was excellent (we checked out at 4 am to catch an early flight and the car was waiting). The waiters at the resturant and at the pool provided prompt and pleasant service. The infinity pool and sand beach area are marvelous. The front desk service was friendly but below average for a hotel of this quality (computer was down at check-out and room needed a 30 minute \"inspection\" before we could complete somewhat early 1 pm check-in). The hotel is ideally located (on a small key) for access to the downtown Miami business district, but it's several miles from South Beach and Miami Beach. One negative is that during rush hour (4pm to 6:30 pm) traffic out of the downtown area is very heavy...it took us nearly 35 minutes just to get to I-95 at 5:45 pm on a Tuesday evening and almost 2 hours to get to Pro Players football stadium for the Orange Bowl.", "Date": "January 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "LONDON", "Title": "\u201cDissapointed!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2973469", "Content": "We spent 5 days at the Mandarin during New Year and were really looking forward to our stay.

(2) The spa messed up our his/her in room massage scheduled 3 weeks in advance and we were told to book the next day \"but in our spa since we don't have availability for in room massages anymore\". (3) Housekeeping was sorry it was 8PM and the maid hasn't cleaned the room - they have other guests and events (not rooms) to attend to... towels did show up 2 hours later after a 3rd call but the room was never cleaned. (4) Concierge screwed up our New Years Eve reservations so badly we were in a cab (thanks to #1 above), going to a club they never followed thru on putting us on the guest list for (even though we were told it was taken care of 3 weeks in advance) so we showed up and had to wait an hour to get in after midnight.

The front desk clerks and concierge were of no help and were quite snobbish. We were in town for business, unfortunately during the time Hurricane Jeanne was due to hit north of Miami about 60 miles. Definitely not the time of year you want to be in Miami, and I realize we were lucky we didn't have a home in danger down there. I realize that it's not their choice to evacuate but when we were told at 10 am that we had to evacuate by noon and that they were not able to help in arranging an alternate hotel you realize you're not getting 5 star customer service. They gave us the names of hotels that they knew damn well didn't have any rooms available. Basically wasted our time on the phone when we should have been packing up to leave. I called down to the concierge and told him it would be well worth his time to help find us another hotel on the mainland and he basically blew me off with \"nothing I can do.\" No apologies or an attempt at being courteous. We later found out that other hotels on the water had reciprical arrangements with mainland hotels throughout the Miami area. You would think that a hotel that touts itself as Miami's finest, would be a bit more prepared for events such as this. You would expect this low level service from a cheaper hotel, not a highly touted 5 star establishment.
