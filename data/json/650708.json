The hotel is nice and provided a shuttle to the metrolink at the airport which is what we needed. Only was able to make one happy hour , wish we had been able to attend more. TGIF is in the Crown Plaza across the street. The pool was nice and they serve a very good breakfast, buffet or cook to order. The problem I had with this stay was I had a split reservation, paying for the first two nights then staying on hilton honor points the next two. They had a little problem understanding at check in and assured me I was set with the same room all 4 nights. However that did not happen, being we were busy in town all day we had to quickly pack up and leave our stuff in the room for them to move to our new room. This made us a little late that morning.

Great price for the room, verses the higher-end trendy hotels in Chicago. Really appreciated staying in a true neighborhood verses the tourist areas. Things I did not like so much: I was pregnant, and it was my first stay here...I was unaware that my room would be up 3 very steep flights of stairs with no elevator, and no one to assist me with my bags.... Check-in time is during the day, so if you have a later flight, plan on driving around to look for parking (no parking at this hotel either), then stumble up the stairs with your bags... My room door did not lock and was not locked upon arrival, and the staff did not seem to think it was a big deal. When you are a female travelling solo, IT IS. Since the building is older, the water heater kept turning on throughout the night which did keep me awake. Overall, I really wished that the hotel staff would have been more clear on the accommodations.

This is a B&B so you have to arrange a time to pick up keys etc, but you are not staying in someone's house where you may feel uncomfortable, this is much more like an apartment experience. I cannot recommend this place highly enough, right in the heart of the wicker park area, close to the metro, surrounded by some of the most cool places to go with plenty of car parking on the side streets.

The locals are generally young hipsters and yuppies... which makes for a fun experience. It's only approx $12 for a taxi to downtown / Michigan Ave. Or you can take the Blue Line directly to downtown in about 15-20 minutes. As for the hotel itself, the staff was very helpful and very polite & the guestroom bed was very comfortable. I might consider staying here again, but it would have to have a much better room rate and/or upgrades to the decor and service. I would not recommend The Ruby Room to everyone for the following reasons: - limited \"reception desk\" hours - no daily cleaning services unless requested on a chalkboard outside your room (we has to request fresh towels every morning) - no elevator, all rooms are 3rd and 4th floor walk-ups - decor was sparse & rather lack-luster (the lounge chair in our room was very dirty and stained) - no dressers or drawers for storage - window curtains where no frills & a bit annoying to open and close - no views (at least from our room and presumably many of the others based on the floor plans)", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cDifferent, but Very Nice\u201d", "Author": "AAflyerSeattle", "ReviewID": "UR63462627", "Content": "Stayed one night.

I was in the first few days of a road trip and my boyfriend and I would be passing through Chicago for a night. I'd booked a room at the South Loop Hotel in Chicago, but after checking out the location it didn't look like it would be nearly as fun as staying somewhere else. I found the Ruby Room and, although the prices weren't as good as I'd hoped, I went to their website to get more information. I was surprised to find that their direct rates were at least $50/night lower than those advertised on hotels.com, so I booked directly through them on their website and was so glad I did. We arrived and parked in the loading zone in front of the spa. Kelly at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful from the minute we walked in, and worked with us to schedule an energy healing session with Ryan later that afternoon. We got our keys and parking information and hauled our stuff up the long, steep stairs to our room - with the help of another employee, who carried some of our bags up the stairs and showed us around before leaving us to relax. We took a nap, got some coffee and pastries from the great bakery right across the street, and then went to the spa to meet with Ryan. We both had wonderful experiences with him and were left feeling relaxed and ready to take on the rest of the city for the night. Kelly again helped us with detailed directions to the places we wanted to go and gave us some great restaurant and bar suggestions. After dinner and a movie, we walked the blocks surrounding the hotel for an hour and enjoyed the neighborhood. In the morning, we reluctantly got out of our VERY comfortable bed and enjoyed the marble steam shower in our suite before heading across the street to Milk & Honey for one of the best breakfasts we've ever had. We hated to leave the hotel and wished we were staying for another week! When we got home, we had a very nice postcard from the staff thanking us for staying with them - they even made a personal note based on what we'd told them about our plans for the rest of the trip.

Even if you keep your curtains open (which is unlikely, considering that the windows face the windows of a business directly across), there's only the faintest sunlight. The garden room theoretically \"overlooks the healing garden.\" Actually, it overlooks the back stairs to the building, which guests use to come and go at night. Also, the healing garden is actually a large patio with some plants around the edges. It's certainly nice, but I don't think it quite qualifies as a \"garden.\" It does have a little waterfall, however.

We were extremely disappointed by our experience there. Things that would probably bother other travelers did not bother us: the stairs, no telephones/tv's, no room service, small bathroom, and checking in at the spa (yes, it's a bit awkward given the tight space amongst all the products but the staff is friendly and check-in is quick). Room decor is Target & Ikea meets Shabby Chic & Yoga Ashram. Basically, it's a bizarre mix of cheap furniture and decor. There were other strange things about the room that made it seem half furnished: no nightstand on one side of the bed, no headboard, no cover on the duvet, etc. The bed linens are not 500 thread count as advertised (Note to owners: your customers have eyes and can read tags & many of us shop at Target too). There were fresh flowers in the room when we arrived but they were half dead...but a nice thought had it been executed properly. Pros: -Comfortable bed despite not having a headboard -Aveda products in the bathroom -Convenient to 'El' and bus -Convenient to restaurants Cons: -Completely OVERPRICED! -Dirty (inch of dust underneath the bed w/ dust bunnies everywhere, coverlet was stained and no comforter cover) -No WiFi as advertised. Direct internet connection was extremely slow. -Paper thin walls (not so relaxing when you can hear everything around you) Again, we were fully aware that this was not your typical hotel and we were ok with that.

I actually shouldn't call this a hotel -- and nor do they - as it is more a part of the Ruby Room Spa that is down the stairs a building over. For the price we paid - around $200 on Expedia - the room was very disappointing. The only positive was the bathroom and that it was clean. The SPA checked us in and they weren't the friendliest of bunch - as I actually thought our arriving was more of a disturbance than a pleasure to meet/greet us. I did not like the fact that I had to climb 4 floors - which was actually many more flights of winding stairs with my luggage - not convenient and very scary actually coming down with the luggage as you land right in the street/pavement (the door seemed to be open a lot) if you were ever to take an unfortuante spill. The room - has a bed, a mirror, a nightstand with an alarm clock, another nightstand with a lamp and that is it.

PLEASE NOTE - if you are looking for a TV - there is NONE - at least there wasn't in May 2007. Overall - I would stay somwhere else if you are looking for service. If you are looking for a place to crash and don't care about a TV, warm service from the staff, an elevator, room service - this could be OK if your destination is Bucktown/Wicker Park area - if not, it's about a $15 cab ride into Rush/Division area of Chicago - more $$ if you go further in.
