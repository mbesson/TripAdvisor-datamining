While the staff were really friendly and helpful and the breakfast was one of the better one's we've had on this type of budget, the room left much to be desired. The motorway is fairly noisy, even with the doors and windows closed; and the room was too warm with the heaters on and very cold with the heater off. We had a room with a private bathroom, however there was a shared bathroom right outside our room which was really noisy all through the night. Our towels smelt of mildew and one of them was ripped in the corner. The 'Standard Double Room' which we stayed in states that it comes with 1 Double bed, however this was in fact 2 single beds. In their advert on Booking.com they indicate that there is free public parking, however this is only with a sticker; otherwise it costs \u20ac5 per day. Most of the tourist attractions are a minimum of 35 minutes away by public transport and it is not possible to get there without at least one transition. Alexanderplatz is about 40 minutes with public transport. This was not a deal breaker for us as the trains and subways run very regularly, but it did get quite tiring towards the end of the trip. Wi-Fi is only free if you take the breakfast. Overall the friendly and efficient staff did not make up for the discomfort of the room and the distance from the city. We wouldn't stay here again.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicestershire", "Title": "\u201cFANTASTIC\u201d", "Author": "scooby_1991", "ReviewID": "UR126600233", "Content": "What a great hotel!

The place is spotless and functional. Do not believe that it is centrally located or at least convenient to anything. Even the underground is a good walking distance, at least ten minutes. There is absolutely nothing to speak of within reasonable walking distance, possibly a few restaurants could be found during more than an hour walk and a small shopping strip. Tried it to find an internet cafe recommended by the hotel staff, 40 minutes of walking came up with a den of characters, got my pocket picked besides an attempt to charge me double. So would not recommend it. Unfortunately when asked, the staff said the lobby computer was \"impossible\" to use, no second thoughts about that. Watch what you sign upon reaching there tired from a long trip and you are asked to sign your credit card receipt, small print by signing you are authorizing them to convert your funds to theirs plus a three and a half percent charge. My debit card company charges nothing for the conversion so I gave them a gift with that mistake. The rooms are basic, don't ask for sheets or blankets again: \"impossible\", although previously I was told \"no problem\" ,if you press the issue \"you did not pay for it\". Basic room clean, bed with mattress and comforter, small sink only in the shared bathroom units. The floor bathrooms cover about 6 or 8 rooms but are spotless and maintained as is the rest of the place, very clean, large and in my case never had to wait for usage, showers great. The only English speaking TV channel reception was weird kept cutting off, on for a few seconds off for a few seconds. When I brought this to the attention to a staff member, wanted to send a technician while I was out of the room (?) When I complained that he could just switch tv with an empty room. First he was too busy then I find him at my door with a tv to swap. A bit later I find that it made absolutely no difference, next morning mentioned to another member of the staff, he said right off it is a problem with the system in the entire hotel, unknown to the first guy? A little strange. I am glad I signed up for only two breakfasts for my seven day stay. A better choice is to have coffee and pastry at the train station or a small shop at the entrance to the U Bahn, full breakfast elsewhere. This hotel seems to be a conglomerate with lots of similar huge cut rate hotels. Summary I will be guided by if I book there again: be alert, don't expect convenience, expect a clean and comfortable accommodation, bring a book to read, go elsewhere for internet computer use and breakfast.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wroclaw", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel\u201d", "Author": "Pawel_EPWR", "ReviewID": "UR122228819", "Content": "The hotel is clean and comfortable.

We also got the tram (S Bahn) to the airport when we left which was advised by the receptionist, but they failed to say that the airport tram was very infrequent and sometimes doesn't run, and so we waited over an hour for the tram and only knew it was going to the airport because a german passer-by told us! we could have missed our flight!

The bottom line: we probably got what we paid for, as the room was not particularly expensive. By the end, though, we were starting to wonder if we'd overpaid. Our en suite room was sparse and box-like, and appeared to have been furnished largely with decor from IKEA: acceptable, but not fancy or particularly comfortable. We brought our laptop along, but found that there was a considerable extra charge for use of the hotel's internet access. Breakfast, likewise, was not included in the room price, which was disappointing. At around 8 EU per person...we opted to go out of the hotel, so I can't comment on the food quality. The most disappointing part, though, was the distance from the hotel to the S/U-bahn stations. A brisk walker can make it to the Heidelberger Platz station in 10 minutes, but the stop isn't central to any of the major tourist areas. We wound up spending a lot of time trekking back and forth to the S/U station and then on trains to and from what we wanted to see which was tiring. If you stay here for 2 or 3 days, consider buying the Welcome Card for public transport from which we definitely got our money's worth. Berlin's public transportation system is excellent...we just wished it wasn't obligatory to use it for every little thing, but due to the hotel's location, it definitely was. On the positive, the hotel was clean, the staff friendly and accomodating. If I had to do it again, I'd probably spring for something more comfortable with an included breakfast.

Rooms: This is a cheap hotel so the furniture may be from Ikea. Personally, I don't mind Ikea furniture if it is a good condition (which this certainly was.) It would appear (from these reviews) that rooms vary in size quite a bit, but we had a good size twin room (7m x 4m) at the far end of the hotel. Plenty of room to sit on the sofa and watch TV (including Sky News and CNN in English). Location: The hotel is 5 minute walk, down a quiet residential street, from the U-bahn and S-bahn stations at Heidelberger Platz. From here it takes about 20 minutes to get into the centre of town. Food: The breakfast buffet was an excellent way to get fuelled up, ready for a hard day's sightseeing. Bread, cheese and cold meats were available in the evening as well. The only place locally serving food was the \"Doner station\" so we ate in the city centre before we returned to the hotel. Hotel Bar: Pricey but not stupid. Are any hotel bars cheap?

The breakfast is really good and the staff is, in general, friendly and helpful. Despite other members said before, the tube station is not far - about 600 meters or 5 minutes walk - and if you just walk 1 more minute you'll have a bus that leads you to the centre of the city(Zoologischer Garten).
