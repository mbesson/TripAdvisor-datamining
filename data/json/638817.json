{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Location, Good Value We stayed at the Viva Hotel Laurus in April of this year and were very pleased with the hotel in general. We got a great deal, and the hotel seemed much better value than others we saw advertised. We saw some of the competing properties in Florence and thought we definitely made the right choice. As others have mentioned, the location is perfect, walking distance from train and bus stations and almost all the major sights. We booked a day wine tour, and the reception staff was helpful is showing us the bus routes to get to the meeting place. The terrace is lovely for breakfast and has a great view. We also had happy hour drinks and canapes up there one night, and it was a lovely pre-dinner event. Our room was good-sized for Italy and had a new, modern, tiled bathroom. The room was very clean, and though an Italian friend had suggested it might be noisy due to the location, we found it to be nice and quiet. The Viva Hotel Laurus can't compete with any luxury properties, but it was excellent value and perfect for a long weekend away...clean, comfortable, with a great location.", "Date": "Nov 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR659254830", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tholmes"}, {"Content": "Good Hotel - Heart of Florence       The bathroom was bright, clean and modern.", "Date": "Nov 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR378950385", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PerthEngineer"}, {"Content": "Pleasant Stay My wife and I stayed here for two nights during our travels through Italy on our honeymoon. The hotel is nice, but nothing spectacular. The rooftop terrace at night provides a romantic atmosphere. Antonio at the front desk works hard, but there is not enough staff to run the hotel. We enjoyed the location of the hotel, being a short walk to most sites and only about a 10-15 minute walk from the train station. The price of the hotel is pretty fair for what you get, not a luxury hotel but not luxury prices. We had the hotel reserve tickets for the Uffizi Gallery and Academia, but there's quite a surcharge (I believe it was 4 or 5 euros per ticket). Overall, we enjoyed our stay in Florence. There's so much to see and do that a hotel doesn't make or break the trip.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR544939882", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "marque44"}, {"Content": "Perfect location We booked a deluxe room for four nights ($173/night from hotels.com) and received a decent room on the 5th floor.The location is great. A few blocks from the train station (we arrived by rail from Venice) and the main bus terminal, making day trips to Siena (highly recommended) or Pisa, etc, very convenient. 75 or 95 minute bus ride to Siena was only 13 Euros round-trip per person.And it's only a 15 minute taxi ride to the airport (although our driver was a bit of a speed demon).The hotel is just two blocks from the Duomo, which is an awesome sight to behold, day or night (and of course, the 463-step climb to the top is a required tourist trek).Most all of the major tourist attractions are easily accessible by foot (20 minutes max): Mercato Nuovo, Piazza della Signora, Palazzo Vecchio, Uffizi, Mercato Centrale, Medici Chapel, Ponte Vecchio, Boboli Garden, Accademia Museum, Bargello Museum, San Croce, etc. Major shopping streets are also very close and there are dozens of cafes, restaurants, bookstores, and clothing shops all around the hotel.Walk toward the Duomo and turn left on the pedestrian street to find some good, inexpensive meals (I Matti for instance).And gelato? You want gelato? You'll find (at least) one gelato shop on every block! The room was good sized for European standards. Decent closet space. Electronic safe. Spacious bathroom, although the bidet was useless because its faucet was low and pointed downard (think about it).Complimentary breakfast on the top floor was nice, with several tables on the terrace offering a beautiful view.Tip: On the fifth floor (perhaps others as well), there is a bathroom at the end of the hall, around the corner from the elevators. So, having this second bathroom just down the hall is a bonus.Another tip: Many modern hotels require you to put your key in a slot by the door for the electicity to work. At this hotel, the plumbing has the same restriction. So, if there's no water coming out of the faucet and the toilet won't flush, be sure your key is in the slot before calling the front desk!One minor complaint: They charge their guests a whopping 5 Euros to use the internet on the lobby PC for just 30 minutes. We found several internet cafe's nearby (close to the bus station for instance), where you could get the same 30 minutes for 1 Euro (or less).Decent hotel. Nice breakfast.

During my trip to Italy with my family in June of 2007, this was our favorite hotel! It was incredibly clean, very modern, and just absolutely wonderful all around. It was very close to the train station, while also being incredibly close to the city center. We were an extremely short walk from the Duomo, as well as the Marketplace, and a bunch of wonderful restaurants and shops. The Uffizi and Ponte Vecchio were very short walks as well. While at this hotel, the day before we were to check out and head to Venice, my grandfather suffered a heart attack in his room. The hotel staff were EXTREMELY helpful and called an ambulance and whenever they saw us that day they asked how my grandfather was doing. Since we were to stay in Florence for the rest of our trip and no longer go to Venice, the hotel staff were very helpful in finding us another room. They had no availability at this hotel, but got us rooms in their sister hotel - another Best Western Viva Hotel in Florence - the Viva Hotel Capitol Santa Croce. We had a wonderful experience at that hotel as well, the staff allowed us to use their fax machine often since we had to arrange a medical flight for my grandfather and we were constantly dealing with the travel agent, trip insurance people, and doctors. Also, the staff at Capitol Santa Croce were very helpful with finding us the best bus routes to get back and forth from the hospital my grandpa was at. After our experience with both of these hotels in Florence, we felt that Best Western hotels were really a great buy for the money. I am returning to Italy this October for my honeymoon and we have already booked our 4 night stay in Florence at the Hotel Laurus - and I'm really looking forward to going back to that hotel.", "Date": "Mar 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR791218233", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "metze"}, {"Content": "Superb little hotel Location is convenient to train station and in the heart of Florence.

While in Florence, I stayed at the Best Western Viva Hotel Laurus.I enjoyed my stay there very much. The location was a 10 minute walk from Santa Maria Novella train station, and the hotel was easily found on the bustling street, Via Cerrantani. (Just down the street from the Duomo!) There are many places to eat just a short walk from the hotel, and a nice bakery just up the street toward the train station. Great cookies with Nutella drizzled over them! I chose Viva Hotel Laurus for several reasons:- Great price.- Great location.- it is a member of the Best Western Chain - It had a rooftop terrace for breakfast.- I read many good reviews on this website about it.I was not disappointed. The room - while quite small, was completely functional and clean - the bathroom was large and clean also. I could hear the church bells out my window sometimes - which was magical.There was free internet in the room - so we were able to use our lap top as often as we liked. We sent emails and photos of our trip to our friends at home!We asked for and received a hot water pot for making our own tea/coffee. That was nice to have a cup of soothing tea after a day of touring Florence.There are only a few TV stations in English - they are pretty much all news, etc. So don't expect movies or any kind of TV entertainment. We had our lap top - and had brought some DVD's so we watched them when we weren't too tired.The breakfast room on the 6th floor was very nice with lots of delicious pastries (chocolate croissants) and pinapple danish - my favorite. Eggs and ham, cereal and toast and jelly, etc. Fresh juice,coffee and tea. The outside terrace was an awesome place to start each morning, munching on baked goods, sipping coffee and looking at views of the Duomo, Giotto's tower, Palazzo Vecchio, and the rooftopsof Florence. When the bells started ringing in a church belltower close by - I knew I was truly in Florence - Italy.The front desk staff was very pleasant and helped book us our Ufizzi and Accademia tickets. (There is a service charge to book tickets ahead of time through the Hotel.) The staff all spoke english and were always pleasant and friendly.All in all - I would definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting Florence. It was a wonderful visit - very different from Rome - it must be experienced to be understood. P.S. Don't miss the Ponte Vecchio at night. The gold and silver shops sparkle and dazzle you as you stroll by with your gelato.", "Date": "Mar 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR513236971", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "CoralExplorer"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u5908\u5049\u9288\ue042\u512e\u9287\u5b28\u501d\u5bf0\u6393\ue1222\u9352?#x201d;   showReview(23237978, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR756045721", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "hamahamakei"}, {"Content": "bien pero caro       ba\u5e3do", "Date": "Jul 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR933505313", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "misla"}, {"Content": "Excellent service   showReview(15571922, 'full');", "Date": "May 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR771888952", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "aquarius747"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d638817-r22272920-Viva_Hotel_Laurus_al_Duomo-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "638817", "Price": "$265"}}
