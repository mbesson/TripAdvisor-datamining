Bathroom was nice & clean , plenty of towels and hot water.. Just around corner from hotel on Denamn St you will find the Denman Mall which has a discount supermaket called \"No Frills\" (I think that was the name) where you can get all the basics for survival in your hotel room ie bread, butter, milk etc. Hotel is located across road from English Bay beach which leads into Stanley Park where you will always find people walking, cycling, rollerblading and just generally enjoying themselves. Hotel is on Davie St which is a nice stroll 1 mile eastwards to downtown. Just outside of hotel you can also get a bus to take you downtown. Plenty of bars,liquer stores,restaurants and fastfood outlets in general area of Hotel. Take a walk east on Davie St until you come to Granville St, turn right here and over bridge to Granville Island ,where after spending some time exploring the markets with their massive selection of mouthwatering foods, you can catch a ferry back towards English Bay beach.

The Room: I appreciated reading other reviews so we asked for a higher floor to avoid the traffice noise and that worked out well. Of course we heard noises from other rooms but they were minimal and nothing to contact the front desk about. The \"mountain view\" is really a view of downtown with some mountains in the distance. The \"English Bay\" view is really a view of a sliver of English Bay. One thing which was really puzzling was the queen-size mattress put on top of a full size box spring. I rolled right out of bed onto the floor because a full six inches of the side of the bed was unsupported by anything. The room was average. The bathroom was also average with the typical slow-draining tub. Ankle deep in water by the time I finished washing my hair. Adored the soft, creamy soap and the tea lotion. The Location: You can't beat the proximity to English Bay and an amazing assortment of little restaurants. So many cultures represented! We walked for a minute and were at English Bay which is really very pretty. Transit is right outside the front door. A Safeway grocery store is a few blocks away, well within walking distance. McDonalds is about the same. Stanley Park is mere minutes away by car, as is Lion's Gate Bridge which takes you to Grouse Mountain. Stanley Park: What a lovely park. HUGE drawback is the fee for parking ANYWHERE in the park at ANY time. It isn't overly expensive but it's a fee nonetheless. During the winter you shouldn't count on horse-draw tours or the mini train, naturally, but in nice weather you can still get a nice walk or relaxing bench meditation in.

The location of this hotel is perfect, the bus stops right outside the door and the other one is right across the street. I took the skytrain from the airport and the C23 to the hotel, you can't beat it for $2.50 and it's a quick ride. There are fantastic and diverse restaurants all over this area and unlike the comments by another reviewer, I didn't feel scared at all, the area is well lit and there isn't much difference in street people in this area compared to other major cities. Some of them talked to me and I to them while waiting for the bus, no big deal even if one guy offered me a swig out of his rum bottle! Point is, if you spend so much time looking for things to complain about you aren't going to enjoy yourself. I rented a bike and pedaled around Stanley Park. Every morning when the sun came up I took a walk along the sea wall past second beach. It's so nice to wake up and be so close to such beautiful places. I also walked to Vanier Park and Granville Island 3 times while I was there, to Kitsilano twice, and on one day we took the Sea Bus over to North Vancouver and went to Lynn Canyon.

The location of the hotel was perfect and it was also the reason I chose this hotel because I wanted to be close to English Bay. This was the 2nd time I stayed in in Vancouver and last time was 10 years ago and I stayed at the YH (hostel) on Burnaby Street so staying in this hotel was surely an upgrade to me. Sadly, however, I was pretty disappointed with the room in terms of its level of cleanliness. The bathroom looked very old and the bathtub (I 100% recommend!) needed to be replaced. Several spots of the bathtub paint were scratched and the drain at the bottom (the silver thing) was basically broken. There were stains on the shower curtain. Both the sofa and the carpet looked like they needed a thorough cleaning. The 2nd day I dropped an empty water bottle (trash) on the floor by accident in the morning and after I returned to the hotel in the evening the bottle was still on the floor! What's more surprising to me was that the bottle was never picked up during the whole time I stayed there. I know housekeepers are not supposed to move customer's items too much when cleaning, but an empty water bottle on the floor? Don't get me wrong, the housekeepers all seemed friendly when I met them in the hallway. I was just confused why no one even wanted/cared to pick the trash up when they cleaned my room every day and it was certainly not a good service I expected. One night I was using eraser when writing my journal so there were some eraser bits on the floor afterwards. The next day after coming back to the room from a long day city tour, I found the eraser bits were still all over the floor. I was really surprised and actually a little bit upset. Shouldn't someone vacuum or do something to clean it? Those eraser bits were very visible so there was no way that the housekeepers \"couldn't see it.\" I truly hope the hotel management will be willing to invest some money to make the hotel nicer. This hotel is in such a great location, the room was a good size, the view from balcony was delighting, and the bed was very comfortable (big plus!!). It's a pity that the room itself was poorly-maintained and the housekeepers didn't pay enough attention to their work. I also think it was a bit too expensive for a room with such a poor level of cleanliness. I will certainly want to go back though if the problems above can be solved. By the way, the front desk was professional. There were some Asian front desk agents who looked like they were on working holiday or something but they were actually the \"friendlier\" ones.

I enjoyed the location as 10 minute walk up the hill you had the restaurants and cafes of Davie Street and plenty of dining options right around the corner. The gem of this hotel though is the swanky corner bar, which is this sci-fi circular set up, with sunken bar in the middle of the room and just fantastic views over the park and the bay. A DJ spins cool chill out tunes as the attentive staff mix cocktails. The Bayview Lounge I seem to recall. Non hotel guests frequent the bar, it looks like a popular spot for locals too. The hotel will likely provide you with a 2-4-1 voucher for a drink here. There are a few coffee shops around for breakfast including the (in)famous Canadian chain, Tim Horton's (do they actually serve coffee here? - whatever they call it, it doesnt taste anything like coffee!) Their bagels are OK and local friends have raved about their chilli). Overall, a nice experience at the BW Sands in Vancouver. I just can't shake the feeling that the property just feels like it could do with a makeover and a refurb. Others on Trip Advisor have mentioned the bus stop out the front of the hotel - which can be a bit noisy. Still, the rooms are well insulated, and the noise is only slightly annoying if you have the doors to the balcony wide open. Then again, I was on the top floor, so it may have been noisier on lower levels. If you are a light sleeper it could be an issue (did I mention the beds? Super comfy, memory foam toppers maybe?) Would I stay again? Perhaps. I did spend a few nights in the Sandman up the hill on Davie Street, which probably had the edge over the sands due to central location and apartment style rooms - with views from the highrise tower.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cLocation Not Bad as I Thought\u201d", "Author": "MissHK2009", "ReviewID": "UR118961394", "Content": "In the first place, I thought it's badly located, away from any skytrain station, away from Robson St or Granville St or waterfront where the actions are.

C23? as I recall) outside the Yaletown station heading to Davie Street and the last stop is this hotel. Outside the hotel entrance, there are also terminals for buses nos. 5 and 6 running round the downtown area. What surprised me as well is that the neighbourhood is like a community, self contained, with supermarkets, quality restaurants of seafood and other cuisines.

The Checkers Bar food, drinks and service was exceptional and the food was good value for money and very enjoyable, with a wide choice. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff at the Sands, and we were very impressed by the welcoming and friendly approach from everyone, no matter what time of day or night, or however busy they were. We booked a Twin Room at the back of the Hotel for two nights, either side of a trip to the Rockies, and both nights were very restful in clean, beautifully presented accommodation with plenty of space. The first overnight stay followed a long flight from the UK, and we were in bed and asleep by 7pm! The second overnight trip was in a different Twin Room, which was equally as nice as the first room. The bathrooms were well appointed, with really good showers, plenty of lovely towels, and were spotlessly clean. We were able to leave left luggage with the Reception staff at no charge, and this was really useful, and well organised. The whole Hotel was superbly clean, and well maintained, and we were very impressed with the entire experience. On both occasions we walked around the local area, including Stanley Park which is fantastic, and were impressed with the cleanliness of the City, and we felt very safe, even when walking back from a lovely Italian restaurant a good few blocks down Davie Street at night. We are two mature ladies, and had no worries whatsoever about being alone without our husbands in this Hotel or locality. We had read reviews of lots of hotels in Vancouver before booking the Best Western Plus Sands Hotel, and were really delighted with the choice we made. It couldn't have been more perfect, and we would recommend the Sands to anyone, including families, single ladies, lone travellers etc. We had read a few negative reviews about the Sands, thankfully they didn't put us off, and we cannot understand why anyone should have any complaints so our advice is to ignore any reviews which don't praise this lovely Hotel! A big thank you to all the staff at the Sands, you made our trip to Vancouver very enjoyable, and we would have no hesitation in booking to stay with you again.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSecond Stay Just As Good\u201d", "Author": "spacedogfl", "ReviewID": "UR118514838", "Content": "This review is severely overdue! I stayed at the Sands from 4/17/11-4/25/11 and my stay was every bit as enjoyable as the first. I booked through Priceline for this stay instead of booking through the BW site and had no issues when checking in or out. When entering or exiting the hotel, the front desk staff seemed to always make a point of speaking to not just my friend and I, but to anyone else in the lobby. Their friendliness and courtesy made approaching them for suggestions or even to just chat about the day easy. It is an older building so the rooms (at least the two I've been in) are small but well furnished. There is not enough I can say about the hotel's location. At the corner of Denman and Davie, it is a short walk to Stanley Park and with buses that stop in front of the hotel, it is easy to get to any other destination in the city. As far as the area, I never felt unsafe. There are a number of clubs at the opposite end of Davie that are open late (>1 mile away). I have walked alone (not that I recommend doing so) from them in the wee hours of the morning without fearing for my safety. For some of my visit I ventured out by myself and never worried about returning at night and being harassed. As for bars, I highly recommend the Bayside Lounge. Next door to the hotel proper, the service there is great as are the drinks...and you can charge back to the room ;) The highlight of my stay was seeing Sue. Though she did not remember my name, she remembered my visit from last year and that highly impressed me. To me she exemplifies what is right with the property: the personalized, not forced friendliness and service. Each server that passed took the time to check on me even though I may not have been at \"their table.\" For the downtown area, I feel this hotel is a great value. Again, I say this is not a new hotel with bright, wide open spaces and new fixtures. It is an older hotel with it's own style and charm. While the service, location and value are top notch, do not expect five-star luxuries. For me, it falls in the category \"base of operations,\" to use solely for sleeping when not out and about.

Driving down the street towards the hotel was quite a scary experience with homeless people, drunks, drug additcts, transvestites etc walking up and down the street and all over the road. When we arrived we were expected to pay an extra $16 for parking. The parking was in an outdoor area with aboslutely no security at all. Through out the night when my husband looked out the window he could see people peering into the vehicles in the parking lot looking for things to steal. We ended having to take everything out of our vehicle and we were worried that the vehicle might not be there in the morning. Not a secure feeling! The elevator needed a room key to operate which was good but it was just inside a wide open area where street people could come in at any opportunity. The room was horrific!! The bathroom had broken tiles and a pink bathtub from the 70's. The faucets were rusty and disguisting! The shower head was a small white plastic hose that gave out barely enough water to get wet. The airconditioner was the cheap kind that was placed in a window and didn't work at all. My husband managed to wedge our suitcases against the door in such a fashion that we felt that if someone tried to come into our room during the night we would hear them. Not exactly what you would expect for over $250 per night!! Probably the worst part was that a few weeks later when we were home from our vacation my husband received an email from the manager asking him to rate his experience at the hotel. When he responded with our honest opinion the manger emailed him back and said he would only agree with the fact that the airconditioner didn't work and was going to disregard all our other comments.

We chose it by its close location to English Bay beach (only 2 blocks) and Stanley Park. The photos available online made it look much better than it actually is. On arrival, we were somewhat dismayed to find the hotel almost in front of a very busy city bus stop, with pedestrian traffic so heavy we just about couldn't turn off the street into the hotel driveway. The lobby is quite small, and the front desk even smaller. The desk clerk was perfunctory, and spent more time warning us about the smoking prohibitions in the rooms than anything else. The hotel description said it was a non-smoking property, which was important to us since our daughter has asthma, so we were well-aware of the smoking prohibition already. Parking was an extra $13 a night, and parking consisted of a 2-deck open-air parkade that opened to a dingy alley in the rear. There was limited space available, so we had to park on the upper level, which had no elevator service, and we had to drag our suitcases down a dirty concrete stairwell to the lobby. Once in the lobby, we were informed that the elevator would require a room key card just to open the elevator door. Given the crush of street people outside, I could understand the need for this, but it raised immediate security concerns about our location and the safety of access to our car. The room we had booked was a suite, with a separate bedroom. It was nicely furnished, even had an efficiency-apartment style kitchen, but there was almost too much furniture in each room. The bedroom had 2 double beds that just about filled the room. The hotel website said that the rooms were air-conditioned, but that turned out to be a window air conditioner in each room, mounted almost on the floor, with curtains that couldn't be moved out of the way of the AC. We ended up just opening the windows and wishing for a breeze, as there were no ceiling fans or any way to circulate air. The windows looked out on the dingy alley and the upper deck of the parking structure, so there was not much of a view. On the plus side, the bedroom did have a large, flat screen TV, and the beds were comfortable. When we asked the front desk person where the work-out room was, he had no idea the hotel even had one, even though the hotel's website said they had one.. If it's there, we could not locate it. Parking was a big concern, because it was first-come, first-served, and if a guest arrived too late to find a space, you were out $13 for nothing. Upper deck was not well-lighted, so safety was an issue. For the price of the hotel, I was really disappointed. It's not well-maintained, and the crush of street people right outside the lobby door day and night made it uncomfortable and not secure, whether we were on foot or trying to get the car out of the parking structure. I had expected the neighborhood to be more upscale, given the hotel location and price, but we felt like we were in the middle of a questionable area of town. I wished I could have gotten out of the booking once I saw the hotel and its surroundings, but could not, since I booked online and nothing was refundable.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Staff...lovely hotel...great beds...super location...the Best!\u201d", "Author": "teshss", "ReviewID": "UR72193307", "Content": "Upon arrival the hotel staff greeted us with a very friendly, knowledgeable attitude...they quickly pulled our reservation and within minutes we were checked in with little perks to make us feel welcome.

I had lived in Vancouver for years, and wanted to make sure that I got a place down by English Bay, and I also needed someplace with parking. I had wandered through to the Sands when I had lived in the area, and it always seemed nice, so I thought what the heck, I'll book the room. First tip - always check online for the best price - and book online through best western's site... they won't request full payment, and for me, I ended up saving $50/night by cancelling my original reservation and rebooking it. We arrived on a rainy rainy Vancouver night - and I had requested a quiet room, so we weren't facing the water - but that was fine with me. What we didn't hear was the car traffic out front; what we DID hear was HORSE traffic out back! Apparently, as part of their regular 'beat' the police officers that are on horseback bring them into the underground parkade and they do some training exercises with the horses. SO every day, around 3pm, there are these horses clopping around out back! I thought it was funny, that I had travelled all the way from Calgary & 'cowboy country' and there were horses out back. Anyhew, the parking there was great - it was free, and there were a lot of spots that were fairly safe to leave a vehicle overnight. They have a limited in-room dining menu, but they have a great two restaurants in the hotel, and about a million restaurants within walking distance, so if one goes hungry it is their own fault. There wasn't a business centre per se, but they did have a computer that you could jump on and check your email for a slight fee - but I also believe they would have had free wireless internet if you had a computer with you. The greatest part of the stay, for me, was the service. My mother was unexpectedly sick when we were there, and part of what helps her stop being sick is cornstarch - it being late at night, we couldn't think of where we could go for cornstarch, but luckily the kitchen was open and they were so wonderful to help us out. The food at the bar \"Checkers\", while is more like pub food, is still not too shabby - but the service there, and throughout is pretty darn great. REcommendations when staying here - get out and go for a walk along English Bay, have dinner at the Boathouse around the corner, and try to be around at about 2pm in the afternoon to hang out with the horses.

Vancouver confused us. We started by disliking it but were won round by the time we left. Approaching from the East down Hastings Road we saw more vagrants than we have seen anywhere else in our travels. The traffic was bad caused by the closure of a main Street in the centre of town and this continued right down to our hotel , both the vagrancy, although reduced in scale and the traffic. However we did gain a much better impression after taking an evening dinner cruise around the harbour and other trips. The hotel reception was not very welcoming although the gentleman dealing with us did lighten up after a while and ended up being very helpful and friendly. Our rooms were very dismal. Other reviewers on this site speak very highly of the hotel and its accomodation - we must just have been unlucky. I suspect that as Gay Pride was taking place a couple of days after we left and there was also an international firework competition taking place, the hotel was fully booked and we and our friends were accomodated in rooms that were overdue for refurb and which with ordinary levels of occupation may not have been used. We observed other people at reception booking out as they were unhappy with their room and had made alternative arrangements. The room was shabby at best and the housekeeping was far from perfect. Our friends in an adjacent room did not walk barefoot on the carpet as they considered it to be too dirty and stained. The bedding and towels were clean and in good condition. There was air conditioning installed in one of the windows but it was noisy and rattled the other windows. A large square hole had been cut out of the blackout curtain so that cooled air could circulate into the room after dark ( so could bright sunshine in the morning!!). The bathroom was acceptable. Reception was inconsistent, some staff were very helpful others not. When we asked about getting to Capilano Bridge, one member of staff said \"why would you want to, all you do is cross a bridge and then come back\" We had a problem in making international phone calls. We followed the instructions but were unable to connect. We sought help from Reception who sent the head of house-keeping to show us how to use the phones. She had no success either. Upon explaining this to reception to see if we could use another phone we learned that we had been charged Can$4.25 for each attempt. However this was refunded upon protest. She then said that although the instructions stated that it was necessary to dial 9 for a line they had noticed that in some rooms it only worked if you dialed 8 - Bingo-it worked! Breakfast was included but what you had was not negotiable.Scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast with Tea or Coffee - take it or leave it. We also felt a little insecure in the area after dusk. English Beach is almost adjacent to the hotel. We decided to wander down to walk as the sun set. It was very busy and many people appeared to be 'spaced out' and again there was some vagrancy and begging. It was much more pleasant during the day. Once we explored Vancouver we were more happy. Recommend Capilano Bridge for a couple of hours. Quite expensive but well presented with good facilities and pleasant walks and raised boardwalks. Good attempts at providing educational/informative guidance to children. We also enjoyed the habour boat tour with dinner. Although reception tried to put us off this as well as we could eat in a top class retaurant for the price, the tour itself takes you to areas you would not see on a tour bus and there an informative commentary for part of the tour and a sing duo during dinner. Stanley Park too is great and we toured it by Tram.

Clearly, the management has done very little to keep up the place, and it shows. But for the location, I would give the Sands two stars. The rooms are just not in good shape. If you're not prepared to rough it a bit with worn rooms, the Sands isn't the place for you. On the other hand, if you're willing to put up with an older facility that needs some work, the location can't be beat.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "gscal99", "ReviewID": "UR17256078", "Content": "I had a wonderful stay at this hotel.

The restaurant is excellent; the servers were warm and friendly and the food was superb! Checkers was fun at night; I had a great time singing Karaoke! The Bayside lounge was a nice place to sit, have a cool drink, an appetizer and enjoy the fantastic view of English Bay before going out to dinner. It was just a short walk to the beach at English Bay and the seawall to Stanley Park so I took the opportunity to go for an early morning run by myself to the Lions Gate Bridge and back. It was wonderful to be out running along the ocean breathing in the fresh sea air and the early morning rays. I look forward to returning for a visit in the summer so that I can enjoy the beach! As a single person travelling alone I am always concerned about my personal safety however everything about the hotel and the location was perfect. I was not afraid to walk or run on my own.

We went from the hotel to the restaurant for breakfast as they are in the same building and ordered breakfast, ate, received the bill, paid and on the way out of the building noticed a sign that stated breakfast was $4.95 not the $8.95 that we had paid, for the same meal. I returned to the restaurant thinking that there had been an error and was informed that if you don't specifically ask for the special you pay the full price. I stated that we had not been informed that there was a special on breakfast and that the meal was the same, I was told that they do not inform people of the special price. I spoke with the restaurant manager who stated the same. I found it interesting that if you enter the restaurant from the hotel you are not aware of the special and that only people entering from the street are given that information. We did however enjoy the evening Kareoke and the luncheon seafood chowder is the best.

The air-con seemed a bit primitive, mounted in the window, with a hole cut in the curtain and probably quite noisy.
