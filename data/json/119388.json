Other than some spots or wear holes on the carpet the room was clean as was the rest of the building, the bed was comfortable although the pillows were thin (luckily I was alone and could pile both on top of each other), and the shower and bathroom were decent, with room service restocking and changing towels, etc each day. The wireless internet was quite good, and the counter staff were helpful, especially the bearded gentleman, and they try their best to give you a good room. You can also go up to the rooftop for good views, etc, but there's nothing really provided up there to make it comfortable other than a couple of broken chairs. On the negative side the Venice area is not really the most salubrious around these days. A lot of homeless people live just outside the hotel, along the beach front, and other unsavoury sorts can tend to gather around. Although I never really felt threatened, I also didn't feel entirely comfortable walking around at night. It is however just a few blocks north until you hit Santa Monica and the vibe improves quickly. A lot of peddlers and legal marijuana sales are also just out along the boardwalk - fine if that's what you're after. Also the area is quite noisy until around 11pm - midnight (this was during midweek). Another minor beef was that the coffee machine in the foyer was broken down for the three days I was there until the morning I was leaving - annoying that they didn't even provide alternative facilities, such as instant coffee to fill in. With no airconditioning, I also imagine it could get very hot in summer. Venice is also not that convenient to the main tourist areas, such as Hollywood, Downtown LA, or the theme parks. It's fine if you want a beach experience, but there's a fair bit of travelling to get anywhere else. Even Santa Monica is a decent half-hour walk away. It is possible to get the local bus to downtown, which takes about an hour and travels through some interesting areas that I was probably glad not to be walking through, but it is cheap at only $1.50. This bus goes quite close to the hotel and terminates at Union Station downtown. All up the Cadillac was a decent performer at a reasonable price for LA. In future I would probably stay elsewhere, say Santa Monica if I wanted the beach, or otherwise nearer to where the other action is, but that's probably as a much a statement about the area in general as the hotel itself.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Comfortable Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Tony Kate Charl...

The staff were friendly and helpful. I particularly liked the fact that they didn't try to be someone they were not. No pretentiousness, no airs and graces, just down to earth folk that made you fell welcome. The room I stayed in was excellent. TV, clock radio with iPod dock, safe, lovely double bed, reading material, a wonderful simple ensuite with basin, shower and toilet. Everything was clean, tidy and well looked after. Adjacent to the lobby was a great \"common room\" that displayed artworks, had a pool table, some guest male & female toilets and also free Starbucks coffee and lipton tea. The location of the hotel is perfect. Right on Ocean Walk Blvd, so right in the thick of the action. Some would say this area is not the best part of town, but I found no problem with the locals. In fact, some of the less fortunate people that lived on the street were nothing to worry about. I guess they realise that the tourists are the ones that indirectly help them out by leaving tips/donations etc when they sell their wares and in some cases perform on Ocean Walk Blvd. Although I stayed when the weather wasn't the best (rainy and windy) I had a great few nights at The Cadillac and would highly recommend this hotel if you are ever in Venice or in LA in general.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cthin walls, very noisy\u201d", "Author": "Charles F", "ReviewID": "UR126544308", "Content": "The location of this hotel was great, however the walls are super-thin, leading to a very noisy hotel experience.

There is no thermostat in the rooms - only a baseboard heat system that didn't seem to work, and a ceiling fan. Two light bulbs out in the room. No outlet plug close to the bed.

On the beach front there were a lot of homeless and people probably on drugs (there were 3 medical marajuana centres) so I wouldn't advise it for those with children, but I felt perfectly safe even at night. The people weren't nearly at threatening or scary as some of the beggars in the big cities (San Fran/ San Diego). Just a couple of blocks into the town from the hotel are loads of good restaurants. As for the hotel, all staff we spoke to were very friendly. The first receptionist advised us the best place to park; an underground parking lot just a couple of blocks away which was $12 for overnight and seemed safest. He provided a map and showed us how to get there and where to go for dinner. Other guys were also friendly and chatty. The room was clean, no problems with it.

From my understanding this place used to be a hostel and it's definitely haunted by it's past. The rooms are very small and cleanliness is not the hotel's top priority (see pictures). It was so bad that I asked to be moved to another room but was told the hotel was full and I would have to try again in a few days. No such luck. Here are the highlights (or lowlights as it is more appropriately entitled): - Parking is ridiculously difficult; this is not the hotel's fault however, they charge for parking in their lot in which it is nearly impossible to get a spot. The one night I lucked out and got a spot, hotel charged me for two days of parking ($30) when I entered the lot at 11:30 p.m. and departed at 2:00 p.m. the next day. Unbelievable! The other option is to park on the street which is free but not easy. I ended up parking almost a mile away from the hotel. I know the distance because I had to use my car's GPS to find my way back to the hotel (embarrassing but true). - The rooms are not as advertised and there was no refrigerator which I really wanted and expected. - The rooms were not very clean or well kept (see pictures). - The walls are paper thin! You can hear your neighbors' thoughts! The hotel is also very loud which isn't a problem at 6:00 p.m. but it's annoying at 6:00 a.m. It's also supposed to be a non-smoking hotel which other guests continuously ignore that rule. When I contacted the front desk in reference to the smoke filled halls which was infiltrating my room. I was told that the only thing they could do was charge the guests for violating that rule! - The window was broken so it wouldn't stay open. I found this out the very hard way after it slammed down on my hand causing three injured fingers (including one with a bloodclot). - No cell phone reception in the hotel. This may just be my carrier but it was still very annoying. On the flip side, the hotel has reliable wi-fi service. - I want to speak briefly about its \"great\" location. This was my first visit to Venice Beach and though none of my friends had stayed at this hotel, the general area came highly recommended. I read the other reviews about the characters that hang out around the hotel but they were not explicit enough. Many of the people are from a half-way house located on the next street and are addicts and other unseemly types. I was warned by a local to be back inside the hotel by dark or no later than 9:00 pm and after my five-day stay I can say he was absolutely correct in giving this advice. One night the police had cordoned off the area around the hotel because a \"man with a gun\" was on the loose. There were many police cars and a helicopter. Even during the day I found the area undesirable...and I'm from New York City! If I were to return I would definitely stay further towards the Santa Monica Pier area. - The staff was the only reason I gave the hotel 2 stars.

You definitely get a front-row seat at the Cadillac! We had a room facing the side-street rather than the beach, which may have helped with the noise factor, but surprisingly everything gets real quiet anyway about 11 p.m., so I don't think music, etc. would be a big problem even in a boardwalk-facing room. Our room was small but quite adequate, very clean, with large windows and a ceiling fan. We also had an in-room fridge. I don't think there was air conditioning, but we didn't need it. The entrance to the hotel is actually on a side street, and you can pull up and unload baggage at the front door. If there is room in their small parking lot, you can park for a very reasonable $15 a day. The first two days we were there, we parked a few blocks away on the street for free, which was fine. Across the street from the hotel entrance is a little store, which was very handy for snacks, soda, newspapers, etc. Also across the street, and on the boardwalk is a reasonably priced restaurant/pub with outdoor seating where I spent every morning, having breakfast while my teenager slept in. This is not a luxury hotel, but it is comfortable, clean, safe, and right on the beach and the hugely entertaining boardwalk, where you can listen to music, get a tattoo, join a religion, and count the medical marijuana dispensaries -- all in one block! For higher-end fun, you can walk to the Santa Monica outdoor shopping mall. Also, just strolling along the charming lanes leading to the beach is fun, and you can walk to the neighborhood of canals for which Venice was named. For just hanging out, the hotel \"lobby\" has sort of a rec room, with couches and chairs, and though I appreciated their effort, I found it to be dark and uninviting.

I could see the ocean from all 3 of the 3 windows in my room on the 3rd floor.

I, personally, enjoyed the fact that after a long day of wandering, I could open my window and hear the live bands at Venice Bistro mix with the sounds of the surf, without having to go down the crowded bar. The hotel itself was quiet- I barely saw or heard another guest the entire weekend. I even had the rooftop to myself every morning for the perfect view of the sunrise. My room was very clean upon arrival, and kept that way by the housekeeping staff. The front desk staff were helpful in providing me with the information I needed, and very friendly.

The lobby, well that could do with being decorated, it was an awful pale blue colour but the hotel is awaiting its final part of renovations. The rest of the hotel though was amazing. The rooms have ipod dock alarm clocks which is more than what we got at the MGM in Vegas. Flat screen TV's with refridgerators (again more than the MGM). The bed was sooo comfy and the decor was very trendy and tasteful, the bathroom was great, simplistic and very effective and as for the views, well ... who could ask for anything more? The only down points, the awful BLUE lobby and the roof deck could do with some loungers. It has an amazing view of Malibu and to the otherside, you can just about see the Hollywood sign (on a clear day). The parking lot can be a bit tight but at least it has one (unlike many other hotels in LA). The area itself can be a tad rowdy but it is all harmless. Up the road, there seems to be an amount of homeless people that can get a bit loud at times but they keep out of the way and besides, they are ALL part of Venice as much as the hippy on the rollerblades playing Jimmy Hendrix (badly). Oh and... I did read others reviews about the dumpster trucks etc. clearing the trash and raking the beach early (7.30)... DOH, this is what they do wherever you stay and besides what would you prefer, a dirty environment but a lay in in the morning or a nice clean environment for the day. Or perhaps these folks think that little faries come and clear it all up in the middle of the night. The area has great bars and restaurants including the Whaler up the road or my favorite, Ricks on Main Street, or you could grab brekkie at the Fig Trees for an amazing half price omlette before 9am.

Most are pretty accurate to what we found on our stay. Venice Beach itself is a place of diversity. Anything goes, and expect it. If that is not what you enjoy, find another place to visit. For us it was fun! The Cadillac Hotel is eclectic, reflecting the area perfectly. We stayed on the second floor. The room was small but clean. There is no A/C at the hotel but with the windows open it was no too bad, but a little sticky as the hotel is right next to the ocean. Just next door is a small convenience store, a restaurant/bar, and lots of shopping. All in all, for the low price of the room and if you are wanting to visit the Venice Beach area, then this is a good place to stay. There are no luxuries here, expect only the basics, but it will give you a great feel of experiencing the entire scheme of things and a very convenient ok place to sleep. We have no complaints at all about our stay except for the parking. This was the one considerable downfall, as the lot was full (it is very small) and you are basically left to find a place of your own to park. There is free parking along the street about 2 blocks up, but your car has to be moved before 8:30a.m. the following morning or it will be towed. That wasnt a big problem because you can move your car to the beach parking lot which was $6.00 for all day. It makes for a moving game though, every day. The worst part was the walk back in the evening from your car to the hotel - in the dark. There are \"interesting\" characters around, we didnt feel completely safe after dark.

First off I am very aware that Venice Beach reflects a diverse and eclectic mix of society and in part that alone can contribute to one's experience. We felt safe and never encountered any threatening behavior from a small group of street people scattered amongst the crowd of faces from all parts of the world taking in the uniqueness of this somewhat artsy/edgy community.

Firstly, you can practically \"feel\" the crime rate in the area. The alleys this glorified motel sits in is littered with drunks, prostitutes and rude homeless. There is little outside apart from the glowing pink neon to indicate this is actually a hotel. The inside lobby is disgusting garage sale art deco, featuring a claustrophobic elevator, one-man sized, that made me fear for my life. I opened the door to my room, with high hopes of a respite from a day's travel from the East Coast, only to have them obliterated as the sickly halogen light illuminated the room. I have never seen a room in any hotel, short of Tokyo Coffin Motels, as small as this dismal room was. The queen size bed, which looked like something Ikea would throw out as \"cheap particle board\", occupied nearly the entirety of the room. In order to reach the far end of the room, one physically would have to contort to dodge the poorly mounted HDTV on the wall and the foot of the bed. Space between the wall and the bed was literally about 5 inches. the far side of the spartan room featured a spindley table and two rickety chairs that appeared to have been saved from the trash heap of a dwelling in the ghetto. They did not appear to be capable of bearing weight in the slightest. A small fridge hummed in the corner, and was the only place I could actually put my luggage up on. The heat and claustrophic effect of the room made me look instinctively for the thermostat. There was none. The room was not climate controlled. It had an ominous looking ceiling fan that I cranked to high while I flipped on the TV - an HDTV flat screen, ironically hooked up to cable quality rivalling that of tin-foil-covered rabbit ears antenna reception. The bathroom made me long for the comparatively wide open spaces of a lavatory on a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737. The shower was fine, so long as you stood perfectly still with your hands at your sides. See, not enough room to raise your arms in the shower. It was about 2 feet by 2 feet. The towels, of which there were three... had the texture of high grade sandpaper. Cotton thread count 30. I took my shoes off, and the carpet was actually sticky to the touch.

Me and my wife went to California to visit San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and other small towns. After staying in a lot of motels, we searched for a nice place. Our Guide Book didn\u00c2\u00b4t give us much options but recomended Cadillac because of its location. Whe got to Cadillac very late, after a long car trip. So, we just wanted to stay somewhere safe with a nice bed. When we got to the Cadillac, we though our GPS was wrong because all we could see were a lot of homeless in front of one building. We got really scared (first time we did not felt safe in USA) but since wwe didnt know about other places to stay and it was very late, we decided to give it a shot. Since it was saturday, they only had the simplest room avaiable (cant blame them for that). Even though, we had to pay 129,00 + tax per night. Well, scarred and without opitions, we decided to stay for one night and then look for another place. When we did our check in, we made very clear that we where propably staying only for one night. Right after we finished our check in, and before we go to the room, we asked if it was safe to leave some things in the car. Since the parking lot is payed, and expensive, i assumed they would be respossable for safety. The lady from the hotel told me that i had to take everything out of the car, because it was not safe and they dont assume responsability for anything that happens to the car and its contents. Worried, I asked her 1 minute and went to a public phone, in front of the hotel, and called for another hotel placed in Santa Monica. The Hotel in Santa Monica was classified as very good but expensive, the reason why i did not look for it before. I decided to expend more, but to feel safe, and decided to call just to see if they had vacancy. I found out that the hotel had rooms for 99 + tax per night. Very happy to have an alternative, i went back to the Cadillac Hotel and asked to cancel my check in, since i did not entered the room yet. Then I was told that if i cancelled it i would have to pay for that night and for the parking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very pissed off I decided to stay for that night. The room was very small but looked clean. So we started taking out of the car all luggage we had, felling unsafe, because the parking is on the back off the building, where there is almost no light and some homeless. After taking a shower in that ridiculous small shower box, we layed to sleep (about 1 am). After some minutes my wife started to scream, saying that shell felt something in her leg. We found a medium cocorach walking over the sheets. I call the front desk and asked to change room or to change sheets. The front desk lady said we couldnt change room because we had already \"used\" the on we were in and she also said that she had no other sheets avaiable for queen bad. I asked for changing sheets with any room and she said it was not alouded, because someone else could check in that night. Really pissed off, but tired as hell, we made a huge search in the room for another bugs, and we did found another cocoroach (smaller) under the bed. I called again front desk and complained again. I was told that cocoroachs have wings and they can come in anytime by the windows, so the hotel have is not responsible for that. What a joke! Ok.... on the next morning i asked to check out really soon (7:30 am). I was told that my check in was for 3 nights and, if i checked out early, i would have to pay U$ 75 fee. Actually, that was writen on the check in paper that I had signed, but I told the lady, on the check in, that i was checking for only one night, that i would propably change hotel, and she said that i would be charged, if i decided to do so. Felling robbed, i decided not to fight anymore against the hotel, and said i would stay one more night only, since i was not going to lose U$ 75 for nothing. Tha same day I got back to the hotel and informed, again, that i wass leaving on the next day. That night we did not found bugs on the room, but the noise from the homeless in front of the hotel made very difficult to sleep nice. On the next morning, again, I asked for check out and again I was told that there would be a U$ 75 fee, since I have to ask for early check out 48hs in advanced. The thing is.... since it was my second day on that hotel, is was impossible to ask for early check out. because I needed to know it even before I check in.... it is crazy. Incredulous that I was having this kind of treatment in the US, I asked to talk to the manager, but It was denied because the manager was at home with his family and the hotel was not autorized to call at his home for \"minor\" issues. I was told to call on the next day. I said I was staying one more day and had to talk with manager to check out withpout paying that fee. The front desk men just said: I am sorry, but there is nothing I can do for you. Conclusion. For the first time in my hole life I felt robbed, cheatted. In the last 6 years I have gone to a lot of coutrys, like Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay... and a lot of big cities, like Nova York, Londres, Paris, and I never felt so unsafe and so robbed like this time. So here is my review: - I was cheated by the front desk over and over - The Hotel is very expensive - Rooms are quite small and, though they look clean, we found cocoroachs on it (one in the bed). Staff did not autorized us to change room, neither changed the sheets. - The bath box is ridicously small - The hotel charges a lot for parking but gives no security - The manage isn\u00c2\u00b4t there... he likes to stay with his family why guests have cocoroach problems. After so many problems he should at least have called us. - The only thing that should be good is it\u00c2\u00b4s localization, since it is near the beach. Though, it is not good. There are homeless (a lot) walking around the hotel all the time, so it becomes really unsafe to get out of the hotel after it is dark. - I just felt happy when i check out, even being robbed and having to pay an absurd fee. My sugestion: DONT GO. Stay anywhere else even if you have to pay more for that.

Access to the roof top for beautiful sun sets and a nice cup of coffee in the morning. There is no A/C but you don't really need it if you keep your windows up and the fan on while you enjoy the beautiful sea breezes (of course I am in Phx. AZ so we were really enjoying the weather.)

We stayed a week and though we were all beginning to miss our own beds, our stay at the Cadillac was still very pleasant and met all of our needs, and for that we are grateful and happy to say that The Cadillac Hotel really took a lot off our shoulders especially in planning a week long trip for a very large party of people from ages 4 to 60. My personal opinion that is is a place for everyone, for any occasion, of all walks of life. The board walk is a very busy and loud place, but its one of the reasons we enjoy our time there so much.

My son and I were doing a college tour along with another mom and son and thought that staying on Venice Beach would be fun for the teenage boys. Our days were busy so it was actually the moms who enjoyed the beachfront and the boys slept in. The Cadillac is undergoing renovation, but it didn't affect us at all except that we enjoyed an attractively low rate. The rooms were simply appointed with beds, flat screen tv, and small fridge. New paint job, carpets, and bathroom greeted us from a long trip on the red-eye. Everything was very clean. There was no chest of drawers, but the closet has built-in shelves. There was no chair or table in one of the rooms, but I think there was a chair in the other. Try to get a room with the flat screen tv between the beds, not at the end of the room. The boys said the tv at the far end of the room wasn't as bad as they thought. They also had a sink outside the bathroom which they didn't quite understand, but which I think could be handy when sharing a room. Our favorite part was the location -- right on the beach. We enjoyed walking every morning along the walkways and down on the beach. There are some nice eateries and coffee places open early. The Fig Tree has wonderful, healthy breakfasts at half price before 9 a.m. I bought some breakfasts at Henry's market right across from the Cadillac, and they were delicious. We dared not venture on the beach after dark. There is a large 'bohemian' contingent situated at the gathering place in front of the Cadillac,. This did not deter us from staying there and we felt safe walking in a group back from the parking lot. There is a lovely Italian restaurant across from the Cadillac where we caught a nice glass of wine (although pricey) at the end of a day and we felt quite safe. The staff was very nice and helpful with any questions we had. We would all stay there again if we weren't going to spend much time in a hotel. It was perfect for us. I only wish we had more time to take in the sights of Venice Beach during the day, but we were busy visiting colleges and relatives. I often travel for leisure and stay at resorts with family.

We had booked the stay in LA early since we knew that the area around Santa Monica and Venice Beach is rather expensive. You can imagine the feeling when we arrived and was told that they had given our room to someone else! I had the order confirmation but they could not care less and showed us the door. It did not help much that we got the $22 deposit back, since I knew that now it would be impossible to find a decent and affordable place to stay. I was wrong! We found Cadillac Hotel in a hotel guide, cheap compared to many other alternatives but still not fully booked. In the beginning, this left me a little suspicious, but there were only good surprises! The hotel is right on the beach walk and our room had ocean view. Also, we got a queen size bed even though we could only afford to pay for the single beds, greatly appreciated being newly engaged. The room was nice and clean and there was Internet access for a small fee. There was even parking behind the hotel for a decent fee. There was also great overall service, e.g. we were missing one towel and it was sent up while I was still in the shower in a matter of minutes. Finally, the hotel went the extra mile to solve a misunderstanding when they did not have to. Before leaving we made an agreement that the hotel would ship a package back to Sweden that had not arrived yet. I signed a paper authorizing them to charge my credit card for the shipping costs. However, there was a misunderstanding regarding the shipping and it resulted in the shipping being much more expensive than we thought. The hotel had my approval to send it, and I was back in Sweden, so they could have ignored me. Instead they were kind and friendly and agreed to split the shipping cost. Great service!

The first room I checked into had not been cleaned after the former tenant so I was moved to a corner room (not ocean view). The room was furnished in 1980's garage sale art deco style (looks better in the site photos than it really is). The curtains fell off the rods when I tried to close them. I had no towels.

It looked like a dump and I was going to be stuck here for 5 nights. The paint effect hurt my eyes. Once we had been given our key (an old fashioned real key instead of the new card type ones in REAL hotels), we went to the lift to go to our floor only to be told it is sort of broken. Meaning we had to physically open the doors using all our strength and hold them open while getting in. It was very scary to say the least. The room was nothing flash. There were two single beds, and the bedding didn't even match. The beds were highly uncomfortable and I believe they came out on Noah's Arc. The TV, which didn't have a remote, only had one working channel and 8 Spanish ones that were fuzzy. The bathroom was tiny and very ill equipped. We didn't even have any towels. We were told at the desk that they should be there and then given to us for us to take them up. I walked off showing that they could bring them up to me. What else am I paying for? The TV didn't work, the beds were bad, the room smelt, the service wasn't good, no towels, and the area was VERY scary. I felt trapped in a tuna can at nights as Venice Beach has quite a lot of undesirable people walking around. The Candle Cafe which is right across from the hotel was the only place I was willing to walk to from our hotel so I don't run into any scary homeless people.

I should have known from the price that this place was a dump, but I'm adventurous, pretty easy-going and try to avoid cookie-cutter chains ... however, even I have my limits. First, the skateboard shop on the lower level plays music so loud you cannot hear on the telephone. Closing the window doesn't help. It starts early in the morning and doesn't wind down until well into the evening, but then the bums are ready for their shift. They sit in a courtyard under the windows and talk all night. Oh, and they get louder as they get more drunk. If you have a nice car or are worried about your rental-car deposit, you don't want to park in the lot. You must park so close to other cars that there's virtually no way to avoid getting dinged. If you get back late at night, there are no spaces left, so the management wants you to leave your keys with them so they can move your car in and out of the center aisle so other cars can get in and out. I wouldn't give my keys to these folks under ANY circumstances, even if my car were a junker. Yes, the hotel is on the beach, but the room windows, which are crowded by the fire-escape stairs, are so small you can't see anything unless you're sitting right next to them. And remember, this was their top \"suite.\" I can't even begin to imagine how horrid the hostel rooms must be. Everything in the room was sticky and grimy. The room stank, and I've seen better furniture dumped near Goodwill bins. The TV was a circa 1970 19\" black and white ... I think ... because I could't pick up any stations anyhow. The shower didn't work, which I dealt with, but when I told them at the front desk as I was leaving, they looked at me like, \"yeah? so what?\" If you want to see Venice and Santa Monica, just pay for a parking space near the beach, they aren't that expensive, or take a cab or public transit, then go back to a better hotel. There are tons of very cool older motels that people are buying and fixing up all around Santa Monica, so if you want to avoid the chains, it's not difficult.

That is it.... Nothing about the hotel is attractive. My wife and I made arrangements to stay in this hotel for 3 nights.

Actually, there are only about 15 to 20 spaces and cars are jam packed; and when we arrived around 11 p.m. at night, there was no where to park. The hotel clerk told me it wasn't his problem and that it was first come first serve parking situation. Secondly, the minute I parked by the hotel entrance, 2 people came up to me (they were either drunk or on drugs) telling me they'd call the police if I didn't move my vehicle ASAP. Next, I decided to see the inside of my room. It was nothing like it showed on the picture. The room was about 200 square feet with 3 small beds. The overall appearance of the room was like a homeless shelter. The entrance door didn't have deadlock, just one key. There is no air conditioning in the room. It so happened the day we arrived it was very humid and hot outside, and very stuffy in the room itself. I was also a bit concerned about our safety. In a matter of 10 minutes I saw all kinds of people hanging just outside, and inside the hotel.

Well, not in the Cadillac Hotel... just outside of the hotel there is a cafe and you hear voices, music, and other various noises which is annoying when you're trying to get some rest. Not being able to find a parking spot and considering all the other problems, we left the hotel.

We drove for 7 hours and just wanted to sleep. Assuring us that the \"malibu suite\" was the room for us we went upstairs to take a look. It was a dump but inhabitable at this point because we were exhausted, we barely slept that night and woke up bright and early with sore backs on a stained mattress. We asked for a refund on the second night we paid for because we wanted to go find a nicer hotel and we did, right up the road was a marriott. We were given the cell number to the manager of the cadillac \"Kerry\" to get a refund. This person will never call you back and if you do accidentally get her on the phone she is nicely selling you lies. After a week of leaving messages and emails I finally got Kerry on the phone who assured me the refund money for the night we didn't stay was on it's way to my bank account. She said two days tops it would show up in my account. Well here we are a week later, no refund. The place is a dump!!!!!

My 11 yr old daughter and I have just returned from a 3 week roadtrip through the Southwest and after staying in LA for three nights on the first leg of our trip we carried on to the Grand Canyon. We were to head to New Mexico after that but enjoyed LA so much we decided on a whim to return and stay for as long as we could. We made reservations here (June 1/05) after reading a great review in the Dummies LA book. We arrived after driving in from Death Valley (the hotel front doors are located at the end of a short alley which, granted, leads directly onto the Venice Beach promenade) where we had to put on our hazards so that we could unload all our luggage (hotel parking is back up the alley, take a right onto a one-way street and another right into another alley with say 18-20 parking spots). We were a little wary when we entered the hotel (potentially cool looking area but very dilapidated) but got to the front desk where a nice Oz girl checked us in. She gave us a key (who has these these days?) on which she wrote the room number with black felt. We got up there and let ourselves into a very scary looking room (like an army barracks) with two bunk beds side by side (like two feet away from each other) and NOTHING else, no tv, no side tables, no clock, no nothing and a very scary bathroom with no tub just shower and grotty sink which looked as though was a shared bathroom. I didn't know what to do other than almost cry and sat down with my daughter and my cell and the travel book to try to find something else. We went back downstairs to let them know we didn't think we could stay in that room as for $130 we had reserved a queen bed and figured we'd have something at least SOMEWHAT presentable. She asked which room we were in (I believe it was 308 but not certain) and immediately said oh no, that's not the room I put you in, you were supposed to be in 310 (or whatever it was-I really can't remember). We were iffy about looking at another room after this (as well, if the key for 310 opened 308 then was that a master key? And does anybody else have one as well??-scary thought) but decided we should do it to appease them and so they gave us the key for the new room. We went up and the key didn't work, we tried and tried but no luck. We went back downstairs where they gave us another one we went back up and again didn't work. We were very very frustrated by this time needless to say and went back down where they gave us the ACTUAL master key until they could find the correct key for the room. This finally worked and we entered a fairly nice if clean room with new carpet (chocolate brown) and a bed with a splintery chair by the tv and smallish bathroom with only a shower. THis being the total of all the furniture in the room which had obviously just been renovated as the mirror in the bathroom was hanging crooked and was not covering a mass of open wiring where the vanity lights would have been had there been any. There were no towels in the bathroom, the sink was crooked and there was no hardware (toilet paper holder, etc) at all. The best part of the room was the window which if you looked to the left had a truly fantastic view (if partial and to the left) of the promenade and beach. There was no alarm clock so had to ask for a wakeup call and when I phone to ask for towels I got three mismatched, threadbare grey ones that looked as though they'd be sent over from the haircolouring section of a hairdressers (bleach spots all over and I'm not exagerating). We were to stay for two nights but I phoned the other hotel I had called earlier (Best Western Hollywood Hills) and then cancelled the next night's reservation at the Cadillac. I spoke to the manager the next morning who was very nice and apologetic and we agreed that once all the remodelling has been done the hotel would probably be one to be reckoned with as the location really IS incredible however, I would advise you very, very strongly to call before you stay to ask if the renovations have been completed.
