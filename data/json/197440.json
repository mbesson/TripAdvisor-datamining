Everything else was sooooo clean, the staff were so friendly and helpful and spoke very good English. We loved having the kitchen and making our own breakfast and tea at night. The neighbourhood was safe and fun to explore and we loved the market that\u2019s in front of the hotel on Sundays and Thursdays. It was close to the metro which was intimidating at first but was extremely easy to use. The rooms were awesome over all, when we went I was sooo afraid we would end up sleeping on a sofa bed, however we had a very comfortable double bed. I asked the receptionist if we would be sleeping on a sofa because we had to wait for our room and she said that only if they are full or booked for the week would they give you a room like that, so I'm assuming that person who posted about the sofa bed was a last minute type person.

We arrived at 9.30AM after a long flight from Singapore and were told in typically brusque French fashion by the receptionist that there were no rooms available and that we should return at 2PM. Fair enough, that was the advertised check in time, albeit the message was delivered in an unnecessarily aggressive fashion. Fortunately for us, a rather charming blond Frenchwoman also on reception took pity on us and found us a room for an early check in. It was this action that attracted my one star in the rating, otherwise the stay was awful. The room had a pull-out sofa bed for two adults. I have never stayed in a hotel where the main/only bed was a pretty uncomfortable sofa bed. Sure, sofa beds can double for a second bed, but the only one? We stayed three nights. Not once was the room cleaned, towels or bedding changed or the garbage removed. Not once. Think of your own kitchen garbage piling up for three days! We were told we had a room with a balcony.

We packed a lot into 7 nights and have come home with sore feet but a trip to remember.

Overall - a clean accessible location with good staff for an affordable price. Cons: While we were there only one of the 4 or so front desk staff who we met spoke English well enough to assist us. However they were all as helpful as they could be given my poor French. The elevators are SLOW...I mean ridiculously slow especially during peak times in the morning Not really a con of the property....but I left by 2G SD camera card in my room (501) and tried unsuccessfuly to have it returned. I was told to make a formal lost request by email but the emails were never answered. I eneded up calling several times to get someone to acknowledge my quandry and was disappointed to learn that not only had the cleaning staff not found my disk but that even if they did they would have probably tossed it as trash (come on now, they can't be that clueless!) If you are a messy person your room will be messy for a week. I can't speak to the quality of the cleaning service since we left before a cleaning would have been due. Pros: Now the good stuff Very nice location. We got a room that overlooked the main Boulevard Renoir and it was a nice view. We could even see the Bastille monument. The hotel common areas are clean and well maintained. The kitchenette is well-stocked - plates, mugs, glasses, bowls, cutlery, kitchen knives and a range of other cooking implements (toaster, can opener, microwave, colander ect.). They provide detergent for the dishwasher but you will have to get your own dishwashing liquid Standard issue hotel toiletries and good toilet paper - bring or purchase your own soap, shampoo, toothpaste and lotion. They also provide hand towels and bath towels but no wash cloths. So if you are accustomed to showering with a wash cloth, bring/purchase your own. The pull out sofa bed is very comformable and large for a sofa bed (probably queen-sized). The arrangement of our room was such that we didn't even put it up everyday and we could still move around comfortably The staff was friendly and helpful especially the one front desk clerk who spoke english. Her name is Cecile and she helped us figure out the details for our day trips several times. Accessible to everywhere in Paris by train. There are at least 3 train stations within 10 minutes walk from the hotel. 2 well-stocked supermarkets not even 5 minutes walk away. Casino is the largest. Additionally there is a wonderful open air market (marche en plein air) on Sunday morning....make sure to brush up on your French as most vendors don't speak English well enough to help you negotiate your way through purchases. Your best bet is also to bring you own shopping bags not everyone has plastic/paper bags for free. The nearby Marais district is \"WONDERFUL\". Lots to eat and drink, endless people watching opportunities, and trendy boutiques, galleries and shops. We found the Frommers walking tour of the district to be a very nice if you have limited time to explore. There is a little breakfast area in the hotel and small concession area but you are better off getting something at the bakeries or supermarkest around. There is a \"Business center\" which really only consists of one computer int eh lobby. However they have free hi speed internet access. So if getting online at amoments notice is important to you bring your own computer. There is controlled card access to the property at all times which helps with the feeling of security.

We are both seasoned budget travellers who have been to Paris before. But if you've been to Paris before, you know that it's a tough one to stay away from! The Citadines made our trip even better. The Deal: We got an unbelievable package with Air Transat -- 1 week air+hotel+transfers from Toronto for under $800 CDN + taxes. What's the French term for 'no-brainer?' The price made our stay at the Citadines absolutely worth it, but I would have paid as much as $1200 + taxes for the same package, as you can make up some savings by taking advantage of the kitchen amenities. The Flight and Transfer: Good service from the Air Transat crew on our flight. The wait for luggage was lengthy. The transfer to the airport was seemless and efficient, and our driver was polite and courteous. No complaints there. The Location: If you like hip, energetic, beautiful neighbourhoods with loads of great bakeries, bistros, restaurants, galleries, museums, shopping, historical sights, and a busy nightlife strip, stay at the Citadines Bastille Marais or somewhere nearby in the Marais. It is by far one of my favourite neighbourhoods in Paris. The hotel is minutes from a Metro station and literally has everything within a few minutes walk. The Marais is a great neighbourhood for walking. The one caveat is that the park near the hotel has some sketchy folks hanging out at night. The Lobby and Staff: The lobby is clean and modern. The staff was friendly and helpful, and relatively comfortable in English. We spoke some French and they were most patient with us. The Room: We stayed in a studio room with kitchenette that was roomy enough for two, but two only. Some quick highlights: -Room was very clean and well-appointed, with a little balcony that made all the difference. Not a lot of character in the decor, but hey, prints of Van Gogh ain't half bad. -The roomy, clean, renovated bathroom had a deep tub, lots of hot water and good water pressure, hair dryer and good lighting. No fan though. -The tiny but well-equipped kitchen came with good dishware and utensils, fridge, microwave and even a mini-dishwasher! -Pullout couch was relatively comfortable and not hard to unfold. We rearranged the furniture a bit to make more space -A lot of closet space. Really. Not a lot of hangers though. But, an iron and board if needed. The Good-to-Knows: -Don't take the 10Eur/day breakfast they offer in the restaurant. That's a ridiculous price when you can buy a fresh pastry every day from one of the many bakeries in the area. Try them all! -Best time of day to get some time on the free computer with internet in the lobby: morning after breakfast, or during the day. There's an internet cafe close by on Ave. Beaumarchais -Bring dishwashing liquid, salt and pepper with you -They only clean the room once a week, but you can live with that, right? You're in Paris, cherie! -There's a Franprix grocery on the first cross-street near the hotel. Very handy -Enjoy the bustling open-air market on Thursday and Sunday mornings. -If you need some English telly, the TV shows BBC and CNN -Take care near the park by the hotel alone at night. The dodgy characters are out in full force. If you're a lady, walk with a friend - I overheard the concierge make this recommendation to a young woman in the lobby after an incident on the street. -If your room is smoky-smelling, just open the balcony doors and give it a good airing out. It will clear up. The Bottom Line: Citadines was a great home base for our trip. It was incredibly convenient and offered so much flexibility in terms of its location and amenities.

The kitchen was well equipped with a stove, microwave, toaster, dishwasher, refridgerator and all the pots pans and untensils you could need. The bedroom was a decent size with a HUGE closet that fit all of our clothes (4 girls so you know its big). The living room had a pullout couch that was comfortable enough for a few nights stay. Our room was on the first floor so we had glass doors that opened to a big patio area complete with tables and chairs. The hotel is very conveniently located across the street from the metro stop Richard Lenior which made EVERYTHING easily accessible. We were all very impressed with the metro system, its clean, cheap and easy to navigate. The area has many restaurants and shops but is still a quiet place to come home to at the end of the night.

We loved having a refrigirator as we love cheese and cold white wine. We ate out several times but also used the kitchen many times which saved us a lot of money considering the exchange rate. They don't provide room service everyday which really didn't bother us at all. we were too busy exploring the city anyways. service is good overall.

Only criticism or minor change I would make is swap the dishwasher for a small oven and we would be better able to use the kitchen. Not having a microwave at home it was all a bit too complicated to have to sit and read the instruction manual, although no such problem with the kettle or toaster. A manual for all electrical appliance is supplied in different languages. You don't really need to eat in as the area is surrounded by many reasonably priced, or, if you want to push the boat out, many not so reasonably priced restaurants! It is nice to get up and have breakfast though. The living space was bright and airy with air conditioning and the sofa bed was very comfy. The receptionist indicated some guests had been put off when told it was a sofa bed but that is clearly explained in the literature. Broadband connection, wi-fi and a telephone line makes this ideal if you need to work when you stay. The bathroom has a bath which is great if you need a soak after a long day or if you need waking up in the morning there is a power shower . The room was cleaned very thoroughly once during our stay as per agreement although you can pay to have this done as often as you wish. The location is fine and the market opposite is excellent for picking up bits and pieces of good quality and good value foodstuffs. Staff do however orientate you on arrival to supermarkets, pharmacies and the metro and bus services which is very helpful.
