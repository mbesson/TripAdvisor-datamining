It is a budget hotel and therefore the rooms are plain and simple but, offer you everything you need. While in Rome you tend to do lots of walking so all you really need is a bed and a clean room and bathroom which is what I found here. The host was very helpful. You are given your own key as no one mans the front desk, so you come and go as you please. It is away from all the tourist sites so is relatively quiet. The tourist sites are all within walking distance and the main train station is about a ten minute walk away. Paid 90 euros for a double room and after searching many sites, it was one of the cheapest places to stay. I would recommend anyone on a budget to stay here.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga", "Title": "\u201cDiscover Roma Stay\u201d", "Author": "salsharon", "ReviewID": "UR12695847", "Content": "Be sure to have cash so you can avoid the credit card situation.

The breakfast consists to pre-packaged Croissants and Tang and cookies. The Cappucinno is really good. Don't waste your time with the coffee. It is really close to the Termini. So just take a cab to the place. It's a pain dragging suitcases all the way there. It was only about 7-8 Euro's. The staff helped us heat a cup of milk for my daughter. The room is eqipped with a Fridge. There is a grocery store minutes away. All in all it was a nice place.

The staff was friendly and helpful. The location was about a ten minute walk to the metro, but in a mixed tourist/residential neighbourhood which we appreciated. There was an outdoor street market a few steps from the hotel and we loved walking through that. The room was large and had two large windows which faced the street, it was the largest that we stayed at in Europe. It was simply, but nice. We did not like the breakfast in the morning which was cookies or pre-packaged toast biscuits. We would prefer that they not advertise themselves as a bed and breakfast if they are not going to provide a real breakfast. For the price, we liked the accommodation. The bathroom was small, but not a problem. We also liked the large wooden door and ancient lift. It is a walk to all of the sights (it becomes harder the longer you stay in Rome walking around each day!). There were plently of restaurants close by. The noise from the streets was a bit loud on some nights. Overall we would consider staying here again, if traveling on a budget. If we had a bit more of a hotel budget, we would stay at a place that was closer to the sights and provided more of a real breakfast.

For like 60-70 euro it just cannot be beat. On the positive side the staff is very friendly, the rooms very large, clean and comfortable (though I wouldn't classify them as luxurious), and breakfast is brought to your room every morning. I really liked the location, though it isn't really next to any single big site. Everything is spread out in Rome anyway but I loved how this was a quick 5-10 minute walk from the central train station. From there you can catch a bus, either metro line, or trains to the airport. Perfect! On the negative side of things, yes you really should pay with cash. I had read reviews and was prepared, and there are plenty of ATM's in the area so its no big deal. They do ask if you pay up front rather than upon checkout. Also as I said the location can be viewed as bad as you are not really close to any of the glamours sites except the main train station (but in my opinion this is really better because it gives you quick access to the entire city rather than just one of the sites). Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to see all of Rome and doesn't want to break the bank.

The decor is nice: long, flowing drapes; large, easy to open window with shutters; terra cotta tile and modern bath w/large shower. The small fridge was perfect and the \"mini-bar\" items (incl. water, juice, beer) were extremely well-priced. We bought our own at the local supermarket a few blocks away. BTW, it is a huge store w/ good produce, wine, snack departments. The staff is extremely welcoming and speak perfect English. (Some of my attempts at Italian made them ask ME to repeat myself in English. LOL) Now for the bad part: We were forewarned about the credit card issue, thanks to this site, and sure enough the sign was posted stating that the machine was out of order! We came prepared though with Traveler's Checks (in Euro) that we specifically put aside for this purpose. We asked about the machine the first day and were told that \"maybe it would be fixed by the time we checked out.\" You could tell from her tone that this was a subject of contention. The morning before our day of departure we presented them with the traveler's checks. The girl called her \"boss\" to see if she could accept them and was given the go-ahead. We returned to the hotel that night at around 10pm to be told that the checks were not acceptable after all. I explained that we needed to be on our way to the airport at 7 the next AM, that our bank (B of A) charges $5 in addition to what the European bancomats charge to withdraw cash, and that on top of it all, we had signed the checks over to them! In a largely unprofessional move, she made us get on the phone and speak to \"The Boss,\" who told us it would cost her $27 euro to cash the $250 in checks. Ridiculous. I then spent an hour on the phone calling the Traveler's Check company to report that the checks had been signed over and then refused, making sure that we could get our money back for them. I was told that the banks in Italy charge a 1.5 % fee to cash the checks, but this is no different from what a merchant pays when accepting a credit card. In the end, they ran the credit card. We did not pay an extra fee. The machine worked. This hotel plays games with their guests because they are operating below the law. I'm sure a local cambio or Tabacchi shop DID want to charge them a lot to cash the checks! The bottom line is our awesome stay was tainted by the experience at the end. We witnessed other guests running to the ATM when they probably needed to be headed to the airport or train too. I'm glad I stood my ground and refused to play their COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY GAMES, but next time I will take out plenty of cash in the first place and hand it over when I arrive. The hotel is an affordable, clean, safe and very comfortable accommodation for the price point. What they save in paying taxes and god -knows- what kind of hotel fees, they do pass on to you! At 90 euro a night, we would stay again and have the cash ready!", "Date": "May 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "leaada", "ReviewID": "UR4026359", "Content": "We were very pleased with the spacious room and bathroom, friendly staff and decent location.

We have mixed feelings about this hotel. Positives included reasonable room price, close proximity to train station and two supermarkets; large room and bathroom; overall cleanliness; friendly helpful staff (provided us with breakfast the night before when we had early starts, gave us directions and suggestions for sightseeing and rang tour company for us to confirm bookings) and fantasic restaurants outside hotel. Negatives for us included no internet (website said there was) hot room (I think you had to pay for Air conditioning), cigarette smell (coming from outside?), hairs on the bed sheets, grubby shower with very hard water pressure/ poor drainage which caused water to fill up to ankles, towels that had no absorption, unpleasant breakfast, and close proximity to dubious area around train station. We were also disappointed that after a six night stay the hotel owner would not let us leave our luggage in the room for a short period after the checkout time. They also were not keen to accept credit cards even though we were given the impression before we ariived that credit card would be fine- there was a sign suggesting that they did not have the facilities yet, however the credit card machine was clearly in view, they then proceeded to try and talk us out of using our credit card, and then when we did we were charged extra. If we were in Rome for a short stay and needed to be close to the train station we would probably stay there again otherwise we would look elsewhere.
