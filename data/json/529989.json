It is also owned by the people that run the Hotel mirage. When we arrived, we luckily knew a little Italian and could decipherer of its whereabouts (piano is 'Floor\" in Italian, by the way!) We climbed the stairs, buzzed in and was eventually greeted by a gentleman that showed us our cozy room. It was quite warm, however we noticed the air-con unit. The tv made a buzzing noise, it had a very good selection of tv (if you can speak Italian, of course) and there was plenty of storage for the time we spent there. The Bathroon was nothing like the one they advertise, its was however in very good condition. Hot water was rare, its a shared boiler for the building (another hotel in this particular partition) so time it right! Our overall stay was enjoyable, the room was an easy 6/10. THE CONS AND PROS! CONS: The walls are VERY thin. Sadly there was a family staying in various rooms that let their children used the hall way as a play ground. The staff were not helpful in the slightest to quell the noise at 12.30am, and in some cases, they could not care less. Beds were not very comfortable. Access is up lots of stairs, not what you want after a day of walking around Rome! the lift looks very unsafe and aged. \"Free WIFI\" never worked. THE PROS: Open 24hrs, so you can come and go as you please. Daily cleaning via room service Mini Bar, we took the drinks out and used it for our own bits, then returned the items at the end - the SPAR round the corner was brilliant for snacks and drink :) Mediocre breakfast, staff was quite 'short' with you and reluctantly polite. (a pro?) Air-con Excellent location if you plan to use the metro, due to it being a stones throw from the central station, and the shops (Spar, station shops and coach pick up point) are VERY close. Perfect for people that would rather use their hotel as a 'sleep only' point and are looking to limit their spending on accommodation. All in all, I would have personally have wanted to stay somewhere a bit more in the center, as we walked everywhere and in the evening all the beggars and homeless make you feel a tad paranoid. However I'm happy we stayed in a comfortable place that helped make my first time abroad very enjoyable. Hope this helps!", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cworse than horrible\u201d", "Author": "drahiser", "ReviewID": "UR81837275", "Content": "The hotel's two star rating is a joke. It should be a zero star hotel. From the time we walked through the dirty, grimy door and walked up three flights of dirty, dark stairs, you feel like you need a shower. The manager is up the street (there is no lobby as such). and just getting back to your room requires buzzing somebody to buzz you through the door. The room was small and poorly lit (if we had wanted to read something, it would have to have been in the bathroom. No drinking cups--even plastic. We could hear water running down through the pipes in the wall next to the head of our bed. Lots of noise from outside. The toilet leaked loudly all night. The icing on the cake was the door two doors down from us which had a Q-tip sticking out of a hole in it. We could not wait to get out of there!", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cBIZARRE HOTEL, GREAT LOCATION, GREAT VALUE !!!\u201d", "Author": "icialex", "ReviewID": "UR46365258", "Content": "reading the comment I was afraid of what we might find for the Hotel. I won't talk about the 2 hotel thing because a lot of review talks about this... the elevator is not such a big deal because if you are used to travel in Old Europe in budget Hotel, few of them have elevator. The location fo the Hotel is just great, train station and metro station across the street. Also, you will find grocery store across the street. At night, the neighbourhood look suspicious but in fact, not a real deal, even with two young child... I felt secure.... Room are small but fonctionnal, In fact, It was a good thing to have a small room it force you to get up early in the morning. At night, a lot of people on the street but I never add any trouble to sleep. In general, a great spot for a cheap price, a good deal in ROME !!!", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cBed Bugs Bite\u201d", "Author": "Printer14", "ReviewID": "UR36762464", "Content": "Great location, close proximity to tourist sites.

It is located by the Termini station, in the heart of Rome, excellent transportation to all sights. I stayed at the hotel with my husband and another couple in a 4 bed room. It was more than we expected. The room was clean, it was also cleaned every day, new towels were provided every day, and breakfast was included.( croissant, toast, butter, jam, ham and chees, and a cup of tee or coffe, or chocolate) The price was also very good 21.5 Euro/person/night,(www.bookhotelsinrome.com) therefore I would never expect what I get. It was cheaper than a hostel what we were searching. ( For same price we could get a 6-8 person room in a hostel with shared bathroom. ) So what I can only say, I would recomment that hotel to everyone, and in my next trip to Rome, definitely I will stay here again. I almost forget, there was also airconditioning in the room, which worked:) It was about 30-32 degrees, so we needed it.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Youngstown, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cStrange hotel\u201d", "Author": "jmc9004", "ReviewID": "UR14559386", "Content": "I stayed in hotel Halifax for 4 nights with about 20 girls from my university. The reception desk is in one room, then you have to walk back outside and into another door to get to the actual hotel. The hotel is advertised as Hotel Mirage and Halifax. It is actually two seperate hotels. Once you get in the doorway, you see old marble stairs. There is no elevater. The first floor was another random hotel ( hotel luciano), the second floor was apartments, and finally the third floor was hotel halifax. It was horrible dragging the luggage up the never ending stairs. No one offered to help. When we got up there, only one room was ready. We had to put all of our luggage and all 20 of our bodies into this small room crammed with 5 cots until the other rooms were ready. The rooms were very small and had old broken cots with sheets for blankets. The room was pretty clean though. The bathroom was small. We had five rooms and each was different. The bathroom was relatively clean. Some mold due to the lack of ventilation. We had some issues with water pressure and temperature on some days. To go to breakfast, you have to go outside and into hotel mirage. The food was okay. Just fruit and bread basically. The location is good; right around the corner from Termini. We went out one night and came back late to find that the door leading to the old marble stairs was closed and locked. We went to the reception desk down the street and the man explained that he didnt have a key. We had to enter hotel mirage and he opened a random old wooden door and led us through several hallways which led to the 4th floor of the building. We then had to walk down one flight until we finally reached our hotel. Overall, it's an okay place to stay for a few nights. We just had a lot of problems. Also, the woman who cleans the rooms and serves breakfast is rude and doesn't speak one word of english. Also, you only get towels every two days and you can't control your own heat/AC. I'd recommend staying elsewhere.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Halifax", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d529989-Reviews-Hotel_Halifax-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$79 - $166*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Milazzo 4</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "529989", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/1/1/4/8/198411/198411.jpg"}}
