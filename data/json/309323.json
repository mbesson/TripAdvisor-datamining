{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good value We were very happy with the value for money at this hotel, particularly considering what our other options were for staying on the beach in southern Bali. I think you save a huge premium because of the fact that the hotel is a few minutes (5 maybe) walk from the beach instead of right on the beach. We got a huge room for $75 and all the space was nice, but we would have been ok with less and next time would probably get a smaller room. Our room was billed as a villa, but there were two units in our building and it was hard to see what the difference was between a villa and a room. The bathroom was gigantic and elegant, though with no outdoor shower. The restaurant was lovely (check the pictures on this site), with good food and reasonable prices. The room was very quiet and had some nice statues and pieces of Balinese furniture. We didn't use the pool, but it looked nice. The breakfast buffet was great. The location is great. You are a couple of minutes away from the restaurants on the beach (which we found to be greatly overrated) and only a short walk to the interesting fish market on the beach, where boats arrive with the day's catches. Jimbaran is much nicer to be in than Kuta but not as isolated as Sanur or Nusa Dua. If you need to get to Kuta for restaurants or surfing it is a short inexpensive cab ride away.", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR786086777", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JoeLikesBali"}, {"Content": "value       My Messy Room", "Date": "Jul 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR462980632", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kristian_page"}, {"Content": "Very nice hotel, will be visiting it again.

Please don't expect all the amenities from a resort chain such as Westin, Shangri La or Hyatt. It's locally owned by some balinese businessman, but it's a quaint and charming hotel. The hotel pool can get overcrowded at times, but nevertheless the swimming pool is there to enjoy. For the price that we paid (Rp. 400.000/night for a superior room include taxes and breakfast), it's actually a descent hotel. Please note that the price is for local Indonesian tourists only (but do try to bargain or mention this during booking). We highly recommend the traditional balinese massage (at Rp. 50.000/person for a 60-minute massage). From the hotel, you can take a 2-minute walk to Jimbaran Bay, which is very famous for its local fresh seafood restaurants set right on the beach, few meters away from the water. We highly recommend the dinner in one of these restaurants as the setting can't be more romantic than this, though the prices are definetely inflated for tourists. For your guideline: Tourist price for 100gr of freshly catch fish is Rp. 15.000. Local Indonesian tourist price for 1kg of freshly catch fish is Rp. 55.000. BTW, Jimbaran Bay beach hardly has any water sport activities. At least while we were there, we didn't see anything going on.There is a shuttle that goes from the hotel to Kuta area. The shuttle stops and picks hotel guests in front of some building, right by the middle of a very busy street somewhere in Kuta. If you need to catch a cab back to the hotel, a cab should run you no more than Rp. 25.000. Other than breakfast, we hardly dine at the hotel's restaurant. There are many and better options out there. Speak to one of the receptionists, and they will be able to recommend or give you information on local hang outs/restaurants. Sometimes these places will arrange for transportation to and from Puri Bambu.To summarize: if you're looking for a good bargain and not looking to spend the whole day inside the hotel, then this is the place to be. If you're looking to just relax, a bit reluctant to travel to get to places, or do any watersport activities, then this may not be the hotel for you. We can NOT picture this hotel to be a honeymoon resort.", "Date": "Dec 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR933406537", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "mar1an1"}, {"Content": "Good hotel       Restaurant", "Date": "Oct 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR288299091", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Krystoffff"}, {"Content": "Good family hotel Puri Bambu is a nice family hotel for its price range. Stayed there 6 nights in July 2007. Good pool, with a nice holiday atmosphere, with pool towels, nice gardens although a little too \u9225\u69aetony\u9225? Staff is very friendly with children. The rooms are clean with good beds, good size TV sets, plenty of soap and shampoo. Standard rooms are a bit too dark, as the only two windows are very narrow, and the lights are dim - but this may be a Bali style. Lunch/dinner food is very good. Breakfasts have eggs made to order but there can be no toasts or pineapple slices for 10 minutes at times. There are pleasant dining tables separated by water close to the restaurant.The true weak point of Puri Bambu is its location. My tip to go to a good beach: take a 5 min taxi ride (10 000 Rp) to the Puri Jimbaran hotel where a public path leads you to a clean beach. Do not choose Puri Bambu thinking to go to the beach on foot with children: the beach is 10 min down the road on foot, but that road is busy enough to be unpleasant, one way with motorbikes circulating both ways, with NO pavement to go to, with litter lying a bit everywhere, and the surroundings are unpleasant in particular with an ice making factory nearby and high walls. Also, the beach itself is not clean, with dog excrements here and there, and the smell of the grilling fish from expensive beach restaurants doesn\u9225\u6a9b help making you enjoy the place.", "Date": "Aug 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR602109515", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "PeterValdOise"}, {"Content": "Thanks to our driver Putu Nastra Puri Bambu is a good hotel.

The surroundings were beautiful here with stone carvings everywhere and serene gardens. The room was nice, large, and had air conditioning, but there were two wee problems. The hotel is made mostly of concrete and there weren't many windows or much lighting, and there were really loud roosters nearby for most of the night. I don't have enough experience with roosters to know if this is a seasonal thing or similar, but be wary. The pool is very pretty and the hotel offers easy access to the beach restaurants.
