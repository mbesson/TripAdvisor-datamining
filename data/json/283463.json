Our two boys (ages 8 and 6) attend school in a district that recently changed over to a year-round calendar, so they now have a two-week vacation each October. We discovered Royal Holiday via its #1 rating on TripAdvisor for hotels in the Daytona Beach area. Our fantastic experience affirms for us the value-added service provided by the TripAdvisor website, as we would never have found this place on our own. We stayed in an efficiency that directly overlooked the ocean. From our room, we could look through our window (or our open front door, if we chose to keep it open) and at various times see: \u2022 top-notch surfers riding the waves by the fishing pier \u2022 paddleboard surfing, where surfers stand straight up and use a long paddle to propel themselves through the ocean and catch waves \u2022 dolphins playing in the sea \u2022 fishing boats in the distance \u2022 sunrise or sunset over the ocean \u2022 the constant crashing of waves on the beach. As others have noted in previous reviews, the owners Marilyn and Pierre and wonderful and make you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. We spent all week on the beach. We went Boogie Boarding every day, and found many other ways to relax and enjoy the beach including reading, walking, building sand castles, collecting sea shells, going out on the fishing pier to watch the surfers up close, and even taking a surfing lesson from two pros (via the Daytona Beach Surfing School). We also spent time in the salt-water pool at the Royal Holiday, which was refreshing and a fun place to hang out. The Royal Holiday has plenty of Boogie Boards, beach chairs, and sand toys available free of charge for guests to use. We ate in every day as part of our DIY beach vacation. There is a large Publix supermarket less than a mile away up the road, and with the kitchen in our room we were able to prepare all of our own breakfasts, lunches and dinners. We found the Royal Holiday to be the perfect location for a DIY family beach vacation. It was also quite affordable - our October stay cost less than $100/night.

This is one of the last GREAT small beachside motels in Daytona left after all the condos have been built in the past few years. Royal Holiday is everything we want in a small, family-owned beachside motel. The Joncas family take real pride in their small hotel and we really enjoy staying with them. Just three doors south of the Sunglow Peir, location is excellent, especially for Port Orange access via the Dunlawton Bridge. The motel has only about 30 to 32 rooms and two floors (top floor has best views of ocean), but the rooms are huge, clean, and bright, windows worked well and sealed good, the closet had adequate space for all our clothes with large mirror on front, and the A/C worked very well in the room, which is important in a high-humidity place like the beach. The beds aren't quite as firm as I'm used to, but I sleep on a rock-hard mattress at home, so that's probably not an issue for most folks. We had a full kitchen, with full-sized fridge/freezer and stove. Plenty of pots, pans, and cooking utensils are supplied as well. The bathroom is small and bathroom storage is limited, but there is a good-sized cabinet under the sink vanity. The bathrooms are also very clean and well maintained, even if the fixtures are older. The Joncas family are very good about keeping the entire motel very well maintained and will have any problems you encounter fixed as soon as they can. Housekeeping service is very good, but is not provided on Sunday or holidays, so fair warning if this bothers you. They do, however, leave you enough towels, soap, and toilet paper to get you through. Location of food services is very close by, with some great restaurants in the area (within 1 mile even). Port Orange is just across the Dunlawton bridge and you can find everything there, including a Wal-Mart Supercenter and a Super Target. The K-Mart in Port Orange (Nova Rd) has now closed, but there's still plenty of other businesses in the area and more restaurants than you can count. I definitely recommend this motel for a beach-side Daytona stay.
