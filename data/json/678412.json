Also close to the \"T\" so take the Silver Line across the road from the hotel to South Station (via tram) and then hop on the train, if you want to go to Harvard Square, or Boylston area (for the Apple Store).

Water bottles were $4 each - usually you get 2 complimentary at other hotels. The business center -- 2 computers working (3 in all); very cramped and next to a noisy conference room, difficult to get any work done. Many people tried to walk in but all computers were taken. Wifi is available in the room BUT for an additional 16-20$ per day depending on if you want fast or slow WiFi. Found myself wondering if this should really cost extra with such a sub par business center. The breakfast - not cheap --- $22 per person for buffet, though it was very tasty. There is a continental version for $16 as an alternative or a Starbucks which is the cheapest option. Due to the location, not many breakfast alternatives.

The area has a couple of hotels, a few sit down restaurants, the convention center, and a couple of office buildings, but not much else. Very few people live in the immediate vicinity, so the area is pretty dead at night and on weekends. It almost seems like a suburban \"corporate office park\" near the water.

We live 20 minutes away, but wanted to use our Marriott points for a \"staycation\". The weekend rate for this hotel was on the high side, but not for Boston. Location: We found this to be a great location for exploring an area of Boston that is \"up and coming\"- the Seaport. The convention center and exhibition center anchor this area, and the hotels and other attractions are in between. There is a Silver Line T station here too, so arriving from the airport would be easy, but getting to the other areas of Boston would require a few changes. This area and hotel is really designed for conventions, but the locals have found the Institute for Contemporary Art, the lively bars (Whiskey Priest ) and the restaurants (Strega on the waterfront, Legals on the waterfront) and it was a very lively place on a Saturday night. Its a young crowd, as there are many college students and young professionals in Boston. It feels very empty during other times if there is no convention, because the infrastructure is built to accommodate huge convention groups. There was enough to do within walking distance of this area to keep us busy for a weekend. We also enjoyed all the pocket parks and urban art installed in the area as we wandered. Clearly, the area could use a few more shops, but the galleries and artisans have found the area, and hopefully can afford to stay. We never felt unsafe or that the area was risky in any way. Of course you have to use your city savvy in any large city, but overall, we never saw anything or anyone that felt threatening in this area. Theme: This hotel is a Marriott brand. We found it to be of modern design, much like any of the Renaissance brand. There was nothing about the hotel that was specifically themed to Boston. Room: Like the hotel, we found the room to be clean, modern, spacious but nondescript. Also our King was decorated with neutral stripes on the wall and a very large colorful couch. but it was missing any kind of chair in the sitting area. It was if they had just removed the \"other queen\" and the room had a blank spot where that bed should have been! The room had a fridge, a coffee bar, and was set up to \"wire\" up easily with plugs and connections right on the desk top. Service: We didn't need much aside from valet parking and check in; all of which was efficient and polite. Things to do in the area: This area is \"up and coming\", and it's been discovered by locals if not tourists yet. There are several branches of excellent local restaurants in the area, such as Strega (on the water front) and Legal Seafood (3 levels each offering something different) as well as Anthony's Pier 4, an old favorite. A couple of more casual eateries such as Remy's Sports Bar and the very popular Whiskey Priest bar on the water front, lines out the door by 8:30 PM (as we were headed back to retire, LOL!) Art and culture your thing? the New ICA (Institute for Contemporary Art) is an excellent addition to the city with in walking distance, in addition to the terrific art inside, the view outside is pretty amazing too! Additionally, we enjoyed many of the outdoor art installations in and around the convention and exhibition centers and at the MBTA station! Yes, a very dramatic sculpture of 4 horseman dedicated to the Polish resistance during WWII. We also enjoyed an interesting exhibit offered nearby (a few blocks off the waterfront) at the Grand Circle company's home office. They have a lovely \"free!\" art exhibit area, which featured the Washburn's photos (one of the longtime trustee and founder of the Museum of Science) and vintage travel posters and artifacts, as well as a comfy living room like area where guests are welcome to relax, check email and learn more about Grand Circle travel (if you want, no pressure) What a surprise that was! Right across the street was the Boston Fire Museum, we didn't visit, but just peeked. Another freebie (donations accepted) and it looked like a blast for the kids with turnout gear to try, a pole, and the bell (clang, clang, clang!) and real firefighter to answer questions. In the same neighborhood, look for Flour, and incredible bakery that offered indoor and outdoor seating, and yummy baked goods and fresh sandwiches of every type! taht was plenty enough for us in a 24 hour visit, but there would be more if you wanted for instance: harbor cruises debark out of this area too!", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dix Hiils, NY", "Title": "\u201cA Fine Choice Near the Convention Center\u201d", "Author": "JLTP", "ReviewID": "UR119148025", "Content": "I stayed for two nights while attending a conference at the convention center located a short 5-7 minute walk away.

So I evacuated - only to get the alarm tripping again on my way down saying all clear - again so loud it hurt my ear drums - I mean my ears were ringing from it. At least no one will EVER sleep through a fire alarm at this hotel! Biggest reason I will not return is that on top of very high room rates per night they want to charge you $18.00 a night for WIFI from your guestroom. That is an unreasonable charge with their room rate and in these times. If your doing business here, you only get free WIFI if you sit in their small lobby.

I'd say it's a great place for business travel, but I would consider it less appealing for vacationing as it's a fair distance from Boston's typical main attractions and historical center. Most of the guests at the hotel seemed to be there on business. I know that there was at least one other conference also taking place at the hotel. As I walked around the area, both during the day and in the evening, most of the people that I saw were in suits. As a business traveler, the proximity to the airport was ideal. You really couldn't get any closer. It was just across the water, and I could watch the planes taking off from my room. I was on the top floor (21) facing the water and part of the airport, and based on conversations with other guests, it sounds as if I had one of the best views the hotel offers, which was just so-so. In addition to the airport and a slice of the water, I could see parking lots filled with industrial shipping vehicles and a couple new luxury buildings. I found my room to be a little on the small side, but it was clean and well maintained. The room decor was subtly nautical, without being over the top. The lobby of the hotel is sleek, urban, and modern--although it felt as if the decorators were trying a little too hard (I mean...a fake tree in the center of the revolving door?). The staff was very attentive, polite and helpful. I would venture to say that it was some of the best service I've ever received at a hotel. The only real downside for me was the room service. I ordered dinner on one evening, and while the food was good, it arrived cold. I never ate at the actual hotel restaurant on the main floor because there were a handful of other options a half block away. If you're looking for a delicious dinner during your stay, I would highly recommend Temazcal Cantina, which is just around the corner. It was the highlight of the trip. It's an upscale Mexican restaurant with a diverse menu of impressive and inventive dishes and a large array of cocktails. All three of the people with whom I dined were very, very happy with it as well. If you do have some extra time on your hands, the hotel is a 10-minute walk to the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art. One of my conference's evening networking events was held there, but unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to see any of the art because we were in an event space separate from the galleries. The next closest attraction is probably the Boston Aquarium, which is a good 20-minute walk. I attended a reception there and enjoyed the penguins, various types of sharks, the enormous sea turtle, giant rays, blowfish, etc. It's an interesting place with an unusual design (a spiral ramp takes you around an enormous tube-shaped tank, allowing you to get incredibly close to the sea life). All in all, I recommend this hotel for business travelers and anyone looking to be close to the airport. If your priority is tourism, you'll probably be happier if you stay in an area closer to the action and/or the historical sites.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel for a conference\u201d", "Author": "phillytraveler71", "ReviewID": "UR118828357", "Content": "Recently returned from a conference held at the hotel.

I ordered what I believe is billed as Organic Maine Oats, along with a bagel. The oatmeal arrived as a thin gruel and the toasted bagel was slathered in butter or some such spread. I would have sent both back, but since I was with other people, I only asked that the bagel be replaced with one toasted but dry.

We were in town for a wedding. We flew in Friday. We had an early arrival. From the airport we opted to take a water taxi to the hotel. The water taxi dropped us off at the world trade center right near the hotel. From there you just have to cross the street to get to the hotel. The water taxi is $10 per person for one way. You can opt for a $17 round trip. We took the one way. and figured we would just take a cab on our departure. The cab would turn out to be much faster and cheaper. The view of the harbor and city skyline is amazing on the way with the water taxi. When we arrived at the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised when they told us a room was ready. We arrived way before check in time to get a jump start on our trip. We had a standard king. The room was super big. The bathroom was typical size. The room had a king bed, a work station, a full size sleeper sofa, coffee table and a chair. It was the biggest standard king i have ever stayed in. A marriott / Renaissance bed is the best bed you will find in a hotel. i never heard any hallway noise in our room. The view was just average but ok for us because it is not why we stayed there. The location of the Long warf is better than this hotel, but there is plenty to do around this hotel as well. Plus it is a short cab ride to the best spots. Or you could walk the two miles if you would like. We walked and regretted it. We happened to be up here when temps tipped 100 degrees. On a cooler day the walk would be great. The hotel is only a couple yearsw old and feels brand new. The breakfast in the hotel restaraunt was great. It is a bit pricey for the buffet but very good food. I recommend the french toast! The staff was very helpful and attentive. Wireless comes at a cost of $16 a day. the lobby has a couple computers in the lounge area where you can use the internet for free. They just ask that you keep your usage quick to allow others the chance to use it. There is also a business center that we had the chance to use a couple times. We never had to pay anything, but i have in othe Renaissance hotels. Valet is around $35 a day i think. I did not have a car. The hotel is only a ten minute drive by cab. the cost is around $15.

No amends were made at the time the error was recognized, had to call Mariott customer service for clarification who then raised the issue to the on-site manager, who did respond until the 3rd day into our visit, offerring to 'move' us to the higher level for the remainder of our stay. Really after being in the room for 3 days, does anyone really want to pack everything to move for the balance of my stay, waste of my time. 4. Club Lounge: breakfast was crazy, they didnt have food at 8AM when breakfast ends at 9:30AM, no milk, no bread, no bagels, no fruit, no eggs (continental breakfast) and no coffee (and when they did it was cold and bad). Running out of the most basic of fruit, the banana. What a shame!!! Plus they only had one person servicing the lounge who couldn't do everything, felt back for that guy. 5. Club Lounge--it was a shame that they did not extend the hours of the lounge on 7/4 so that people can enjoy the fireworks that started at 10PM. I would think that management would make an exception to accomodate so that people can enjoy the unobtsructive view into the city, but no, we (approx 30 ppl) were requested to leave. 6. Navigator (direction guide, concierge)--was slow, we had to wait on long lines to get information and when we did they weren't really helpful and I found the staff rude.

Club Lounge: have to give points to the staff managing the lounge who work alone with no back-up when it gets hectic. Facilities: clean, pool was nice and gym was suffice.

If I was a concierge, I think I would make it my business to know what is happening locally and be able to give recommendations based upon the type of group you have. For example, we heard that there was going to be a free Earth Day outdoor concert downtown and wanted to know where it was located. The concierge had no idea that there was one, and after looking on the internet, told us that Earth Day wasn't until May....after some back and forth she realized she was looking at last years schedule.

The rooms are well appointed and clean and I would stay here again if the customer service wasn't so bad. I booked my hotel 3 months in advance and made a specific request for a king sized bed. I requested the bed not only through room selection, but through a note and a phone call. When I arrived, they placed me in a double bed room and the receptionist told me that \"to her dismay\" there were no king sized beds available and that there was \"nothing that can be done.\" The best part of sleeping in a hotel is the chance to sleep in a bed bigger than your own. Instead, I had to stay in a room by myself with two beds that are smaller than my bed at home. For $250 a night, I was not happy. The safe in my room did not work, and because I was expected at a conference in 20 minutes, I did not call the front desk to have it fixed. Having it fixed while I was gone would have defeated the purpose of using the safe in the first place, and without the safe, I did not feel comfortable having my room cleaned, so I missed out on the service that you expect when staying at a hotel. When I checked out with CAROL at the front desk and mentioned the issues I had while I was staying there, she told me there was nothing she could do for me. The price could not be adjusted (even though the double bed rooms were cheaper than the king rooms at my time of booking) and there was nothing she could do out of shear customer service. She told me that I should have called the front desk about the safe and I explained to her that I had to leave the room and that having the safe repaired while I was away defeats the purpose of the safe in the first place. Carol looked at me like I was not worthy of her time or worthy of this hotel, and refused to even acknowledge that I was a customer who had an issue. As a business traveler on a company expense account, the discount was not what mattered to me. I wanted her to acknowledge the problems with my stay and at least apologize on behalf of the hotel. She represented the hotel horribly. Beware of the valet. I self-parked in the garage and the valet drivers were treating the cars horribly. They were speeding through the garage, cut other cars off, blasted the music and slammed the doors of the cars. I even saw one valet driver hit one car with the door of another car. I saw all of this in the short amount of time that I was in the garage so I can only imagine what the rest of the day looks like. You can park your car by yourself for $30 instead of paying some one $42 a day to trash it. If you are there for the convention center, try the Westin.

It's within walking distance to a few restaurants (LTK, Salvatorre's Jerry Remy's.) There's also a deli/grocery store (Jace & Son's) that has yummy, cheap sandwiches and all kinds of snacks and drinks. There's a lot of new construction going on in the area. There will be more shops and restaurants opening up within the year. We attended the Penny Arcade Expo at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. It was a 10 minute walk from our hotel. Hotel: The decor of the hotel is very modern and chic. There's a restaurant, bar, and Starbucks in the lobby...very convenient if you don't want to leave the hotel! There is a Club Lounge that provides a delicious Continental breakfast, as well as an espresso machine and teas. On the 5th floor, there is a small pool, sauna, and work out room, so don't forget your exercise/pool wear. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I were given a hospitality suite since that was the only room available. (I'll elaborate about that later on!) The room was very large. It had a miniature galley style kitchen with a fridge, coffee maker, and sink. The room was decorated nicely with comfortable furniture and plenty of seating. It had a nice view (Large, bright windows) of South Boston and a small view of the waterfront. The bathroom was modern and clean. The shower had great water pressure as well. Internet and parking is very expensive\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so be sure to budget that. Service: We checked in about midnight on Friday night. Apparently, the hotel was over-booked so we were given a hospitality suite on the 5th floor. (It worked out in our favor because the standard rooms were quite tiny!) Will, who was working the front desk, was friendly and nice, but unaccommodating. We were tired after a long drive and found out that we were to spend the night on a sofa mattress instead of a real bed. After some coercing, he offered us free internet for the night in the hotel room though we were unable to connect in our room. He also granted us access to the Continental breakfast in the Club Lounge. The following night, there was a Jazz band gala concert on the 3rd floor. We could hear the music in our room! Once again, we went to the front desk. They offered to change our room to the 7th floor, but since it was our last night. The front desk clerk could have been more understanding. I mean, was it our fault that there was a jazz concert and we didn't want to go to it?! Sunday morning, we checked out of the hotel. We asked for a feedback card since we were not very happy about the cost/service of the hotel. Mike, the front desk clerk, was very understanding and really listened to our complaints. After explaining our situation, he gave us a $10 card for breakfast at Starbucks, as well as a $100 gift card to any Marriott hotel. This was the service we desired and we left Boston feeling happier instead of stressed out and unhappy. Overall: I was going to give this hotel 3 stars, but I added a star because of the the professionalism and understanding nature of Mike. He really went out of his way to make us feel better about our stay. The hotel is nice, modern, and green. I liked how they were eco-conscious in the rooms. If you do stay at the hotel, try to find out if there is a conference or event going on to be prepared for extra noise.

The pros: Nice rooms, very clean and bright with a comfy bed and nice flat screen TV. The cons: The plumbing! I can't believe no one has complained about this on TripAdvisor - the noise emitted by the plumbing system is unbelievable! When our neighbor used the shower, the vibration and noise was horrible - fortunately, we had to be up early so it didn't wake us up but if I'd wanted to sleep in I would be a really unhappy camper. Either a room near us has a jacuzzi or something is seriously wrong on the 7th floor! Our shower made alot of noise on it's own so I don't think it's a jacuzzi next door. The other big con was the restaurant - my husband and I went down on Sunday AM for an early breakfast and were told it was a 15-20 minute wait so he went off to Starbucks and I decided to come down later. When I returned solo, there were two empty eats at the \"bar\" area by the kitchen. I was told I could not sit here and would have to wait. The hostess I spoke to promptly disappeared and about 10 minutes later, another hostess wandered over and said, \"are you waiting for a table\"? The seats were still empty at the bar but she seated me at a 2-top. The food was good albiet expensive but no worse than the other hotels in this area. Parking is $42/day and internet is $12.95-16.95/day so make sure to factor this into your budget. There is no self parking at the hotel with the garage nearby costing $30/day.

The room was a decent size. The technology was fairly up-to-date (ipod docking station clock-radio, flat screen TV with adjacent connection panel). Internet had two-tier pricing, so I saved a few dollars checking email. If you're expecting free connectivity, don't stay at a Renaissance. The restaurant had a fairly limited menu, but the food was quite tasty. Service at the lobby Starbucks was especially good. It didn't take many visits before they learned what I like to drink. The big drawback for me was noise. I asked for a quiet room and was given a room on a high floor and away from the elevator (thank you for that). Unfortunately, that room had a connecting door that provided almost no sound isolation from the neighboring room. My neighbors stayed up much later than I did and I could hear most of their conversations. I requested a different room and moved to a lower floor, also away from the elevator. I slept much better, but that's because my neighbors were quiet at night. One day that I was working in my room midday, I could hear muffled conversation. It wasn't as bad as the connecting room, but it was clear that my quiet nights were because I had quiet neighbors, not a well-isolated room. Hallway noise was fairly typical. I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of airplane noise considering I could watch planes land from my second room. I could hear the planes, but it wasn't bothersome. The \"gift shop\" was quite limited (really just a few shelves in the corner of the lobby). Normally I wouldn't even notice, but I needed a sweatshirt when the weather was unseasonably cold and couldn't get one here.

I would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but can't go all the way to 4 based mostly on the small room size and the fee for internet access from your room--$12 per day. First, details on the positive. I think the beds were nice, good pillows, and everything was clean and well furnished. I used to live in Boston and the location was a plus--some may not think so, but it's really close to downtown and offers plenty of restaurant and bar options within walking distance. Also, in this section of Boston, there is usually meters available. If you are willing to walk a little, and usually awake by 8 am anyway, try to find the 4-hour meters on nearby cross streets. They end at 6 pm and start again 8 am the next day. We did this for 4 nights and avoided the $30/night garage rate (a benefit of this location). About the rooms--we originally reserved a king room with a cot for our daughter. I called once in town and checked in via phone. They said they would have our room ready and bring the cot up. When we arrived, the cot was not in the room, nor do I believe it feasibly would have. We asked if anything larger was available, and ended up with an accessible room with 2 doubles. We are used to a king at home, so this is not the best solution to us. Also, the room still felt cramped for the 3 of us. As for the internet access--we needed to check email and log into a work site for about 10 minutes. It's absurd we would have to pay $12, so instead we tried the business center. Unfortunately, the security settings were set so high that it was impossible to do what we needed to. Per the staffs' suggestion, we tried Starbucks off the lobby, but their access was down (which I learned after buying a cup of coffee just to use the wifi). Later, trying to use the computers at the business center to print our boarding passes, I nearly gave up again due to the million boxes popping up to ask if it was okay to proceed. This \"free\" internet access option is hardly a good alternative considering the amount of time it will take to accomplish what you set out to do if you are lucky enough to get that far.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cI LOVED this hotel\u201d", "Author": "ejdb", "ReviewID": "UR65307390", "Content": "This is a beautiful, new hotel.

The hotel manager should be proud of his staff, his hotel's services and the overall image this Renaissance puts forth... hands down, a terrific place, and I would come back again and again.

If I had it to over I would stay elsewhere.. It was overpriced for what it is and what they give. If you need to be near the convention center, the options are limited and the hotel knows this. So, the charges are high. I think a more central hotel would be a better idea. After hours there is nothing around the hotel and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to take the T into Boston or end up with a boringish walk into town. After a screw up on their part they upgraded me to a better room and free breakfast in their lounge. Even my upgraded room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that great. The hotel is billed as water front but the hotel is really only facing the water on the short end not full on so the best you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get is partial view of the water. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that many rooms that have even that. There is a whole wing of the hotel which faces the back and has no view whatsoever. The breakfast which I got for free because of their screw up was nice but should have come with all rooms at the rates they charge. Oddly, the hotel does not offer the breakfast on Saturday or Sunday. I am not sure why. So, the last morning of my stay there was no free breakfast. The walls of the hotel, like most, are super thin. I heard the tvs of both rooms next to mine and every word of the cell phone conversations of these rooms as well. Finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the most amazing thing, even though the hotel charged over 200 a night, they still charged 16 a day extra for internet access. Actually there is a 13 a night plus tax for semi fast internet and 16 plus tax for the faster internet. This to me is appalling. It brings new meaning to the term nickel and diming. All of the hotels near the convention center charged this extra rate for internet. The front desk clerk failed to tell me that the starbucks in the lobby gives their internet away for free. So if you stay here you can go to the lobby for free internet. They won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you this. This place basically is a rip off. Too high priced, and then looking for extra money in things they should provide for free. Better value can be found in a more central location. If you must stay here make sure you try to get a room with a semi view or you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be stuck looking at the T sliver line tracks in a hotel that has water front in the name. Also, beware the not free internet. Lastly, the front desk will steer you to park at the apartment building next door for 30 a night but there is public lot next to the hotel on the other side which charges 10 a night. They will not tell you about that lot.

We won the Renaissance Boston Waterfront for $80/night (Thursday-Sunday). I was extremely pleased with the hotel. The lobby is very modern and pretty. When we first checked in, the agent at the desk advised us that they did not have a king waterfront view available for us, which we understood. We got to our room on the 10th floor and found it had a view of the high rise next door. We also found that the deadbolt did not work. We called the front desk immediately and were moved up to room #1503, a king room with a waterfront view. We were a little confused as we were told 10 minutes earlier that no waterfront king rooms were available. The room was beautiful. I have zero complaints about the room. The bathroom shower was lovely (walk in with full length glass doors). We enjoyed the large flat screen tv and the big picture window that gave us a full view of the city, and of the waterfront. We used the hotel jacuzzi and pool twice and really enjoyed them. We never ate at the the hotel but did go next door to The Legal Test Kitchen on our first afternoon and had a wonderful lunch. Valet parking and internet are expensive, but consider this the cost of staying at a beautiful hotel in Boston proper. You are likely to find similar costs at any 3, 4, or 5 star hotel in a big city. We asked for late checkout on the Sunday as our flights were not until late afternoon. The hotel allowed us until 1 pm. A very nice gesture. In previous reviews, I did see others mention that the walls were thin. I only experienced a noise concern on our last morning at the hotel. And to say it was a concern is really a stretch. If I was very quiet, and had the TV on mute, I could hear the couple in the room next to us. But under no circumstances was it disruptive or loud. My one complaint (which is my complaint at any hotel) is that hotel rooms are never cool enough. I am a cold sleeper and the first thing I do in any hotel room is turn the temperature down to 65F or so. I still don't generally find this cool enough as there is almost always a lack of circulation in a hotel room. This is the second city in which my boyfriend and I have ventured out to a Walmart to purchase a fan. Seems silly, I know, but I am a very particular sleeper and I don't sleep well at all without good, cool air circulation. It would be great if hotels kept a fan available. All in all, a wonderful 3 nights/4 days in Boston at the Renaissance Boston Waterfront. P.S. Bring or rent a navigation system if you are visiting Boston and are unfamiliar with the city.

Renaissance and JW Marriott are supposed to be their top of the line hotels. Yet some Renaissances and JW Marriotts are not 4-diamond properties. Such is the case with this Renaissance. It is rated as a 3-diamond property, and it's easy to see why, too. For example, the selection of free toiletries isn't as large as what is found in the 4-diamond properties. Plus the typical room doesn't have a tub---just a shower stall. In addition, the towels are not as thick and plush as what is typically expected in Renaissances. If Marriott wants customers to think of Renaissances and JW Marriotts as their top brands, then they need to consistently provide 4-diamond amenities. All that said (and not as a complaint but rather to point out the differences), the hotel was kept very clean. The decor is stylish. The rooms are on the small side but still manageable for two people. One thing I did really like---there is a small refrigerator in each room. Housekeeping did a great job keeping the room clean. However, they were very slow to get around to our room. One day we were even considering calling the front desk because we didn't think they were going to come. However, we found that they tended to get to the room between 4 and 5 p.m. There is one thing that is done by housekeeping that we found impressive---when the maid was in a room, she would put a sign by the door saying that housekeeping was in the room and if you wanted to enter while the maid was there, you would have to show her your room key. We were given a room on the 16th floor that had great views of the Harbor and Back Bay. I liked that there was a daybed by the window. It was really pleasant to sit there and enjoy the view. Before our stay here, Marriott Rewards bumped us up to Gold Level. That means we got to have a free continental breakfast in the concierge lounge. Unfortunately, it was only available Monday through Friday. However, it was better than the average continental breakfast in that it offered scrambled eggs in addition to the fruits and pastries. When the concierge lounge didn't have breakfast, we ate at the hotel restaurant, 606 Congress, which offers a breakfast buffet until noon on the weekends. The location of the hotel has its plusses and minuses. On the plus side---there is very little traffic on the roads so it made the area very pedestrian-friendly. The hotel is right next to the Silver Line Way stop which made getting there from Logan very easy. Also, it made getting downtown and elsewhere easy, too. Plus, by the World Trade Center there is a 7-11 which came in handy for buying cold drinks for the fridge. The area is quiet at night so it is easy to get some sleep (all things being equal). On the minus side---the hotel is a good 15 to 20 minute walk to downtown so you can't just leave your room to shop or have a meal then easily get back to drop off your shopping bags or rest for a while. You're pretty much left with carrying your shopping bags around with you or taking the Silver Line back to the hotel. Depending on just where you are, it could involve making one or two changes of subway lines. Like many hotels, the walls are thin. If you have quiet neighbors, it isn't a problem. However, for a couple of nights we had noisy neighbors who had a toddler that cried a lot. It made me glad I brought my earplugs. We also didn't like the shower stall very much. There was little room to put items such as shampoo. The grab bar was in the back of the stall, opposite the faucet and showerhead. I would imagine it would be difficult for anyone who needs the grab bar to use it. Also, after showering, when you open the door, lots of water spills out onto the floor. Would we stay here again? Well...the verdict is still out on that one. What drew us here is that it was far cheaper than the Marriotts that are downtown or in the Back Bay, plus the proximity to the Silver Line. Yet we like the idea of a hotel that is in a better location for sightseeing and dining.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, Clean, GREAT service - I would stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "chapetx", "ReviewID": "UR29082322", "Content": "This hotel is about a year old and is beautiful.

Slept like a newborn baby -Meticulously clean -42\" LCD TV that turns to anywhere in the room -GREAT lighting from dim/mood to bright in all areas of room -Large glass shower (no tub) w/great water pressure & temp -Room Service friendly, good food, reasonable price -Excellent onsite restaurant & Starbucks in lobby -Fresh smelling & quiet CONS: -Location is a bit more businessy than touristy (not seedy or scary area) but taxis available continuously, Silver Line (bus) & subway both less than a block away -No airport shuttle yet very close to Logan Tips if you aren't using a rental car: Buy a $2.00 ticket at MBTA machine in baggage claim area of airport or pay on the bus. Go to the RIGHT END of walk at arrivals (each terminal) & wait for long double bus, the Silver Line. It's only 2 bucks and the 2nd stop is right at the Renaissance (Silver Line Way stop).

Got a special conference rate of about $200 plus tax. Although the location was not bad, I would likely consider a downtown hotel if going to Boston just as a tourist, especially if the rate at the Renaissance were much more than we paid. As noted, the hotel is not real close to a lot of attractions, though it is within easy walking distance (across a parking lot and street) to the Silver Line bus/trolley, which can connect you go the airport or the regular subway lines. Breakfast option of Starbucks has been noted, though they seemed to have nothing but pastries. You can get fast food breakfast sandwiches a 5 plus minute walk away at Dunkin Donuts. For dinner, there is the restaurant/bar in the lobby (limited menu), and, nearby, the seafood and Italian restaurants noted in other reviews, plus the funky No Name Restaurant at the nearby Fish Pier, the small and casual Yankee Lobster Pot down the street, upscale Morton's Steak House, and others if you walk further. Still, if the weather is bad you may not enjoy the walking required. The rooms are modern and spacious. No complaints at all, other than the lack of room safes. Ours had a nice view of the harbor (be sure to request in advance). The business center had two PCs for customer use (free). Exercise room was adequate; pool small (narrow). Concierge was quite helpful in giving info about tourist sites, subways, etc. And there was an endless supply of mini Reese's Peanut Butter Cups at the check-in counters.", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel Nice Area and Some Tips for travellers Would stay again\u201d", "Author": "Chulolaw", "ReviewID": "UR20427123", "Content": "I booked my trip through Priceline and at first i was a bit apprehensive because the parking was so horribly expensive. I went for a weekend and thought from the other reviews that the area was abandoned at night. It was not. Parking is ample at night but you must pay the meters $1.00 per hour at 8am, Although I like sleeping in, I got up and moved the car over 2 blocks to ample parking lots for $5.00 per day weekend if no events are going on. It was $5.00 although u must pay by credit card. It was great. The old town trolley stops near Anthony's pier which was easy walking distance to do the trolley ride. The Hotel is brand new and amazing. Very clean, nice tv's, excellent bar and restaurant and great staff. The trolley driver dropped us off in front of the hotel because Tropical Storm Hanna decided to pour down on us so for our benefit and some of the older passengers he made a special stop and avoided our need to walk 2 blks in the torrential rain. Hotel is near the waterfront, near the convention center and near the Fannueil Hall, (about a 15 min walk) You can easily take the silver line from the Airport to the Hotel and it is on the next block that the train is there. I would have preferred not to have a vehicle because parking where all the clubs and bars are is awful and hard to find. I think you can take the silver line to South Station and transfer to the rest of the T, which I would definitely do next time. Airport by car is on the other side of the New Tunnel and it is a 10 min drive. Very nice, quiet area. Starbucks is in the lobby for a morning coffee and danish. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again, so close to everything.", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chapel Hill, NC", "Title": "\u201cPre-cruise convenience\u201d", "Author": "Mary47", "ReviewID": "UR20345642", "Content": "We stayed for one night in August, with a late arrival, on the eve of a cruise departing from the Black Falcon Terminal.

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot to recommend about this hotel, as well as a few drawbacks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new (opened in February 2008) and it looks it. Most everything is shiny, polished, and not showing any wear, which is as it should be. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153water theme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd throughout, with lots of blues and greens in the color scheme in common areas and the guest rooms. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenient to Logan Airport, easily accessible by the Silver T line, and just two blocks from the World Trade Center stop. Front desk personnel were gracious and efficient. Upon check-in, I was initially given a room with two queen beds although I had requested a king, and put on a lower floor near the elevator. I immediately went back to the front desk and I was moved to a room on a higher floor away from the elevator, though they still had no king rooms available. I questioned this, as I was checking in about 4 p.m. -- neither early nor late \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but was told there simply were no king rooms available. When paying $249 a night, not getting what one requested is more difficult to accept than if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d obtained a deeply discounted rate from a booking service. The on-site restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 606, for the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is described as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153American tappas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant. The dinner menu features six categories ranging from salads and appetizers to main courses to a selection of cheeses. The food is very good and the variety excellent. 606 also has a pretty decent wine list. But the service needs some improvement. Most of the wait staff I saw was quite young and, while they seated me, took my order, and delivered my food quickly, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check back to see if I needed anything until I had finished the food. That area should be targeted for improvement. Housekeeping could also use some fine-tuning. When attending a conference, I HATE coming back to the room after lunch and finding it had still not been made up, so I called at 8 a.m. just before I left and requested service. When I returned at 1 p.m., it still had not been done. I find that very frustrating, especially since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d requested service five hours earlier. The hotel has a well-equipped fitness center with individual TVs on the cardio equipment, as well as a pool and (usually) saunas for both men and women. The men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sauna was out of order during my stay, which is unfortunate for such a new facility. Guest rooms are nicely furnished and offer full connectivity (for a fee); they include large, flat-screen TVs (HBO and other movie channels included) which can also be hooked to your computer and doubles as a monitor; and iHome radios by the bed. However, the rooms do lack a few things. There are no in-room safes, which I find very useful when traveling with my laptop. It could also have used a table and chair in addition to the desk; otherwise, any in-room dining would have to be eaten at the desk or on the bed. And the towels are far too thin considering the higher-end nature of this property. All in all, a pleasant stay and a hotel I would stay at again.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cReally nice hotel, a little out of the way\u201d", "Author": "SteveBoston", "ReviewID": "UR20171795", "Content": "Beautiful new hotel in the waterfront area.

The hotel is new, well designed and equipped. Views are excellent (try to get a room as high as possible) and rooms are light, airy, great air con, big tv and a really good clock radio that I could plug my iPod straight into. There was a conference on at the hotel the whole weekend I was there but other than some busy lifts this did not bother me in the least. Bar was good for snacks and drinks and as a lone traveller I found it a nice area to relax, have a beer and chill / read! Food is dear but then you are in a city etc. The hotel is away from the main drag but is a 2 minute walk away from the World Trade Centre T station. Tip: if you are there for a weekend, get a 3 day ticket as it just makes it easier to jump on and off. Within a day I felt as comfortable jumping around the system as I am on the tube. It is safe and I found the staff to be very helpful. I must have walked 12 miles over two days with my sight seeing. There is lots to do / places to go. Just buy a guide book to get the tips and do the Freedom Trail to see the city by foot. Couple of things are poor (in my opinion) 1. Pool is absolutely tiny for a hotel of this size. I didn't bother using it for fear of hitting so many people whilst trying to swim! 2. American hotels are designed around the lifts. When you are on the 16th floor (fab views by the way) then the lifts get a little busy and frankly I'd rather walk down the stairs. The stairs are difficult to find and then when you reach ground level you end up in the back of the kitchen! I ended up walking down to level 4 and getting the lift the rest of the way! 3. Walls could be a little more insulating - on one occasion I was woken by next doors bed gymnastics. Boston is a great city and whilst this hotel is a little way out of the centre, the links are easy into town and the airport.", "Date": "September 15, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d678412-Reviews-Renaissance_Boston_Waterfront_Hotel-Boston_Massachusetts.html", "Price": "$285 - $567*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">606 Congress Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Boston</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">02210</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "678412", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0b/d1/0bd15232cba3eae0946622e1df47120a1large.jpg"}}
