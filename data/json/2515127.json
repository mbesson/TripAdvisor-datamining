I was a little hesitant at the cost, but the location made it well worth it. From our check-in, the stay was great. Unfortunately the room was not available (they had upgraded us - thank you very much) so they escorted us to the bar and hosted us to drinks and snacks until the room was ready. When ready they came to get us - escorted us to the room -- and we found that our luggage had been delivered. We were on the 4th floor, a corner room, overlooking the plaza, the Louvre, and the Palis Royal. Three great French doors with a fourth in the bath provided great breezes. You could literally watch folks tour the galleries of the Louvre from the South windows (100 feet away across the street). The only drawback was the noise from the plaza, but after the first night we learned how to adjust the doors for great airflow. The Concierge service was outstanding from reservations for diner to arranging a taxi to the airport - always able to assist. I'd recommend the hotel to any traveller who wants to be within walking distance of the center of the city and also close to the metro (in the plaza).", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRomantic Winter getaway\u201d", "Author": "leazo", "ReviewID": "UR127256783", "Content": "We booked this hotel for a weekend in December 2011 for my boyfriends birthday.

The only rude person I encountered on the entire trip was an American (and I'm an American). The French have not lost their old fashioned (and wonderful) manners, dignity or humanity.

The concierge booked several meals for us and the desk, brasserie, and bar staff were as nice as could be. The room was small but very well appointed. The bathroom was, by contrast huge! We had a 2nd floor room facing the Opera. There was a little traffic noise (horns) in the mornings but nothing too disturbing. Breakfast was not a bad deal at 19\u20ac. It was a very good buffet. Dinner was exceptional and the by the glass wine list was truly outstanding. The hotel offers free wifi with a good signal. We connected easily from the room, lounge, and outside patio. We were even given a 30\u20ac/day hotel credit for use in the lounge or restaurant. If I have one complaint it would be that the prices in the lounge seemed a bit high.

Any stress we had been feeling to this point dissolved. Our room was a decent size, the beds were comfy, the bathroom was well stocked, even supplying wash cloths. I feel a little silly saying this but I found the quality of the toilet tissue is the same that I would purchase for myself at home. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and have found that they cut corners in this area. We had no view to speak of but considering all of the other plusses this was not a big deal for us. The one thing I missed in the room was a clock. There was one imbedded in the television but unless the master light switch was on it could not been read. Fortunately my daughter travelled with her ipod so we were able to use it for an alarm as well as a clock. The staff in the attached restaurant are also very friendly, our waitress from lunch stopped by our table at breakfast the next day to enquire about our holiday. The food is of decent quality however I found drinks to be very pricey. My daughter ordered water & ice tea and it cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 13 euro.

I arrived at the hotel at 9 am and was told that my room would not be available until 3pm and could not even get a room to change. I tried to pay for a room for a few hours but was told the hotel was sold out and I felt that the front desk person did not really try to accommodate. I took occupation of the junior suite, which was spacious but had dated furniture. Breakfast was included in my package but on weekdays, breakfast ends at 10AM and essentially the staff starts packing and preparing lunch tables at 10:01 making the experience a bit stressful with tables and food carts being moved around. In most hotels I have stayed at, breakfast typically goes until 11am and even later on weekends (10:30 on Saturday and Sunday at this hotel). Upon checkout, I asked if I could keep the room a bit later because my flight back to the US was in the late afternoon and again was told that the check out time was 12 noon and that the most they could do was 12:30. This was another indicator that the staff made very little extra effort to make my experience memorable by going the extra mile, a very important attribute of \u201cluxury\u201d hotels. Perhaps the reason is that the hotel is always sold out due to location and does not need to brand itself around hospitality. I was also very surprised by the rates used for local calls from the hotel. Buyers beware and do not use the hotel phone lines to make calls to cellular phones (including local ones). Rates are prohibitive if not outrageous. The bright spots were location and concierge services but unfortunately these positive elements were not sufficiently compelling to make me want to go back.

It was also excessively warm despite our turning off the heat (this was early December), so we had to crack open the windows to let in fresh air but sadly that also made the room quite noisy -- I had to put in earplugs in every night to sleep. The bathroom was a decent size and nicely done in white marble, though I was bummed that no hair conditioner was supplied (ladies, bring your own). This is definitely a 3* or so hotel -- after checking out here, we then checked into the Park Hyatt Place Vendome (where we stayed for fun and not work) which is a real 5* hotel, as was the Four Seasons Georges V where we had lunch one day.

It's the Parisian way.I've been to Paris 6 times in my lifetime...I still find people rude in general, and unfriendly. And this is despite my majoring in French Literature as an undergrad, speaking French reasonably well, and being very well traveled. The euro is still very strong right now despite the economic woes of the country and the dollar is not, so it is not like the days of the franc where there was some value in purchasing. Good things about the hotel: location is great. Plenty to do nearby, close to metro, food, etc. Staff is reasonably accommodating for Parisian standards. (Again, Parisians aren't known for their warm and fuzzy demeanor). Customer service is not really their \"thing\" . But compared to other visits to Paris in the past, I thought the hotel staff was nicer overall. The room was large for Parisian standards. Nice decor, updated light fixtures, etc. Bathroom was excellent. The concierge is tremendously helpful. They answered all our questions in detail, and never rushed us to go away, like the front desk. We bought tickets to the Louvre here and didnt have to wait in line. Also, they booked dinner and tours for us which was very helpful. Bad things about the hotel: -After flying all night and being 6 mos pregnant, they only allowed us to check in at 3 pm. If checkout time is at 12, does it really take 3 hours to make a room ready? We were able to go to the Louvre for the day, but it was really exhausting. -The bed is hard as a rock. Some people like this. Again, being pregnant, it was not comfortable for me at all. Also, it is not a king bed but 2 beds put together and you can feel the divider in the middle. -Very loud in the morning. -Bath products are watered down (to save money??) but have the Annick Goutal label. -We were told we got a 30 euro credit per day for meals at the restaurant, but when we checked out this was not applied to our bill. It took some arguing with the front desk staff for them to admit we were correct. The general attitude was very snooty and dismissive. But hey, its Paris. Normally, I wouldnt complain about a lot of these things, as I have stayed in much worse accommodations, but it's especially painful to spend nearly $400 per night and not have a comfortable bed, etc. Perhaps its is just a bad time to visit Paris, because everything everywhere in the city is expensive.

From our room, 305, you could literally see into the museum (Richelieu wing). Also, the entrance to the metro stop is no more than 50 meters from the front door of the hotel, 5 meters if you go out the back door. Also, not a huge factor, but the free wifi worked fine. Lastly, we had a deluxe room (not a suite) with a king size bed and found the room to be spacious by Paris standards. Now the negatives: Housekeeping left no toilet paper on the second day of our stay. It took 3 phone calls to the front desk/housekeeping and almost 1 hour to finally get someone from the front desk to send some up. On another occasion we had to twice call housekeeping to get 2 glasses that housekeeping had forgotten to leave. The water temperature in the shower was awful; as soon as you would get the water to a comfortable temperature it would suddenly turn hot or quite cold. This was consistent throughout our 7 day stay. The secret seemed to be to wait it out rather than try to adjust it back to a reasonable temperature. Early in the morning you could hear the trains underneath the hotel from the metro. It wasn't so bad that you couldn't get back to sleep, but you can hear it none the less. I suspect that it was partly due to our room facing east, which is where the entrance/exit to the station was located. Not directly a hotel problem, but do not waste your time and money on the hotel food. It expensive and so-so.

The luxurious lobby got really worn out, the old, very old room was not just SMALL, it was miserable! I am a short girl, though it was almost imposible to move inside the room and the ceiling was literally on my head. I felt like overgrown Alice in wonderland.

The bathroom was superb \u2013 twin basins, bidet, toilet and bath with shower over \u2013 spotless and very spacious. It led off a small hallway between the bedroom door and the bedroom itself, which gave privacy to anyone using it. As you might expect from a hotel like this, bathrobes and slippers are provided, as are quality toiletries and very fluffy towels. We only ate breakfast at the hotel and it was a plentiful buffet with a great deal of choice. The one downside was that the cooked items were not as hot as they should have been and sometimes a little tired. If you take tea with milk you do need to ask for cold milk or you get it frothy and warm! Our room overlooked the Louvre and the Place du Palais Royal, where you are entertained every evening by the skateboarders practising their skills.

I decided to go for Hotel de Louvre and was not disappointed! Arrival was smooth, check-in very fast and efficient. We were taken to a room and it was on a top floor (as requested by me). The room was not big but we were happy with a size considering that usually rooms in Paris are extremely small. Rooms are somewhat dark. I think some renovation for windows is required (at least some frames painting). Breakfast is served in the hotel main restaurant and we found it somewhat not up to the standard, but it was not poor at all. Just not what we like. Hotel's location is just perfect. It is next to the Louvre. What else to wish? What we did not like: - hotel staff seems to be demotivated and not always helpful. This is especially noticed on cleaning and maintenance. We had a tap broken in the bathroom but nobody seemed to care, none of the hotel employees was pro-active enough to fix it and was leaving it for the next one hoping they would do it for them. Typical for human being in general, but I found it unprofessional for the hospitality industry. - room service is good, but food is not tasty. We liked the hotel's restaurant and dining is a pleasure in it. But food served to your room is not as tasty as at the main restaurant for some reason (we were told it is coming from the main restaurant). - cleaning. Very poor. You get a bottle of Champagne on arrival but nobody bothers to clean bottle and glasses when you are done. It is left in your room for the entire stay.

Her relaxation is to watch TV. I must admit that the hotel TV service is poor. The only english channels were three \"news\" channels. When the hotel advertises Satelite TV , i expect to get at least one major US/UK network, or at least more english tv, other than news. Comment # 2: Internet I was told WIFI access was free. It is free, but next to useless for attempting to do business, or access the net. Then i found out that the \"useless\" WIFI is free , but for a fee i can get this other service that has a cost (wired connection). That service has a cost but it works fine. Needless to say, this annoyed me, and i can't help but think it annoys others. Why not give up the charade, put prices of the room by a buck or two and give free \"real\" access.

The only one exception was the visit to Montmartre, where we went by metro. The metro station is just next to the hotel. I guess for someone not willing to walk, this could be very convenient. Also we have been to Versailles with a tour organized by a touristic agency near the hotel.

The room was not too large and it had no view at all, but it was clean and with a huge and very comfortable bed. So, the missing of the view was balanced by the great quality of the sleep. The room was cleaned twice every day and the towels and bed sheets were changed on customer\u2019s request, as often as we needed. The breakfast buffet was very nice, although not as rich as we found in other 5 stars hotels. The minus of the breakfast was the fact that every day they were serving exactly the same things, with no variations at all, but the quality of the food was very good. The last day we also served the lunch there and I have to admit that the food was excellent, the chef deserves our congratulations. The personnel was very prompt and polite.

My sister had a corner room that was a bit smaller than the other two by had views of both the Louvre and a side street. Her room was the size of a traditional American hotel room, but huge by European standards. My room and my parent's room were practically identical. They were much bigger than my sister's with a separate sitting area. The toilet was separate from the rest of the bathroom. Our toilet had a sink in the room while my parents had to walk around to the other bathroom to wash their hands. There's been a lot of comments about the noise of the metro, and I wanted to note that being on the first floor, the metro never bothered us. You could hear the vibration, but not feel it, just ever so slightly. I thought it sounded like an air conditioner starting up. A couple of days later, my mom said the same thing. Not once did the noise bother us. We could not hear the noise on the street besides the occasional sirens, which you get staying in a city. If you're worried about the noise here, stop worrying. You'll be fine. I've also seen comments about the staff. In our experience, the staff was wonderful. We had great service at the concierge. They recommended some great restaurants and provided guidance when we needed it. Housekeeping was sometimes slow. We would return to our room occasionally throughout the day to take a break and a couple times our room wasn't made up by 2pm despite the \"please make our room\" sign that we had posted. Turndown service was often around 6pm, when we were getting ready to head to dinner or rest before heading out for our second wind, so we often just got the knock on the door and were handed our chocolates instead of having our bed turned down. Not a big deal at all though. We did have an issue one day with our AC not working well. I think it's because we lost power that night. We called the front desk and they sent someone up to fix it. We never had any issues again. The AC was nice and cool besides that one time despite being 80* F out. As I said above, the best part of this hotel is the location. We walked just about anywhere, the Louvre, the Opera, Notre Dame, Sainte Chapelle, and more. If we didn't walk, we took the Metro, which was great. I love the Paris Metro. It's so efficient and there are lines that go everywhere. Be smart and watch for pick pockets. It's pretty obvious who's trying to pick you.

We can absolutely rave about the diligent and knowledgeable concierge staff., The pleasant and attentive bellmen. The location cannot be beat. However, the room we were given was very dissappointing, as was the attitude of the front desk staff. We arrived from an early morning cross atlantic flight to be told check in was not until 3pm but that they would try to get our room ready earlier. We stored our luggage and took a walking tour until we returned at 2:45pm. It was then that the front desk clerk called house keeping. We were told that they were checking the room, it would take 10 minutes and could we relax in the bar. The clerk would come to get us when the room was ready. Any other hotel might have offered a complimentary drink for our wait. Exhausted, we waited and waited. I finally returned to front desk ( no line, no other guests waiting) and inquired about the room and, without a blink of an eye (cannot imagine clerk forgot she had sent us to bar to wait and had promised to come get us) she called housekeeping again to find out room was, indeed, ready. Room was nothing like we imagined. Nothing like website picture. Bathroom was stark. The shower door leaked water all over floor no matter how we positioned showerhead. However, we were quite tired and so we moved in. It was not until the following morning that I realized that bathroom was the way it was because it was set up as a handicapped bathroom. I called and inquired to find out it was handicapped room. I asked to be changed because of the wet floor everytime we showered. (can't imagine it was too safe for disabled person - not to mention us). Of course told there were no other rooms except an interior room overlooking the roof of the first floor (had specifically paid for a deluxe room in order to have an outside room). We were told that there may be a room at 3pm. Spoke to manager who reiterated this. I cannot imagine why hotel did not know whether or not there would be a room available (were they waiting for cancellations?). I asked if others would be checking in that day, did not get clear answer. If there were people checking in, there would be people checking out and therefore a room for me to switch to. Of course, when we checked at 3, there were no rooms available to move to. Our travel agent contacted the hotel by email, as well but had no response whatsoever. Needless to say, late at night we rode up elevator with new guests checking in. Their conversation was that they had booked \"standard rooms\" but they they had been upgraded to larger outside rooms. I was appalled. The capper is that, 7 pm the night before we were to check out, the hotel manager called and offered us a new room.(After we had been there three out of four nights) She said she had been trying to call us \"all day\". She said she heard we had been unhappy. Wish she would have made that call on second day..... I have stayed in many four and five star European Hotels.

On the Right Bank, Hotel du Louvre is always our first choice. The location couldn't be better, we never have to use taxi's or the Metro (although both a taxi stand and a metro station are only a few steps away). So many views are within walking distance of the hotel. For the Louvre Museum you have only to cross the street. The lovely Park of the Tuileries is less than five minutes walking. The Opera can be seen from the front door of the hotel; just walk down the Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra. Next to Place Malraux where the hotel is situated, is the Rue du St. Honor\u00e9, with many designer shops. Or we might stroll along the quays of the Seine, to the Notre Dame. And just cross the place in front of the hotel to arrive in a world of pure magic: the garden of the palais Royal. The hotel itself is in a lovely old building. The reception area is beautiful. The decoration of the bar and the brasserie / breakfast room is done in style Napoleon III, the rooms are all different. This time we had a large room on the 4th floor, with marvellous views of the place de Palais Royale and the Rue de Rivoli / the Louvre. Of course, if you want a room with such a great view, you'll have to accept a bit of traffic noise, although the double windows are very efficient. (There are also more quiet rooms.) The room had a sitting area with a sofa and two easy chairs, a big writing desk (with a Bose radio), and a King size bed. Good lighting. There also was a big bathroom (with separate shower cubicle), a separate WC room, and a walk-in closet. The decoration of the room was maybe in some places a bit tired looking, but the floor covering was (almost) new. Needless to say, everything was spotlessy clean. The staff are very friendly and efficient, and we are always made to feel welcome. The turn-down service is very good, almost as if your room is cleaned twice a day! The hotel has its own brasserie (with a great terrace). In the morning, a breakfast buffet is served here.. If we could, we would just change two little things: the volume of the muzak in the breakfast room to be turned down, and to be greeted in the morning with a French \"Bonjour\", and not with an American \"Good morning, how are you today\".

More than I hoped for, better than I dreamed. I have to start at the beginning. I booked my flights in July of 2010 for my Feb. 2011 trip to Paris, France. Planning to travel alone, I had over 6 months to find a safe hotel with a good location in Paris. For months, I researched hotels and reviews. Reviews are very important; the people tell it like it is. Location and price were my deciding factors. No matter how many hotels I looked at, I kept coming back to Hotel du Louvre. The only reason I didn\u2019t book right away was price, I was close to my budget, but it was still higher than I wanted to go. I wanted a safe area, a room with a view and breakfast included. Every few days I would check prices with the links on Trip Advisor, i.e. Expedia.com and hotel.com and it was still out of my price range. I do not know why I did not go the Hotel du Louvre website sooner, but in November after 4 months of looking and comparing, I went to the Hotel du Louvre website. They had a Winter Special, if you booked 2 months in advance you received 20% off the room and buffet breakfast. That is a HUGE savings. I did not think of looking further and booked the room within 5 minutes. There were many emails from me, to the hotel, with questions about the hotel and rooms. The staff was wonderful and they answered all of my questions in a timely manner. They did not make me feel like I was pestering with all of my inquiring. Thank you, Virginie Picard-Lavergne. Upon check in, the smiling face of Mirna greeted me. Hint: if you are coming in on an early flight from the US and you arrive at the hotel at 9 am, check in is not until 3 p.m. So either pay for the night before arrival or request an early arrival and pay a little extra to get the room sooner. I did not do this and my request was for a specific room so I did have to wait until 3 p.m. check-in, my fault, not the hotel. It was worth the wait. Best room in the house as far as I was concerned. It had it all, a spacious bedroom and a marble bathroom with a view of the Paris Opera house. The bathroom had a wonderful Parisian balcony where I could step out to take photos. The bedroom had a balcony with a view of the Eiffel tower. It was almost a suite. In addition, it was one of the Superior class rooms. Wi-Fi was included. Hint: bring a plug that is compatible with the electric outlets in the room so you can recharge. If you forget, the hotel has some available. Bed was excellent, pillows and duvet, so comfortable. I had a small fear because of previous reviews. I have fibromyalgia and am very sensitive to firm beds. It was not a problem. Best night sleep I had in a long time. Some reviews complained about the metro noise. I did not hear it, my room was on the 5th floor but even when having breakfast or sitting in the lobby there was never any metro noise. Room temp was fine. I was cold, but adjusted the heat. I wish I had written down the name of my maid. She was a great help when I became ill (bronchitis). She gave me slippers for my feet to keep my feet warm in the marble floored bathroom and an extra box of tissues. She is such a kind woman. Concierge and bellmen.. all excellent. Standout.. Laurent\u2026 I traveled alone, had so many questions, and sometimes wanted to share a few words with someone. He made me feel like no question or comment was trivial. Laurent is very informative on many levels of Paris sites and travel routes. Breakfast buffet..food for all types of diet. Scrambled eggs, potato cakes, bacon, sausages, heated sliced tomatoes and mushrooms. Many varieties of toast, jams, nutella, butter , rolls, croissants,\u2019 cold cereals and fresh fruits, Vegetarian items and a sliced cold cuts and fresh cheeses station. Beverages are tea, coffee, hot chocolate, orange and grapefruit juices. If you go away hungry, it\u2019s your fault. The only problem I encountered was that the carafe of hot water was never hot enough to steep the tea properly. I would not hesitate to recommend the Hotel du Louvre. It may cost a little more than your budget allows, then again, maybe cost is not a problem, either way, a stay at the Hotel du Louvre is priceless.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "TX", "Title": "\u201cExceptinal Service\u201d", "Author": "pedidocTx", "ReviewID": "UR98142519", "Content": "I traveled to Paris to attend a Medical Congress.

It is across the road from the Musee du Louvre and right next to the Metro 1 line only 2 stops from the RER B train line. So it was perfect for walking and moving around to other areas. We found all the staff charming and very helpful. The hotel has a traditional feel which we like. The superior room wasa bit small but expected in Paris, and the bed huge and superbly comfortable. The bedroom and bathroom are probably in need of refurbishment, however, facilities are fairly good (lit magnifying mirror, hairdrier and free safe). There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. The room was warm at bedtime and it seemed difficult to lower the temperature. However that did not disturb our sleep and we did not need to open a window on this occasion. We found the prices in the minibar and the lounge to be very expensive: Example: \u20ac8 for can of coke in minibar and \u20ac22,50 for 2 small bottles of perrier and one cup espresso in lounge. We did not eat in the restaurant since we were out most of the day returning late. The business centre costs \u20ac12 for half an hour. There is a small richly decorated lounge where people meet for afternoon coffee; a glass of champagne; for business; in the evening listening to live music; or simply enjoying the weekend newspaper. Breakfast is very fresh and includes delicious smoked salmon, a selection of cheeses and freshly cut fresh fruit salad. However, it costs 32 euros and seems expensive for what it is. Other hotels have a much wider range of breakfast. We booked a special weekend rate which included breakfast and late checkout (6pm) on Sunday which was a great arrangement for us. It is central to walk around shops,cafes; visiting Musee du Louvre and Jardin des Tuilleries . Within a few minutes you are walking along the Seine and within a few steps you can be on one of the main metro lines.

Again, the room wasn't huge, so this configuration was really the only option for the space and wasn't a problem for us. We had a view of the Comedie Francais from our window too.

The Mandarin welcomed us to our room with a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and a bed covered in red rose petals. The du Louvre never made mention of our celebration in any way. The concierges at the Mandarin consistently made recommendations for us regarding attractions, restaurants, etc and always confirmed with a written note in our room. When making reservations at the du Louvre, the concierge told us he would let us know by note or phone call when something was scheduled but never did. We had to follow up with them. In our room, we had to call housekeeping twice to ask for more tissue paper because although we left out the empty box, it was never replaced. I also found it insulting that they charge you to use the internet when you are paying over $500/night versus 24/7 business center access at the Mandarin at no charge.

I was a bit nervous because I got such a good deal on the package that I thought for sure I'd end up in some broom closet in the basement for what I paid for it. Plus I heard from a few people that a four star in Europe was more like a 3 star in the States and that the rooms & bathrooms were very small. That certainly was not the case at the Hotel du Louvre. My room had a king bed with nice high thread count sheets and it was very comfortable. We were on the 5th (top) floor with a breathtaking view of the Commedie Fran\u00e7aise - the Louvre Museum was on the opposite side of the building. The double doors leading to the balcony blocked out the majority of the sounds of the city so sleep came easy. Though the bedroom did not have a dresser there was enough closet space to accommodate both my fiance's clothes and mine. The bathroom was HUGE. Lovely marble everywhere - with a separate water closet with a bidet. The bathroom also had a balcony with french style door - with frosted glass so no one could see in. There was only a single sink, but it was an over-sized basin and the counter was long enough that two could stand there comfortably and not be in each others way. As for the location, it was perfect. The Louvre museum is literally right next door and there is a metro station pretty much right outside the front door. If you prefer taxis, there is a stand right across the square and the bellman is always willing to hail a cab for you. Everyone at the hotel was wonderful and so accommodating - especially Julien and Eric at the concierge desk. Props to them. A few tips - get the Museum pass. It's well worth it and it covers everything from the Louvre, to Versailles and everything in between. Moulin Rouge was a disappointment. We paid a little over $400 for the dinner and show after. Not worth half that. The Segway Tour (done by the Fat Tire Bike Co.) was awesome. Lastly, if you want to save some money, DON'T, I repeat DON'T buy sodas at lunch or dinner. I found that out the hard way. The price does vary from area to area, but in all the touristy places it runs around 5.50 Euros for a medium Coke and 7.20 Euros for a large coke. The sandwich was 6.5 Euros so less than a large soda. Unless you want to have a nice glass of wine, get the tap water at lunch and dinner. You can pick up a bottle of soda at one of them many small market stores for between 2-3 Euros. Oh and taxis have a minimum charge after a certain hour. I think it may be around 7 or 8pm. It's 6.10 Euro even if the meter only reads 4 by the time you reach your destination. Lastly, if you are planning on going, take a look a the metro station set up first. I am a native Bostonian and I thought that I would have the \" T \" down pat, but it was a very confusing set up. It would have been better had I done a bit more research, but it was an adventure.

Having stayed in this city almost every year for the last decade, I am still not happy with any of the hotels I have chosen here. Maybe it is just that the standards in Paris are low by international benchmarks. Anyway, let me start with the positives on Hotel Du Louvre: it is in a great location across the road from the Louvre; it has a passable gym; the free internet was reasonably fast; the welcoming letter with bottle of wine was an unexpected touch; the reception area staff and room service staff were very courteous and friendly; and I slept soundly every night. But the negatives: for 320 euro for a so called deluxe room I expected a larger room - there was barely enough space to move. I cannot imagine how people in the next category down would manage. The bathroom, while nicely lined with travertine marble, had one of those over bath showers with a glass screen which did not stop water leaking onto the floor. Unfortunately the hotel is located over a metro line and so every minute or so there was a thunder like rumble from below. Fortunately, this seemed to abate from midnight to 6am. But the room soundproofing was poor, probably because it had an adjoining door to the next room where a lady and her dog could be heard readily. Noise from the street however was not noticeable even though my room on the third floor overlooked the adjacent square with a big window providing a wonderful outlook and lots of light. But it was the included breakfast and the manner in which it was provided that let the hotel down badly. Firstly, the breakfast ends at the ridiculous time of 10am. At 9:30 the staff concentrate on setting up tables for lunch rather than re-stocking the buffet. The buffet itself was quite varied but mostly of poor quality. The quality of the pastries was particularly low for Paris. Ready made coffee in jugs are already on the tables, but not necessarily full or even hot. The staff, while friendly, herded people into small sections of the already table congested cafe as if trying to avoid the necessity of cleaning up later. One morning I arrived and had to wait 5 minutes while a waiter cleared a table in a congested section of the cafe even though other tables were already set. I refused to sit where he wanted because the floor under the table was littered with crumbs, as if a pig had been eating there. The next morning they paid me back by locating me jammed next to the register. The overall impression is that they don't want you to have breakfast because you are an inconvenience. And so, I am disappointed with Hotel Du Louvre.

But it's hard not to get back to the location.

It takes about 2 minutes to walk to the Louvre. Also, as the hotel is located centrally in Paris, we used the metro only twice or so (for the Eiffel tower, and for Versailles), and easily walked to the other main attractions. The hotel is close to the metro station Palais Royal Musee du Louvre. If you are on a tight budget, it is also close to a Japanese restaurant called Higuma, where you can get meals for less than 10 euros. Our room had a kitchenette, which was convenient for making breakfast. However, the decor is quite daggy, especially the design on the carpet. If you look at it for too long, you can feel nauseous. I felt itchy whenever I was in the room, and I think I may have been because of the carpet or my bed. Plus, the '2 single beds' comprise of a single sofa bed and another single bed that you pull out from under the first bed. The instructions to pull out the beds were vague, and it was quite hard to pull them out. The second bed also had a slight slope to it. The bathroom was clean, but the absence of a shower curtain means that you inevitably get water all the floor, which flows to somewhere under the bath. They had covered the gap between the bath and the floor with some patchy woodwork, which is not impressive. Our room had only one chair, which is not enough for a TWO person apartment. So, my partner and I sat on the bed to have breakfast, using a small table and one of the bedside tables as tables. Most of the staff are friendly and helpful, especially Jamile. She was generous and really endeavoured to make our stay comfortable. She offered us 1 free load of laundry. We had enough for two, but she counted it as one. She gave us a receipt for it afterwards (21 euros), and reassured us that we did not have to pay. However, there was another woman at the front desk who I was not impressed with (I can't remember her name). I asked her for the best way to get to the Eiffel Tower. She suggested a complicated route on the metro map which contained 3 changes of lines. Luckily, I discovered that there was a quicker route comrpising only 2 changes of lines. She apologised and said that she had only about 3 hours of sleep, as it was Christmas day. I would have expected better knowledge of the metro system. Upon checking out, we were served by the same woman, and she charged us for the laundry, and at 21 Euros, it was a rip-off! What is also a rip-off is the shuttle service to Charles de Gaulle airport, at 34 euros for 2 people. My partner and I used the metro to get to Chatelet, then RER B to Charles de Gaulle, which did not take much time, and cost only 17 euros for the both of us. Overall, this hotel is not good value. There are 4 star hotels which are located near by, and cost only a little bit more and look much nicer, such as the Hotel du Louvre. Plus, the room was serviced only on our 5th day.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Christmas Vacation\u201d", "Author": "LolaBabyAR", "ReviewID": "UR52194402", "Content": "We spent a wonderful 4 nights at the Hotel du Louvre.

What I mean is that if you stay here you are near the Louvre and Notre Dame, but far from the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triumph. Likewise if you stay near the Eiffel, you are far from the Louvre, so nothing is really central in Paris. The size was nice for Paris, but the AC was poor and I was constantly hot, so in retrospect I'd prefer a small room with properly working AC. We realized the price is pretty average after meeting and talking to other visitors whose rooms were in better locations and more luxurious for the same price. The most obnoxious part was that we got the distinct feeling we were being made fun of by some of the staff. There were chuckles and the word Americans overheard many times. We did nothing to provoke this from the staff as we are world travelers who do our best to represent our country in a positive light.

It is also 10 yards from a metro station, providing access to the rest of the City. For anyone coming into Gare du Nord, metro travel takes about 15 minutes (it took longer to buy the ticket at the Gare du Nord!!!), while we took a taxi back to the GdN which took about 10 minutes and cost 8 euros. The check-in was extremely quick and efficent, with the staff member being very polite and courteous. Our room was a standard room, so no view of the Parisien streets or The Louvre, but it was compensated for by its cleanliness and general quiet. I can imagine a room overlooking the street would be noisy until late at night due to the location of the hotel. The bathroom, although not large and a bit dated was spotless - I travel around Europe with work, staying in many 5 star hotels, and cannot remember a cleaner bathroom. The double bed was wide, and very comfortable. The hotel was not cheap, but that's central Paris for you. A couple of words of warning though: 1) Brasserie did not offer particularly high quality food, and was poor value for money 2) Hotel breakfast is 27 euros per person. Instead, why not try one of the many cafes that are within a 5 minute walk of the hotel and get a hot drink, fresh juice, a croissant, jam, and a small baguette for between 7 and 9 euros.

It was very elegant and traditional without looking old or outdated. There were a lot of things I liked about this hotel. First, the room was very nice. The bed was large, plush, and comfortable. We slept very well. The bathroom was also excellent. It looked recently renovated, everything worked well, and the bathrobes and towels were soft and warm. I liked the view from our room, which was out on the large square next to the hotel. There were always lots of people out there, including some people doing tricks on rollerblades, which was fun to watch. We also could see the Louvre Museum from our window. It was a bit loud outside when we opened the window, but they were well sound-proofed and the room was quiet with the window closed. Lastly, the breakfast buffet in the Brasserie was the best breakfast I had in Europe. It offered an immense variety that would please guests from many cultures. To just scratch the surface, I remember there being a few kinds of bread, jams, honey, pastries, fresh fruits, cereals, yogurt, fresh squeezed juices, many types of sliced meats and cheeses, eggs, bacon, sausages, sauteed mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, hash brown potatoes, and rice. It was all delicious. We did have a few experiences that didn't meet expectations. We ate dinner at the Brasserie the first night, and it just wasn't that great. The food was weird, somehow trying to be imaginative but not coming up with much flavor. My starter course of a bland crab cake ball wrapped in a cabbage leaf is a good example. If you stay at this hotel, find your dinner elsewhere. Also, while I liked working with the concierge named Xavier (I think), my mom was not as impressed with the help she received from a different concierge. She thought the man she worked with was very pompous and made her feel belittled when she told him the price range she wanted to spend at a restaurant for dinner. I would warn business travelers that the wifi internet connection is fairly slow. I appreciate that the internet is free and available in all rooms, but I was not able to upload any of my photos to the internet due to the snail's pace connection. There is a business center with computers and a printer, but I'm not sure if the connection is any faster.

Whilst we enjoyed our stay there immensely, with fantastic staff, excellent breakfast and brilliant location, i think it is overpriced. I know Paris hotels are expensive but nevertheless i think they need to do the place up a bit. I have the following comments: Good Points: Location: hard to beat, right beside the Louvre and the Comedie Francaise. WIthin walking distance of everywhere in central Paris. Views: many rooms have views of the Louvre and down to the Arc du Triomphe, or of the COmedie Francaise. Breakfast: if you get a breakfast inclusive rate, the breakfast is really excellent. Full buffet, hot bacon, eggs etc, croissants and pastries; meats and cheeses, fresh squeezed juices, yoghurts etc and fresh fruits; miso soup. really excellent. Attic Rooms: little balcony overlooking the Louvre made up for small room and poor choice of decor. Concierge and staff: nothing too much trouble. excellent service. Reception and brasserie and bar very nice. turndown service at night. good toiletries and well equipped room. best shaving mirror ever! it magnified and had a light... Very busy traffic outside but our room was well insulated against it. thankfully our room had double doors to the balcony with double curtain which minimised the din. well managed as obviously an occupational hazard in busy city centre. Bad Points: Decor a bit tired on corridors to rooms, alot of worn carpet; grouting cracked between tiles in bathrooms.no fan in bathroom so it steamed up alot. Decor colours can be bad: our room on the 5th floor in the attic was a small room with a low ceiling and yet was painted a cross between brown and purple. made it very dark. bizarre. could have been beautiful if painted a lighter colour to brighten it up. Saw other rooms with lovely colours but were either higher category or smaller room with bed configuration unsuitable for us. Courtyard Rooms: our standard (called superior) attic room luckily had a view but some are smaller and over look the very unattractive inner courtyard. Toilet without wash basin was separate to bathroom. no bidet in bathroom. Very expensive. A coke and a single express coffee in the Brasserie was \u20ac13! Cafe Marly in the terrace of the Richlieu wing of the Louvre is cheaper and a far superior location. All this for \u20ac440 a night.

We had informed the hotel that this trip was in honor of our 25th anniversary, and not only did we have a gorgeous sitting room with French doors opening onto the Place Collette below, we also had a lovely bedroom and two separate bath areas, one with a shower and tub (complette with towel warmer, robes, thick towels, and good toiletries) and one with a toilet and sink. The rooms were charming, good piillows and linens. We slept beautifully there. When we arrived, we had a bottle of champagne on ice waiting, along with a box of chocolates and cookies and note from the hotel manager in honor of our anniversary. The hotel is lovely, small and inviting, with a grand circular staircase from top to bottom. We did not eat in the hotel. (The cost of a breakfast was 27 euros apiece! )We did have coffee in our room in the mornings and it was delicious, though really nothing can compare to the coffee in the street cafes. The hotel was fabulously located. You are not only adjacent to the Louvre and the Tuileries, which we walked in every evening to take advantage of the lovely breezes and the sunset, there are also cafes on every corner nearby. The cafe immediately adjacent to the hotel had the rudest waiter but the creme brulee was excellent. During one evening, we threw open our French doors to the Place below and were entertained by a string orchestra playing Pachelbel. It was magical. I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone. I never took advantage of the bar, and in fact only peeked in on the day we checked out, much to my sorrow - it is beautiful and intimate.

I regularly travel to our office in La Defense, and although the Pullman there is good, I felt like a change. If you stay in the centre of town you can save a good \u20ac 25 by having breakfast in a cafe, and probably the same again by taking advantage of the wide range of good value restaurants in the evening. This place is a great choice for that - less than 30 mins from La Defense on the direct metro line, and a great location for restaurants and sightseeing if you have time. In addition, the wireless broadband is free, saving probably another \u20ac20 per day vs your standard business hotel.

We booked a table on the terrace for dinner, when we arrived it was not ready, we came back 15 minutes later, we sat down, were given menus and we waited, and waited half an hour for our order to be taken, three quarters of an hour for starter to arrive and that was only after speaking to the manager of the restaurant who vaguely apologised. It took another half hour for our main course to arrive. The food was really good but after waiting so long when others were being served who had arrived after us, it took the gloss of it. On the morning of our departure, we checked out, left our bag with the concierge and went to have one last coffee, after realising that we did not have time we had coffee in the hotel and told the concierge where we were, The driver of the car was waiting at least 15 minutes even though were in reception waiting for him, he had told the concierge that he was there to pick us up and if I had not gone to ask him if he was waiting for us, we would still be there !!!. Overall the whole experience of the dinner fiasco and the slap-dash way the concierge did his job really ruined the precious weekend in Paris which up until then we had thorougly enjoyed. I must also mention that the housekeeping staff while very pleasent were not up to scratch, a plate used for fruit was left soiled in the room for the duration of our stay, together with an opened bottle of wine.

It is. But if they are Americans, as I am, they have to take into consideration the decline of the dollar. We stayed at the Louvre a few years ago and had a deluxe room with a huge bath that looked straight up the street all the way to the Opera house. This time we had a much smaller room for a much higher price. This was our 8th stay in Paris, so we have sampled many hotels, and the Louvre is our favorite. We have not stayed in any Parisian 5 star hotels, so we are comparing it only with 4 and 3 star hotels. I guess we were lucky and had a redecorated room. The furniture was old, but the walls, carpet, upholstery, etc were very clean and fresh, and handsome. Our room overlooked the Palais Royal. Our air conditioner didn't seem to put out cold air, but we didn't bother to complain because it wasn't too hot, and we just opened the french doors a crack to let in some fresh air. We did mention when we first checked in that our sink drain wouldn't close enough to retain water for washing out some clothes. The maid called someone right away, and it was all fixed in a jiffy. Not only is the hotel across from the Louvre and near several metro exits/entrances, it is also across from the double decker sightseeing bus stop, which is a wonderful way to see Paris and get around, because you can get on and off at the major sights. Another plus is the proximity to the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore, with its many enticing shops. We had dinner one night in the hotel Brasserie, and it was good, and not expensive compared to most other restaurants that are pleasant and spacious. Most of the more modestly priced places to eat squeeze you into a table practically touching your neighbor's elbow.

I liked this hotel. I'll probably stay there again next time I go to Paris. Sure, there were some niggles, but that's true of anywhere you go, and the niggles here were really pretty minor. The location is absolutely fantastic. It's in a very central part of Paris, with plenty of nice places to eat nearby. We were there to see an exhibition at the Louvre, and it really can't be beaten for convenience if you're visiting the Louvre. It's literally only about 1 minute's walk away. I was very impressed with the standard of service. The staff we interacted with were, without exception, extremely friendly, professional, and helpful. I've not always found that in Paris, and this hotel went a long way to restoring my faith in Parisian hospitality. They mostly spoke excellent English, but only did so if I was struggling to communicate in French. I find it quite patronising if someone immediately speaks to me in English, given that my French is good enough to handle most situations, and they didn't do that. But were nonetheless very happy to speak English if required. Not only were the staff clearly well trained and well motivated, but there were also enough of them. We never had to wait longer than was reasonable to get attention. The bedroom was comfortable enough, but rather small. That's probably inevitable in this price range in such a central location. No doubt there are bigger rooms in some of the 5-star hotels in the vicinity, but then you'd have to pay more than twice the price we paid here. The decor was a bit tired, particularly the paintwork on the window frame, which was flaking off and in dire need of replacement. But the room had all the things you expect to find, such as a safe, a minibar, and a TV with some international channels (although disappointingly no BBC World). Breakfast was good, with a wide selection of hot and cold food. It was, however, a tad on the expensive side. If you're on a budget you'd do better to find a local cafe and just have a coffee and croissant at a fraction of the price. However, if you enjoy a hearty cooked breakfast, you won't be disappointed. I made the mistake of ordering tea with my breakfast, fooled into thinking they might understand tea by their selection of different teas on the menu. Wrong. I think it's a fact of life that only us Brits understand how to make tea. Foreigners just don't seem to get it. They don't seem to be able to grasp simple concepts like putting the tea bag into the water (I was served a pot of hot water with a tea bag on the side). I had the coffee the following day, which was much nicer. So, to sum up, I think this hotel represents excellent value.

Great location for The Sights of Paris. A downside was the 5 star prices in what is emphatically a 3/4 star hotel. Two Cointreaus and two Whiskys set us back 71 euros, two tiny bottles of evian from the mini bar were 14 euros. Unless you have an inclusive B&B deal, avoid breakfast and go to a local cafe - a serving of coffee, croissants, rolls and jams was 27 euros a head. But all this could be endured if we had been allocated a different room. As we deposited our luggage on arrival I commented to my husband that it sounded as if someone was draining the water out of a gigantic bath. On returning to the room at midnight, we discovered the sound was the noise of the hotel lift scraping up and down the side of our room. This went on for the entire night, rendering sleep impossible - a variation on the Chinese water torture. (In fairness, we were travelling with another couple who were entirely happy with their room, but this was of small comfort when my husband and I spent the next day walking around like zombies). I complained to reception that it was entirely impossible for the management to be unaware of the immensity of the noise and disturbance in the room (and presumably in 250, 350 and so forth). It also seemed to me that the room was probably always allocated to someone staying one night (we were), as I would defy anyone to spend a second night there.

The furniture is old dark wood, with functional beds that are not especially comfortable. The room I was in was a superior room as they had upgraded me when I checked in (kindly!).

I find the whole place a treat. I'm not sure I'm alone either. I seem to be endlessly bumping into famous folks in the lobby. Regretably the most famous thing I ever did was get to Monoprix (its like Wallmart) down the street to get wine without getting run over--no small feat I can tell ya. No doubt it's not trying to be a holiday Inn, but its all the better for it. Parisians (and their hotels) don't really change. It's a love it or loathe it thing. Personally, I love it. Try it out.

PROS Fantastic location / right next door to the Louvre and central to most of the main tourist areas. Great little restaurants, etc in the area. Beautiful facade and entrance lobby Helpful valet BUT THAT'S WHERE IT ENDS!!! CONS We had booked two rooms and both of them were a disgrace! I can live with extremely cramped spaces (I am used to Europe), but I can't live with dirty spaces!!! Our room in particular was dingy and faded with serious signs of wear and tear. The sixties style orange and red furnishings were in a very poor, grubby state and more suited to a cheap run down bed and breakfast. The wood of the desk / table for the tv was very chipped, warped and heavily stained!!! It was the sort of room that made you reluctant to touch anything and I'm not particularly fussy! My children's room wasn't that much better, albeit slightly bigger. The only good things were the bathrooms which had obviously been redone! When I complained at the state of the rooms and their total dissimilarity to the photos on their website, the girl at the desk did admit that some of the rooms were being renovated. Obviously ours wasn't one of them! On top of all this my ac didn't work and this was summer time so it was desperately needed. I complained three times by phone and after no response (several hours later) ended up having to go down to the front desk. Strangely enough there was another couple there complaining about problems with their ac. Someone was eventually sent to fix it and assured me that it would start working (by which time it was time for bed) and predictably enough.....it didn't!!! After a sweltering night (reluctant to open the windows because of the noise of the traffic) I complained again the next day (only more strongly). They sent someone again who admitted that it wasn't working and that they couldn't fix it!!! I then had to leave to go sight seeing only to return to find that their solution to the ac problem was to install a big, unbearably noisy unit with large wide hoses which had to be extended through the open french windows to get the air from outside. Not only did this take up the little space that I had so I had to clamber over the bed to get to the door, but it didn't solve the problem as the outside heat coming through the open window counteracted any limited cooling effects, plus we now had to contend with no privacy or security (we were on the first floor) as we had to leave the french windows fully open and we also had to deal with the constant roar of the traffic outside as well as the nosie of the unit itself.!!!! Despite lots of complaints, no one at the hotel was prepared to help us as I gather they were fully booked (peak season) and therefore it was our hard luck! They did eventually (on our last day) send two technicians to fix our ac and it took them an hour and a half to do so, but it was too late as it was our last day. I don't know if we were just unlucky as no doubt the hotel was full and possibly some of the rooms were better than ours, but I do know that we have stayed at other hotels in Paris and had much better quality and service.

Stayed at hotel du louvre in mid-August. This was a family trip, and we had 4 rooms. The room my husband and I had was smaller than the others, but it was all right. Two of the rooms were more of an old fashioned French style, two were more contemporary. The bathrooms were modern and pretty good-sized. This hotel seems to cater to large groups/tours. It is run like a large hotel, and does not attempt to offer much in the way of personalized service. One thing I found particularly annoying was that all 4 of our rooms were booked and paid for together and were supposed to all include breakfast. My husband and I changed the number of nights we were staying, and somehow this eliminated our breakfast, despite the fact that the other 3 rooms still had breakfast included. OK, the breakfast is not that great, but it would have cost my husband & I 54 euro (appx. $75 US) per day to eat it. We tried repeatedly to clear this up with the hotel and even had our travel agent call, but the hotel did not budge. I really thought this was poor customer service. We paid for 4 rooms in Paris for a week, and they could not give us the breakfast that we had previously contracted for? It's not like breakfast for 2 was going to actually cost them much in the scheme of things. But it did lose them loads of good will. For those of you who do not get breakfast included, the cafe st. honore down the street offers a lovely breakfast menu for a fraction of the cost (ex: omelet, salad and baguette for 8 euro). The comedien cafe around the corner is not as good, but it is also much less (continental breakfast for 9 euro). The hotel location is right across from the Louvre Museum. This location is very touristy and not very quaint. There are vender stands everywhere. My family chose to stay on the right bank, but I prefer to stay on the left bank, which offers a little more Parisian charm and better restaurant options.

The beds were very comfortable, the air conditioning worked well (sometimes a problem in Europe), and there was adequate storage in the dresser and closet. We had the breakfast buffet one day, which was a bit expensive considering we only had yogurt and coffee. There was a Starbucks about a 10 minute walk from the hotel, as well as many small cafes nearby. Since we were in Europe for almost 3 weeks, the concierge directed us to a nice laundromat and a dry cleaner which were walking distance from the hotel. This was great considering the hotel charged about $14 to launder a shirt. The fitness center was below our expectations. It only had one treadmill, one bike, and one weight machine, and there was often a wait for the equipment. I used a nearby Club Med gym two blocks away that the concierge directed me to.

The Louvre is about a 3 minute walk. Rue de Rivoli is also right near the hotel. I believe a few tour companies have their meeting points on Rue de Rivoli. I was only in Paris for 3 days so having a hotel in a great location and easy metro access made all the difference in being able to see a lot of the city. The hotel itself is not very fancy, but I think it would be considered a 4 star in North America. Other highlights or comments. 1. I stayed in a Junior suite. The room was spacious and clean. The decor is very European. 2. A metro stop with access to two Metro lines (#1 and #7) is located right near the hotel. The easiest way to enter is through the station stairway entrances in the open square right behind the hotel (about a 1-2 minute walk without crossing any streets). The name of the metro stop is Palais Royal/ Musee du Louvre. 3. I found that every person I encountered at the hotel was able to speak english - which was unexpected. All the hotel staff I dealt with were very polite and accommodating. 4. The hotel restaurant was only open for buffet breakfast. The sign listed the reason for lunch and dinner closures, but I did not pay too much attention. The buffet breakfast was 27 euros. 5. The hotel is located on a busy street. The room windows block out a significant amount of traffic noise, but you can still hear some of the traffic. Neither myself or my travelling companion had any trouble sleeping and even while we were awake I would not describe the noise as distracting. But based on the room I stayed in, which faced on to the road, I would not call the hotel quiet. But even having said that, I will stay at this hotel again and even in the same room, if I ever return to Paris. 6.

The friendly desk clerk suggested around noon. We came back after 12:30 but were told the room was still not ready and to try back in 30 minutes. Came back at 1:45 pm very much wanting to shower and were told that the room was still not ready. We balked and the now different desk agent called housekeeping and apparently there was an internal error as the room was ready for release. We were given a room on the first floor which was very disappointing. The king size room was VERY small. There was no room to put two regular sized luggages and still walk. I understand rooms are smaller in Europe but at this price point, one expects a reasonably larger room. However, far more disconcerting was the shabbiness of the furnishings. All the furniture was significantly chipped, scraped, etc and also covered with tacky glass coverings more reminiscent of a banquet hall than a 4 star hotel. We were aware that the hotel was full so we immediately called the front desk to request a new room for the next day. The next morning we were transferred to a room on the fourth floor which was significantly larger and in somewhat better condition. It also had two sinks in the bathroom which was a plus. However, the lack of a shower curtain or doors was annoying. Guests make due instead with a partial glass screen that pivots out of the way to enable access to the tub. It was definitely cramped in the bathroom. One plus with both rooms though was windows that opened into half-balconies, permitting fresh air. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel. I have to believe that at this price, better options exist in Paris. I do admit that the location is terrific as the location is central to all the city has to offer, including close proximity to the Louvre museum as well as the Musee d'Orsay.

Pros: It is a good location, but really any place in the city near a metro would be good. The staff speaks excellent english, and I love the Annick Goutal toiletries the Concord Hotels use. Cons: There are a bunch. Traffic noise and fumes are really pretty bad. Traffic noise is not too bad with the windows closed but then you will need to rely on the AC. It was warmer than normal when we were there in October, and our room was hot and stuffy. The front desk explained that because we were between seasons, the air conditioning had been turned off. We couldn't open the windows at night because of the traffic noise and bus fumes. We were promised a fan (twice) but it never arrived. I begged for an interior courtyard room, but was told it was not possible. The carpet was filthy and there were red wine stains on the wallpaper. This may not seem like a big thing but there was no place in the bathroom for me to do my hair or makeup. There were 3 places to plug in a shaver in the bathroom, but no place for any hair appliances. The makeup mirror and hair dryer were in a far corner of the bathroom - with no place to set anything other than the toilet, and the only place to plug in my curling iron was next to the front door, again with no place to set anything. There was no refrigerator in the room, the mini bar was warm and we had to call room service for ice. I know this is France, but this hotel caters to an awfull lot of ice loving customers.

My wife and I recently took our honeymoon in London and then on to Paris. The Chesterfield Mayfair was an amazing hotel in Mayfair that I can't praise enough in every category but that will be on their review from me. Then we took the Eurostar to Paris where we checked into the Hotel Du Louvre. It is literally across the street from the Louvre. The first night I thought that the room was a little stuffy and I cranked the air down all the way. The next morning it was no cooler in the room, it was actually cooler outside. The room was very nice and spacious so we cracked our french doors open for a little breeze. Paying @\u20ac350 a night I should not have had to do this and later that day I went down to the front desk to address this problem. I spoke to a gentleman, well, a staffmember named Sebastian. He quickly explained to me that hotels in all of Europe didn't get as cool as hotel rooms in the US and that 20C. was as good as it would get and there was nothing more they could do, and good day! I found this odd considering that at the Chesterfield Mayfair, my room was a chilly 16C. the whole time we were there. I went back to the room dissapointed and later as we left, I complained that our room was hot to the housekeeping staff that was working on our floor. They barely understood English and my broken French but amazingly when we returned back that night, there was an auxillary air conditioning unit that had been placed in the room, I'm sure becuase of them, and the room was nice and cool. I will try to keep this short. We had prepaid \u20ac22 per person per day for the deluxe breakfast. You would be asked if you want coffee on the way in, they would bring it to the table, and that would be the last you would see of your server. Then at the buffet style breakfast, the would run out of everything. I can understand running out of eggs or bacon now and then but the giant container of orange juice would almost always be empty, then they would come out and pour in the equivelant of a large cup in and it would be gone after the next two people got their glasses. The electricity went out in our room twice in two days. The second day I had had about enough. One of the staff members came up, a young man in a suit and tie. As we sat on the foot of the bed in the dark, he climbed a ladder near the front door and began to push up and ceiling panel to look for the problem, he said it could take a while and that maybe we would like to go wait in the hall. AT THIS POINT I LOST IT!!! I let him know that my stay here to this point had not been very pleasant and that for the money I was paying this was rediculous. Several choice words followed and I said that if he had any clue of how to satisfy customers he would have us go down to the hotel bar for a drink on the house. At that moment a very, very small lightbulb when of inside his thick skull and as his voice cracked he said, \"We'll if that would make you happy?\" I grabbed my wife and stormed out of the room. At this point I was on a roll and stopped by the front desk to give them a few more reasons to dislike Americans. I let them know about the experience as a whole, and especially about the restaurant. She said that they would take care of the breakfast situation, especially fresh coffee. Funny that from here on out our stay had a different, more attentive feel to it. We had our free drink and the next day when we came back to the room in the evening there was a small bottle of wine and pastries. Definetely a step in the right direction. For the rest of the week not one day was the coffee refilled.

Cafe Truc across the street from hotel was pretty good for dinner but the hostess was not very nice and seated us next to the door even though the place was half empty and we asked for a table that was in a warmer area (got the feeling that tourists are second class here).

It reminds of that place. Anyway, there is no internet in the rooms! I had to \"steal\" it from Cafe Ruc accross the street. The signal went in and out. The bar downstairs is very cool. Very French and red. The restaurant is GREAT for breakfast. It's buffet (try the french toast) but classy and relaxed. Very good. I was a little surprised at $21 Euros per person for a breakfast buffet, but what the hell, I paid $10 for a coke on the Champs Elysees......France is out of control in the expensive department. Recommendations- easilly walkable to Louvre (duh), Notre Damne and Opera House. There's a Starbucs nearby. Get some snacks at a local shop on Honre......it will save you big $$$. Also, it's 1 1/2 mile walk to Champs Elysees and Arc D'Triomphe. Eiffel Tower is about the same; but, it seems longer. A REALLY good idea is to exit the hotel and turn north (right) on Richeleau. That this about 1/2 mile to MontMarte and turn right. This street has all kinds of action, pubs, cafe's, restaurants (including Hardrock).

One morning there was no hot water. They apologised and sent up a bottle of champagne to make up for it. As others have written it is extremely convenient to musuems, transportation, cafes and shops.

There's a bank right across from the hotel (the concierge will tell you where to go to withdraw money) and the ATM charges $ 2 per transaction. The rate I got was 82 cents for one euro.

The staff was very accomodating and friendly ... special kudos to the concierge who recommended some wonderful bistros for dinner.

I stayed in Hotel du Louvre for 8 wonderful nights. This was my first trip to Paris, but it will certainly NOT be my last! I absolutely LOVED Paris. As for the hotel, it was nice. This is of course my first experience in Paris so I have no other Hotel to compare the Louvre to. Once inside, we were welcomed with carpet and beautiful furniture. The people at the front desk all spoke english very well and the concierge was extremely helpful. Our room was on the 4th floor. I think we had a junior suite. While the room was small, it met our needs. It was equipped with 2 small twin beds that were pushed together and a small balcony. It had a small fridge in it that we squeezed some of our goodies into. It is cheeper to find a store and buy soda, water and snacks than it is to buy from the cafes that line Rivoli Street. For example, a single serving bottle of water on Rivoli Street cost 2 Euros...in the store, I found a large bottle for .79 euros. Another tip is to exchange money at the airport, they charge only 1.5% commission vs on the street where they charge 15%. I used my ATM for all purchases other than food, taxi, and the metro (subway). If you plan to stay in the district, make sure you have food BEFORE 10pm because everyone shuts down their kitchens and there is nothing left to eat. Location Location Location! Absolutley fabulous! There was a carnival right around the corner from us. The Plaza De Lafayette mall was about a 20 minute walk. The metro was across the street and around the corner. Cafes and little shops line Rue de Rivoli and there is a McDonalds not to far away. The Seines river is a stones throw away, and whenever you need a cab, you can always walk to the circle and just tell the cabbie where you want to go. I am so happy that I decided to go with my freind. On t.v. Paris does not look like fun. The way it is depicted, it seems like it is for old people but I learned first hand that the people of Paris are truley amazing and beautiful. I am a 27 year old single, African American female. We met so many nice guys it was unbelievable....White, Brown and everything in between.....I will never forget those wonderful, smiling faces...It was a blessing to be in a place where I was celebrated, not just tolerated. It was nice to see how everyone got along without the barriers we still face in the states. My freind and I are both tiny but we felt completly safe in our hotel and walking the streets even in the wee hours of the night. The only thing about the hotel/Paris that was annoying was the smell of smoke in the hotel. Also many Parisians do smoke and as a nonsmoker, it's really annoying. But overall the hotel was nice, I would stay again. I am already looking forward to my next visit. It is the most amazing city that I have ever visited. While I was ready to come home and share my experiences, I hated to tell the city that I fell in love with avoir.....", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Clarita, CA", "Title": "\u201cClose Enough to Touch\u201d", "Author": "theullman", "ReviewID": "UR3804522", "Content": "If you are a history buff looking for a centrally located hotel, and don't mind forking out a few extra dollars, then the Hotel du Louvre is for you. It's the perfect location, if you are planning on spending a lot of time in the Louvre. The hotel is directly across the street--so close, that with good aim, you could hit the museum with a paper airplane! Nearby is shopping, cafes and there's a Metro stop right next to the hotel. You may appreciate that the hotel itself holds a place in history. In 1855, Napoleon III commissioned it for the Universal Exposition. Keep in mind that the rooms are not as plush as one would expect for a hotel in this price range. Yet, they are good-sized (by European standards) and the bathroom towels are some of the largest I've ever seen. It's a unique property, and frankly there aren't many hotels where the bathroom has it's own view of the Louvre! My tips. If you like croissants, don't get them at the hotel, unless of course you prefer a soft \"Costco\" like croissant. For true Parisian croissants (and excellent hot chocolate) go down the Rue de Rivoli to Angelina. And, if you want to splurge on a meal of a lifetime. Go to Le Grand Vefour, located in the Palais Royal next to the hotel. It is gorgeous and the food is to die for! You can save a few dollars as well if you order the fixed priced meal at lunchtime.

Standing on the steps of the entrance you can see Opera House at the end of the street. The lobby was nicely decorated and even had a replica of the Venus De Milo. The staff was wonderful! Everyone from the maids to the concierge were courteous and helpful. The staff at the front desk and at the concierge spoke English extremely well. That helped us out a lot, since our french is terrible. We also took the opportunity to email the hotel through their website to confirm our reservations (we booked through expedia) and requested a room with a view of the Louvre. They always replied to our emails promptly and accomodated all our requests. We booked a deluxe room so I imagine that our room is larger that the standard rooms. Although the room was small compared to American hotels, it did include a stocked mini-fridge--that we loaded with our own goodies--and a balcony. The best thing about this is hotel is LOCATION. Aside from being right across the street from the Louvre, there are also numerous cafes and restaurants withn walking distance. This includes a few of the ones everyone is always talking about, like Cafe Marly and Angelina. If you plan on going anywhere beyond the 1st then you can take the metro which is literally right outside the hotel. There are also a ton of souvenir shops close by on Rue de Rivoli and a few blocks south east on that same street are a bunch of clothing stores like H&M, Zara and Mango. There is even a Monoprix on Opera street where you can buy drinks and snacks. Although we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Du Louvre, there are a few cons that I can't ignore. I know this a debated issue among those who have posted reviews, but the lobby DOES stink of smoke. Being from California, the indoor smoking drove me crazy! I do understand though that this couldn't be helped since there is a bar very close to the lobby. Another downside is the price. If you want fork up the cash to stay at a centrally located hotel then you might want to consider staying here. But I feel that there are a lot of nice hotels that are more affordable outside the 1st. Although very yummy, the restaurants and cafes near the hotel tend to also be expensive. Because of this, I think that when I return to Paris I would probably stay in a hotel in the Left Bank, specifically the Latin Quarter, which I feel would be more suited for a young couple like us.

The gym was a bit small, but it had a working treadmill in a clean environment, so I was satisfied. Although I got confused as to how many miles I ran since they use the Metric system there.

The rooms well like any city hotel the rooms are quite small, we had a free upgrade to deluxe room and whilst still pretty small, it was bigger than some rooms I have been in, the room again was very clean and the maids done a fantastic job in cleaning our room everyday, and the room had air conditioning and if its hot when your there (it was for us) then this is a god send.

We also had a room service meal which was very good and nicely presented. The bar staff at the hotel's pleasant bar were also top notch. I also found eating breakfast in the hotel's brasserie much nicer than in some poky breakfast room without windows (which even some large hotels have). Breakfast had a good selection and did not (contrary to some earlier reviews) peter out early.
