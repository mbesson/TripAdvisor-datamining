I stayed at the hotel for 8 nights so had ample time to really get a sense of the place. Because of the length of our stay we had to bring our golden retriever along with us. The ITC's website states that they are a pet friendly hotel but I was worried that having our dog along would be a hassle. Right from the check-in it was clear that when the ITC says \"pet friendly\" they mean it! At check-in our dog was provided with a welcome package containing some doggie treats, a spare leash and admission to PawsWay at Queens Quay. The staff was very friendly and accommodating with our dog during our whole stay. The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated and the beds are, fall asleep in an instant, comfy. The staff go out of their way to accommodate and are friendly and professional. One night, we ordered take-out from a local Indian restaurant. When the food was delivered we realized they hadn't included rice with our dishes. We called down to room service and asked if they could deliver two portions of plain rice to our room. Within 10 minutes, we had two plates of rice and were able to enjoy our meal. I would recommend the ITC highly for both business or pleasure.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLove this hotel\u201d", "Author": "MM2424", "ReviewID": "UR126452009", "Content": "Great service, wonderful rooms and the beds are so comfy!

We had a room on the 17th floor over looking Lake Ontario and the CN tower. Location was perfect just a block south of the venue in the entertainment district. Check-in was fast and friendly and we received a room exactly what I had booked with a King Bed Non Smoking. There were lovely views from the elevator hallway and from our room. The CN tower never ceases to amaze me. What an awesome structure both at day and night. Wonderful views. Hubby and I liked sitting at the window sipping a Drambuie and watching the men working construction waaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy down below at the base of the tower, building what ever it is that they are building. They looked like little ants toiling away. We liked watching the planes land on the island, the white capped waves on the lake, the GO trains coming and going, the clouds in the sky. The bed had clean fresh crisp sheets with big soft pillows. We slept well but if you are a light sleeper I would recommend bringing ear plugs as there are lots of assorted noises, not loud though. The room was clean and large and it had a nice flat screen TV. There is a Keurig coffee maker, iron and ironing board, and nice crystal glasses. I hate drinking out of plastic cups. Lots of hot water for our shower. We were very comfortable indeed. The Azure restaurant in the lobby was nice but very expensive so we only stopped in for a night cap after the concert but it was a relaxing place to sit for a bit.

And of course, the CN Tower is a minute away and some rooms have views of the Tower. From a business perspective, the meeting rooms are a little oppressive with low ceilings and there isn't a large ballroom onsite but that's partly due to the location beside the Convention Centre. The other big plus with this hotel is the guest room size...they're big! Lots of room for a king-size bed and a couch, coffee table sitting area. Due to the angles of the outside walls, the rooms offer extra privacy at the windows as well. The one restaurant in the lobby is slightly on the upscale side of average but there are many great restos within a 10 minute walk or a short cab ride, and there are some typical chain/touristy spots just steps from the front door.

So, at the end of the day they were accomodating Rooms are average size with a nice LARGE Phillips HD TV with lots of channels. I also found the beds very comfortable. The location on Front street is walking distance to lots of restaurants, Real Sports Bar, ACC and Rogers Centre and CN Tower BAD The furniture looks dated and the wallpaper in the bathrooms (does anyone use wallpaper anymore) was very old and peeling in spots. Definitely ready for a face lift Checked in around 2:30ish and room was not available and had to leave luggage with concierege Went to the Lobby bar at 5:30 after our show and the service was terrible. Took 25 min to get our first drink and almost 20 to get our second. Everyone in the bar was complaining and a manager eventually came over and apologized. Apparently the night before, one of the gents in our group was at this bar the night before and almost got into a fight with the bartender as the bartender tried to scam them out of some money....The hotel needs to look into the service aspect of this area for sure.

The hotel is easy to find, just under the CN Tower. This great location is why I picked the hotel, but it was perfect for our downtown Toronto explorations. My advice is to get the breakfast package with your room. The buffet is really deluxe - they even have an omelet chef! Parking is under the building. If you are going to use your car, be ready to pay $45 for valet service. That beats the $25 per day flat fee of the self park, but only if you are going to go in and out with the car. We didn't need ours, because we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. The valets were helpful even though we didn't use them, directing us to the better deal. The lobby is spacious and well-kept, with a nice concierge desk. The clerks checked us in right away, with no wait. We were upgraded to a better room for free. It was on the 13th floor, an unusual thing to find in any hotel. We took it and had no weird things happen. The room had comfortable beds, a nice view of the city and lots of great amenities. We really liked the iPod dock on the clock radio. You could charge your device and listen to your own music. The room was clean and had all the supplies you need. We walked to the AC Center, Hockey Hall of Fame and CN Tower, all from the hotel. It is also really close to the convention center and rail transport.

Grateful to have a room with lots of seating, as we were having friends over. I highly recommend paying a bit more for a Club level room. This will provide you with a morning breakfast (many different options for food & lots of warm beverages, juices, etc.); afternoon tea & snacks, and then evening cocktail hour (a wide selection of hot & cold appetizers & non-alcoholic drinks). You can purchase alcohol in the Club lounge if you like. This is very similar to what the Marriott Concierge level rooms offer, but even better! More food options. The staff are always super friendly & helpful. Vera particularly stands out. I briefly met her once when checking in & she remembered my name and our New Year's Eve plans for the rest of our stay.

Found the reservation desk and completed all the necessary documentation and checked our small bags with the concierge. We were told our 'specific room' was not ready as yet and as we secured a King suite online, perhaps they are particular as to where you are slotted. I also asked if wi-fi was included but sadly no, a different company owns that right in the hotel so we would be charged $10/night for that privilege. In this day and age, when this hotel is close to the heart of the financial district, this is just ludicrous to add this charge! If anything, the room rate should be inclusive of this and not nickle/dime the customer. For those who need it, there's a Starbucks close by where you can utilize their free wi-fi. Finally our room was ready and it was on the 11th floor - not quite the view of the lake as insinuated by the online site. However, what was evident from the moment we opened the door - was the smell. And we weren't quite sure what it was. Layout of the room was very good, bed is comfortable albeit a bit too soft, older furnishings, fairly good bathroom lighting - but a smell. Not enough to make you wrinkle your nose but enough to wonder what it was. And I really miss not being able to open a window in most of these hotels. So we turned the fan on high to see if that would help with the 'smell' and went out to explore the city. Upon returning, the smell was still evident. We didn't mention it to the front desk staff thinking it may resolve itself but it never did. What made it even worse is the fan/air conditioning vent is situated in such a way it blows on the bed - which can dry your eyes out in a noo yawk minute. So we turned it off and spent a very restless night in a stinky room. After much thought we feel the smell most closely resembled someone who smoked in this non-smoking room and it was sprayed to disguise the acrid stench. The Azure (?) bar on the first floor was empty most of the time and while there was a little combo playing when we returned from dinner, the bar was still fairly empty. Not sure why when the hotel appeared to be fairly busy. There are several interesting places to stay downtown so think we'll try elsewhere when we return next week.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cClassy and Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Pauline S", "ReviewID": "UR117557983", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel because it was right next to the Convention Center, and on top of it's central location, it's a great hotel.

I will say first off, that the staff was very friendly and helpful, which is always refreshing to see. The hotel lobby is very large and pretty, and the elevators were quick. The lobby has a number of places to sit and relax as well. The room was nice and spacious, with a view of the CN Tower. The tower lights up at night, for an even more impressive view. The room was quiet the entire stay, no complaints. The rooms do not have a fridge to store your beverages, only a mini-bar, with the standard outrageous prices ($4.50 for a can of coke, miniature bottle of liquor $9.00). There are also no vending machines in the hotel for snacks and drinks, as I did ask at one point. There are ice machines on each floor however. You can also enjoy a bottle of water stocked in the room, for the hefty sum of $6 if opened. You could set the temperature of your room, which was fine during the entire stay. The maid service was good as well, with towels restocked and beds made each day. There were flat-screen televisions in the room, that had a large number of channels to enjoy each day, and an alarm clock with docks for apple products that are becoming standard in hotels these days. We ordered room service for dinner one night, and it came pretty quickly. The food (cheeseburger with fries, and grilled chesse) was tasty, no complaints here, as I am already well versed in the crazy room service prices and fees. You do have to spoil yourself sometimes. The room service is 24 hours, although the menu options become more limited depending on what time of day it is. There was also a free newspaper outside the door each morning. The checkout was great and quick. The hotel puts the bill and a form under your door at night, and you just put your room number on the form, and drop it in a box downstairs. The keycards can be left in the room. The valet parking was quick and efficient, although pricey at $40 per night. I will complain however that the hotel does try to nickel and dime you to death in some respects. I did not bring my laptop, so I am not sure of the wifi charges in the rooms. However, in the 24 hour business center, it costs $3 every 10 minutes to use the computer, which you have to pay by putting your credit card into a machine, which dispenses it when you log off. In addition to this charge, it is .75 per black and white page printed out, and $2.00 per color page. I wish all hotels would just go to free wifi, and no charge for the business center (excluding printing, as it would be abused). The shower was also not consistent. The hot water would go in and out, going from very warm to extremely cold throughout your shower. I am not sure if this was just our room, or was a hotel wide issue. One tip would be to skip the Azure restaurant in the hotel for breakfast. My girlfriend and I ate here one morning, and both ordered the $16 meal eggs, bacon or sausage, with home fries meal (toast included). The meal came out to $63 for the two of us, as they charge $5 for each for a very small glass of orange juice, and the same for a small cup of coffee. The coffee did have free refills, and $5 was removed from the bill as I do not drink coffee. Sixty-three dollars for a small breakfast, come on now, it was average taste, nothing special. The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk from the CN tower and Rogers center, and a couple of sightseeing tours park their buses down the block from the hotel, which have offices where you can buy tickets. The hockey hall of fame and Royal Ontario Museum are about a 10 minute walk.

This year, we chose Toronto, and the Intercontinental seemed to be the perfect choice, mainly because of its location (a 5-minute walk to Rogers Centre). While we enjoyed our trip, the hotel certainly wasn't the highlight. Here are the pros and cons: Pros: As mentioned before, the location can't be beat. Walking distance to lots of restaurants, bars, shopping, etc. The staff at the concierge were awesome; we are in our 20s and like to go out drinking, but don't like loud clubs. The concierge recommended great places that suited our tastes and they were always very genuine and friendly. It was very quiet, not a lot of kids running around. The pool was quiet and relaxing, with friendly staff at the spa. Cons: We are from the US, so using our phones while roaming in Canada is extremely expensive...nonetheless, they refused to budge on their $9.99/day wi-fi charges. This was very frustrating to us. The very first morning, after traveling the entire day before, we were awoken at 9:00am by loud banging and sawing coming from the room above us. When we called to ask about it, it was stopped, but it was still irritating to have to deal with. After arriving back at the hotel late one night, we ordered room service, but it never arrived. Decided to just give up when my boyfriend finally just fell asleep. Not once, but twice, the fire alarm went off. The first time it was as we were getting ready to go to a fancy dinner, and I ended up having to walk down 14 flights of stairs in high heels. The second time was at 7:00am, and the alarm sounded for almost 30 minutes. The room never seemed to be able to cool down, no matter how long we had the air conditioner running. Very unpredictable water temperatures when taking a shower.

The location of this property cannot be beat, two blocks from Union Station, the metro, a 5-7 minute walk to the CN Tower, the Convention Center and Toronto's major league team facilities. The staff were exceptional - caring, professional, and welcoming. The staff did whatever it took to ensure guest satisfaction and a memorable stay. I would like to point out what a great staff there was in the InterContinental Club Lounge. These women were gracious, hard working and a joy to talk too. This staff really went the extra effort to make my stay and other guests a wonderful one. My room which was upgraded at check-in was smartly furnished, comfortable, relaxing, and lighting was very adequate. Room space was outstanding.

All the newspapers and magazine offerings were there as well as a well stocked library of books and music. Complimentary computer usage was available in the lounge. All lounge guests are able to take advantage of the car/driver within a 5 km radius of the hotel subject to availability.

Stayed at this Hotel in November. When i arrived from the airport coming Barbados my best friend had checked in the room for me. The Hotel's lobby looked very upscale and the front desk personnel were very professional. Although i knew my buddy had checked in, i was unaware of the room number so in went to front desk and they called the room to verify that i was the other party. All i was thinking was oh my gosh it is 11pm and i don't want any problems with this room because i am tired and want to go to sleep. Surprisingly when i entered the room it was pretty spacious and clean with a Fantastic view of the city. The mini bar was fully stocked which had everything from Oreos to Diet Coke. Everything well arranged and room was good which i was pleased about since in the picky one and my friend could care less if it was a cave with 2 beds. The following morning i ordered in-room breakfast which i found was a tab-bit pricey but to my surprised when it arrived, it came on a fully laid out dinning table!! from Table Cloth, flowers, appetizer fork, spoon, knifes i mean i wish i took a photo of how well this table was layed out, we were both impressed because out of all the hotels I've stayed in and that was the most precised room service table ever. It felt like if i was actually in the restaurant and all the hots were hot and the colds were cold. Was diffinantly worth the price if not even more, breakfast was AAA star awards and it was just Breakfast The housekeeping staff were polite and most importantly the room was always cleaned and all my mess looked alot better when i returned. After all of this being said, the only downfall to me was the places that i wanted to go such as Eaton Center, Church Street were not the easiest walk away, but were a bit far to walk for comfort. If your going to the CN tower, then ok! but if you want to be in the dundas hub... taxi would be the best bet although the cost of the taxi does add up.

My Priority Club Platinum status didn't help this at all, but hey, no problem. We will park the car and go for something to eat. We were informed that we could not self park our car as the lot was full; not sure how that is possible, so we had to valet park at a cost of $ 40.00. While I am sure that is compeditive in downtown Toronto, I really prefer parking myself. This also meant we had to get our bags from the car, and couldn't walk around to find a place to eat. Again, no problem as the valet parking attendant advised us we could leave our bags with the bellman by the front desk. Get to the front desk and no one is there to take our bags; so, we go to the hotel restauarant and have our late lunch. By 4:30, the ballgame had let out, and the line up must have been an hour to check in. Luckily the guy at the concierge desk was very helpful, and able to give us our room keys saving us the long wait. Now, by 5:00'ish, we finally get to our room. I was told we were \"upgraded\" but I really don't see where the upgrade was; the room was quite \"standard\" in my opinion, which is fine, but after 1-1/2 hours to get it, I guess I may have been expecting more.

What a coincidence that both keys (carried by 2 different people) were de-magnetized at the same time even though it had worked perfectly for the past few days. I believe that someone did not bother to extend our access and the keys were automatically disabled at a set time for security reasons. The insensitive way the front desk handled the situation, is not that of a great hotel.

Similarly there is a fairly poor choice of offerings at breakfast and on some days even basics such as bagels were missing. On another occasion the maid knocked on our door to turn down the bed at 9:30pm when I had just gone to sleep. Newspapers were not delivered every day.

I can summarize my experience based on the below: 1- Hotel in General It is a luxurious hotel with a really spacious lobby and a smooth welcoming atmosphere in a modern environment. You enter the hotel to a huge lobby offering all the required amenities of food and drink. you can just lounge on one of the really comfortable sofas or just order a boor at the lobby cafe. It is a big building in the shape of descending stairs, more like a pyramid without any obstructions. the entire facade throws on the city center with its wonderful high rises or on the track of Central Station. Trust me you will enjoy looking at the trains. 2- Rooms Rooms are luxurious enough and spacious. They accommodate all your expectations and hold all utilities which one might be needing for his stay. The TV is a large LCD screen, rightly placed opposite your bed, making those early breakfast morning more and more enjoyable. Bathrooms are clean and neat, with splendid showers and tubs. In short the rooms live up to the famous Intercontinental standards. 3- Service I haven't used much of the hotel services. But I can say that the staff were very welcoming and really warm. The door men are just smiley and really helpful for any direction or facility you might request of them. I was smoothly and neatly welcomed at the reception by a wonderful young lady who just facilitated my check in less than 3 minutes. Just make sure that you get the room you confirmed. I confirmed a double queen and got a single King. It took them 5 minutes to switch me back to my original choice, but hey it is a mistake non the less, but rectified quite quickly. The only thing I can;t tolerate in hotels is the paid internet access. Chains like Intercontinental, and especially business hotels like this one should really start thinking about granting free internet access. It is paid a the hotel and I would say not at all cheap. Service is another thumbs up. 4- Location If you like the vibrant and dynamic environment of a modern North American city, then this hotel is rightly places. It is in the heart of the city center 2 minutes on foot from the CN Tower and the Rogers stadium. It is also 10 minutes away on foot from all the big attraction centers of the city, and taxis are just very easy to catch on the main street just at the front entrance of the hotel. Just east, and around 2 minutes away on foot you will find Toronto Central station which connects you to all of Canada and the US. Location is 5 starts by all means 5- Price While I reckon that the hotel offers all those thumbs up on all those scales, and even if it is an Intercontinental chain, there are other choices in the city, so the CAD 380/night is really not that sustained (and that's excluding taxes). Fairmont is just a block away and offers the same exact amenities in a 5 star atmosphere for very similar prices.

Finally they offered free breakfast for 1 person, while traveling with wife, how does this make sense?, sort of a slap in the face! The rooms are nice as we had a junior suite which was quite large for a JS.

I am not knocking the hotel, but for the average price charged per night there are other options that are more accomodating to the guest, rather than being there just because they are being paid to be there.

One other comment that probably is general rather than specific to this hotel. I'm a Platinum on Priority Club but don't tend to stay in too many Intercontinentals. This hotel (and maybe all ICs) don't provide any special amenities, AFAIK, to Platinums. You need to purchase an $200 Ambassador package, which I haven't done -- I did it one year but didn't get the amenities that would have made it worthwhile so dropped it.

We booked a double occupancy room because we travel with our toddler who is two years old and needs a bed. My wife was also 7 months pregnant. 2. We requested a late check-in, with an approximate arrival of 1 am. 3. We received no communication by phone or email that the hotel was overbooked and that there was no room for us prior to our arrival. 4. On arrival, at approximately 130 am, the front desk employee immediately left to go into the back room, presumably to speak with the manager about our reservation. When she returned a few minutes later, we were told by the front desk that unfortunately there were no more double occupancy rooms to fulfill our reservation, but that we were being given an extra large room with a King Sized bed and that it was a great alternative. 5. Upon arriving in the room, we saw a tiny Murphy bed that was pulled down in the middle of a conference room as our \"King Sized bed in an extra large hospitality suite\". There was no room for the three of us, and we were obviously going to have a very uncomfortable night. Many of the options offered as standard on our reservation where not present in the room we were ultimately given. 6. On calling the manager we were offered a 25% discount as compensation and told that \"guests always stay in this room\". We were also assured we would be given a complimentary breakfast for the 3 of us, something that frankly was included in our reservation anyway and wasn't actually a concession. We were also offered a cot for our toddler and told that as a concession it would be free of charge instead of being a charge of $25. This was laughable because these 'concessions' did not bring us near to the level of experience that we had booked and paid for. 7. At this point, I started getting worried about the suit I had deposited for safekeeping with the hotel staff earlier in the week. I left if with the hotel because I was going on a trip and was returning and staying at the hotel later in the week. I had originally planned to pick it up in the morning, but decided to immediately go downstairs to retrieve it. I received it back and it had been significantly and permanently damaged on the front right portion and left breast of the jacket. My wife and I sat in the room and examined the damage for some time, in total shock. I called down and was told by the night manager, who had made the nominal concessions for our room, to make an appointment with the desk manager in the morning. 8. The cot then arrived with no pillows. My pregnant wife slept on the hard and foul-smelling couch beside our toddler to make sure she would not fall off and we placed some other pillows on the floor to protect her on the other side. 9. Soon after the sun rose the fire alarm went off and we all went down to the street to join the other guests, after having had approximately 3 hours sleep. 30 minutes later, not one member of the Intercontinental staff had come by to update us on the fire alarm, nor was any staff member present during the entire ordeal. Finally a guest wandered by with a coffee and confronted the sleepy and now very angry guests (dressed in everything from pajamas to underwear still standing on the street corner) to tell us that everything had been resolved for some time. 10. Approximately 1 hour after the event we got lost in the hotel in locked stairwells with another family who had been directed by the only visible staff member in the lobby to take stairs located past the conference area. 11. After we returned to the hotel room we tried to fall back asleep. We heard a dripping noise and we noticed water leaking from the ceiling approximately 10 ft from the bed. After trying unsuccessfully to sleep, we decided to leave. 12. We went to use our breakfast vouchers that we given to us but were told that they had expired and that we were too late to use them. I have waited to post this review so that a fair chance was allowed to the hotel to resolve my concerns and compensate me for both my experience and the suit that they irreparably damaged.

I am a Platinum Ambassador and the one thing I always find outstanding at this hotel is the staff. From the front desk service, to the concierge, to the bellhops - they all provide impeccable service. I stay in hotels about 40 nights per year on business. I have stayed at each of the three Intercontinentals in Canada (this one, Toronto Yorkville and Montreal) and, though each has its own charms, this one is my favourite. I have stayed in three different room types - standard (I am a smoker and have stayed in this room by choice a couple of times - with my ambassador status, each time they have been gracious enough to provide me with club access in lieu of an upgrade), deluxe and junior suite. The smoking, standard rooms are on low floors (I have always stayed on floor 4 of a 25+ floor hotel) and have not been renovated like the rest (I have found smoking rooms at most hotels to be the worst rooms in the hotel, likely for good reason). The deluxe and junior suites are great, I have generally stayed on high floors with great views and modern furnishings. The Club Lounge is very nice (although I was surprised that you pay for alcohol), and the continental breakfast is a nice way to start the day - particularly the smoked salmon. An example of the great service they provide - I had a late meeting that ended past 4 p.m. (my Ambassador late-checkout). My flight left at 6:20 p.m. I had the bellhop keep my bags at the hotel and asked for a limo at 4:30. However, my meeting ran late and I didn't end up at the hotel until just after 5 p.m. As soon as I told the bellhop of my situation, he literally ran to get my bags while another escorted me to the car (which was still there, more than half an hour later than I had booked). The first bellhop brought my bags to the car and the driver (during Toronto rush hour traffic) took a route that ensured that I got to the airport on time.

The PATH system can be confusing to someone who is not familiar with it due to the convoluted networks and the unclear signages. But once you figure it out then you're all set because you can reach places such as City Hall, Eaton Centre, Union Station, etc. comfortably (useful during hot summer and cold winter days!) The hotel was not grand by any means, and the lobby area was just average. The reception person was nice enough, but not very warm. The housekeeping staff was really amazing though! He was attentive, fast and very friendly (I had made several requests and he offered to fill my ice bucket) The room was your average five-star hotel setup. I stayed in this hotel with 3 other friends. We booked through Hotwire and the four of us were assigned a room with two double beds. The decor was a little drab and somewhat tired, but the room was very clean. The bathroom was also average. The view from our room was amazing though (I like city view and a bit of people watching!) I checked out the fitness centre and the swimming pool as well. The fitness centre was small, but it had everything I needed. There was a poorly-lit yoga room in the back which I thought was a bit weird. The pool area was alright. They had a small pool, a kids' pool and a jacuzzi, which were all salt water. There were some metal palm tree decorations around the pool area from which water was flowing (sort of like a fountain). It was a good concept but the salt water had caused the metal to rust a bit. The pool area was located in their spa area, so visitors were asked to keep the noise level down. However, there were a bunch of kids in there during my visit and they were quite rowdy, but the pool attendant did not do anything. In terms of location, the hotel was located by the Business District, so it was a bit further away from all the action. It was, however, very close to Union Station where you can hop on a subway to take you to wherever you want. On the plus side, the hotel was very serene and quiet at night, so you shouldn't have any trouble catching some quality snooze time.

My wife joined me for the first two days and night, then left me to my conference (next door at the MTCC) for the rest of the stay. Check-in was high-class. They allowed us to park ($40 for valet) and check-in early, and the process was smooth in both cases. A package had been sent to me earlier in the week and the front desk made sure I knew where to go to get it. This is a small thing, but in some hotels picking up pre-shipped material is arduous and stressful. Intercontinental has the process down to a smooth professional transaction. We had a junior King suite, which consisted of a spacious bedroom open to a small living room, a hallway and the bathroom. For two, it's just enough space. For me alone, it was ample room to spread out and relax each night. There are two 32\" flat screens in the room(s), as well as a desk/workspace with free regular tethered internet, or wi-fi for a price. Luckily for us we had a spectacular view of the CN Tower, SkyDome, Island airport, and harbour. The room was decorated nicely, with slightly upscale furniture/carpets, and even bamboo flooring. I found the walls a little bashed up and aged -- wallpaper is starting to peel -- but otherwise it's modern and comfortable, if not totally luxurious. Cleaning staff were attentive and kind, taking great care to return the room to its pristine state each day. Staff throughout the hotel were courteous and professional, effiecient and pleasant at all times. The downside? Intercontinental's pricing is high. Room service and restaurant prices are utterly excessive ($22+ for a two-egg breakfast), which makes it necessary to go elsewhere for all meals. If you can upgrade to the Executive levels for $20 a night, getting free breakfast and wifi, it's more than worth it. I couldn't justify that to my company, so I had to scramble to get food outside of the hotel each morning. Other than that, my only beef was with the elevators -- we were on the 24th floor (of 25)...and each time we needed an elevator it was slow to come, and then made countless stops on the way down. The hotel would be wise to dedicate banks of elevators to certain floors (ie one bank serves floors 3 to 13, the other 14 to 25). Other guests had the same comment as I did on this one -- at least it gave us something to talk about as we waited through the frustration. Finally, a correction on something an earlier reviewer said -- the hotel is in fact very close to the PATH system. Directly across Front Street from the hotel is an entrance to the PATH. So in any weather, you can get yourself around without getting soaked. Given its central location (walk to the Convention centre, waterfront and ferries, CN Tower, SkyDome, Entertainment District, Distillery District, etc), its wonderful staff, and its luxurious feel, the InterContinental is a safe bet for those seeking mid-to-high range accommodations.

To observe Alfred Packer Day with our Canadian \"family\" ( the only individual to be hung for the crime of cannibalism in the states!

Well, we have been informed that indeed he is now up for nomination. Go Kev!! Without reservation, we can state that the Intercontinental has once more exceeded its richly deserved 5-star ranking. Every aspect of the stay once again world-class without exception.

The list could go on for 5 more pages but suffice it to say that this, the 3rd visit, reaffirmed our staunch belief that, bar none, the Intercontinental rules the field in every measure of guest convenience and amenities, and whatever is in second place is too far in the rear to be discernable. Oh yes,a final note: Mr. Bowen has advised us that the G.M., Monsieur Payette has introduced a Rewards Program for dedicated, loyal guests of the Intercontinental. Guests can now achieve \"Marble\", \"Pearl\", \"Silver\", \"Gold\", and \"Platinum\" status. As for us, Mr Bowen has informed that as a result of our loyalty and several visits for the purpose of \"spreading the wealth\" ( in the words of THAT distinguished gentleman, M. Obama), Mr. Payette has graciously granted us a status change from \"Talcum\" to \"Cinder\"!! And following our next visit in the spring, we have been adivsed to hold out hope for \"Aluminum\".

My reason for my stay was neither for leisure or business; it was an emergency situation that necessitated my stay. I originally booked the room for 5 nights off a discounted hotel booking website. It was an amazing deal in a time when I needed some good luck in my life. I recently had many of my belongings stolen; including all of my personal identification. Upon checking in, I immediately informed the front desk staff of my situation. Considering that I did not have any photo identification, (a requirement to check into most if not all major hotels), my mother accompanied me to check-in. She lives in another city and would not be staying in the room with me, however after staying at the near-by Hilton and Sheraton under similar circumstances, exceptions were made for me because they had her identification on file. The manager on-duty approved my stay and set up a system of me signing my name on a sheet of paper which would be used to verify my identity in event that I needed to replace my room keys or if I extended my stay and needed new keys cut. I did extend my stay - I had no choice and seeing as I had quite a few things in the room (due to my circumstance)... extending was expensive for me but helped ease some stress. I lost my key one late night and had difficulty with a manager on-duty. He could not find my signature, questioned what I told him about my signature identity-verification and told me to wait at my room for security. Security came after a long wait of me sitting in the hall outside of my room, asked me to identify multiple items in the room then let me in. I extended another week - paying the full rate without complaint. Unfortunately, I cam home late from work and lost my key, late at night a week after the first incident. The same manager was on duty. He remembered me but still would not budge in having security accompany to my room. I was able to recide the exact rate I paid for my room each night for the week. He brought up my lack of ID and questioned me on why I didn't have it (which is frankly none of his business, and gave me scripted lines on the hotel's policy on refusing guests with no identification. I was very frustrated and voiced my frustration with the situation - he even admitted to remembering me from the week-prior. The next morning I again intended to extend. I was called by the day's front desk manager who informed me that the hotel would be booked for the night. I knew this to be untrue because I had been monitoring the availability on the hotel's website. When I mentioned this a room suddenly appeared. Then my lack of identification was brought up. I don't understand why this suddenly became an issue, as I had been at the hotel for so long already and we made an agreement upon my check-in. To me - I feel I was treated poorly by the second manager because of my disagreement the previous night... sort of a \"getting back at me\" type of attitude could be detected. But I was told that a) I could extend and b) I could book online if I chose to for the next night or call in the morning to ensure a room would be free. I went to the lobby to pay for my night and immediately detected a sour attitude from the Manager. She was very very difficult with me. She made it clear to me that she had done me a favour by allowing me to stay. She again lectured me on my ID situation (after telling me on the phone that we could photocopy my one credit card and use that as identification). The way she was speaking to me, questioning me, repeating things that had already been talked about and dealt with - I told her that I found her customer service to be appalling. I am a very easy-going person and customer. I am not a confrontational person nor am I difficult to please... but I had to speak up; her attitude was incredibly catty and disrespectful. After I spoke up she refused to let me pay for the night. I asked for Head Office's number. After a few minutes of back-and-forth bickering at the front desk, in front of other customers, she finally let me pay for the room and after much hesitation, gave me Head office's number. When I tried to renew the room the next day I was told that my reservation could not be extended. I called the Head Office number that I was given the day prior. I told my story to the agent who picked up, only to then realize that the number I was given was not to a \"head office\"... it was the reservation line of the same hotel! The woman who took my call was very pleasant and passed me onto the hotel manager, Warren. Warren informed me that my stay could not be extended due to my lack of ID. I explained that moving out on such short notice would be extremely difficult and I questioned why it is an issue for me to stay (paying the hotel's full room-rate, ordering room service, generally being a good guest) now when my lack of id was a non-issue when I checked-in. His only reply was that it was a mistake. Well sir.... you made a mistake yet your mistake has caused turmoil for me. After speaking with the \"head office\" number, I was basically told that the hotel was independently owned and there really is no recourse for me - the hotel management's decision is final. Before these events transpired, I had nothing but good to say about the Intercontinental Hotel. The facilities are very nice, the service was friendly and efficient. But the lack of empathy, catiness, rudeness, and general professionalism by the hotel's management team and total lack of recourse for the hotel's guests upon receiving poor customer service is absolutely appalling.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201c\"We will be back\"\u201d", "Author": "Romie_01", "ReviewID": "UR28506412", "Content": "First, I must start from the valet parking, who's service was second to none.

Right in the town center but still easy to jump on the highway even in the crowdy morning. The reception went very smoothly and they took very good care of me. The room: Very good size. Big bed, nice desk. Only problem is the glass on the desk which makes it difficult to use an optical mouse with a computer. Minot problem really... The TV is big and working great. The selection of food and drinks in the minibar is very good. The bathroom has everything needed and the right way. Nobody is replacing all the little bottles everyday. If it's not empty, it stays which is very good. Also I had one soap which lasted the whole week and it was just perfect. I hate when the clean ladies change everything everyday.

If you don't want your towel to be changed, it won't be changed. Not like many other hotels where they don't say anything or they do the opposite of what your require.

I have stayed at many InterContinental Hotels in Europe, and this one does not measure up to even the worst day at any of them, but there is a very good reason why; it's a converted Crowne Plaza. A very old Crowne Plaza. When you enter the hotel for the first time, it's all InterContinental. Very beautiful, modern and clean, with staff who are anxious to serve. Check in was a breeze, and then I took the elevator (very nice elevator, too) to the 21st floor. I felt like I stepped into a time warp when I got off the elevator -- it was 1978 from the floor to the ceiling. All topaz, and other colors that go with topaz. When I got to my room it was more of the same. The only \"InterContinental\" part was the bed linens. Everything else was classic, cheap hotel. The room smelled very stale -- like a converted smoking room -- and everything was horribly disappointing. The thermostat still says Crowne Plaza. I called to request another room and was sent to the 16th floor where a bellman met me with new keys. This is a remodeled floor. It's like 50% InterContinental -- modern decor but more than a little disheveled. My room was much better, but nothing (and I mean nothing) like an InterContinental room in Europe. The smell was the same because the ancient, loud, rattling ventilation system is there for good. The 15-year old, 27-inch television had a distorted picture because the TV signal for some channels is HD squeezed into a box format. The desk chair was broken; the seat was falling through the middle. Both the wireless and ethernet internet access were abysmally slow. The bathroom had been touched up, but not gutted like it should have been after 20 or so years. In short it was a $150 per night room that I was paying $300 for. I could go on with tons of examples, but suffice it to say the hotel will disappoint anyone who has stayed at another InterContinental hotel pretty much anywhere. And at $300 per night it is horribly overpriced. If you can stay here for $100-$150, that's almost worth it.

I booked this room using a discount hotel website, and paid approx. $140/night. For that price, I believe I got good value for my money. However, had I paid the regular rate of nearly $400/night for this room, I would have been greatly disappointed. Due to road construction, finding the hotel's parking entrance was tricky, but once we got inside, the amount of parking was rather plentiful (but tight for SUVs and expensive: about C$18/day). Front desk check-in was quick, but I felt that I did not receive the attention a customer paying full price would have received; I believe the front desk clerk thought I was a low-class person because I refused help with my luggage and asked the hotel to remove me from the C$1.50/day newspaper delivery service. While this may seem cheap to some, the fact is that I am a doctoral student who can't afford to be nickeled-and-dimed to death. (Fortunately, the check-out clerk was much more friendly, nearly flirtatious!) The room was quite large with very comfortable mattresses and new-appearing carpeting. Our excellent views of the CN Tower and Lake Ontario were facilitated by enormous windows. However, the furnishings appeared worn and second-rate, considering the hotel's normal price-point. Likewise, a cheap, mid-1990s-era, small RCA color TV occupied an enormous entertainment unit. The bathroom was all marble tile and quite spacious but poorly-lit. The decor of the room, and of the hotel in general, was about 10 years out-of-date. My companions and I did not use room service, nor did we use the in-room mini bar (the charges were outrageous: a candy bar or bag of M&Ms for C$4.50, a liter of bottled water for C$6, and so on). The meals at the in-hotel restaurant looked wonderful, but were greatly over our budget; the breakfast bar alone was C$21 per person. Intercontinental Toronto Centre is a great deal provided you can book online for $125-175/night. It has great views, a convenient location, and comfortable accommodations.

I didn't have time to enjoy pool or rest of the amenities so I can't comment on that. My husband called and couldn't be put through because they couldn't find my name by confirmation number or by my last name.

Our hotel faced the C.N Tower, steps from the RogersCentre (where the Toronto Blue Jays MBL Baseball team play), also a short walk from the Air Canada Centre (where the Toronto Maple Leafs NHL hockey team and Toronto Raptors Basketball team play), underground shopping (it is huge...and I mean huge the extent of the tunnels that go all the way to the Eaton Centre), steps from Union Station and major Toronto Subway trains and public transit plus a short distance to the Entertainment District for live theatre, bars, clubs, and amzing restaurants! Location to all those places were key to us. Toronto is a great city and this hotel gave us the opportunity to see lots of sites from our hotel home base. So, as you can tell, we were very pleased with the places we could visit right from our hotel room. Our stay was for December 30th and December 31st for a short New Year's Get away. We live about 1 and a quarter hour driving time from Toronto but every now and then we escape to the city. We had planned our 2 day vacation to be relaxing, entertaining in the big T.O and bring in 2008 in style and that's exactly what we got! The room....what can I say....but it was just fabulous. We ended up staying in a suite that had a bedroom with the most luxurious bed and we barely made it out of bed the next day since it was the most comfortable bed ever. The bed linens were so soft and silky and made our stay extremely romantic. We faced the C.N tower from our room and at night the tower was lit up with colourful lights that we admired from the living room just adjecent to our bedroom. We had a desk that was available for business (luckily we were not working that weekend) so it would have been perfect if we needed to do our business. There were connection cables for internet but we never needed it. The livng room had another television and bar area which was comfortable for relaxing. Keep in mind we had booked this weekend for a very well needed restful time and it fulfilled our every wish. We had a lovely view of the lake and the city of Toronto was so pretty all lit up at night. It was a quiet room and we felt it was our own little bit of paradise. There were bathrobes in the room for us to relax in and we brought our own wine, beer and snacks to enjoy our stay. There were lovely crystal wine glasses that we poured our wine into and it was just amazing to be in that setting at the hotel. We walked to restaurants nearby and found a few hidden gems. Our fav place for the afternoon was the Beer Bistro where we had our choice of beers from around the world. We also went to a cajan type place for dinner once called N'Awlins for dinner in the Entertainment District and great Blues live music. We ate at Cora's for yummy breakfast and it was very reasonable.All those places were a 10 minute walk or less. We ate at the hotel's main restaurant called Azure for New Year's Eve and had the most delicious food. There was a live band playing and although it was kind of poorly attented was very nice. Next time I think we'd stay the night at the hotel but go out to a club to have a more party type atmosphere with younger people. Don't get me wrong...the food was awesome and we ate like kings and queens but we were too full to party after....lol The reception desk staff were extremely helpful during our stay and our check in and check out were totally painless. The parking at the hotel was pricey and so we went across the road for the outdoor lot at a much lower rate. The hotel had valet and regular parking right on site. We just used that area to drop off our bags and one of us went in while the other parked the car. It seemed like a pretty safe area but you should always be careful in big cities. Nothing bad happened to our car. The pool facilities were really beautiful and the staff in the spa were very kind and helpful. It had an amazing metal art type palm tree waterfall deorating the poolside so it made it all that much nicer. We had stayed at the Yorkville Intercontinental last year and found this pool to be much nicer. Both hotels are uniquely different. This one is more modern but the Yorkville one is gorgous too. The only downfall was the men's sauna room had not been attented to in a long, long while. My boyfriend let the front desk staff know right away. The women's change room was spotless. The gym had loads of good equipment but we never saw it used durng our stay. The hotel is connected to the large conference centre called the Metro Convention Centre so if you need a place to stay right on site...this is the place. All in all it was a great stay. We booked on priceline and got it for much less than half the rate posted on the room door.

Our room was nicely decorated in honey coloured, slightly cheap looking furnishings. We noted, however, that the elevator areas on our floor and several others were not decorated in the more contemporary style we saw on some other floors. It may be that there is a distinction in room furnishings, too. Housekeeping was OK, but there were some maintenance issues that included peeling paint in the bathroom and a piece of rag wedged in between the mirror and backspalsh.

We were also told that last call was at 11:45, despite the fact that the hotel information book and conciege both said that the bar closes at 1:00 am. We later saw others being served at 12:30 am. The doorman was rarely at the door. There is a button on the phone in one's room that is supposed to be an \"ask anything\" service. We called several times. No one had an answer ... ever.

I highly recommend taking the bus from the airprot to the subway station (The 192 Airport Rocket goes directly from the airport to Kipling subway station, and you transfer at St. George Station to the Milton (yellow) line going south to Union Station. You can save yourself around $13 per person ($2.75 vs the Airport Express at $16.45). The hotel is a short two-block walk from the subway. Between the street cars and the subway, we never had to take a cab. Public transportation is $2.75 to anywhere in the city. We went all over Toronto, and the hotel was a great base to radiate from.

Cleaning was great, and they are thoughtful to give you the option of clean towels or conserving natural resources and reusing the towels -- we would at home, so why not? Bedding made sleeping here great. The sheets were high thread count. The pillows were a perfect blend between soft and firm -- I'm a side sleeper. Down comforters for winter were very comfy.

We have stayed in three other TO properties in the last two years - The Grand which was nice but too small of a room for us, Pantage Suites which was very nice and had a washer/dryer, very large suite, etc. however was a bit too pricey for us and One King West which was very nice also had a washer/dryer but was too small square footage wise and had very weird room confiigurations with huge funiture. So this time I was looking for something that had everything we wanted: a pool, walking distance to restaurants, Eaton's Centre, etc., something kinda funky and upscale but not over priced. I took a huge risk and booked our hotel on Hotwire - I chose a four star hotel for $97 a night and got the Intercontinental which I was thrilled with. The Intercontinental was actually a Crowne Plaza property before Interncontinental bought it and renovated. The outside of of the building is nothing spectacular and we actually drove right by it before \"finding\" it on our return down the block. The hotel is attached to the Convention Centre and the subway right beside the CN Tower. The Lobby is spectacular and the bellman was wonderfully attentive to our many packages, bags and children. Check in took a while and even though we arrived at 4:45pm our room was not ready. This was upsetting because we had been driving all day and wanted to put the kids down for a while. The hotel offered to buy us all a drink (alcoholic for the parents) at the bar - Azure. The bar was very nice and thank goodness they were buying the drinks because they were very very very expensive!! We went back in 45 minutes and the room was still not ready... arrrghhh!! I told them it would cost them two more drinks... they quite happily gave up two more drink vouchers and then got a phone call that room was actually ready. They let me keep the vouchers which was very nice and off we went. We got a room on the 16th floor facing the city (not the CN Tower side). It was very nice, roomy, had a wonderful comfy bed with lots of pillows and a duvet, mini-bar and internet hook up ($11 a day). In the room is where you can tell that not everything has been replaced i.e., door knobs/key passes, temperature controls for room, bathroom fixtures, etc. It would be nice if they did replace everything so that it all feels \"new\", however it would be expensive. We ate at the buffet for breakfast on Sunday morning.. it was very yummy, however a bit pricey again for my liking - $24 each I think. I must admit that I probably did eat at least $20 in Brie.. it was so good.... lol I had a massage in Victoria's Spa. The masseuse was Russian (I've forgotten her name.. ) she was lovely and sweet and gave me a wonderful massage. Again I thought the price was a bit steep - $125 for 55 minutes.. I think I'm sounding cheap now tho... lol The pool has three parts, the main pool which has a fountain/waterfall effect, a small wading pool for kids and a hot tub in which children are not allowed. We had heard that there were specificl \"kids allowed\" times, however this did not seem to be the case and as long as your kids are not yelling and screaming I don't think anyone would have a problem with them being there. Our kids loved the wading pool and had a great time. The locker rooms are great and there's a steam room/sauna in each. The valet parking was again pricey in my opinion... $30 a day, however they were always so nice and helpful that I really didn't mind paying... So here's my list of pros and cons: Pros: Great value for your money Hotel staff very friendly Beautiful renovation Great location Lovely pool Nice sized room Every room has a view of some type Convenient to transit Close to many restaurants on King Street Spa facilities Enticing restaurant/bar area Great bed with fabulous soft linens Lots of storage in room for clothes and \"stuff\" Cons: They should have your room ready by 3pm Expensive parking Old \"fixtures\" and bathtub/showers Slow elevators in the morning when everyone is checking out Expensive internet (it should be included in the room price) There is no back to the counter in the bathroom, it's very annoying to have to keep picking stuff up... Overall we would definitely stay there again for the right price.. it doesn't have a washer/dryer or a kitchenette but really that's all it's missing for us...

The Intercontinental is also a stop for the Airport Express bus, which will get you to/from Pearson Intl in about 35-50 minutes depending on traffic. All the staff I dealt with at this hotel were very friendly and helpful, across the board from the front desk manager to the bellhop to the maid. I had a drink at the hotel bar one night, which was stylish looking, but not very busy other than your typical traveling businessman types. The room itself was spotless and comfortable with plenty of room for two occupants. The beds were a delight, with fluffy duvets and plenty of pillows. The bathroom had plenty of towels and toiletries. Although the hotel was fairly busy hosting a conference, I never heard a peep from the hallway or neighbors. All in all, I have absolutely no complaints about my stay here. While the location was a bit \"financial district\" rather than \"cool neighborhood\", it was perfect for my needs on this trip and I had no trouble reaching other parts of the city quickly and easily.", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location, Value and Service!\u201d", "Author": "DoctorNurse", "ReviewID": "UR5039675", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed at the The Intercontinental Toronto center and both agree that this is an excellent hotel!

The staff were first rate! the concierge staff (Genevieve and Jackie) were excellent and gave wonderful recommendations for things to do and see in Toronto. Additionally, givn the central location of the hotel, we were able to buy many tickets for attractions (CN Tower tours, City bus tours, Day trips to Niagra Falls) in the hotel, and were able to avoid long lines...they went beyond the call of duty, and even when there was a scheduling snafu with one of our tours, they PERSONNALLY went with us to resolve the issue immediately...Again, FIRST Rate service from the staff... The other key bit about the hotel was its central location...2 blocks away from Union Train/subway (Called the TTC in Toronto) station, Directly on the list of stops for the airport shuttle, 10 minutes from the CN tower, and the city tour buses, and 1 block from an excellent Eastside Marios restaurant (where the appetizers are 1/2 price Sunday-Thursday and an excelent choice for food if you are on a budget!)... We enjoyed our stay immensely, and recommend this hotel highly...I travel often for business, and have stayed in many hotels that are NOT as niceas this, and a few that were better, but for the money, and the purpose of a relaxing, easy to navigate vacation, this hotel was really world class!

I stayed in room 2219 which over looked the Rogers Centre, and Lake Ontario and the CN Tower, pretty much the south end. The view was just to die for each day that I woke up and was able to look out and see some of the main attractions within the city. A couple days while I was there I did see the top opened on the Rogers Centre and I was able to get plenty of pictures of that shot, a couple days was cloudy, so that was nice! The location is great, I think one is less than quarter of a mile walking distance from the CN Tower, go early though, a big tourist spot, maybe 2-3 blocks east of the train station, less than a mile or right at it, for walking down to Queens Quay and the harborfront. The entertainment district is right up the street on John R and one had plenty of restaurants to choose from each night their in town. There are always cab's right in from of the hotel for any places you may need to make a run towards. I see no need for a car if your staying at this hotel, everything is within walking distance or a short a cab ride to the location. One will save money by taking the train or the airplane. The hotel definitely had a grown up adult feel to it, very kind of darkish at night time in the lobby. The pool area was nice, small and quiet atmosphere, right next to the spa area. The pool and hot tub closed early, 8pm each night, that made it tough if one was out most of the day to get to the pool area. Overall, I think the renovations that they said took place on the hotel paid off!
