Our room was tiny and very cramped, the wall adjacent to the bathroom had damp patches, the air con didnt work, the door frame was rotten, the shower head snapped off on first use (they did replace it promptly though), very noisy (didnt bother us though), the breakfast area is a cattle market and you will have to share a table with other guests.

Conclusion, if you're looking for somewhere cheap and don't mind all of the above then go for it, if you're looking for a bit more quality then avoid at all costs.

Then the room as tiny, dirty and smelt of sewage, along with the paper thin walls and you can hear every footstep on the corridor. There was no TV in the room when we arrived, i mentioned it to the receptionist who seemed shocked that there was no tv & that they would arrange to have one installed. That never materialised over the 3 days we were staying there. When we came back to our room on the second day we got not get in as the key would not work, so the receptonist had a go and could not open it either, and then the cleaner who also had a go could also not open the room. After 30 mins of this the receptionist walked off, leaving me and my partner in the corridor, and when i asked him ehere he was going he said to call maintainance to come. I asked him how long this would take, and he said because it was a saturday evening it would be about 1 hour! I then asked him if he had any intention of telling us that it would take this long, and he shrugged his shoulders and carried on walking away! So, we immediately went to reception to wait as there were couches, and literally 2 minutes after getting there the receptionist told us the room was now open! Very suspicious to say the least, as we all tried for 30 mins withour success trying to open the room, and as soon as we leave the corridor it opens! Cheked all our belongings as soon as we got into the room to make sure all in order. The restaurant staff were some of the rudest people I have ever come accross, especially one chap in particular who would shout and agressively speak to guests, demanding them not to sit anywhere until told where to sit, and I saw a number of guests complain. On one of the mornings, we waited to be seated, and the waiter saw us waiting but carried to joke with his colleagues , looking over at us ever now and again. After 5 mins we went to take a table ourselves (the restaurant was empty at the time!) as the waiter would not come over, and as soon as we moved to do so then he moved quickly to us shouting what do we think we are doing, and not to sit until he tells us! Incredible to witness this, almost unbelieveable. And if you were to ask for anything the waiters would just grunt and basically not assist.

We paid almost the same if not more through hotwire. Terrible! Anyway , back to the hotel , we stayed 3 nights in this hotel ,May 2008. It was clean and has good location ( 1 minute from the parallel station which harbors the green and the purple lines ; also next to barcelona universal hotel). La Ramblas is about 10 minutes breezy walk , the mirador colon and the seaside is about 5 minutes walk. If you plan to go to Montjouc , the furnicular departs from parallel station , so that's a plus too. The staffs are friendly and speak fluent english. Basic amenities are provided in the room , but no hairdryer. Air-con was working fine. Breakfasts were okay. There is a 24 hour supermarket, just 5 minute walk from the hotel (ask the staff for the location , they'll be most happy to direct you.). Next door there're restaurants serving pizzas , paellas , and other catalan dishes. Price is not bad , beware though if you ask for mineral water , they might pull the most expensive bottles ,water in glass bottles instead of your regular plastic bottles. It's best to ask what brand is available and how much. The tap water is drinkable , but it's not tasty (near the sea..). I wont reccomend this hotel to light-sleepers because the hotel has a lot of young guests, some nights they can be noisy. All in all , the hotel is good if u're in a budget or if u just need a place to crash in at night. Save money by getting the T-10 transportation card.

The view wasn't great from the balcony (just the back of another building) but I wasn't planning on sitting on it for long with so much else to do. The beds were comfy and the aircon worked well. The shower was brilliant - always plenty of hot water and powerful spray. It was cleaned daily and the towels were changed regularly. The fact that we had to cross the car park to get to it was no problem as the area is only small and well lit at night. The only problems we had, and there are always going to be a few niggles, were that where the hallways were tiled you could hear every flip flop step when your neighbours came and went from their rooms. Also the lifts were a bit temperamental - sometimes they didn't want to open the doors until you'd gone up and down a few times, but we found that if we helped the internal doors to shut properly then they were fine.

We were very dubious after reading reviews on here and after a few initial problems concerning the air conditioning and position of our room, we came home very happy with our stay at the hotel. We arrived late at night and were directed to our room, via the famous car park! I knew this was a bad sign thanks to the previous reviews and sure enough we had a twin room (after booking specifically a double) with literally NO air conditioning. Luckily after taking advice from other reviews we'd packed a fan. Without that I would have slept in the lobbey! It was room 235 on the second floor, so beware! It was roomy and clean but dark, had no view, no breeze and the heat was inbearable. We went straight back to reception but they informed us nothing could be done until other rooms had checked out tomorrow, actually admitting the air conditioning DIDN'T work. I consider this quite bad false advertising and the booking agents should be aware of this. That night was possibly the worst nights sleep I'd ever had, the heat was indescribable! The next day after sightseeing we were shown to a room on the 7th floor, accessed via the lifts inside the lobbey. Despite being compact and very small (we lived out of our suitcases rather than putting our clothes in the damp wardrobe) it was cool and air conditioned which was all we were after. I'd definitely say temperature is more important than the space here. The room had a view looking over the best sites of the city including the Montjuic area and Sagrada Familia. The rest of our stay was extremely comfortable. Breakfast runs from 7-10:30am and gets busy after 9. It is a great Continental variety including croissants, bread rolls, toast, cereal, coffees, tea, orange+pineapple juice, fruit, selection of hams and cheese. One day we knew we wouldn't have chance to have lunch/dinner out so we made sandwiches from the breakfast. It's paid for afterall!! The staff we very helpful (apart from a couple) and spoke the best English we'd encountered in the entire trip. Our room was cleaned every day and towels changed too. One day we did not leave the room till 5 and the maids rang our room phone, insisting on cleaning it so late in the day. The rooms (also against advertisement) do not have security boxes. The first one we were unable to open and the second room didn't even have one. However, the reception staff were more than happy to let us use their safe and we accessed that every day. The location of the hotel is very good. A 2 minute walk from the metro station, 15 minutes to the Christopher Columbus monument (the bottom of the Ramblas - also where you can catch the sightseeing bus tour), 20 minutes to Port Vell and 30 minute walk to Barceloneta beach. BARCELONA TIPS... - Take the orange bus tour. It is less advertised but stops at the same ones as the \"official\" blue bus tour and there are always seats available on the open top. - Take care of your cash. I saw a guy steal a womans bag from next to her on a bench at Place d'Catalunya. She luckily saw it out of the corner of her eye but it really made me think. Later in the holiday I had 75 euros (\u00a350) pickpocketed, either on the metro or the beach. They'd taken my purse out of my bag, taken the cash then put the purse bacK! Unbelievable. - Ask about the prices of drinks at bars/restaurants. They're usually not listed on the menu and can be ridiculous, like 6 euros for a small bottle of coke. - I'd recommend the pastry shop down the road from the hotel which has large cold bottles of water for 1.05 euros. - Make a trip to the Japanese restaurant a few paces to the right out of the doors of the hotel. Cheap and well worth it for the atmosphere and experience. - The magic fountains at the National Palace run thursday-sunday from 8:30-10:30. - If you're going to the Hard Rock Cafe be prepared for a wait and, if possible, say you're open to smoking and non-smoking areas to cut that wait down. If you arrive before 8 the wait for a table much less I think. - Make a trip to Port Olympic (avaible via the metro with one change from the hotel) for a meal. Great seafood and service. That's about it. The hotel was overall good for a 2*. I'm not sure whether I'd be eager to stay there again, we would possible save up to afford a better place. However, it provided exactly what we needed, a comfortable place to wash and lay our heads after a tiring day of walking in the sun.

I complained multiple times about the air conditioning and initially I got a shrug, then I was told someone would be trying to fix it, then I was told that the a/c on our part of the hotel was simply not working - no more explanations to be had. Finally, I had to ASK for a fan - no one ever thought to offer us one. With the fan in our already tiny room, there was no space at all - barely a path to the bathroom. The room condition was dingy, bathroom was dirty and the shower was moldy. My husband and I enjoyed the night train down to Seville more than this hotel. I would not recommend this hotel, but if you chose it, I would contact the hotel directly and request to stay in the \"new\" part of the hotel. I think that would be a completely different experience.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkhamsted, England", "Title": "\u201cI'm sure the main hotel is fine... but a word of warning\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5441935", "Content": "Based on the reviews on this and other sites we stayed at the Auto Hogar on a hot July weekend. First impressions were fine and we made our way to our rooms which were, surprisingly, accessed through the garage at the rear of the hotel. Here there is a second and much more run down hotel. My word of warning is to avoid this part of the Auto Hogar like the plague! With two airless rooms without working air conditioning we asked to change rooms. WIth no more space available the management suggested we sleep with our doors open! Not satisfied with this option, we were eventually re-housed in the Hotel Nuevo Triunfo round the corner (+93 442 59 33). That was cool, quiet, friendly and perfect. Worth a call but haggle on the price - our rate was 25% below the advertised tarrif. Sadly this was an attempt to check out the Auto Hogar ahead of a larger trip coming later in the year. On this experience we won't be staying there and my advice is that if you are sent to your room through the garage you either get another room or check out immediately!", "Date": "July 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cSimple but nice!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5394778", "Content": "Just returned home from a week in Barcelona where we stayed at the Auto Hogar Hotel. It's a simple but nice and clean hotel with VERY friendly and helpful staff that spoke English well. The breakfast was OK, nothing special, but satisfying. Ask for a room facing the yard though!

(apart from eating our snacks!!) The location was poor, if you want to visit la ramblas everyday then your best satying exactly on the strip, otherwise your feet will be cut to shreds! la ramblas an barcelona itself is excellent and we had a great time however i recommend staying in a better hotel!", "Date": "June 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201csurprised!\u201d", "Author": "missmarples", "ReviewID": "UR5333325", "Content": "Having booked this hotel then reading reviews after I thought I might have to book into another hotel on arrival. Well my sister and I were delighted, our room on the 7th floor was spotless as was the bathroom, the bedding and towels were changed on a regular basis. The breakfasts were more than adequate, altho sometimes a bit of a scrum! The hotel was very central, a nice and easy walk to the port area and only seconds from the metro! which we used every day. The staff were very friendly and on our last day we did not fly until 21.45 so the luggage room was most helpfull. The only down side was the street noise and building works but hey it`s a busy busy city and the Hotel is on a busy main street, and by the time we got back to the hotel we were so exhausted with the days sightseeing that we more or less fell asleep fully clothed!
