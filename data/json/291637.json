Overall, the experience was overwhelmingly positive. The roof terrace offered excellent views across London on Bonfire Weekend with all the fireworks. It is set right in the heart of the Portobello Market, surrounded by pretty shops, market stalls and musicians. My review is biased since I stayed in the Flat, which is spacious and includes the roof terrace and pretty bathroom (though needed a DVD player). My parents, in the Bridal Suite, also had a gorgeous room with a fireplace and lovely period furniture. The other rooms are small and you need to be sure that you are fully happy with a 'wet room' instead of bathroom with separate facilities. The bathroom and plumbing aspects of the hotel are not up to modern standards, even of more seemingly basic accommodation like a Travelodge but for the location (very close to the market and our wedding reception venue) as well as the period charms of the place, it was perfect. The staff who dealt with us, Aiste and Rob, were excellent. Rob arranged cabs for us to the wedding and served us in the restaurant the night before with gusto and spirit. The restaurant was excellent. Our whole party said they would return to the Gold again. It is full of character and charm. Know what to expect before you arrive by asking ahead and then hopefully the positives will outweigh the negatives.

The rooms at the PG are up at least 2 flights of stairs, so not suitable for the infirm. This is the smallest of the PG's rooms and has a slightly unusual bed arrangement: 1 single raised bed across the room, with 1 single bed (lower) lengthwise. This is a tiny room (approx 6'6\" x 9'6\"), so do not consider it if you feel claustrophobic. However it has everything you need: ensuite toilet and shower (more about that later), a curtained closet alcove, kettle, tv (small and high up), free wi-fi access and comfy beds. Room rate (\u00c2\u00a370 per night) includes a more than adequate continental breakfast (juice, fruit, coffee, cereal and toast). The negatives: slight draught from the window, and the traditionally english anaemic shower. The ensuite toilet/ shower room is an interesting arrangement: when you enter the narrow room, a small basin is on the right, a shower pan is immediately inside the door and the shower is above the basin. Then there is a step up to the toilet. If you have ever stayed in an english home, you will know that often the hot water pressure is considerably less than the cold water pressure: this makes balancing hot and cold output for a shower an art form, and this shower is no exception. Your choices are lots of cold water, or considerably less warm water: showering can take a while. How you respond to this \"inn with rooms\" depends on how you feel about the idiosyncratic: this is NOT a full service hotel. Personally, both my daugher and I loved the fact that it was above a neighbourhood pub, and the smallness of the room reminded us of being on a boat.

This is not a hotel -- it's a pub that also happens to have rental rooms upstairs. So if you want a \"standard\" hotel with a front desk, cookie cutter rooms, dedicated hotel staff, etc. -- this isn't that kind of place. But if you like unique places with local color, this could be a good place for you. One the pro side, this is an \"only in Britain\" type of place. It's on Portobello road (home of the famous Portobello antiques street market) in the Notting Hill neighborhood. The neighborhood is *fantastic* -- lots of great little shops, wonderful restaurants / bars / pubs, newstands, etc. There aren't any hotels nearby, so you're surrounded by locals, not by other tourists. It was great to be able to come back to the room in the evening, freshen up, and then head out knowing you had dozens of great places to eat and hang out within a few minutes walk. The Gold is right in between two Tube stops -- it's a 10-12 min walk to either station -- and of the two stops, the Notting Hill Tube stop connects to both the Circle and Central lines, so it's super convenient to get into the core of London and the main tourist sites. You're also only a couple of Tube stops (or a 5 pound cab ride) from Paddington train station, which is convenient if you're arriving in Heathrow and you take the Heathrow express into Paddington. The pub itself serves food too, if you want to eat in house. I ate there twice -- first time the food was mediocre, the 2nd time the food was great, so I think it depends on what you order (they have huge menu). It was also nice to be able to get a drink at the bar and take it upstairs to your room, if you didn't want to hang out in the smoky / noisy pub. Note that the Gold doesn't serve breakfast, but there are multiple breakfast places (both sitdown and takeout) in the neighborhood. The rooms are very small, but they weren't any smaller than the budget hotel rooms I've stayed in elsewhere in Europe, Britain or New York City. Rooms were clean and had a TV (with cable -- movies etc), phone, insuite bathroom, hairdryer. The wireless internet in the room is very convenient if you bring your computer -- we used it all the time, the signal was strong and reliable. You can also use their two computers down in the pub for free -- but in the evening when the pub is crowded, it's kind of a hassle. Still, it's better than having to go out and find a cyber cafe every time you want to check your email. You *cannot* beat their price for a London bathroom-insuite room -- we paid 65 pounds for a double. I spent literally 5+ hours online looking for budget hotel rooms in London, and the next cheapest rooms I found were 10-15 pounds more expensive for a typical budget room in cheap hotels in Earls Court or near Victoria Station (ie, the budget tourist ghettos). There are two big tradeoffs. One is that the rooms don't have air conditioning, so if the weather's warm, the rooms can get darn hot even with the window wide open. I did see a tabletop fan on my last day there (too late for my stay, but having a fan could make a big difference). The other tradeoff is the noise. You are right above a pub, and esp in the warmer months, people are hanging around outside drinking and talking. The noise level varies, but you can get some noise until around midnight - 1 am, so if you're sensitive to sound, earplugs might help. The noise kind of bothered me some nights, but not on others, so YMMV. I would definitely stay here again, but probably not in the summer months, because of 1) the heat (rooms could get really hot and stuffy), and 2) the noise from summer outdoor revelers. In the cooler months, this is probably now my top choice of where to stay in London.
