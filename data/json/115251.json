The parking is included in the hotel bill, which as those that travel to the N.O. know that normally you have to pay separately cash, so the parking was great. However, i did notice that the parking garage that hampton uses is also self-parking for $10 versus hampton's $30 valet charge. But hey, for the service and convenience I got, I'll pay the extra $20. The room was a very nice size, the beds were amazingingly comfortable and I'm a shower/water pressure fan and that was GLORIUS! The bathroom was roomy, the view was awesome! I had a great time!! AND they had my bigelow tea, oh yes the breakfast available for the guests was nice!

Upon check out, the front desk clerk/manager, did not even ask why we were leaving before our scheduled date. She probably knew how bad those rooms were. Perhaps a higher floor, street facing room may be ok, and those may be bigger rooms as well. Location is just next to the French Quarter and Canal street, without being directly where the noise is.

A two-block walk to the French Quarter, yet far enough away to avoid the noise, especially at night. The old green St. Charles Avenue streetcar stops less than half a block away, making for an easy trip to the Garden District or the (not-to-be-missed) National World War II Museum. Two blocks from the hotel is Canal Street, where the red Canal Street streetcar can take you to the waterfront (Aquarium, Imax theater, Harrah's casino, the waterfront mall and cruise ship terminal), and a transfer to the Riverfront Streetcar gets you to the convention center or the French Market. As for the hotel itself, we had a corner room that was huge and a bath to match (the latter could use a renovation, but that's the only minor negative thing I can think of). We particularly appreciated the quiet, efficient heating/AC, another thing that's important for a good night's sleep but is often lacking, especially in older buildings. Add a flat-screen TV with lots of cable channels, terrific bedding, and solid wi-fi, and it's hard to think of anything that is missing. The place was simply comfortable -- and comforting -- after returning from a hard day of sightseeing. We spent five nights and actually looked forward to returning to the room every day. As with all Hamptons, a free buffet breakfast is included and this was one of the better ones we've encountered. In addition to the usual assortment of cold items, there were two hot dishes each day. One was usually either scrambled eggs, a cheese omelet, or french toast sticks, and the other was sausage, turkey sausage or ham, though one morning it was biscuits and gravy. The usual fruit cocktail was supplemented with fresh bananas and apples, which we particularly welcomed. The service in the breakfast room was outstanding: nothing was left unreplenished for long and the trash cans were emptied promptly.

The hotel is on Carondelet Street, which two blocks later across Canal Street, turns in Bourbon Street (and a whole other world from where you are staying). The lobby is somewhat strange as the hotel is connected to a mall with a clothing store located in the lobby. The front desk is actually in the back past the elevators. We arrived a little after 1 PM with a 3 PM check-in. Our room wasn't ready, no big deal, they stored our bags and we went out. I left my cell number and they said they'd call when the room was ready. Well, 3 PM came and went and we still got no call. We eventually showed back up about 3:15 and after what seemed to be some confusion behind the desk, we were given our room keys. As a Hilton Honors Silver member, usually I would get a snack bag or water, but here my status was never mentioned (not sure why not, I await my survey from Hilton). Anyway, our room was on the 4th floor, which also is the floor that breakfast is served on, so that was convenient. The room itself was clean, with a nice HD flatscreen. The bathroom was kinda cramped, with a shower stall that had almost painfully strong water pressure (never thought I'd say too much pressure). Our view was of a giant brick wall, not a big deal to me, just a warning to anyone expecting something different. The room had a fridge and microwave, which came in handy. The breakfast changed daily from scrambled eggs, omlettes, sausage, etc. Cereal, fruit, bagels and waffles were available daily. The coffee bar is always open, as with all Hampton's, so that is a plus.

We had family who had booked rooms here, too, and would arriving at various times. We arrived at the hotel and noticed the entrance and seating areas are tidy and clean. Later, since our group's rooms were on various floors and we went to each in order to talk to, pick up, or drop off people, we noticed that the hallways and area in front of the elevators were clean and well-kept. We were quickly checked in, told about the necessity of the keycard in order to access the guest floors, and told the time and location for the complementary hot breakfast. I'd noticed that one of the ladies at the desk had helped a group of people who checked just before us by providing a map and marking places on it that corresponded to the group's interests for dining and attractions. I asked the lady if she would do that for us and she kindly obliged. This was our first time to N.O. and that map was a tremendous help in finding the restaurants and hotel again. The bell man was going to store our luggage until our room was ready and we returned from lunch, but the room became available before we left the lobby so hubby and I took the luggage up to the room. Cool! Since the rest of our party wasn't in yet, hubby and I went off to eat lunch and see what was around. There is a street car that runs in front of the hotel, a short distance is Canal Street where more street cars make stops, CVS and Walgreens drug stores can be seen from the corner of Carondelet and Canal Streets, an Arby's fast food is close by (we stopped here for iced tea, which was delicious and refreshing as the day was a real scorcher), some other shops, close to good dining (we ate lunch at Deanie's Seafood - excellent), just across Canal Street Carondelet becomes Bourbon Street, and very close to the French Quarter attractions. The room was well-appointed. It had a brand new flat screen television, a lap writing desk, a desk, plenty of lamps, a mini refrigerator, safe, (if I remember correctly) a microwave, a bench at the end of the bed, and an chair. There was a window in the room with the view being a white brick wall. Oh well, we didn't mind. We were happy that we had a window at all (while researching hotels for this stay, we had read that some hotels have some rooms that don't have windows) and that the white of the wall reflected the outdoor light so the room seemed brighter. The sitting and sleeping were tidy and clean. The bathroom could have used a little bit more cleaning of the commode, but I took care of it with my standard traveling supplies (disinfecting wipes & spray). Ugh! It seems most hotel, cruise ship, and public bathrooms I get need extra cleaning these days :( . I asked my traveling companions about their bathroom cleanliness and they said their 3 bathrooms were totally clean. Yep, it's just me (rolling eyes). One member of our group (my aunt) had a problem with a passport that got left behind back home. The ladies at the front desk were instrumental in coming up with a solution because the big package services (Fed Ex and UPS) weren't open on Sunday. They literally saved the woman's vacation because without the passport, there was no way she could have gotten on the cruise ship the next day. Between the ladies at the desk, relatives in the hotel, the relative of one of our group back where the passport was left, a cargo service, the planes/airports, a taxi, my husband and the aunt, and maybe others I'm not aware of, the passport was able to be moved from point A to point B between late Saturday afternoon to early Sunday afternoon! Whew! Outstanding! \"THANK YOU!\" to all involved!!! Saturday night we slept very well. The bed and bedding were extremely comfortable, some of the best we've ever slept on/with. Cool! Sunday morning we went to the room with the hot breakfast buffet. The room was clean, large, had ample seating, and had a pleasant atmosphere. There was a good variety of hot and cold food and beverages (which were very good). The attendant kept things clean and replenished. Hubby, I, my brother, and his wife agreed it was the best complementary breakfast we've ever had in a hotel. Well done! Check out was quick and easy. From when we checked in, we knew the hotel had luggage storage service, so we asked to have our bags stored so we could explore the French Quarter and pick up some last minute items before heading to the cruise ship terminal. The ladies at the desk were still friendly and helpful, as was the bell man who tagged and stored our bags. Had no trouble retrieving Not exactly sure how it came about, but we ended up with a couple of vans to carry us all to the port. For a one night stay, a lot sure took place. Thanks to the great staff and very nice hotel property, we had a pleasant stay at the Hampton Inn Downtown/French Quarter.

The bathroom needs some remodeling though.The refrigerator and microwave came in handy for our leftovers. The free breakfast was really good. I had a waffle and fruit, which was more than enough.

Also my little cousin brought her laptop and the free internet worked really well when I used her computer Valet Parking: I had to circle the block about three times because there wasn't any place to park in front of the hotel.Unfortunately, valet services were not moving the cars out fast enough. Valet parking was a big negative but when I saw my room, I forgot all about it. Since I'm really big on customer service, I will not stay at this Hampton Inn or any other Hampton Inn.

First, the pros. The hotel has valet service, bellman, comfy beds, micro/fridge, extensive breakfast, and cookies! The location is great for walking to the French Quarter and the staff were all very nice. We had a king study, which are corner rooms, and they are MUCH larger than the kind standards. Now, the cons. We decided to stay over an extra night, but our same room we had been in all week was unavailable that night due to a wedding group arriving for the weekend. We had to load up and move to a different floor, to a king standard, which was tiny and faced a white brick wall. That was not the hotel's fault though, since we waited until the last day to decide to stay over. We paid $109/night all week for the large room, but were told the rate in the smaller room would be $199/night. However, I asked for the Triple AAA discount and they discounted our room to $139. In the 1st room, on our TV remote, if we used the channel up/down buttons, the channels would not go past like channel 23 or 24. After channel 24, it would go back to channel 2. If you wanted to go past 24, you had to manually punch in each channel number. We tried reprogramming the TV channels with no luck. We didn't report it to the hotel, so no big deal. In the 2nd (smaller) room, you had to jiggle the toilet handle to stop the water from running after flushing. Also, in the king standard, there was no tub, just a stand up shower, so we had to bathe our baby in the shower and he screamed the whole time. Also, the floors and the bottom of the tub and showers looked dirty/dingy. The bathrooms need updating. The only complaint I have with breakfast is that they really need to leave the can of cooking spray next to the waffle iron for guests to spray the iron before making each waffle. The breakfast hosts would come out once in a while and spray the iron but then would take the spray back to the kitchen. The 1st waffle made after the spray was fine, but after that, anytime someone would make a waffle, it would stick and they would have to peel it off the iron (myself included).

I'm sorry I forgot one of the clerk's name, but Brandon was the other one. Loved them both!! I got to my room and it was the room that a previous reviewer had talked about. The windows were facing a brick wall so therefore there was no natural light coming in the room. I had to turn on every lamp to light up the room. I didn't like it, but I endured it. The room itself was spacious, clean, and it had a mini fridge, and a microwave which came in handy when bringing food and drinks back to the room. The bed was very comfortable! The bathroom was also spacious, but is in need of a major renovation. The next morning I went to breakfast and was satisfied with the items offered. I also used the fitness facility and I was quite pleased with the equipment that was available for use. They have one computer and it is located in the breakfast room. I used it twice and I only had to wait to use it once and I waited maybe 10 min. Anytime I needed information or directions, the front desk staff always gave me everything I needed. The only problem I had with housekeeping is that on the 3rd morning I was there, I had to wait until around 5:30ish to get my room serviced. I actually only needed fresh towels. I'm not the type that has to have my room vaccumed or the bed made everyday, but I do require fresh towels so that was a bummer. The toilet handle broke, so I called the front desk and not long after I hung up the phone, the maintainence man was there to fix the handle. That was great! The hotel is just a couple of blocks from the French Quarter. Carondelet Street actually turns into Bourbon St. when you cross Canal St. I think the location is perfect, because you are in walking distance to the French Quarter, Canal Street, the Riverwalk and Harrah's Casino, but yet far enough away from the hustle and bustle and noise. The street car stop is just steps away from the entrance of the hotel so that's a plus! Upon checking out I noticed that I was charged for 2 days of valet parking.

Carondelet Street turns into Bourbon Street about three city blocks down from the hotel once you cross over Canal Street.

On both stays, I found the staff to be super friendly and very accommodating. Perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of my Hilton Honors status, but on both visits, I was given a very large suite with nice views in either direction. On each stay, my room was huge; high ceilings, enormous windows and lot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of charm (a nice break from the cookie cutter chain hotel look). In both incidences I found my room to be very clean; beds and pillows extremely comfortable. As I stayed for an entire week both times, it was nice to have a refrigerator and microwave in the room. The hotel provides little perks that makes the stay a little more enjoyable; news paper waiting outside the door every morning, freshly baked cookies at the reception desk each evening and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complementary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast every morning. Mind you, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s typical Hampton Inn fare, but still good enough to start the day.

The front desk staff was great. They provided directions when I needed them, my wakeup call was always right on time and when I needed a taxi they had one ready and waiting for me.

Now the problems.....The owners should really invest some money in this property and renovate the rooms. I'm almost suprised that Hilton allows them to carry the Hampton name. The rooms are big with very tall ceilings, but this also makes the room feel empty and cold. The whole property has a certain smell to it, almost as if you were visiting a nursing home. I think my room has the original carpeting and couch from the 1870s and I almost felt like wearing sandals in my shower because the tub basin just looked gross.

I picked this hotel based on location, price and free breakfast. So here are some of the ups and downs of my stay: Ups: Hotel info said the trolley stop was in front of the hotel. Well this is partitially true if you walk out through the back doors facing St. Charles Ave. You can catch the St. Charles trolley here but I recommend that you walk out the front and walk the 1 block to Canal and catch the St Charles Ave trolley here as it is the beginning point and is the best place to get on and be able to get a seat. The Canal St trolley line is directly across the street from the St Charles trolley stop so this was good. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. No problems with friendly staff at desk. We got a corner room that didn't have the best view but that was ok given the amount of floor space we gained. Plenty of room and nice sized beds. The hotel also offers a free breakfast and it is not your usual danish buffett. There was a make-your-own waffle station, eggs, biscuits, assortment of breakfast breads and cereals, fresh fruit, coffee and juice. This was a true bargin for those traveling with kids. Tiffany kept it stocked and tidy. They do have an afternoon feeding but we never went to it. But it looked like more than chips and salsa were served. Another plus is the food court located in the building. The Carondelete St side had the hotel and the St Charles Ave side was a business complex. On the 2nd floor is a food court offering many different types of cuisine. This is great for grabbing a quick lunch if you're not out and about and just want to stay in. Now for the downs: There are only 2 downs for me. The first one was the mattress on the bed. Talk about firm! It was stiff as a board. I know some people like this but it was truly uncomfortable. The other down, and the major one, was the bathroom. All I can say is yuck! Compared to other Hamptons I've stayed in, this bathroom looked like it belonged in a motel and not a hotel. It was small and very yucky looking. There were stains on the floor that I don't think would come out. The tub had cracks all around it and the water pressure sucked. I think they cleaned it but it was very hard to tell. This was a major issue for me but one I had to let slide for the week.

However, if your business will keep you more on the west side of the French Quarter or north of the convention center, this hotel would work very well.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved our Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Traveling_Lady_2004", "ReviewID": "UR76653228", "Content": "From the time we were greeted by the front desk, we were made to feel like a valued guest.

The breakfast area is located in the 4th floor dining area as well a computer and large screen TV. The hotel also has free wi fi throughout the hotel. Breakfast is the typical Hampton Buffet Breakfast. There is a gym on this floor also but I did not use it. Parking is costly, we did not rent a car. We took a cab which is $33.00 flat rate to the city(plus tip). Cabs are plentiful in front of the hotel if you need a ride to the airport. I think there is a Shuttle for $20.00 per person from airport, since there were two of us, it was cheaper to use a cab. Hotel is located 2 blocks from Canal Street..cross it and you are at the beginning of the French Quarter. There is a CVS on the corner to pick up odds and ends.

The location was easily found by our GPS and the hotel only a few minutes walk straight down the street from all the action of Bourbon St. But being across Canal we did not experience the crazy noise of Bourbon. (Turn right out of the hotel lobby and you are on the heart of Bourbon in 2/10 of a mile) The only parking associated with the hotel is valet service, but is about the same price as all other hotels in the area. The valet was always very prompt and courteous. (Though I found it odd the valet was not tall and always left our seat way too close for me to get into the car!) Check in was rather disorganized. The clerk could not find our name and then they had reassigned us from the pre selected room to a very poorly laid out room where the elevator lobby looked right into the room. After some persistence and argument with the clerk, and threatening to invoke the 100% Guarantee, we finally got a hold of the manager who moved us to a smaller but much better located room. Still not the service I expect as a HHonors Diamond member. There is a small but nicely decorated, inviting lobby with a small front desk. They have a large nicely appointed common area. (Breakfast area) on the 4th floor that is only accessible to guests but is open 24/7 with coffee, tea, and fruit. Fresh cookies were available each evening at the front desk. The hotel has a non-typical layout as it is a historic building. Each room is somewhat different it seems. The hotel does not have a pool, but that is not a problem given we were not expecting one. They have a small gym, but we did not have the opportunity to check it out. They do not really have a business center but have one computer and printer in the breakfast area. The hotel has free internet access for guests in the common areas and rooms. We found it to be of acceptable speed. The rooms are typically decorated, and comfortable but a in need of updating, but were clean. The beds are acceptable. They have large but old style CRT TV's with sufficient channels. The climate control works and you can leave the blower motor on for white noise while the climate control is still functioning. The room had no discernable noise from nearby rooms. Even though our second room was on the 5th floor, the second set of windows on the room kept out the majority of the noise, but as with any city hotel, you could hear some traffic. I imagine higher rooms have less noise. Room included a work desk (though you could not see the TV from the desk), microwave, fridge, and chair / ottoman. Some rooms have fold out couches. Bathrooms are well equipped with plenty of storage and counter space, but rather dated. Some rooms have a tub / shower combo and others have a shower only. The blow dryer in the room was a bit of a pain since you had to hold a spring loaded handle to keep it in the on position. The first blow dryer broke, but maintenance quickly brought up a temporary one and then replaced the built in one that day. Of course this location lends itself to quick and easy access to the street cars, Bourbon Street, the French Quarter, and even Jackson Square. The night time walk from the heart of Bourbon to the hotel was well populated and felt safe. (Of course always watch out in any big city!) The breakfast area appeared to have plenty of seating in the morning, but we never had the breakfast....decided to eat out one day and slept in too late the other. The day we looked in they had typical Hampton breakfast, scrambled eggs with cheese, biscuits, sausage gravy, waffle maker, pastries, cereal, juices, coffee, etc. They did not have the \"on the run bags: with an apple, muffin, cereal bar, water, and mints as it was the weekend, but I am sure they have those on the weekdays. The staff was cordial, though the one night desk clerk must have been new as he did not seem to have his act totally together. The real highlight of the staff was the bellman Bryan. He was absolutely great. Provided great late night dinner, breakfast, and lunch recommendations whenever we asked. He really seemed to enjoy his job and as lifetime local really liked to share tips about his hometown.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Union, MO", "Title": "\u201cFabulous experience.\u201d", "Author": "ShelbyLynn75", "ReviewID": "UR66914247", "Content": "We stayed at the Hampton Inn on Carondelet Street over Memorial Day weekend. We drove from St. Louis with our 8-year-old. The hotel was easy to find. Check in was a breeze taking only a few minutes. The valet helped us unload our bags and loaded them onto a cart for us, something that wasn't even done for us at several Hyatt hotels we've stayed at in various cities. Our room was very large. Two comfortable double beds, a couch, coffee table, desk with chair, a huge armoire housing the flat panel tv, in-room safe (which is great for laptops and other electronics), coffee maker, microwave, and mini-fridge. There were three enormous windows on one wall. The view was of another building, but that's what you get sometimes in a city. We were directly across from the ice machine, but we never heard it. The bathroom was huge. All three of us were in there at once brushing our teeth, and we could have easily fit a few more people in there. The shower head is fabulous! Great water pressure. We took the longest showers there. The climate control in the room was fantastic. We were able to turn the temp down low so we were greeted to a nice cool room after walking the French Quarter in 95 degree heat and humidity. The location is great. It is located a block and a half from Canal Street and Bourbon Street. We walked every where. The street car runs right in front of the building on Carondelet Street. We used our car once because we went to Metairie for a concert. We called down for our car 15 minutes before we planned to leave. We walked down 10 minutes later, and our car was waiting for us. When we returned late that night there was a valet available to park our car. The hotel is secure as you must use your room key card to open the front doors during late hours. The key card is also necessary to take the elevator to floors 4-14. The complimentary breakfast was fantastic for the $99/night we paid for the room. Fresh fruit, yogurt, cold cereal assortment, pastries, bagels, biscuits, sausage gravy, omelets, cajun potatoes, an array of juices, and coffee. The food was constantly replenished, none of this \"get there before it's gone\" business. The dining area is very large and accomodated the large number of guests eating quite easily. The housekeeping staff were very nice and courteous. They knocked each morning and asked if we needed our room serviced. Any staff we encountered in the hotel were extremely nice. The late night front desk clerk offered us several suggestions regarding where we could get a late night bite to eat. (Brother's chicken is practically next door. Great late night treat.) Upon departure, the valet retrieved our car quickly even though there several guests pulling in for check-in. He helped us load up our car. I would also like to point out that we booked our room through Expedia.com and were treated with respect and courtesy. I know sometimes using booking sites such as that have been the basis for some people not getting treated the same as other customers, but the Hampton Inn on Carondelet Street was not one of those establishments.

It was almost like a suite. We stayed in room 709 I beleive. The bed was really comfy and there was a mini fridge which was nice for our beer & such. The bathrooms were pretty clean but old tile lined the floor and a tad bit of mildew in the shower but not nasty. Several times our room keys quit working & the staff was always nice in getting us new ones. It was never loud in the hotel either. It is only 2 blocks to Canal and Bourbon Street. There is a corner store (24 hours I think)across the street from the hotel so we got drinks and snacks everyday. Keep in mind the hotel does not have room service or a restaurant....but theres always something open because New Orleans never sleeps.

The breakfast wasn't that great at all (I do want to say at this point though, that both women working as hostesses were wonderful, friendly and helpful and the food review is absolutely NO reflection on them). There was one hot dish at each breakfast. Scrambled eggs mixed with cheese on day 1 (weird consistency). Eggs with bacon and cheese on an English muffin the next day (I don't eat bacon, and I don't like pre-made sandwiches). Day 3 featured small waffle squares - pretty much tasteless. The bananas were usually green. The bagels were like I'd get at a local grocery store, same with the pastries. I really like the breakfast at Country Inn and Suites, it is always really good. I would have expected a little more from this hotel. It was passable, and that was it. I had read reviews before I got there in which some people didn't care for the breakfast, and I figured they were picky or used to really nice restaurants all of the time, but I have to agree with them. I do want to make a note that they advertise that they have \"microfridges\". I just thought they meant small fridges, but apparently it's a brand of some sort, which is a small refrigerator and a small microwave. So that was nice. The small couch was not comfortable at all. We did miss having a pool. I wished I would have booked at another place for that reason alone. If you're not interested in the breakfast or a pool, the rooms were nice and big and clean, so you would probably be happy here.

I travel for business and stay in Hampton Inns fairly often, so my first thought was \"We can't stay in this dump, let's see if we can find a Hampton Inn.\" Sure enough, there was a Hampton Inn right around the corner. We walked into the lobby and the staff was extremely friendly, not just at check-in, but throughout our entire stay. The room was very clean, spacious, and updated. The mattress and pillows were very comfortable. The best part was the breakfast! We paid a little more, about $10 more a night, to stay at the Hampton Inn than at the prior hotel we originally had checked into, however, with the cost of breakfast in the city, the breakfast at the Hampton Inn easily paid for the difference, plus it was 100 times nicer!

We were afraid we'd be late to an event because we planned for a cab ride and ended up having to walk to the restaurant. It wasn't a huge deal and probably only took a few more minutes and a little more wear and tear on the feet, but maybe a little more stress than we wanted. As far as the hotel itself, it has a few things to recommend it over the hotels in the district. The first being it's not in the district. It's quieter, there's no barf on the sidewalk and there's no one yelling to show us your [-]. And being on the 9th floor as we were, we had zero issues with road noise. All of my friends had issues with outside noises while they tried to sleep. We got a great recommendation for a restaurant from the guy at the front desk (Acme Oyster House... it's a must), and our wake up call came as requested. Going against it, the public areas smelled oddly of pee. I think maybe the carpets in the rooms have been replaced but not in the hallways. We also had a fabulous view of a brick wall. On the other hand, we spent about 4 seconds a day in the room, so the view wasn't really an issue for us. If you're in New Orleans for the parades (the big parades with the floats), this is a block off the route, so not bad.

Also be aware that the price of your room and then some will be held immediately on your card, the day you check in. So take that out of your trip budget. The TV was kinda fuzzy but we weren't in the room much. Overall it was a great stay at a bargain.

I am happy to report that ALL of my fears were unfounded. This was my first trip to New Orleans and I fell in love with the city. LOCATION: The French Quarter is only two short blocks away. Yes, many of the buildings are boarded up, but even when walking home late at night, we felt safe. Once you cross Canal, you only have one short block that is quiet and then you are within view of the Hampton and the neighboring Holiday Inn. This isn't to say that you shouldn't be aware, but don't worry about taking a cab the two short blocks. The hotel doesn't have many shops and those that do close early, but there is a Walgreens on the corner of Carondelet (sp?) and Canal for drinks, toiletries, snacks, etc. HOTEL: We had a room on the 5th floor ... which was a combination of smoking and non-smoking rooms. While this seemed odd to us, other than a bit of smell in the hallway, our non-smoking room was fine. The room size is average, large compared to New York for example. The closet was decent sized and we loved the fridge and microwave. The linens were great. NOTE: My one complaint was the housekeeping staff. Several times we came back to the room around 3pm and the room was still not cleaned. Our coffee pot was only cleaned once and our linens never changed, even when requested. BREAKFAST: The breakfast was great! Someone else commented there were no hot items. We had at least one hot item every morning and a nice assortment of breads, cereals, yogurt, etc. This coupled with the free wireless access in our room was a great perk! The dining room itself was pleasant as well. OTHER: We took a cab to the airport on our way back ... be sure to allow yourself at least 5 minutes to catch a cab. They seem to be infrequent. I am also going to write review for some restaurants (Muriels, Tujagues, Cafe Benet, Johnny's PoBoy), and a few touristy activities (Cajun Style Swamp Tours). Overall ... while there is still a lot of rebuilding left to do, I can truly say I left my heart in New Orleans. Everyone I encountered there was friendly and still so proud of their city.

Housekeeping missed cleaning the room twice, and when the came back, they just folded the sheets and took the dirty towels... not even replacing them. If we needed everything, we had to wait an hour for it (that is if they ever brought it up). Another dissapointing aspect was the free breakfast. Don't expect to see eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, etc., everything is cold, only cereal, juice, coffee, and stale begals. The only really good things that came from the stay was its location, free dry-cleaning, and discounted rate (I had before we checked-in). To sum it up: bad service, rude and lazy housekeeping, room size differences, and lack of features (no in-room movies either).

Although the website states it is one block from the French Quarter, is a bit closer to three. The area where the hotel resides contains other hotels and office buildings, unfortunately there are no real restaurants or shops for one-two blocks from the property. There are some retail/clothing stores in the lobby (if you walk past it), however they were always closed by the time I got back to the hotel in the evening. You will find that a lot of the shops and restaurants in New Orleans and surrounding areas have limited hours, especially when you go outside the French Quarter. Even the Shops at Canal closes at 6pm, although the movie theatre and a few eateries were open past then. There is such a shortage of employees due to not having anywhere to live in so many areas of the city. I was able to tour the area with a local employee from my office and it is heartbreaking. If you stay in the FQ, you really won't see much of this, however if you head over to the 9th Ward, Lakefront, East New Orleans, etc., etc. you have to wonder how the city will recover. Is very upsetting. The area was just so-so. It is close enough to the French Quarter, however was close to Canal and Bourbon and really wasn't close enough to what I wanted to see (Jackson Square, Cafe de Monde). If I were to stay again, I would choose either a much newer hotel, or stay more in the nicer part of the French Quarter. As nightfall came, I really didn't feel safe walking back from the French Quarter alone, as a female. The streets are pretty much empty and dark. Luckily I found a couple walking their dog that I talked to on the way and was fine. I did see some National Guard, but not really where I was. I did see a lot of NOPD. My room was in the corner, a King Study and the first thing that hit me was the smell. It was a musty smell, could have been because the furniture was older, could be the zillions drapes on the windows, could have been the window panes, it was just not a fresh smelling room and really just smelled old. The bathroom was decently clean, however the grout really needed a touch-up. Water pressure was so-so. Was decently clean. There is a cabinet in the room that features a 25-27\" TV (reception was just okay), a microwave, fridge, safe, two small closets with an iron and ironing board. The drawers are actually located on the nightstand (which took me a night to figure out). The carpet was so-so, again, could have been cleaned or replaced. The sofa was pretty warn, had a stain or two. The computer desk was fine, adequate lighting and the chair was very comfortable. Free internet worked well. The air conditioner, as described, is a bit of a pain. When I came into the room it was set on 60 (old school dial) and medium. It was freezing. When I went to bed I put it at 70. It felt more like the upper 70's and was warm when I was sleeping. So, second night left it on 60 and was better, but a bit too cold. I would aim for 65! Bedding was not the new Hampton bedding yet, so your generic icky comforter and blanket. They do give you plenty of pillows and the bed was very firm. Staff was always very pleasant, including housekeeping and maintenance. Wake up calls were always on time. Valet Parking was easy, but very expensive, with tax: $29. There are lots/garages very close to the hotel. If you are traveling on your own dime and don't mind walking a block or so, I would see what else is available. I didn't eat the breakfast, is located on the 4th floor, however they do have my favorite breakfast bags at the front desk. Those are a life-saver when heading out to visit the office. There is an exercise room on 14 that had a lot of equipment and a weight machine. Vending machines with snacks on 4 and 14, other floors have ice/soda. Overall, the rate was excellent at $80.10 and if they could spruce up the rooms a bit and somehow get the musty smell out, would have been a nicer stay. Once they get the Hampton Bedding, that may help a bit too. If you aren't super-picky, this is a fine stay, if you have allergies, I would think twice. And PS.... while you are there, make sure to tip often and generously.
