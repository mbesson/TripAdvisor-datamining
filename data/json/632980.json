My email was answered by the owner who just referred me to his website. Not very helpful!........ We drove to the place to have a look for ourselves and we were welcomed by a very friendly and helpful manager who showed us all the available rooms and so we were satisfied and booked room 104 (called captain A. Haddock) at the front on the first floor for two days the next week on our return trip. A nice, spacious and cosy room. Old, wooden furniture, totally in style of an 19 century sea master. The mattresses could have been a touch more firmer, but that's also a matter of personal taste. We had a lovely dinner, a giant sea sole poached in butter. Delicious, expensive but worth it! Breakfast was simple. Very tasty Dutch coffee, white and whole grain slices of bread, cold cuts, old and young Dutch cheese, some marmalade and Dutch chocolate chips (hagelslag). They don't have a breakfast cook, so no eggs. Internet WiFi is free. Although an old place, they use modern technology such as RFID room cards and light switches reacting on movement. All in all, Holland as it should be and a place we can wholeheartedly recommend. Possibilities: The tourist office of Durgerdam has a nice parkour prepared that you can walk or bike.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cIn another world...\u201d", "Author": "NatalieR4", "ReviewID": "UR118098773", "Content": "I spent two nights at this hotel and I must say I was impressed by the atmosphere that the owners offer.

We booked it on Priceline and showed up for the last three days of our vacation. The things you should know are: Only six rooms of the hotel are in the old house, the rest were added in the last few years. Its a good way to anything, you have to have a car. The restaurant food is average and the service is really bad. The room we stayed in was clean but small for a \"superior\" room, the only view we had was of the neighbors yard, be sure to ask for a sea view room if you come here unless you are just looking for a place to sleep. Overall it was not a bargain, but there arent many bargains in Amsterdam in the high season. We drove to Keukenhoff Gardens today which was pretty close at 31 k and the Heineken experience which was under 10 k. It is a nice area on the waterfront, but I wont come here again.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiev", "Title": "\u201cThe real old Holland\u201d", "Author": "KievIgor", "ReviewID": "UR103631342", "Content": "The hotel is perfectly situated for any car or bike travellers - it is really hard to find the hotel without GPS.

It wasn't even cheap. I was forced to cancel, because of work problems, and gave them three weeks notice. I can't go any other time because it's not school holidays. They refused to reimburse me , and when I suggested they deduct a reasonable admin change (say \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50) , in the interests of fairness , they still refused ! Incredibly mean , given that they can easily re-let the rooms - and I suspect possibly Illegal also - given that I gave plenty of notice and I have received no service for my payment. It is entirely at the discretion of the hotel, it has nothing to do with Booking.com - they even asked the hotel to make a refund ! I may pursue legally.
