The owner was astonishing.Whatever you do, do not ask if you can pay by credit card.Do not make things worse by suggesting you will visit a cash machineand pay at breakfast the next day. This will be interpreted as attempting to steal a room for a night.The comments in another review are true (smoking, hostility).This is not recommended.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR262724602", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Herberge Grosse, disaster It is no problem to stay in a hotel that only takescash (in advance). If you say, May we stop at a cashmachine and pay at breakfast tomorrow, you do notexpect to be accused of trying to steal a room. Mietbetrugwas the word used.Each room has a TV. It is a pity ours did not work.The place has been painted - at least in the 50's.In this price range (70 to 80) euro, you will not find luxury,but the Berlin Charlottenburg area near Savigny Platz is packedwith Pensions. What a tragedy to end up in this one.At least it is near an S-bahn station so we could leave easily.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR657695431", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Beware of Owner! Berlin: Herberg Grosse: Beware of Owner!Date: August 6, 2004Reviewer: Toronto, CanadaI would not recommend this place. The owner became very grouchy after we declined to take the breakfast option with the room. The entire place smelled like smoke because he was a chain smoker. There was no A/C which was OK in a budget place, but the weather was in the 90's and no fan was offered. When we kept the room door open in an attempt to catch a cross-draft, we were rudely told to close it. The room and bathrooms are very basic but clean. The real problem was the owner -- he made no attempt to make my party feel welcome in any way.", "Date": "Jan 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR307799220", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234925-r22761265-Herberge_Grosse-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "234925", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
