After dinner we came back, threw the windows open and listened to the dueling orchestras and enjoyed a moonlit view of the plaza and basilica. In the morning we simply popped downstairs to enjoy the piazza before the crowds returned. AND to get a picture ofourselves standing at the window in the famous clock tower.

Arrival can be a bit challenging, as the reception dest is about 2 tiny blocks away, but once there they will gladly help you with your luggage back to your room. This was my second time to Venice and by Venetian standards, the room was not only large, but also extremely clean. The scaffolding that some of the reviewers mentioned had been removed the day we arrived. The view was spectacular, and remarkably quiet considering you are in the main plaza. You do hear the bell tower, but I'm not sure you can avoid that as it does ring across much of the area in San Marco. We got to stay for one of their annual fireworks regattas' which we enjoyed directly from our room's window. We avoided the thousands of tourists down below, and instead just pulled up a chair to the open window, drank champagne, ate mini paninis and enjoyed the show. Alex at the front desk was absolutely amazing. He tended to all our needs and made sure our stay was nothing less than incredible. I will include Germany on my next trip my friend. Thank you very much. Venice Tip: 1) Keep an open mind, You will not find contemporary W Hotels in Venice. It can come across as dirty and overly classic for many tourists. This is part of the old world charm and should be appreciated in such a way. It can be completely surreal. Venice transcends you back to a time were life was simpler yet more difficult and quieter yet louder all at the same time. Cherish it for what it will become to you. Although, it wouldn't hurt to see Venice have 30-40 guys around the city picking up trash. Venice Tip: 2) We loved Venice for all it's beauty. It's a city that will stay with you forever, but arriving and departing into the city is something I'd budget for the next time I go. The public water Taxi is inexpensive, but when you're carrying around your luggage and just want to arrive or leave Venice, it can be absolute hell waiting for the dozen stops and distances you have to commute before your bags are stowed. Save a few bucks and take a semi private or private boat to get you near the hotel and bus terminal fast.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful dream!\u201d", "Author": "Max-Max-44", "ReviewID": "UR102966974", "Content": "My girlfriend and I have booked the room with the view on St. Mark's Square.

The hourly ringing of the clock was not an issue for us during the night as we always sleep with earplugs, and the sounds of the people in the piazza was entirely insulated when the windows were closed, although we enjoyed having the windows open most of the time.
