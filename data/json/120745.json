The Hololani is on the ocean and about half way between Kapalua and Lahaina. Lot's of restaurants are within walking distance, though, if you don't feel like having to get in the car and drive up or down the island for dinner. As I mentioned, these condos are ocean front with breathtaking views but the beach itself is small. You only have to walk a short distance along the beach, though, to find a better beach. These are all individually owned condos and some are more updated than others. We've stayed in 203A, 603B and 804B. All were nicely updated and well equiped. Bldg. B is the best one to be in if you want shade on your lanai/balcony. Bldg A has the sun shining on it basically all day. These units are not air conditioned but all are equipted with ceiling fans/and or standing fans. If you go between October and May, you won't even notice it as there are great cross breezes through the condos. The resort is a bit only so there's no spacious lobby with all the glitz but it's a very friendly place to stay. They have a great pool with three nice barbeques and best of all, there is free underground parking! All the units are around 1200 sq. ft with two bedrooms and two baths, and the balconies are huge, which is what makes this place such a great value!

We stayed in unit A203 and it was wonderful. The staff is very friendly and easy to work with. The condo was ready when we arrived and felt like home. We had four adults staying in the one unit and did not feel crowded in the least. There was plenty of room to hang our clothes and lots of drawer space. The kitchen was fully equipped and had dishwasher detergent, dish soap, towels, aluminum foil, cookware, you name it! There was also a coffee grinder. We bought ground coffee at Costco, but if we get to go again, I'll remember this so we can grind our own. The condo also came with beach towels, had I known this I would not have packed my own, but they are there (at least in this unit) if you need them. The grounds were nicely maintained. The staff cleans the pool and the pool area every morning, and the grills are cleaned daily as well. We ate out for the majority of the trip, but we saw other residents using them and the pool area has tables so you can dine al fresco. The units are not air conditioned!!! This was not a problem for us as the trade winds and the fans in the condo kept us cool enough that we really barely noticed. However, I know this can be an issue for some people so please be aware that none of the condos have a/c at this time. The beach is really not a good swimming beach, but great for taking a stroll. There was a lot of high surf for the majority of our trip (this affected all beach areas, not just the area where Hololani is located), but the water is a little rough and the water area is pretty rocky (under the water). The pool was lovely for swimming and relaxing when we weren't out exploring. They do like for the pool area to be relatively quiet, so you may want to keep this in mind if you feel like partying it up! The condos are located in a very convenient area and I think look to be nicer than some of the other condos in the same location. It is right around the corner from some very good restaurants, including a brew house & rotisserie that makes nice local microbrews. It is a short drive to both Kapalua and Lahaina as well. We loved that the location was so convenient and still felt secluded. We had a very late flight off of the island (11 pm!) and asked to be allowed to stay in the unit past our check out time. The staff was very accommodating and had no problem letting us check out later. If you need to do this, it is nice to check in advance to make sure no one is checking into your unit right after you leave. The views are really unmatched in this complex. I stayed in a hotel on my first visit to Maui and to get the view we had at the Hololani, we would have to pay about a thousand bucks a night. In this unit, we were literally less than a hundred yards from the beach. I can only imagine what it is like during the winter when the whales come. It's just breathtaking, and you can see both Lanai and Molokai. Unreal. There were only two things that bothered us a bit during our stay: 1) they started working on the outside of the pool area during our last few days, and we saw a few nails on the walkway on the way out of the pool. Not good for bare feet or flimsy flip-flops! and 2) the sound of the ocean. I know that sounds like a ridiculous complaint, but the surf is LOUD. It's not an issue during the day, but if you are a light sleeper, it can wreak havoc on you, and it did for me. I did not sleep through the night once in the whole 10 days we stayed. We finally got desparate and closed our sliders one night but got too hot and had to reopen them.

Everything we needed was available from coffee filters, baggies and cookie sheets to a DVD player...We also had access to BBQs and a large room for private parties.

The incredible part of all of this is that our accommodations were far more inviting and luxurious than what we saw when visiting family staying in a high-end time share up the street. I want to give you the full picture of Hololani Resort. It is a comparatively small condo, a little older than those nearby. The elevator is badly in need of new carpeting and a fresh coat of paint. i can't imagine that all of the units are as nice as 402-A as each owner decorates to his taste and budget, but we heard only positive remarks from other guests.

I asked her to select the best unit for our needs. She certainly did a great job with that! Upon departure, I left our camera battery plugged into the wall. She immediately mailed it back to me which I very much appreciated. Lots of restaurants are within walking distance. There are three supermarkets within a ten minute drive. Expect to pay more for groceries. (In one store, Bing cherries were $12.95 a pound!) We found the best prices at Safeway and were glad we had shopped first at Costco, near the airport.

About 1 block away on Hoohui street, there's all the stores you need to make your vacation enjoyable. There's a Whalers' general store which is basically convenient store similar to ABC store. In the same shopping center is a McDonald's, Roy's ( yes, the famous chain restaurant from Oahu), Outback Steak House, local coffee hangout and a local micro brewery. In addition, you can get all our watersport needs at the Maui Dive shop. As an added plus, there's a decent Chinese restaurant hidden on the same street about 1.5 blocks away called China boat. So if you are craving chinese food, this is the place. You don't need to drive 15-20 minutes to Lahaina The Hololani condos have two twin towers 8 stories high; the buildings are probably built from the early to mid 1970s The condos are literally on the beach. If you are a light sleeper and can't stand to listen to the waves , then this place is not for you. Also if you open the front door to your unit, you'll get the wonderful cross wind to cool the condo. The breeze was great and comforting. During our stay building B was being reneuvated so it was a little bit noisy with the constructing, but nothing worth losing sleep or complaining about. Looking at some of the units from the pool, the CC&Rs for this condo is lax, because some units have fans installed in the lanai, others don't/ We stayed in unit A303. The unit was in good condition; the bathroom fixtures needed to be replaced and updated though. One of the towel racks was coming apart too. The pool is small but good size. The beach adjacent to the property is narrow and has sharp rocks, but it's still romantic for sunsets or early mornings. our 11 month old son enjoyed the beach. The BBQ grills are easy to use When we arrived, we were given lots of good tips in Maui tour books. Marcia, the property manager was helpful in our trip to Hana; she let us borrow an audio CD of the road to Hana. There were some guests who has some noisy kids but they quieted down as soon as someone asked them to chill out. One thing I would change is to make it a house rules for non smoking certain hours by the pool. I have an infant and several times we left because there were guests who were smoking.

The beach in front of the property is perfect for morning or evening strolls. We drive up to Kapalua beach for snorkeling. Inside the condo everything is updated, clean and roomy. The 2 bathrooms are both full size. We felt absolutely spoiled to be staying here. We will be going back in about 6 weeks. We have stayed at Napili Point (not worth the price) and the Noelani (inexpensive but dated and we had electrical problems in the bedroom of our unit) and will continue coming back to Hololani until it goes out of our price range.", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redwood City, CA", "Title": "\u201cTHE BEST\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3646298", "Content": "Great location, within walking distance to mini mart and stores. 5 minute drive to great snorkeling.

Close to the Whaler Shopping center and Roy's and Outback Steakhouse, as well as a decent short drive into Lahaina and all the sights of Maui. We enjoyed meeting the people who stayed here - a good mix of travellers. The beach is right there and you can walk for about a quarter mile before it ends with rocks. Just enough beach for a short jog or a morning stroll! The one thing that is not a complaint, but just the way it is...we didn't like the 2nd bedroom. THe sliding glass door directly opens to the walkway to the other units. I wouldn't be all that comfortable at night keeping it open for a nice breeze. It had several locks on it at different positions, but still not something we thought was a bonus.

Each stay is always the same whether a year passes or five years. The Hololani is an exuisitely kept condominium resort---don't expect resort hotel services--that provides a perfect feeling of privacy and comfort in the Kahana area. Two high-rise buildings form an \"L\" facing the beach and a breathtaking view of Lanai and Molokai. All units run through the building providing constant and access to the trades. After at least 10 years of staying at the Hololani, we define Maui as heaven at the Hololani. The units are clean and spacious and well appointed. As in earlier reviews the restaurants and stores are but a step away, but within the Hololani it is still a separate and wonderful place apart. Couples and families alike will love the place. We had dinner at a Roy's in San Diego the other night and felt the old Kahana feeling. Booked the flight the next day.
