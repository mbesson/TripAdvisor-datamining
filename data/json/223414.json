Brian the manager was nice enough to allow me an extra parking for a friend who spent the day. Did not use the restaurants but saw many there. Parking under the building was always overcrowded at night but plenty of nearby satellite parking and 1 block to Dunkin Donuts. Nice laundry rooms w/o extra charges.

We stayed at the Hilton last year but thought it might be a little more convenient to stay on the boardwalk, so we chose the holiday. What a mistake! The room we were given was 311, it was clean for the most part aside from the cigarette ashes that covered our balcony table, however the room was just very dated from rust cover fridge to wallpaper tearing off the corner wall, crack in the shower tile. The decor was unimpressive and the room had an odor to it not exactly sure how to describe it, not terrible but not fresh. My family and I went out for a few hours hoping to come back to rest for a while assuming the room would have been made up by now, only to find out our room doesn't get done until 2:30 in the afternoon, that happened twice. The pool is nice, waitresses and lifeguards were great, but I strongly felt the wristband rule was not enforced. I don't think everyone at the pool was actually staying at the hotel, since some of the people were actually in there full clothes, in the pool! The coral reef restaurant food was good, but our waitress, must have been in a rush cause she gave us the check before we even got out entrees!! We had a little rain and decided to go to (what we thought) was a heated indoor pool, only to find out it was not...or at least the heat was not on. the waitress in the restaurant assured us it was but it was freezing! even the host at the desk said he would check on it but nothing was done. The pools outdoors were warmer! Every guest that came inside to use the pool complained about it. Needless to say this will be our last time at the Holiday inn and suites, for $400 a night same as Hilton, the Hilton is the way to go, even if we have to drive a few blocks!!

Our only requests were to have a king size bed ( we have a toddler who sleeps in between us) , to be away from the elevators and to be on higher ground. Sounds simple for one of the largest hotels in Ocean City right? NOPE! Upon check-in we were given a room key to 108 which just so happens to be on the ground floor right next to the lobby and elevators. As we entered the room, we noticed that we had 2 full size beds instead of the king and also right in front of our balcony was the swimming pool. GREAT! My husband walks back out and talks to some guy at the front desk who could do nothing for us. FOR REAL??!!! We book 6 weeks in advance and paid close to $400 for this?! What could we do right? We drove 4 hours and were exhausted so we stuck with what they had. The noise from the pool area was not as bad as I thought it would be but things go downhill from here. When I went to clean the jetted tub to give my daughter a bath, a bunch of small black hairs came out from the jets! GROSS! The shower head also had green mold on it. It was a good thing I brought along my Tilex and sponge because it is obvious they do not clean the tub/shower. When it came to bedtime, I actually had to stack a bunch of pillows along one side of the full size bed so that my daughter would not fall off. (like I said earlier she usually sleeps on a king in between my husband and I. Well apparently that did not work well bc she ended up falling off the bed during the night. Oh I also found a couple long blonde hairs on the the duvet cover......eeeew!

Tips and info: ~ If you can get an ocean front, do! Great views! First floor rooms have direct pool access, but not as nice of a view. These rooms have pros and cons. Pro: you can beat the crowd when the pool opens and possibly get a table! You will be guaranteed a chair. You will be also able to go in and out of your room when at the pool! Please know that these first floor rooms are at the adult pool and activity pool, so if you want to request one- make sure you request the side you\u2019d like to be on. Cons: loud, no privacy on you patio, lacking beautiful ocean view. ~ We had a one bedroom ocean front suite- all rooms here are suites. We requested a room with two beds. When entering our room, you walk directly into the living room- nice size with pull out sofa and table for four. Then you walk into a galley kitchen- everything you need! To the right is a large bathroom with large Jacuzzi tub! Tip: make bubbles in the tub by pouring the provided shampoo into the bath! Then walk further to the bedroom- very nice size. Then to the balcony! What a view- table and chairs- very nice. Overall, our room was clean. Yes, it could use some minor touch ups, but we expected that. Tip: Make sure you put in a request as to where you\u2019d like to be placed. Higher floors are above the noise and have nice views. ~ Washing machines are located throughout the hotel. I hear that they are free of charge, just bring your detergent. ~ Smell- the smell you have read about in other reviews is true. We did smell it. It seems to be in the hallway. Attention Holiday Inn: I think it is from your carpet cleaners. I own a carpet cleaner and the smell reminds me of the stale water that accumulates in the carpet vacuum. The dirty water smells awful and if it happens to fall out onto carpet the smell will stick! I\u2019d have a talk with your carpet cleaning crew. ~ Elevators- nice. They seem to work well. Now if you are and the lobby and need to go to the ground- why not simply use the stairs. ~ Restaurants- we enjoyed the food at the indoor restaurant and at the pool. Kids eat free with a paying adult. I suggest the club wrap. Our kids loved the chicken finger meal consisting of two chicken fingers, fries, two Oreo cookies, and a drink. If you want ice cream- don\u2019t buy it from the ice cream truck that you will hear. Instead, buy it from the indoor restaurant- great prices! Most are only $1.50! You will pay $3 or more for the same items on the boardwalk or from the ice cream truck. ~Activity pool- usually opens around 8 or 9 AM and you will see a line form prior to it opening. Unfortunately, until Holiday Inn finds a way to regulate this, you must play this silly game of saving seats. Now I am NOT saying you should save seats if you don\u2019t plan on using them for hours (as many do), but you can stroll out there when the pool opens and save your spot if you plan on being there within the hour. People would put their towel on a chair and head and head to the beach for the day and come back in the late afternoon- how rude! Tip: if you can\u2019t find a chair set one of your beach chairs up in a free spot. If you have toddlers, try to get a chair by the entrance to the pool close to the baby slide as you will spend a lot of time in that section. If you have kids a little older like my 6 and 8 year old who love the circling whirlpool try to get a chair on the right hand sided closed to the beach. I liked this position because I could see the kids in the circling whirlpool at all times. Also, kids under 16 are NOT allowed in the outdoor hot tub. You can access a bathroom by using the door by the towel booth. If those two bathrooms are being used, walk a down the hall and to the right you will find additional bathrooms. There are even more bathrooms located by the arcade. ~Indoor Pool- this pool in nice. It is located with the indoor restaurant. This is a nice place to eat your lunch at and take a break from the sun. Other info: It is nice to use the changing rooms on your last day or when you arrive. Simply ask the front desk for the key. These rooms are located by the gym. Towels are provided for beach and pool use. We viewed a magic show in the conference room. I would not recommend wasting your time as it was not very good. However, it is nice of the H I to offer it. Additionally, fruit is available for the taking by the front desk. Be sure to clean it very well- you will smell the heavy amount of pesticides used. Around the corner from the front desk is a mini store. There are additional stores right under the H I on the boardwalk.

Needless to say we were not in a hurry to jump back in.

Before I begin my review of the hotel itself, I would just like to say that I often wonder what people really expect when they stay at a hotel in OCMD high priced or not. As long as its not falling down, its a place to sleep and shower, this isn't a Sandals Resort, its OCMD. If you haven't been there before OCMD is not exactly glamourous or exotic...its a boardwalk and a beach plain and simple. SO IF YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE TRIP OF A LIFETIME BY GOING TO OCMD YOU HAVE ANOTHER THING COMING. I have read many reviews on here for many of the different hotels along the Boardwalk and it would seem that every single hotel has a 1 dot review. Honestly, upon reading most of these reviews, one would probably rather stay on the beach than in any of these hotel rooms. My experience in this hotel was a very pleasant and predictable one. We had a very nice ocean view from the 6th floor, room 620 to be exact, and the room seemed very clean and well maintained. The staff were very friendly when asked questions and laughed and joked with us as we were checking in. The wireless internet worked pretty well as I had to attend an online meeting whilst there, experiencing very little network interruption. The lobby was clean enough, I mean come on...its a beach...things are going to get sandy...I myself was probably responsible for some of the sand left on the floor. Steps down to the boardwalk may pose a problem to handicapped visitors but there are other ways to get to the boardwalk...I have a handicapped mother and I would stay here with her; and I'm sure she'd have enjoyed it just as much as me. To expand a little bit on the room...it had a sitting area with a large TV, maybe 42\" flat-screen, and comfortable couches with nice decor. A full kitchen with Stove, microwave, and fridge. Bathroom had a huge shower and a nice tub. The sleeping area also had a flatscreen tv and had 2 queen beds and a nice porch to look out over the boardwalk and ocean. I did not notice any cleanliness issues in any parts of the room, not that I was looking to be displeased by something, we are not overly scrutinizing people. Here's the deal and my two cents on this...everyone is looking for and will have a different experience on vacation. I have been to OCMD before, I know what to expect, I have no kids, I was here with my girlfriend and one of my close friends, and we had nothing tieing us down to the room so we came and went as we pleased. We slept and showered here; that was all. And for that the room was excellent. The only reason I did not give this a 5 dot rating is because I think nothing deserves a perfect rating. Things could always be better, even if there is nothing apparently wrong. I would definitely stay here again....If you want more than one opinion on this after reading my review, I thought the review with the \"Roll the Dice\" title was very fair.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montclair, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "4mindshare", "ReviewID": "UR133093143", "Content": "Superior location, and attentive staff.

The very first night we arrived the room smelled horrible a mix of musk/smoke/mildew, and we noticed there was a huge floor dryer blowing directly at the front of our door in the hallway! I immediately called and complained and said I wanted to switch rooms because the smell was nauseating and I have 3 small children with me one of whom is only 8 months old, I was told \"Sorry we are completely booked - we will send someone up to check the smell. Housekeeping arrived and checked the outlets??? and then said \"I smell exactly what you are talking about but I do not know where it is coming from but I will leave you this can of air freshener but don't use it unless you plan on leaving the room because it is very powerful!\" I asked him why the floor had a dryer blowing outside and he said \"Someone spilled a drink earlier which splashed onto your door so we were drying the carpet. The next day we woke up and walked outside of our room and noticed the dryer was gone, didn't think much of it went about our day, came back, and were walking into our room when I noticed wet shoe tracks all throughout the room - I grabbed a towel and wiped it up. The smell again was horrible. We continued our day and went to eat downstairs. Upon returning I opened the door carrying my 8 month old daughter and slipped and almost fell. Again I looked down and see wet foot prints from my kids - I start looking around and realize the wet floor was coming from outside my door - it was drenched! The smell again was still overwhelming as well so I called again and complained - this time I was told a mop bucket was spilled - we will put a dryer out and send someone to check on the smell. Maintenance arrived and he put vanilla scented pads in the air returns which completely masked the smell and the dryer ran all night and most of the next day until someone removed it. Day 3 went about my day came home to a drenched floor again! Called yet again and complained the manager said she would come look at it - she evidently looked at it and called back apologizing saying they would send maintenance up to take care of it this time they would use a wet-vac first and then a dryer. Again I asked to move - \"Sorry we are sold out!\" A maintenance man came up again with the dryer - I asked him if he had any knowledge about the situation he laughed and said \"This room has had this problem for a month - I have told management several times and they have done nothing except say put a dryer out! At this point I am furious but obviously my hands are tied - the hotel has all of my money and I can do nothing about it! By the 6th day I am so sick of wiping up the tile so we don't slip and break our necks that I head straight to the front desk and ask for a manager to follow me to my room. He did and said \"I was told a mop bucket spilled here a while ago and have heard nothing since, I apologize you shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this - I will credit you one night and you can switch rooms if you like. By this time my husband refuses to switch rooms because of the amount of time and hassle of packing everything back up to move and unpack for the next 2 nights. This vacation was a complete nightmare! This hotel was horrible and no better than most motels we drove past while in Ocean City. I feel the one night credit was a nice gesture but not nearly good enough for what we had to endure. My vacation days were spent wiping up a floor every time we walked in the door, and dealing with a horrible odor which I can only assume was from the leaking water all of that time. When you pay over $400 a night you expect a nice hotel - my 9 year old boys even said \"This place is a dump and disgusting!\" I am completely appalled at the service we received staying in this hotel! I will NEVER again stay at this hotel because of their lack of customer service. Obviously this hotel has too many managers since I never dealt with the same one more than once and they have not a clue what goes on or don't care! I took a video of just how soaked the floor was -you can actually see the water gush around my shoe when I step unfortunately I can't upload it here!!! I will be advising all not to stay here!

However, my recent visit to celebrate my birthday was, in a word, awful. At $400+ per night, I do expect a certain level of professionalism, including top notch customer service skills and the ability to deal with difficult problems. So here is a word of warning to you -- if you are a person or family who requires a good night of sleep during your vacation, please know that your chances of having that are a roll of the dice. For me personally, I aim for about five solid hours of sleep. If I can get that, I'm good. So when all hell broke loose in the evening at the unit directly adjacent to ours, my adreneline kicked in, though I felt pretty sure the hotel could handle it. I was wrong. Earlier in the day we had heard screaming, arguing and banging on the wall, but we left for the beach and figured it would pass. When the loud voices and wall banging re-commenced in the evening, we called downstairs to report it. The staff member duly responded that he/she would \"handle\" it. Okay, good. About twenty minutes later, the wall banging and door slamming picked up, and it had the distinct feeling of some kind of adolescent retaliation. Except I knew it was two adults and a couple kids. Another phone call downstairs was made, and the responding staff member indicated they would make another call to the offending room. By this time we're into an hour of this aggravation. More wall banging, yelling and door slamming ensues, and a security person then comes up. Clearly whatever it was he communicated did nothing to impart concern to the hell raisers that they might be asked to relocate. My feeling is it should be three strikes and you're out. Evidently the hotel takes the attitude that those poor souls who are complaining about something should be the ones to move. Really? It became painfully obvious to me that the hotel prefers not to deal with these kinds of issues -- but at the customer's expense. The yelling was so loud that my 17 year old daughter kept being startled awake and asking what was happening. When the wall banging and angry yelling started again, I began to feel a bit threatened for my family's safety. My daughter was so tired, as was I -- we all were -- all we wanted to do was get some rest in our nice, expensive hotel room, but no. The grand finale came around 2:00AM when the whole motley crew stepped out on their deck and screamed loud enough to drown out the pounding thunder. This went on for a good hour. At this point...I gave up, knowing our option would be to \"relocate.\" It was in that moment I realized that my esteem for this formerly beloved hotel was gone. I deserved to have a nice birthday, and my family deserved to enjoy themselves. I strongly recommend that the Holiday Inn and Suites in Ocean City, MD revisit their security policies, along with the manner in which they treat hotel guests who are experiencing this kind of unpleasantness. It is patently unfair that folks who spend their hard earned vacation money should have to suffer through something like this. So be forewarned -- you might get the chance to enjoy a nice stay here. On the other hand, should something happen that requires professional intervention in a situation such as the one we suffered through -- may the good Lord hlep you, because it seems the Holiday Inn & Suites enjoys so much business that it doesn't have to care.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pewaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWatch out for falling concrete\u201d", "Author": "Rick G", "ReviewID": "UR132691148", "Content": "We were using our Priority Club points for this hotel, as it costs $400 a night or more during the summer.

We had a full kitchen with dishwasher. It was nice to be able to make quick meals for breakfast and eat out on the balcony. The room was a little dated but very clean. The location is perfect. We parked our car and didn't drive for the rest of the weekend. There is a CVS within walking distance, but if you want groceries such as lunch meat and things of that nature, you should get them on the way in because there are no big grocery stores within walking distance. We were able to walk to the end of the boardwalk to ride the rides and play games every night. I'm guessing it was about 1.5 miles to the end of the boardwalk from this location. There is a tram car you can ride for $3 dollars each way/person if you don't want to walk. My little one loved the activity pool. It has a shallow entry so you just walk right in. It was heated so he didn't mind going in. There is a spa tub near the activity pool. You need to be 15 in order to use it. The other pool was not heated and was pretty chilly when we were there. You have to purchase your alcohol through the pool bar. They don't allow outside alcohol in. The pool hours were also a little strange. The activity pool closed at 6pm and the other pool closed at 8pm. The hotel gives you passes to get towels at the pool. If you hand in your towel you get the towel pass to use the next time. The indoor pool is next to a restaurant/bar. It was a little chilly also. The only downside to this property is the price.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cMet our needs\u201d", "Author": "TheFbright", "ReviewID": "UR131033709", "Content": "Ocean City isn't upscale so it's no surprise this hotel isn't either. But it met our needs. We traveled with our 2 year old daughter and it was a fine stay. The front desk staff isn't rude but they are not helpful or accommodating in any way. We should have been given a brief rundown of hotel amenities(like parking) but it was sort of \"here are your keys. Bye\" type of attitude. Being a former hotel manager,I prefer uniforms for employees (except management) and some standard of professionalism. Although the front desk staff looked fine, i prefer uniformity so you recognize them as staff. The restaurant staff & maintenance did wear matching shirts but looked sloppy from the waist down, just unprofessional in my opinion. We ate breakfast in the restaurant each day and it was pretty good. Some of the staff was great, others lacked service. The room was fine. Yes, some things were dated or needs attention (I.e. Pealing wallpaper) but overall good. The view is wonderful, bed & linens were as good as any, ample size living & kitchen, very much met our needs. The whirlpool tub needs to go. My toddler is scared of the shower and it was hard to bath& wash her hair in the whirlpool tub. And it's just dated& tacky in my opinion. The bathroom was large with ample amenities. The air conditioner could have been colder, especially since we went early in the season. Hate to think how hot it would be in mis summer. Overall we had a good stay. Happy hour prices were great!

It was all very clean and new. It was nice to be able to make our own breakfast in the morning, and to have all the food we needed through out the day with out having to rely on eating out for every meal. The bathroom was great! Our toddler LOVED the giant jacuzzi, and she swam in it several times during our stay. It also has a nice rain style shower head, very luxurious. Plenty of counter space and lighting. We had two queen beds in he spacious bedroom. We loved how high the ceilings were, and that we had a TV in here too. It was far enough away from the living room that we didn't disturb our sleeping baby. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The sliding doors leading to the balcony were lovely, and we enjoyed watching the sun rise over the ocean from our bed. The hotel is on the beach, so access is very convenient. Since it was the off season, there were hardly any people there, which was great! Lots of covered parking, no crowds, and a very quiet hotel. We appreciated that there was an indoor pool too! The outdoor pool(s) looked amazing, and I can imagine it would be a kid's dream come true during the summer. We ate dinner one evening from the restaurant in the lobby. It was very quick service, and our ribs were great! We especially enjoyed the fried banana cheesecake pastry offered there. I highly recommend it. The staff and employees were very kind and accommodating. We were given and early check in at around 10. We also asked for a late check out so our toddler could squeeze in one more nap before we headed home, and that was no problem at all.

I do like the rooms very much despite the fact that we usually stay at 5 star hotels (Grand Cypress or Grand Floridian in Orlando, The Plaza in NY, The Willard in DC and so on) so this is an adjustment downward in luxury, but it is clean, comfortable, spacious, friendly and all the amenities and it\u2019s PRIME location make up for a hard to see run in the carpet here or there.

The large bathroom has a triangular two-person jacuzzi that is very comfortable - the included bath salts are a nice bonus. But the best part of this place is the view. From the bedroom, the large sliding glass door faces the open ocean. If you're high enough up, you can't see anything but water from the bedroom. It's truly spectacular if you love to see the ocean stretching away for miles. You might even see whales in the distance. And if the sky is clear, you can see the moon and sun rise out of the ocean, even while laying in bed. With the slider open, you can hear the surf very well, which is wonderfully relaxing. It's about my favorite place to go to unwind. The small restaurant/bar has cheap drinks at happy hour, though that may only be the case in the off season. I was surprised that the breakfast was inexpensive. It may be that there is so much competition in the area. The hotel is right on the boardwalk and there are restaurants everywhere.

With a pack and play (which they supplied), I loved having the extra room and somewhere to set it up so we could stay up a little later and not feel confined to a small space, having to be quiet. The pool was great. It was sloped for the babies to play and had 2 water slides. One was even geared toward younger kids and shaped like a pirate ship.

We chose this Holiday Inn for two reasons, First the reviews were very good and second, the outdoor kidde pool was still opened. Our choice was a good one. The kidde pool was large and contained a number of very nice features such as heated water, spouts, water slides, whirlpool, and a lazy river. There is a lifeguard in the kidde pool and threre were plenty of chairs for our stuff. My grandson spent literally hours in the kidde pool each day. There is also a separate outdoor pool and an indoor pool but these do not have lifeguards. The room itself was also clean and nice, It contained a sitting area, kitchen and a separate bedroom with a fairly large balcony overlooking the ocean. The kitchen contained a full stove and refrigerator but the counter space in the kitchen was so small that serious cooking was difficult. However, the balcony contained a dining table and four chairs that seemed to beg for some al fresco dining. For the first day we brought some pre-cooked food (steaks and microwave veggies), warmed them up in the kitchen and ate on the deck. Prep time was 10 minutes and everything turned out fine. The hotel was clean and and the personnel were helpful and friendly. The restaurant was next to the indoor pool so you could actually get carryout from the bar and eat poolside if your kids didn't want to leave the pool. The food at the restaurant was reasonably priced and decent. There are many breakfast places within a quarter mile of the hotel. The location of the hotel in the center of the boardwalk about a mile from the inlet where all the rides are. The hotel offers a number of freebies including fruit at the front desk, parking, towels at the pools, laundry facilities, meals for children under twelve in the restaurants, dish detergents, and newpapers.

The hotel was everything we hoped for. My wife and I are both from Maryland and have been going to Ocean City since we were kids. I feel like I have stayed in almost every major hotel there, from The Breakers to the Carousel, and a dozen condos from the inlet to Fenwick. The Holiday Inn Suites on 17th Street is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in at Ocean City. Anyone who has ever been to OC knows that cleanliness is relative; but this place was objectively clean. Our toddler loved the kids pool. She played on the whale and the small fountains and it was great to have a pool where she could stand. In addition to being clean, the room, a king ocean front, was gigantic. Both my wife and I loved the view and the little one loved eating breakfast on the balcony. I liked that we didn\u2019t have to go out for breakfast and lunch every day, as there was a full kitchen and even a dishwasher in the room. The gym was clean and uncrowded (to the extent that is a word). The fruit in the lobby was a nice touch, and the staff was very pleasant. As far as complaints, the bed was a little soft for me, but that is hardly a complaint. The price is also a little higher than most places in OC, BUT, you get what you pay for. It was absolutely worth it.

It looks like a relatively new hotel, but as with any beach hotel they seem to age very quickly. The room itself seemed to be a tale of different eras. You enter into a dark living room. It is reminiscent of something from the 90s. There is an odd ceramic tile floor that seems totally out of place. There is a sleeper sofa and a TV. You then enter into the 80's with a very basic kitchen and the absolutely least expensive appliances and cabinets money can buy. We are talking lower than builders grade quality. The facet leaked like crazy. The refrigerator made a loud noise when it kicked on, but that was easily drowned by the dishwasher which sounded like a jet engine. We didn't use the stove, and it looked very clean and hardly used. The bathroom still carried the 80's theme with the exception of some nice wall tile. The shower curtain was missing several hooks and appeared to be in bad need of replacement. The drop ceiling was rusted. The bath tub looked like it had been caulked by a 5 year old. Not the worst I have seen, but considering the cost of the room it was a bit of a letdown. Finally into the modern era. The bedroom was very nice. New furniture, bedding, carpet and curtains. The balcony was nice. We had a 14 floor room with an amazing view. There are table and chairs on the balcony. The pool area was very crowded. Lots of people hoarding chairs. By 11am it was impossible to find one. Well, let\u2019s be correct. There were plenty that were empty, and many stayed empty the entire day except for the towels that people placed on them. The hotel really should create a storage place around the pool for people to store their items and keep the chairs open for people that are actually going to sit in them. The same is true for tables. Especially around lunch. They should be reserved for people that are eating, and not for holding a cooler and beach toys. The only real negatives we experienced were the AC didn't work the first night. It was 74 degrees in our room. We called down and a tech arrived within 30 mins. He messed around with it for about 15 mins and said he fixed it. Well he got it down to 73 degrees and still very humid. The next morning I asked the front desk and they said they would send someone up. At 4pm it was still 74 degrees and I called down again. They apologized and said there was a mistake and would send someone back up. The new tech arrived and said there was a part that was bad, and fixed the issue. The room finally started cooling down. The other issue we had was that our neighbors decided to have a party on their balcony at 11:30pm. I called the front desk and they said they would take care of it. Within 5 mins the screaming and yelling stopped and all was quiet. Overall it is a good hotel. I don't think it is a great value for the quality that you are receiving.

Nothing like taking a nice hot jacuzzi in the bathroom and then sitting out on the private balcony watching the ocean to relax . A paper is delivered out side your door every morning. Free fruit is available in the lobby and a high speed internert connection is free in every suite. This year we brought our 4 year old granddaughter along. We took her to the Winterfest of Lights,swam in the indoor pool(which we had all to ourselves),ate at Grotto's pizza,Waterman's Seafood and Coin's. Played games in the hotel game room,watched movies,walked on the beach and a mostly empty boardwalk and had a wonderful time. My granddaughter cried when we had to leave for home. She wanted to stay at the hotel.I got a great rate online for the room(less than $90 a night) and believe me it was worth much more.

Kitchen: well-equipped with utensils, plates, a few cooking pots/pans, dishwasher, microwave, can opener, blender (yay!), fridge, stove, and coffeemaker.

Bathroom: dual sinks, good-sized three-head shower, regular commode. Sunlamp (I think) and built-in hairdryer. Hotel supplies nice soap (citrus mint when we were there), individual mouthwash, conditioner, shampoo, shower caps. Bedroom: Roomy, equipped with 2-person jacuzzi (bedoom jacuzzi available ONLY in select rooms; some rooms have the jacuzzi in the bathroom), mirrored closet, 4-drawer drsser, TV cabinet with a couple of drawers, flat panel and DVD, upholstered chair, king bed, 2 nightstands. The bed was uncomfortable to both of us but I have recently had back surgery and we have a ridiculously expensive memory foam mattress (worth it, let me assure you!) to compare to, so that's a little unfair. They provide 2 soft and 2 firm pillows with indicators for which are which. I liked the firm, my wife felt no difference. Balcony: Table, 4 chairs. Sliding glass door and screen. The 2 windows don't open! Opening the balcony door airs out the place reasonably well. We opened the room door also and almost got knocked down by a few gusts! The hotel provides extra towels at the jacuzzi and some bath salts. We used them and our own bubble powder at different times. Ocean City water seems to be quite hard and nothing could raise more than a faint mat of sad little bubbles that clung to each other but eventually gave up. The jacuzzi is roomy enough for two Americans or three Europeans. It may hold as many as... oh, I'd better not. We ordered room service twice, dinnner the day we arrived and the \"pre-order\" breakfast (you'll find a form on the nightstand) the day we left. Both meals were delivered when they said they would be and the quality was good. Both orders had exactly one error-- incorrect side order, wrong beverage. A correction was not requested as the errors were actually preferable-- the fries served were delicous sweet potato and the wrong drink was an orange juice for apple juice and my wife says, \"Oh, sheesh, I meant to tell you to get me an OJ.\" And there it was. Maybe the hotel is psychic? There was an 18% \"service charge\" for the dinner we ordered so be careful about adding a tip The breakfast states there is an 18% gratuity added to the price so, again, be careful about adding a tip. The suite was well-presented at arrival, very orderly and clean. The dishes all were spotless as were the eating utensils. Everything except the very back of the top of the fridge was dusted.

In fact they said payment would be made at check-out. Yes, you still are required to use a credit card number when you do your reservation, but no charges were made to ours until we checked out. Also, we originally book one for one night. We decided to extend our stay but the Hotel staff said weekend rates were higher.

This year we decided to splurge and try this Holiday Inn on the boardwalk.... probably twice as expensive as the place we stayed last year. The oceanfront view from our room on the 11th floor was AMAZING! It was too hot to sit out on the deck in the morning with the direct sun, but by early afternoon it was partially shaded with a great breeze. My kids tried all 3 pools.... the indoor pool was larger than expected but the water too cold for me, I think because it shares the space with a restaurant. Both outdoor pools were nice and warm. They especially loved the kids pool, since it had jets in areas that push you around a whirlpool and river. We thought the room was very nice and clean -- I think from reading some other reviews, it really depends what you are used too. The kitchen was fully equipped with most things needed for cooking -- however, 2 things missing were a cookie sheet-type pan (for baking a pizza or chicken nuggets, etc) and oven mitts. Maybe these were just missing from our particular room ,,... but there really was everything else. The beds were super-comfortable! The kids tried out the jacuzzi tub and liked it but found it's very loud. Location is great... steps to the beach and a 10-20 minute walk to the busier end of the boardwalk with the arcades. The only frustration we had, and this was mentioned in a previous review, is that it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to find a chair in either outdoor pool area. Guests seem to go out there early in the morning and \"reserve\" a chair with a towel, and then leave. 2 mornings we were there, from our deck I counted 30-40 \"reserved\" chairs by 8:30 am when there were no more than 6 people actually in the pool area. And people also tend to reserve a chair for each family member, including little kids, which really isn't necessary. There is a small sign about not leaving belongings on a chair when you leave the pool area but it's ignored. We were lucky to find 1 chair for the 5 of us to share, and a few times I just sat at the edge of the pool with our stuff to watch the kids. It would be great if the hotel could come up with a solution for this, since common sense and consideration is obviously lacking.

I was getting mixed reactions from family and friends about choosing OCMD as a \"family vacation.\" I was told it would be \"raunchy\", \"overcrowded\" and \"dirty.\" However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was none of these and our family of five.... kids ages are 10, 9, 5 had a great time. I choose the Holiday Inn Hotels and Suites because of the kids pool..... slides, whirlpools, fountains, etc.... they had a blast and would stay there all day if we let them. The only problem I found was that by 10am all the chairs around the pool had been \"reserved\" with towels and such so there was never a free chair to sit at. I wish hotels would stop that... it is my pet-peeve in life! Anyway, the pool was great. There are two other pools as well... one indoor (water was very cold) and another outdoor which was more for the adults... but kids could go there too. The hotel itself is in a good location... not so close to the \"busy\" side of the boardwalk where the amusement park is, but close enough that you could walk there in 20 minutes down the boardwalk or you can get the tram ($3 each way per person... pricey!) The hotel is directly on the boardwalk and the beach is right across. We brought our own chairs and umbrella to set up. The water can be rough. My older children loved boogie boarding in the waves but my 5 year old was fearful of the waves and did not go in the water. The inside of the hotel is OK. It is very expensive for what you get, but ALL the hotels on the beach are this way. The beds were very comfortable, but overall the room was a little outdated and not the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed at.

This year I used Priority Club Points for one of the nights and paid $479+tax for the second night (they did not have any Priority Club rooms available). When I booked the hotel the operator assured me that even though I had two confirmation numbers I would have the same room. When I checked in I explained to the front desk employee that I had two confirmation numbers and she said that it would not be a problem. My family and I got situated the first night and unpacked all of our bags and put everything away. The next afternoon I received a phone call from Jenny at the front desk telling me that I needed to return to the hotel to move my belongings to my new room. She said that they don't have the same room \"type\" available for me any longer. What does \"same room type\" mean? Let me explain, I guess when you are a loyal Holiday Inn Priority Club member they don't give you the same rooms as the other guests. From that point forward Jenny at the front desk only said \"this is your new room, there is nothing we can do for you, if you want a room tonight this is where you will be staying\". Admittedly I dropped from a Platinum level member to a gold level member this year but I still accumulate a lot of points each year with Priority Club. Unfortunately for Holiday Inn, the treatment I received at this property has me reconsidering my loyalty to their chain of hotels. Somebody in management should look up the research that Nielson Research Company did a few years back that shows that 5x as many people hear about a bad experience over a good experience.

This was our first stay at this Holiday Inn. I booked the reservation back in April using a combination of Priority Club Reward Points and cash. I only had to pay a total of around $225.00 out of pocket for both nights so we only ended up paying around $112.50 per night for a room that normally would book for $449.00 a night which is the nightly rate it was showing as on the web at the time of my booking. If you are not already a member of the Holiday Inn Priority Club Rewards Club then it is definately worth joining. It is free to join and you can rack up a lot of extra bonus points fairly easily through promotions by the program involving stays within a certain time frame, You can also easily rack up big points by subscribing(NEW only) to Direct TV, Netflix,Chase credit card etc to name a few. Just make sure that you register for any of these offers through the Priority Club Website link for any offers for Direct TV, NetFlix, Chase credit card etc or you will not be eligible to receive the points. Now on to my review. A southern view was the only option with booking a Priority Club Rewards night. The room description said that it had a balcony but I expected that we would be facing the street or not have a view of the ocean. Boy, was I surprised! but more about that later. The Holiday Inn was very clean,modern, and inviting from the outside and we were able to find a parking space in the main parking lot by the hotel. There is also a parking area across the street. There was several polite young men assisting with baggage as we entered the lower lobby. There were stairs as well as 4 elevators.The lobby was very inviting with marble floors, nice lighting,railing by the stairs and overall nice decor.There were 2 restaurants on this level as well as an indoor pool. There were 3 guest relations clerks at the reception desk checking in guests which was fantastic as our check in went very quickly and smoothly. This was the best check in experience that I ever had anywhere! Theye also gave you cards to get pools towels which you got back when you turned them in and purple bracelets for everyone in your party to show that you were a Holiday Inn guest. There were also large baskets filled with grapefruit, oranges, and banana's for the guests as well as a basket with packets of bath salts to enjoy in the whirlpool tub in your suite. We checked in with such ease. There was no long wait for one of the 4 elevators even with there being 14 floors. We got to our room on the 8th floor and were so deligthted when we opened the door to our suite. There was a sleeper sofa,table and chairs, chair with ottoman and a flat screen TV to name a few. There was even a ceiling fan. From there,was a hall that contained the kitchen on the left and bathroom on the right. The kitchen contained a fridge, stove,dishwasher, coffee pot with the fixings, toaster, electric can opener. It was also fully furnished with dinnerware,eating utensils,cookware to name a few. It was a fully functioning kitchen ready for use. There was even dishwashing powder,liquid dishwashing detergent, and even a dish towel. The bathroom was large,clean, and spacious with Bath and Body Works amenties provided as well as bath salts(I believe those may have been Crabtree and Evelyn but unsure???) A blowdryer was provided abd the bathroom also had a double sink. It had an amazing whirlpool tub for two and a rainforest shower for lack of a better work.The shower was a round disk in the ceiling. We then moved on to the bedroom which was located past the kitchen/bathroom. It had a door that could be closed for privacy which was especially nice if you had 2 families staying there and someone was sleeping on the sleeper sofa. The bedroom had 2 queen beds and another TV located in an armoire.It was very tastefully furnished. There was a closet with a full length mirror on the door and an extra nice touch was a full size safe that you could program with your own combination. This was great to put valuables in while in the beach. Our southern view balcony had a nice beach view even though our room was on the side of the hotel. We were in room 804 which was great as the room location was as closest as you could get to beach without having an oceanfront room. The balconies had a solid wall for privacy but since our room was on the end closet to the beach, we had an unobstructed open side facing the beach. There wwere 2 outdoor pools that included an adult pool and a very nice childrens pool with a lazy river,nice slides, and other play areas in the pool.We did not utilize any of the pools due to our short stay but they really looked inviting and the kids were having a ball in the kids pools as well as the adults. There were steps from the lobby that took you directly between these 2 pools and right on the boardwalk and right on the beach. There were also several nice shops located right on the boardwalk including a nice jewelwry store-Mark Douglas Jewelers. I puchased some very cute turtle earrings for my daughter there. The beach was very clean and not overly crowded by the hotel. I would also like to say that our room was very,very clean and that we were provided with fresh towels in a timely fashion during our stay. The room was also very quiet and I slept great as the bed bed and linens were very comfy. We also had the good fortune to secure a parking spot in the parking garage and left our car there the whole time as everything was within walking distance and the tram passed by frequently though a little expensive-$3.00 for 1 person for 1 way trip but they do offer discount cards. I was also impressed that one of the housekeeping staff spoke to another guest in the elevator regarding that she remembered him from his visit the previous summer. WOW! All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Checkout was also a breeze as the clerk advised that Priority Club took care of everything and that we didn't need to do anything. Check in is 3:00 pm and checkout is 11:00 am. I only have one regret about this stay in that I wish that it could have been much, much longer. It was so relaxing and we will definately be back as fast as I can rack up those Priority Club points. I was also very impressed about how VERY CLEAN,CLEAN,CLEAN that the suite and bathroom was as I am very pickly about these things. Thanks for a fantastic stay from start to finish.

No laundry soap provided nor offered in a vending machine. There was also an ice machine with soda pop machine (Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, Dasani, Neste Iced tea)\u2026 all drinks only .40cents each. Candy/snack machine was priced from .60cents to a $1. The restaurant was decent, but priced a little high. Indoor bar was nice\u2026 bartender Terry was excellent. She always remembered our room-number when we charged beverages. Hotel offered room service, but we never ordered. Pools were nice. Indoor pool was always empty... except older people swimming in it. The kiddie-pool was very nice. Not overly crowded. 2 life-guards were on duty. 2 small slides and lazy river was cool. Just a handful of umbrellas in pool areas to block sun. I felt those were taken fairly early in the morning. Free towels at pool. Hot tub was ok\u2026 I never saw little kids in it. Adult outdoor pool was nice\u2026 not crowded. Outdoor bar was nice\u2026 $2 beer specials. Also had snack food for kids (nachos, hot dogs, fries, etc). Small area to sit in shade at bar area too. Bartenders walking around pool area ready to serve drinks/food. By 2pm half the pool areas are shaded from the sun (hotel is blocking sun)\u2026 which is nice.

I definitely will stay at this hotel again\u2026 it\u2019s conveniently located on the boardwalk. We walked to the end of the boardwalk to have dinner. A train runs on the boardwalk during the evening costing $3/person. We rented bikes/surrey on 20thStreet off of boardwalk. They accepted the $5 competitor coupon from the place located on 8th Street. So, large surrey for an hour was $20 with coupon. Every evening before we went to dinner we stopped at the front desk asking if they had dinner coupons for the place we were heading to\u2026 and don\u2019t you know it\u2026 the front desk gave us bigger discount coupons than what we found in all the coupon books/guides found in lobby area.

If your key doesn't work to open the pool door just push the handicap access button and it will open or enter through the gates in the cafe. The poolside cafe was a kind of cheap looking, but we found we could get the same food items at the same price in the nicer dining room area (Hemingway's). It all comes from the same kitchen! There's no complimentary breakfast though they had some fruit on the front desk (banana's and oranges). Layton's, a family restaurant, is now open year round and is located across the street next the CVS (on the main drag). They had some impressive specials and dyno biscuits and cost a lot less than the hotel cafe. The room itself was good. Had a rain shower head above the whirlpool tub, both the bed and the sofa (sleeper) rooms had flat screen TV's. One TV had a DVD, the other a VCR. The balcony was spacious - a nice table and 4 chairs were provided. I'd go back to this hotel, not sure what it's like during summer season, but for a quiet and relaxing getaway it worked great.

I had to repeat back everything to make sure I understood her.

There are two large outdoor pools and an indoor pool. We liked the heated activity pool. They also have a fitness center which we did not get to use. On almost every floor there are washers, dryers, vending machines, and ice machines. We got to the hotel around 11 AM Monday and our room wasn't quite ready yet. Brian, the manager on duty, took our cell phone number and called us when the room was ready. The room that we were assigned (120) was very spacious and really nice.

We have a 6 year old and a 2 year old. The 2 year old didn't want to go to the beach at all. She just wanted to go in the kiddie pool. And the 6 year old wanted to do both the beach and the pool. The pool has a small slide and a larger curvy slide. It has currents (not too strong) that carry you around the edges of the pool. It is really a ton of fun. My husband and I really enjoyed our time in the pool with the kids. A really nice touch is that they give each of you a pool card (we received 4) and you turn it in to receive a clean towel. Then when you are done with the towels, you turn them in to get your card back. It's really nice having a clean, dry towel every time you go to the pool. During the week there wasn't much of an issue with getting a chair. We never sat in the chairs anyway so we just threw all of our towels on to one chair. On Saturday I did see a small line waiting before the pool opened at 9am. So weekends might be a bit more crowded. The rooms are spacious. We had 2 queen beds. Then another room has a pull-out couch. Our 6 year old slept on the couch . We brought our own crib (yes, my husband tears it down and sets it up.). We put that in the room with the couch. Put the kids to bed early which was nice. The beds were comfortable. We were on the 11th floor. The maids on our floor were very attentive. I requested extra towels and they delivered them within a half hour. Our rooms and towels were changed every day. Never had any issues with unclean rooms. The shower could have used a little more power but probably an energy conserving type.

The set-up of this hotel is great. The indoor pool is located just a few yards from the Corral Reef Restuarant. Therefore, the kids can swin in the pool and the adults can enjoy a few cocktails while keeping their eyes on the children. The rooms were very clean and beds are very comfortable and have nice sheets (not the usual sandpaper type sheets at most hotels). The maids seemed to sense when we would be gone for a few hours and when we returned our room was again spotless. In my mind, with or without kids, this is the best hotel in Ocean City. We can't wait to come back this summer! During the summer, this place is awesome. There is a kids activity pool that features a water slide, lazy river, water jets and a mini slide for the really young kids. The other pool is more geared to the adults and has a pool bar and grille. In both pools, there are plenty of wait staff to take your drink and food orders. And as a bonus, this hotel is right on the boardwalk. We literally park our cars when we get here and do not get into them the entire time we are here. You can walk to many attractions and restaurants and if we need to travel someplace, the hotel staff will get you a cab in minutes! Trust me taking a cab is the way to go in this town.

We were on the ninth floor(highest for southern view) and the 2nd suite over from the oceanfront. Two double beds in bedroom with TV armoire and VCR, additional dresser, side chair, large closet with mirroed doors.

Living room had a comfy sofa, reading chair and ottoman another TV armoire with DVD player and a table with four chairs. Full kitchen with everything you would need to make a meal. The view from the balcony was one of the best I've had while in OC. You could fully see and hear the ocean, as well as the bay on the other side. We a had a wonderful view of the city all the way to the inlet and over to Assautegue. On clear days you could see the ponies. The city was so pretty lit up at night. See pictures but please forgive my poor picture taking abilities. The indoor pool as a perfect 80 degrees everyday and was a nice way to warm up after a cool evening stroll on the boardwalk. All staff was attentive and friendly. Housekeeping keep our room spotless. One of the best parts is that they participate in a enviromental preservation program. If you hang your towels up they leave the same ones in the room(our maid even refolded and made them look pretty again everyday). Sheets are changed every three days and after checkouts of course. This saves water and detergent and it something that I think every hotel should do. We tried the pool cafe for an afternoon snack and it was very good. Ordered som appys and drinks and it was delivered promptly and our server was very sweet. Even though they were almost full we never had a problem with elevators or parking.

The location is ideal, there is no question about that. But the suite itself doesn't really live up to expectations, i.e.it's not as nice as the pictures on the website. I will say this though, the bed was VERY comfortable, and the bathroom was pretty big for a hotel. The housekeeper did a good job every day, but the hotel should have a broom in the closet for guests to use to sweep up the sand. Also, there were dish towels but no dish RAGS....no huge deal, but I found that quite odd.

The clerk saw the fire in my eyes and realized that we never received that message since we were in Pennyslvania for the previous three days due to our daughter's wedding. \"Not to worry\" she told us as they had arranged for us to stay at the Holiday Inn next door for the same low rate of $61 for an ocean front balcony room. Needless to say, I was a little wary, but the desk clerk assured us that we would have a terrific room and that the price would be honored. Once we arrived at the Holiday Inn, the clerk told me twice that I was getting a steal. And a steal it was indeed! We had a suite which included a combination sitting room and dining area, a full kitchen including pots, pans, and dishes, a huge bedroom with a jacuzzi, and a balcony overlooking the ocean from the 11th floor and yes, all for the agreed upon price of $61 per night.

A very loud group of happy hour guests at 7pm in the bar area pretty much made it inappropriate for my 7 year old to swim in the pool.

I have done this twice before. There is no place for special requests on the website, so I called one week before our stay to request a room between the 7th and 14th floor, preferably a corner. This is the same arrangement I have made twice before, and the staff graciously honored that request each time. This time, upon arrival, I was given the option of a corner room on the first floor, or a smaller room on the second floor. Both of these rooms are directly in front of the swimming pools. On the first floor there were people walking around on the patio directly outside the room! Having no other choice, I opted for the 2nd floor, where we endured the screams of children in the kiddie pool until 6:00 pm. We hoped for peace at night, then had to call staff to remove teenagers from the \"closed\" pool area after dark. After several unsatisfactory conversations with the staff, including the manager on duty, I informed them we would be checking out the next day, since they would not provide us with the room I thought had been booked. I was then told we could not have the room because the people in it decided to stay longer. Last year, we asked to stay longer, and were told we would have to move to another room, which we did. Why did the staff not make these people move to another room??? The staff was completely indifferent to our comfort, and obviously did not value us a customers. The next day, we checked out without getting an apology from anyone, then had to go to the Ocean City department of tourism to find new lodging. We also went on a nighttime beach walk to see if the corner rooms from the 7th to 14th floors were occupied, and it appeared many were not. Two days of our vacation was ruined by the lazy and disrespectful Holiday Inn staff, any of whom could have exerted a little effort to put us into the type of room I rquested.

The children loved the pool with all the slides and spent hours on end enjoying it. Yes, as the previous traveler stated there is a problem with people waiting on line two hours prior to pool opening to take the best chairs and tables. I don't know why she had to add the \"chubby\" people comment .... that's ridiculous and malicous. Anyway... the kiddie pool was very busy, but it's expected during July and August.... if it gets too crowded the beach is just steps away and there is an adult pool as well. The pools opened at 9 and closed at 6. I think that's a bit late to open and early to close, but I figure it's due to the fact that they have pool side rooms. Never waited at the pool side bar... sat my Chubby Ars down in a chair and used the waitress service... yes it was a little slow, but hey your on vacation. Only complaint about the bar service was that the drinks were very weak. When I asked them to spike it up they charged $2.00 on top of the 6$ for another shot. As far as the room goes, everyone is going to have a different experience..... In a large hotel there's going to be some that have a problem. We on the other hand had a lovely King/jacuzzi oceanfront suite. Everything seemed clean. The bed was delightful... linens crisp, great mattress and a lot of fluffy pillows. Our two children slept on the sleeper sofa and said it wa cozy. Loved the fact that they had their own room and their on DVD and TV. Hubby and I enjoyed some privacy while they were busy in the living room. Nice kitchen. Everything you could possible need, even down to a blender. We enjoyed the shower head, but could see how one would not enjoy the fact that you can't adjust it... I think they call it a rainfall head or something. Kids ate free with paying adult at the pool side and in the restaurant. Had breakfast on the last day and it was very good and reasonable. Pool side menu is very reasonably priced and loved that the kids ate free! (I guess they made it up on the drinks LOL). Not crazy about the indoor pool being right next to the open (atrium type) restaurant. I was a little turned off of the smell of chlorine prior to eating. Once your in there you don't notice it any longer. Great for the rainy day we had on Friday. They also have a small game room and they post activities for the children throughout the hotel. If you want a hotel on the boardwalk and it's important to have a nice pool and facilities for the children... this is the best place. I walked up and down that boardwalk and there in nothing that comes close. Now if you don't care to be on the boardwalk then for the same money go to the Hilton ocean front. Last year we stayed at the Park Place which has been rated #2 for the last year or two and were absolutely miserable with that horrible pool. The locating is great (very busy part of the b.w.), the rooms were very small, but clean. But when the children have had enough of the beach and want to have fun at a nice pool and you go to that street facing little (not so clean) pool... well it was a drag. So this year we went for the big bucks and you get what you pay for (although all OC hotels are overpriced in season). It killed me to pay $425 a nigth plus tax for a H.I., but it was worth it because it had everything we wanted in a family getaway. If we didn't require the nice pool and only wanted the beach and location then there would be other choices. The Holiday Inn Suites was wonderful.

We had originally booked three nites at the Quality Inn Boardwalk next door but found it to be such a dump upon arrival that we walked over begging for a vacancy. The friendly counter clerk claimed she had only one available\u2013a two room suite that was almost 3 times the cost of what we had planned to spend originally. The place was gorgeous though and, after a long day of travel, we decided to stay. Our room was equipped with an older big screen TV in the living area, a complete kitchen, a very cool jacuzzi in the bedroom, a nicely tiled bathroom with a double shower and great views on three sides. I\u2019ve been coming to OC for years and this is by far the nicest place I\u2019ve seen. But...there were some things I did not like. The bathroom shower had these cheap pinpoint shower heads that cannot be adjusted so if youve gotten too much sun, taking a shower can hurt. A recliner in the living room seemed old, worn and hard to operate. When I put my hand down on the inside in search of a control lever, I discovered goop and crumbs that had not been cleaned. The balcony, bed headboards, phone and TV remote also seemed grungy. One TV remote was missing completely and I had to ask for new batteries for the one I had. The soda machine in the vending room was broken. And I found it odd how they put a washer and dryer in the vending room \u2013the dryer kept the place too warm and melted the chocolates dispensed by the candy machine. The indoor pool seemed nice though and was thoughtfully laid out with the Coral Reef restaurant/bar just next to it. Although while we were having dinner there at about 9 pm one evening the pool was full of kids yelling \u201cMarco-Polo\u201d at each other. The outside pools were overly crowded and I watched with disdain from our balcony each morning as chubby people with tattoos would claim entire rows of lounge chairs for their comrades who wouldnt show up until later in the day. Although there were signs asking guests not to do this, nobody on staff challenged the practice. The outside pool bar was chaotic as well. I spent about 10 minutes being completely ignored one afternoon before being able to place an order. While waiting, I couldnt help but to grimace as I watched the cook run his hands along his hair and sweaty neck, get a dirty ladder out from under the counter to stand on, put it back and then proceed to use his bare hands scooping up food to put on plates. I didnt see anyone behind the counter wash their hands the whole time I was there. The food was all pretty good though as OC standards go\u2013just don\u2019t watch it being made.. Our big gripe though was the water coming out of the bathroom ceiling starting on the second day. This seems to be a common problem here. A call down to maintenance before we went to the beach for the day should have resolved it, but we returned later to a bathroom with gunk all over the toilet and floor from an apparent attempted repair...yet the waterfall from the ceiling continued to flow. Fearing it was 'toilet water', I called the front desk at 6pm to report the ongoing flood and was assured that maintenance would be right up....but I did not hear anything until about an hour later when three latina housekeepers came to the door to offer me extra towels. When I asked about the flood, they radioed for help and then explained the maintenance guy was working on the problem at a different location or something...I don\u2019t know.... Anyway, the maintenance guy finally shows up about \u00bd hour after that and explained that he needed to replace some pipes in the ceiling the next day. Apparently the family on the floor above us had been instructed not to use their shower at all until the repairs were made\u2013and no other rooms were available for anyone to move to. So, the next morning we got up and just decided to go home a day early. I just could not justify spending $450/nite for a room without unfettered access to a clean, working bathroom and did not want to have to relocate elsewhere. Manager Brian was a good guy about it all though...apologized and comped me a nite for the trouble. All in all though, this is a nice place with a good location and a friendly staff. I would really like to see the management be more proactive though at these rates and pay attention to details of maintenance, housekeeping and good customer service. The Quality Inn Boardwalk next door at one point (in the not so distant past) was the gem of the boardwalk but has since been driven into the ground by seemingly uncaring management. The jury is still out on the Holiday Inn though\u2013hopefully the right people will recognize the incredible potential of the place, work out the kinks and have us all not wanting to stay anywhere else.

Maintanence came and fixed the curtain bar, but there was more leaking on our check out day and there was dirt all over the tub from either the leaking or maintanence in the tub to fix it. There was also the parking problem that everyone mentioned- both my inlaws and my family had cars there, and we were originally charged for having more than 2 adults in the room, so we expected to get 2 parking passes. They were not able to give more than 1 pass, so we parked on the street. They did remove the charge for the additional people in the room though, so we were happy with that. The pool area was nice, very crowded in the kids part, but always clean in the morning and the towels were clean and warm. The restaurants were clean and the staff was very nice and helpful, the food was better than I expected it to be. In the end, they did not charge us for one night plus tax because of the bathroom issue, so I am pleased with how the issue was resolved, but I am surprised they aren't keeping up the hotel better than this.

Make sure to get an oceanview because the view from the balcony was amazing. We had 2 queen beds in our room, and although they weren't spectacular they were clean and there was a TV there and we hooked up the dvd player from the living room and watched movies at night. The kitchen was outstanding with a full refrigerator, stove, microwave, and dishwasher we saved a lot of money we would have spent eating out. Then there was the bathroom, which was extremely clean, had dual sinks and a jacuzzi included, the jacuzzi was amazing especially after a long day walking the boardwalk. The living room was also very nice with a dining room table a TV with a DVD player sofa and matching sofa chair. As an added bonus high-speed internet is included at no additional cost, which for a weeklong trip is becoming an essential. There are 2 outdoor pools, 1 for kids and 1 for adults, as well as an outdoor hot tub. We only got to go once because of cooler weather. The kids pool is very nice although it is very busy. The adult pool is very simple, but was very uncrowded. Both of the pools overlook the ocean which is right on the otherside of the boardwalk from the Holiday Inn. The Hilton Suites has gotten a lot of good reviews; however the location of the Holiday Inn is a lot better than the Holiday Inn especially when it comes to access to the boardwalk. The Holiday Inn is on a quieter part of the boardwalk then if it was closer to the pier; however it is still close enough that walking to the end isn't out of the question. I would also recommend getting up to ride bikes when it is permitted early in the morning.

These are not your average balconies - you can easily spend time on them watching the pools and the beach. We had no problems with our stay and would be happy to return. One thing to note is the hotel does charge your credit card for the full deposit immediately when you make the reservation. In our case that was the full charge (tax included) for our one night.

Not sure how other hotels in OC handle reservations, but for what it's worth I recommend reading the fine print carefully when you reserve to make sure you don't authorize a pre-check-in charge; if they try to get you for a night and you've tried to give more than 24 hours notice of cancellation, tell them you didn't sign a contract and that you intend to dispute the charge with your credit card company as an unauthorized charge and contact the Better Business Bureau to comlain.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "va", "Title": "\u201cGreat time!\u201d", "Author": "lisa111", "ReviewID": "UR7284835", "Content": "We stayed for 4 days starting April 1.

As they dumped all 2000 people onto Atlantic Ave., it was found to be a false alarm. The next day we requested a couple extra bath towels from our housekeeping staff. When our room was done that day we didn't have two extra towels, we had none, NONE...We had to call the front desk to get towels to shower that evening. We never got any so we went to the front desk to get them an hour and a half after calling for them.

Again for yet another false alarm resulting in 2000 people outside on the boardwalk this time. Next day, again another towel issue and going to the front desk to pick some up. We were on the fourth floor, and our ice machine was out of order and we had only one dryer for laundry. Our room vents were completely packed with dust and mold and the furniture had stains on it. It seemed as though none of the furnishings had been cleaned. The top of the refrigerator was disgusting.

We usually rent a condo in the summertime, as most hotels are extremely expensive. We used to frequently stay at the Nassau in the Oceanfront building. Since the Nassau is no longer there, we decided to try the newer Holiday Inn because we had admired it from the outside. We fell in love with it! The kids love it too! There is a wonderful indoor pool and bar in the pool area (the kids enjoyed swimming, while my husband watched games at the bar enjoying a drink). Mom could take advantage of some quite time enjoying the jacuzzi tub bath. It was heavenly!! The rooms are very clean and decorated so nicely. The room service was excellent, the food was excellent, the staff was excellent, and I could go on and on.... One other nice feature was that in the vending area on each floor, there were a washer and dryer which the guests are free to use (providing our own detergent of course). Since most places have coin-operating laundry, I thought this was very convenient! They also have a great exercise room as well as a little arcade. It's a great off-season place!!

I recommend it wholeheartedly. With minor improvements -- most of which are in any event necessary -- the owners could easily flag the property a Hilton or Westin, and really distinguish it in the Ocean City lineup. However, I can't give the hotel 5 stars until it makes those minor improvements. Most are merited by the high rates charged, and the balance I'd gladly pay for in a $25 or $50 higher rate, to get the 5 star experience that I want for the very little time I can get away with my family every year. First, the arrival experience and parking services needs to be upgraded. I expect a property at this level to offer a doorman, a bellman, and valet parking. With the exception of bellman on-call (i.e., not available as you pull up), the property offers none of these services. The problem is compounded by the fact that the lobby is a flight up from the port cochere, leaving a first-time arrival parked in front of the door, warning lights blinking, with no clear idea of where to go and no one to help him. (Not just me, either ... the three people to pull up after me all seemed to have the same perplexity.) Second, the breakfast was only the standard Holiday Inn bill of fare. This is totally unacceptable, as that menu is very limited in choices, low-end in terms of cuisine, and appears to use (sub)standardized ingredients provided by Sysco or some other restaurant mass wholesaler. A great hotel breakfast is a key piece of the upscale travel experience -- this property has no trouble putting on a good lunch and dinner, so they really should be able to offer a first rate breakfast, including both more healthier options and more indulgent options. For now, a guest has more and tastier options at the Denny's-type greasy spoon two blocks in from the beach than one has at the hotel dining room, and that's not right. Third, breakfast and lunch were understaffed upon our mid-week arrival and got worse into the weekend. The servers were pleasant and efficient, but simply had too many tables to cover. Fourth, there are a few signs of cheapness in the amenities which ought to be done away with. The pools are VERY overchlorinated; a real issue when your kids want to spend six hours a day in the pool. It saves management a few dollars (less filtration and cleaning, less fresh water added, and less testing) but it is definitely not worth it from the standpoint of a guest. And while chlorine leaves a literal bad taste in one's mouth, the gameroom pricing does so figuratively -- $1.00 to play Pacman, forthsooth! The bath towels are undersized and no bathrobes are provided; big towels and bathrobes complement the inroom jacuzzi nicely. After the above suggestions, I do want to note a nice little thing done right, not necessarily noted by commentators below: the hotel provides a full expanded basic cable lineup (the local Comcast analog tier, plus HBO). This is SO VERY welcome -- one of my abiding frustrations with travel is how hotels will spend millions on frills of little consequence, but will not spring for the 5 cents per guest per day it costs to put FX, TBS, USA, Nickolodeon, the Cartoon Channel, and Sci-Fi Channel on the television.", "Date": "September 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Holiday Inn Suites on 17th st\u201d", "Author": "dreamcycle", "ReviewID": "UR3933451", "Content": "Just back from our stay., we stayed (1) night, on the top floor (14th), only like 10 rooms on that floor.

The 3 pools were clean and the water very warm. The poolside service was exceptional. Getting to the beach was a matter going down maybe 15 steps and the beach area had life gaurds. The room was exceptionally large, even the balcony was a good size. The location was perfect. You won't find a nicer hotel on the boardwalk. The one and only downfall was restuarant due to the excetionally long wait to get breakfast. Other than that the place was perfect!", "Date": "August 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island NY", "Title": "\u201cA Great Place\u201d", "Author": "deadheadted", "ReviewID": "UR3740451", "Content": "This is the second time we stayed at the Holiday Inn Hotels & suites in Ocean City. Yes, the price for a peak season ocean view room is close to $380.00 per night !, but you could not find a cleaner more profesionally run facility on the boardwalk. Our suite was cleaned everyday before 10:30am, this is after we left the room around 9:15 am. Friendly & professional staff from the conciege \"Joe\" to waitstaff \"Lauren\". The price is worth it when you consider the fact that every thing from the kidde pool to adult side pool bar are effciently operated with no sign of confusion. Additionally the Hotel Restaurant prepares above average food and for those who do not want an \"all you can eat\" option, it is worth the chance to visit the restaurant. The only glitchs are really the result of popularity, i.e. the crowding at the kiddie pool, especially the habit of some guests of \"reserving\" poolside lounges, at 9:00 am and then spending the next 5 hours at the beach! Anyhow, this seeems to be more of an guest rudeness issue not as a hotel operational defect. Recommend this for the central location (17th Street ) close enough to walk down to the \"action \" but far enough away to not have to participate if you choose.

I had to post it though! My new husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon week. Despite some comments I read about Ocean City not being a typical honeymoon site, we decided to go anyway. This hotel was the perfect choice! Your honeymoon is what you make of it. If you like to have fun and want some nightlife as well, then this is a great place for it. This hotel was both romantic and practical. It has a great restaurant downstairs, a great view and every room has a big jacuzzi tub. We have kids and this would be a great place to bring a family as well. It has a full kitchen including a full size refrigerator and dishwasher! The staff was wonderful and we just had a great time! I can't say enough about how good our stay was! We will return! I have to say the best time to go is before the summer rush; we were there the week before Memorial Day and we left the weekend of. It was a perfect time because we got the before Summer rates, it was quiet at the fun center's, and nice crowds at the nightclubs, plus we got to party the last night with the incoming crowd.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Hotels and Suites Ocean City", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d223414-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Hotels_and_Suites_Ocean_City-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "$102 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1701 Baltimore Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "223414", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cd/66/a6/located-directly-on-the.jpg"}}
