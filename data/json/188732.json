I finally found a bath tub that had adequate size. Most hotels around the world seem to be shrinking the size of their bathtubs and I loved the fact that Le Meurice, had good nice, large bathtubs that I could enjoy. The rooms too were generous with space and I appreciated that. Of course the flavour of the hotel is traditional and the decor is in keeping with that; but for me it completely enhanced my experience of Paris. Paris came alive for me as I stayed at Le Meurice. Their in room dining was superlative and so was their check in and check out process. The challenging parts were - concierge, not stepping out of their way to respond to questions and the lack of a proper business centre in the hotel - its difficult to call one 28 inch mac with a printer and some prepaid card (felt really stupid using a prepaid card in a top five star hotel) to connect to the internet. Of course I had to do that because I needed print outs; but otherwise you can connect from your room. I have still not at all understood why top luxury hotels do not offer WiFi connectivity free of charge - it beats me.

My husband called down to the Reception Desk, spoke to a very helpful gentleman named Stephen, who said he would be happy to show us an \"Executive\" room & we could move there the next day if we liked it. The \"Executive\" room was lovely & when we went to pay our bill at the end of our stay, there was no extra cost to us for the upgraded room. All of the staff were wonderful, eager to please and very helpful. The Concierge were great & so helpful. The rooms were immaculately kept & turn down service each night was excellent.

We\u2019ve stayed here after being in the Middle East in very luxurious hotels. Also this was the first time I didn\u2019t stay in Le Bristol in Paris. For the purpose of our visit (leisure), the location was extremely fabulous. We arrive very early, and we already knew the room was going to be ready, but received all our stuff. Also found the dinner reservations we arranged with the concierge before arrival were ready. We bought tickets for the Louvre at the hotel. This is good, as you skip the long lines at the famed museum. Of course Le Meuruce is in walking distance. We stayed through AMEX Platinum. I didn\u2019t know if I received an upgrade, but the room was nice and comfortable. The bed was ultra comfortable. Also cleanliness was a strong point. The d\u00e9cor was very French and elegant. The toiletries were good too. The layout is not the typical hotel layout, but made us feel as in an apartment. Breakfast is different from the major European hotels (including major European hotels) as it is not buffet. They have two versions: continental (bread basically) and American which is the continental plus eggs. It is very tasty and high quality. Breakfast is served at their luxury restaurant and in an informal setting. We preferred the formal one, more comfortable. During our stay we had a couple of bumps: a missed wake up call, problems with a reservation and a rude waiter. At the moment I found this unacceptable at a famed ultra-luxurious Paris jewel. However we complained each time and were heard. Actually, once the manager of guest relations apologized in persons and sent delicious macarons to the room. After a year, and because of my job (at the factory), I understand that if you have 99% of great service (impossible in an industry to reach 100%), you\u2019ll have trouble with one of every 100 guests. I guess we were than 1%. Also, after a year of being in all kind of hotels and complaining (not five stars of course), when they hear you are not happy, not everywhere seem to worry and do something. So, when you do something wrong and try to make for it, is something that \u2013although expected- should not be granted. So now I\u2019m fully able to appreciate the extra effort. The only thing I would change is the toilet in the room. Usually this kind of hotels has a bidet, but is understanding they don\u2019t because of the size of the room. To compensate this, they could have TOTO (or Japanese) toilette. Then a bidet would be totally unnecessary.

Most interestingly it boasts a ceiling piece by Philippe Starck's daughter inspired by a former resident, Salvador Dali. The rooms are cosy and elegant - this hotel exudes old aristocratic French style. One of my favourite hotels in London is the Dorchester and as a sister hotel, Le Meurice is perfect. My only minor critcisms are the local area - which can't be helped - many tourists pack the walkways making it difficult to get out (although this is compensated by being close to the lovely Tuileries garden). The other minor gripe is the price of drinks which is really exorbitantly expensive and the lack of choice regarding breakfast. However, the plus points do really outweigh the negative points and if I am in Paris again, there is only one place to stay:- Le Meurice!

So for a room service waiter to tell us, after he has brought us our dinner, and received a tip, with a sarcastic smile, \"merci mon grand\" (\"thank you my good man\") created more than a slight ripple effect in my beat-up body. That he should feel authorised to judge that I had been offered this trip by some rich parent (my parents are not rich, nor would they ever dream of giving me anything like this if they were) is bad enough. That he should go on to express it, and with full sarcasm to boot, completely took my breath away.

The friendliness of the staff seems genuine, matched with a perfect balance of professionalism. You feel you are being taken care of from the very start and up to the last minute of your stay, as it should be in such an expensive place. The entrance hall, foyer and common areas are worthy of a historical chateau, but not stuffy in any way, and immaculately clean, even fragrant.

We got the package for less a night than the rack room rate. Our welcome and treatment in the hotel by all staff was charming. We ate lunch in the Le Meurice restaurant - a memorable meal in a lovely room. The staff were great - skilled, relaxed & warm. The food was excellent & the wine recommended was superb & a long way from the most expensive available. We also ate in the Dali where the food was a little more casual but the atmosphere was very pleasant & the staff were also very nice. Our room although newly renovated was dull & not roomy - the bathroom was huge. Unfortunately, our room had a connecting door with another room on both sides. The sound proofing was fairly good but at this price & particularly if we'd paid the rack rate of 900+ euro a night I don't want to hear someone else's noise. An upgrade was not offered (it was suggested as a possibility at the time of booking & on the website ) but they did seem busy. The flowers listed in the package were not in the room & when my husband spoke to the guest service director they immediately sent up a lovely bouquet. There was also a problem with a simple room service order - corrected immediately & with charm. We were given a late check out which was much appreciated & very useful as our train was after 5pm. We spent, with the room & the grand lunch & a casual evening meal, a great deal of money. If you can afford it as a matter of course or if like us you can budget for it as part of a special occasion then go to Le Meurice & have a lovely time. I wouldn't recommend it if you were going to be stressed about the money - everything costs a fortune - 9 euro for a small bottle of evian in the room - 26 for an ordinary sandwich - 20 euro for a 1 days wifi.

The first was that there was some kind of renovation going on so I was woken up by really loud banging at 10am the first morning I was there. I didn't complain as it was quite late in the day but the next morning it started at 8am. That is 2am NYC time so I was pretty unhappy but when I called the front desk they were totally useless. They said they didn't know where the construction was happening and that it couldn't be in their building. (Then they said someone was putting up curtains) They later called me to discuss it and that woke me up again, even though I had the \"don't disturb\" sign on my door. Not sure why the noise was such a mystery to the front desk and manager. The housekeeping staff was on the floor and heard it too. No apology, no free fruit basket, No note. No explanation. Nothing. Not what you expect in one of the finest hotels in the world. The second problem was that there was a cold snap and we had no heating in our room for two days. We called and they sent someone to our room (which always seems to be their response. They send someone who can't help and then he has to make follow up calls) but in fact it's all managed from a computer somewhere. So I don't quite know why they didn't notice it to begin with and why they couldn't just fix it without having to send someone. So not disasters but not the seemless incredible service one expects.

Once inside...wow...the hotel was beautiful and the atmosphere, due to a mix of traditional opulent elegance and modern touches, was fantastic. Reception was professional and every aspect of their behaviour reflected a top smart attitude. Not sure if it was genuine kindness or \"leading hotel one\" but for sure it was faultless. We were upgrade to the Marco Polo Suite and, as soon as we entered the room, we remained without words for some minutes: the room was big, elegant, very frenchy, with an open space including sitting room, bedroom and bath. Ten minutes after our arrival in the room, a bottle of complimentary champagne was delivered. Not the common Moet but an elegant (yes again) bottle of Louis Roederer. Every detail in the room was top notch. You got the impression that they choose the best for everything: Penhaligon toiletries, 5 kinds of waters and 4 champagnes in the mini bar, excellent room amenities and fantastic ambience fragrances in all the public areas. Since I am a passionate of hotels, I am always very critic against hotel services but here everything, really, was top. Concierge, especially Sam, and Adeline at reception worth a special prize. For sure the hotel is expensive, even if we got a very special deal. But you are in a masterpiece of French hospitality, steps away from the best Paris has to offer.

I have stayed at the George Cinq, Ritz and De Crillon and my review compares Le Meurice with these. Firstly, Incentives: 1) The hotel has a great location with great views. On the Rue de Rivoli, opposite the Jardins du Tuileries and diagonally across from the Musee Louvre, it has an excellent location, with the Tuileries Metro stop less than a 5 minute walk away, 20 minutes through the Tuileries will put you past the Place de la Concorde and along the Champs Elysee. Shopping is on the street behind, with Rue St. Honore and the Place de Vendome round the corner. Arguably, for view, the De Crillon has a more enviable position right on the Place de la Concorde but the Meurice came in a close second, certainly trumping 4 Seasons George Cinq and the Ritz. 2) The bathroom was generously proportioned (stayed in a superior room), with twin sinks and a clean, refined, modern twist on Louis VI design. 3) The in-house restaurant is superlative. A bit of a foodie, I try to take in the new recommendations by locals and Michelin (a reliable guide for french food) and was not disappointed by the eponymous restaurant. It is everything a 3 star Michelin should be: elegant, attentive service and excellent food with an element of creativity. With more and more fine establishments appearing on the scene, 3 stars isn't just about service or doing a traditional menu well, there must be more. There must be creativity with cuisine and Le Meurice delivers. 4) The service is absolutely the best I've ever had at an European hotel. Bar none. Friendly, cheerful but respectful, the Meurice has got it right. The George Cinq was too large a hotel for the staff ratio and felt impersonal and perfunctory; the Ritz and De Crillon were abysmal with snotty, bad service for those who are not completely fluent in french (I'm capable of basic conversation but not much more at this point in time). Even my french speaking friends from Montreal say the snobbery in these 2 hotels was insufferable, almost as if you should feel grateful for them \"letting you\" stay there. But the Meurice was warm, everyone attempted french first but smoothly swapped to english if you weren't following or looked lost. Though they only do that to those who look or can speak a bit of french I'm told. Otherwise, fluent english all the way. The housekeeping service could not be flawed and was always smiling and polite. The concierge was somewhat solemn faced but very polite and efficient. Not the best, but certainly not marring of the experience by any means. Discentives: There was only 1 that stood out really. The rooms were very tired looking. Unfortunately the pictures you see on the website do not at all correspond to what you get at the Meurice. The photos taken by some other contributors are a far better bet. Even the colour scheme of the rooms are different from the images on the website. Unfortunate for a hotel that was supposed to have undergone fairly recent renovation. If one has to, the fact that the toilet was not in its own enclosed alcove, was another point. But this is a very old establishment in a historic city. Most such places will not have the spacious bathrooms with alcoves etc. like you'd get in say New York or Tokyo. But the shower is separate from the bathtub. Don't scoff, you'll be amazed how luxurious this point is in old European cities. All in all, for the price (5 star famous Parisian hotel category), Le Meurice gets the highest marks amongst the lot from me. I was made to feel welcome and comfortable and would definitely recommend this ahead of the George Cinq, Ritz or De Crillon if you are booking a standard or superior room. If you are booking a suite, the Ritz, George Cinq and Plaza Athenee are top bets for your money.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corsicana, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOne of the very best in the World\u201d", "Author": "k-myers", "ReviewID": "UR36223557", "Content": "My wife and I stayed in Paris for 2 nights on our way to Normandy for the 65th anniversary of D-Day.

There was also a well-stocked minibar, and off the foyer were two doors. One lead to a huge, gorgeous bathroom. Double sinks were set into a slab of grey marble, which also surrounded the enormous bath tub, six feet long with a waterfall spout and hand-held shower spray. There was also a very large walk-in shower, and the toilet and bidet were in a separate area as well. Everywhere were piles of thick, blindingly-white towels. The bedroom itself was perhaps a bit smaller than we expected, but extremely quiet and comfortable. The king bed was heaven, and across from it sat an antique desk, above which a flatscreen TV was mounted on the wall. There was a small table adorned with a beautiful orchid and 2 small chairs in the corner. A set of double-paned windows looked across the rue Castiglione to the Westin Hotel, and when closed they muffled all city noise beautifully. We could not have been happier. Room Service breakfasts are expensive and worth every penny. Fantastic coffee, an elegant carafe of fresh o.j. and a terrific assortment of fresh rolls and pastry are served on fine china and linen. You'll be offered many delicious tiny jars of preserves and spreads from Fauchon, the famous gourmet shop not far away near the Madelaine. The stewed prunes I ordered arrived tipped with real gold leaf! This was just one of the special little touches that made our stay unforgettable. The hotel's location cannot be topped. The Louvre (and Tuileries metro stop) are an easy stroll down Rue de Rivoli. Up the road are the Grand and Petit Palais,where the former currently has a fantastic Warhol retrospective. Around the corner from the hotel is Place Vendome, and just beyond that is the Opera and easy access to world-class shopping. The famous Faubourg St. Honore is close by, as are the enormous department stores au Printemps and Galeries Lafayette. There are many bars, cafes and restaurants within easy reach, including Angelina Tea Room virtually next door. There are 2 restaurants within the hotel; le Dali and le Meurice. le Dali functions as a lounge (and really part of the lobby as well). We found the most entertaining thing in all of Paris was to sit in le Dali, order a $30 cocktail, and watch the comings-and-goings of the rich and famous. The clientele is generally chic and connected and we loved guessing which Broadway star was sitting by the piano bar, and if that young waif might be a supermodel cozying up to a rock star in the corner. By all means do not miss enjoying breakfast in the drop-dead gorgeous Restaurant le Meurice. Enormous chandeliers,gleaming marble floors, a frescoed ceiling and polished silver await you here. A Michelin-starred chef also serves up some numbingly-expensive lunches and dinners. There is a lovely Spa onsite. You'll be welcome to use it at no charge, a real rarity in a hotel of this calibre. When we stopped in the place was almost empty. There are dry saunas, a \"hammam\" (steam room) and delightful Jacuzzi here, as well as a small patio and a well-equipped workout room. Service was flawless, from Doormen to Housekeepers, there is a feeling of quiet efficiency and discretion throughout. I would not consider staying anywhere else on the \"Rive Droite\". It's all here, it's all superb, and we felt we received the very best value possible in pricy Paris.....we paid 380 Euros per night (the rack rate on our door quoted 880 Euros), and it was absolutely worth it. le Meurice is truly special in every way, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

I planned long and hard for my 5th anniversary. Having spent hours researching, I finally decided upon the Meurice. Partly due to the rave reviews, the Starck interior of the lobby and the promotional prices. I really should have been vigligant of the discounts as they appear to the only hotel in this price range offering promotions at the time of my bookings. Location - yes, it is a short walk away from the Louvre and the Metro. But along the busy Rue de Rivoli there are also tacky souvenir shops and other lesser hotel establishments. It is far less grand than the surrouding areas of the Athenee, Park Hyatt or the Ritz. Rooms - I booked a Grand Deluxe room. It was gloomy without much natural light. The room was a long elongated shape so i feel as if i am sleeping on a corridor. The TV clearly was an afterthought as it was 2 ft above the sofa and there is no way you can watch it from the bed even if swiel it to full angle. The windows overlook a 'courtyard', but it was sparse and plain (nothing like the courtyard at Ritz). Disappointing. House keeping was most disappointing, used cups were never clean or replaced (i stayed for 4 nights). Items of clothing went missing and never found (hotel offered me a reimbursement - but still it should have never happened in the 1st place). Requests for hot water were forgotten. the TV and modem did not work the first time. The niggles that happen at this hotel alone were more than those from other trips i have been to added together.

Le Meurice is centrally located near many of the major museums and near two Metro stops. If you use the Metro, you can easily reach any of the tourist attractions inside Paris. I have very briefly described my thoughts on various museums, attractions, and restaurants. Le Meurice - Check in was a breeze, front desk staff was friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The rooms are comfortable and spacious for a European hotel room. We opted for a courtyard view since these rooms are quieter than rooms facing Tuleries Gardens. Housekeeping was efficent. In fact, my daughter wrapped one of her stuffed animals in the bath towels, after we returned from sightseeing we made a frantic call to housekeeping and voila, housekeeping found the toy within 15 minutes. I wonder how many bath towels they had to rummage through. Absolutely no complaints regarding the hotel except prices in the minibar, bar and the restaurant. Breakfast is very expensive compared to the states (continental breakfast is 36 Euros). Water in the minibar is 9 Euros. Vodka martini in the bar is 25 Euros. Service was outstanding and the hotel well worth the price. I would highly recommend this Hotel. Paris Museums - They are all fantastic. Don't believe Froder or Frommer's when they state you can view the Louve in 1/2 days. To do the museum right you need more than one day. For the Louve we went on a Wednesday at 0930 and bought our tickets at the Carrousel du Louvre entrance ( the Carrousel du Louvre is a collection of shops with an entrance to the Louve - enter on Rivoli, the same street that Le Meurice is on); there were no lines. Your ticket allows you to return if you go outside of the Louve for meals. The Louve after 1800 was virtually deserted. Musee d'Orsay can be viewed in 1/2 a day. The restaurant in d'Orsay had great french onion soup some of the best we had in Paris. For military and history buffs don't miss the Musee de l'Armee or the Museum of the Legion of Honour and the orders of chivalry (next to d'Orsay). The Museum pass is OK if you plan to see all the museums over a set number of days, but since we were there for two weeks, the pass was not in our best interest. Paris Churches - Notre Dame is of course a must see (especially do the tower tour) but if you can make it to Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Chartres (Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres) make the 50 mile trip. Chartres is not as commercialized as Notre Dame and read up on its stained glass history. Sacre Cour is also impressive and has great views from its tower. St Chapelle, one can sit for hours viewing the various stained glass. Arc de Triomphe - is a great place to view Tour Eiffel especially at night when the Tour Eiffel turns on its blinking lights. Great history surrounds the Arc so a must see for history buffs. Catacombs - Safe, easy to get to, and alot of bones. closed on Tuesday. Berthillon - good ice cream but not the best in the world as stated in some tripadvisor reviews. The Salted Caramel is overrated but the black chocolate was fantastic. Galeries Lafayette - most prices are higher than in similar stores in the states at least that's what my wife and daughter tell me. Cheap Eats - L'As du Fallafel - fantastic fallafel and shawarma. Welcome Cafe - down the street from Le Meurice great cheap (by Paris standards) food. Many other great places to eat and see. Places to Avoid - We had poor service /attitude in two locations - Carmine and Cafe Rivoli. Driving in Paris - the city itself is crowded for driving but not any worse than driving in New York City, London, Italy, or any other major international city. Drivers are aggressive but I found more willing to let you change lanes in town than in my home town Chicago. Definitely fewer horns than in any major US city. When driving on the highways remember the left lanes are for passing not loitering like here in the states. Regarding the stereotype that the French especially Parisians are rude: this is false. Just attempt to speak French even just Bonjour and au revoir, Remember in Europe it is customary to greet the shop owner/worker and saying thank you or good bye when leaving the shop or restaurant. We don't speak French but just attempting made the vast majority of our interactions pleasant.

Another time, I asked the front desk to recommend a place we could buy a cheap curling iron since the different voltage had fried the one I brought. The gentleman looked at me in horror and said, \"Why, we should certainly have curling irons here. You needn't spend your time in Paris looking for something like that. It's our mistake for not thinking of it, but please, allow us to find you one.\" An hour later there was a brand new curling iron in our room with a note of apology for the delay. They had gone and purchased a bunch on their own to keep on hand for guests in the future! Our room was lovely and the bed the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever experienced. Every day we were surprised with a plate of different, amazing pastries. The lobby was a great combination of chic and comfortingly traditional and great for people-watching.

This person ushered us through customs, helped us retrieve our luggage and euros from the ATM and brought us right to our waiting car and driver. Thank goodness for that because there was no other way out of the airport! We arrived at the hotel in the very early a.m. and the staff was ready to greet us. We sat at the little desk in the reception area and they helped us through all of our plans in terms of museum tickets, etc.. We had planned to go to Versailles and also had made many restaurant reservations prior to our arrival. These were now in jeopardy because there were no taxis, trains or metro. The hotel was very helpful in ordering chauffered cars for us for everything. This was a huge added expense, but some of the pain was taking away by how wonderfully gracious they were in handling everything. Our room was prepared immediately and we were able to go in and rest right away. Room service was excellent, decor and cleanliness were top notch. Our view was of a courtyard which was as expected. The staff was friendly and helpful. When we had (many) technical problems with the DVD player and the stereo they came and replaced the entire system. The day we went to Versailles we were celebrating our anniversary and we returned to a lovely bottle of champagne with special treats. There are two wonderful things about this hotel: the location--can't beat it--and the staff. On our last day we were flying to Rome on an early (7 a.m.) flight. We had ordered the car for 4:30 a.m.. We came down, the car was packed and ready to go. As we were leaving, the concierge asked us if we would like him to confirm our flight to Rome. Guess what? The air traffic controllers at Orly had decided to join the transport strike. We were to be meeting some officials at the Vatican as we were renewing our wedding vows at the Vatican on Thanksgiving Day.

Location is good. The hotel doesn't have very many rooms, but the lobby is way too small. It is basicly a combination of the reception, an entry way better known as a \"couch\", the casual restaurant, and the bar. It was pretty, but I guess it could have been better enjoyed if it wasn't so crowded. I know it is cliche to say that the Parisians are rude towards Americans. But I think it is more that they don't enjoy speaking english since they are native french. We were encountered many times with arrogant staff. I am not paying over two thousand euros a night to get a cold shoulder. The suite was nice. A deluxe garden view. It was small for the price, but nevertheless very nice. It was difficult to see the garden and the eiffel tower. If you do decided to stay here, don't pay the money for the garden view. Food: Restaurant Le Meurice was great. Great food and service. It will cost you about 400 euros with wine. If you are looking for star french cuisine, look at Ducasse. He is at the Plaza, and Jules Verne at the Eiffel tower (we had Jules Verne; the view was pretty, food bland). Funny enough, the best French cuisine we had on the trip (between Paris and London) was Ducasse's Restaurant at the Dorchester in London. Back to the Meurice...skip the casual restaurant. It had a boring menu and lazy service. This hotel is beautiful. However if you enjoy fantastic service at a hotel it truly can't recommend the Meurice. Try the Park Hyatt...its at Vendome and is an understated hotel. And you can't go wrong with the Four Seasons. We booked a driver through the Meurice to give us a day tour, and he told us that he also works for the Four Seasons, and that they \"try to hard\".

I've had a large number of meals in many top class restaurants but this has to be in my top 3 ever. My 11 yo son is still telling people his langoustines were the nicest thing he has ever tasted. Finally, the location is second to none-everything you need to see is within walking distance if the weather is ok. If Le Meurice can maintain these standards there really is nowhere else to stay in Paris-and I've been to the George V. One other point which you may find useful-don't bother with Angelina's next door. Despite allegedly having the best cakes and hot chocolate in Paris, it failed again (I'd had lunch there with clients last time I was in Paris) - noisy, poor quality cakes, awful service and expensive. We had Le Meurice's afternoon tea which was everything it should have been though pricey but worth it.", "Date": "June 6, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Le Meurice", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d188732-Reviews-Le_Meurice-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$707 - $1,192*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">228 rue de Rivoli</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "188732", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ed/72/ed72923cf5ba9ad23ecb4bae1eeef0357large.jpg"}}
