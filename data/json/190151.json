Location is very central with atleast 3 metro stations in a five minutes radius. I think driving and parking would be difficult though. Also a large El Corte Inlges nearby and plenty of places for a quick breakfast. Madrid's layout is not very car friendly, so if you go by taxi after 7am allow plenty of time. If you go to Atocha train station after 8am use Metro or you will be stuck. Our room was ok, spacious with two large beds. Amenities looked like refilled so we didnt take the chance on using them. There was a bathtub which was good for our infant. Overall it was convenient and pretty decent rate to stay there, but next time would upgrade for EUR 20-30 to stay somewhere better.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cRoom smelled of cat urine and they REFUSED to let us check out!!!!\u201d", "Author": "taccoleo", "ReviewID": "UR44236744", "Content": "First of all, location is a little sketchy, but if you stay a few blocks away you'll feel MUCH safer.

To make matters worse, when Expedia contacted them about the matter, they LIED straight out and told them we never complained, when in fact, we had a one hour argument with them for a stupid proof of check out.

My travel plans can fluctuate often, and I would be able to cancel until 6PM Madrid time day-of-arrival when booking directly through Best Western. -Honors several discount rates like AAA, CAA and special internet rates (check BW website) -Extremely clean, well maintained room. One of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed at, and I travel often. Room was absolutely immaculate. -Accessible to all Madrid attractions via foot or Metro within a few minutes. -Extremely easy airport transfer using Metro. It's a quick walk to the closest stop (Plaza de Espana) -Bathroom was large by European standards; great shower pressure, nice towels. -Free WiFi and a PC in the lobby (.50 euro for 15 mins) -Efficient desk staff with decent English skills (although they did not go out of their way to make us feel welcome...) Free maps and area info, newspapers, etc at the desk. -Quiet area; Avoided the traffic and noise of staying on Gran Via, but still only 30 seconds away -Close to many restaurants, so no need to eat at the hotel. The Bad: *************** -Air Conditioning was weak. Barely cooled the room and mostly just blew warm air around. -Firm beds with only 1 pillow (but nice linens) -Our safe did not work, so we were forced to walk around Madrid with our passports, iPhones, wallets, etc which I did not think was ideal. If my Spanish was better I would have dealt with this. MY ADVICE & NOTES: *************** I would stay here again. Decent deal for around 60 euro. Book your room through Best Westerns official website rather than a 3rd party like Expedia or Hotels.com so you'll have their good cancellation policy and special rates. Be aware that they will ask for the passport of everyone staying in the room and will make copies of them; this made me a little bit weary but I think most hotels in Spain do this. Also, familiarize yourself with the location of the hotel PRIOR to arrival because it can be rather confusing since it's tucked away between two side streets.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cReliable fairly nice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "muffinshanks", "ReviewID": "UR38536677", "Content": "Nothing special here.

It is a typical Spanish design with outer rooms and inner rooms. The inner rooms surround a courtyard of sorts in most Spanish hotels but at this one, it is just a work area. When we arrived, spent from the trip, we were given a nice outer room and immediately tried to catch up on some sleep. But there was a garage-type rock band practicing at a bar across the street that made that impossible. So we switched rooms to an inner room and decided to just go out and look around. We slept like dead people that night. The next night we were out real late, enjoying the nightlife of Madrid. Got home about 3AM and chatted until 3:30. As we tried to get to sleep, at about 3:45, the inner courtyard came to life! They were crashing around down there and making so much noise I thought something was wrong. So I went to the desk to ask what was happening. The clerk was asleep so I had to wake him. He told me he couldn't hear anything, so I walked over to the door that led to the kitchen area and the noise was immediately obvious. I said, \"That noise.\" He responded that it was just the kitchen staff preparing breakfast. There were plates crashing, and people talking as loud as they cared and all of it was going out in to the courtyard and up to all the inner rooms. I asked if there was anything they could do to tone it down and the clerk looked at me like I was nuts. He told me, \"They're preparing breakfast! There is nothing we can do.\" I was pretty amazed! I returned to my room and laid in bed and listened to crashing and loud talking. We were traveling with another friend and she eventually came to our room and asked if we knew what all the noise was about. I told her, \"Yeah, they're making breakfast...\" So I went out on the streets of Madrid at 5AM and began the chore of finding new rooms for us. It was a nightmare! And there is a bonus! This hotel is at the corner of Los Libreros and a street named Calle Flor Alta. The Alta must stand for \"Get High\" because it is an unsavory little street right off the Gran Via where local junkies hang out and shoot up....serious! There were discarded syringes on the sidewalk and other things even more disgusting. Boy were we glad to get out of there!
