We had booked a Superior Room. The room we were offered was on level 2, and was a tiny airless shoebox with no windows at all. Very claustrophobic. The corridor outside the room also smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. We asked to be moved to another room.. The replacement room (which they proudly called a \"superior\" room) was slightly bigger, but also had no windows at all. At least the airconditioning reduced the level of stuffiness and and feeling of claustrophobia a bit. I wondered what the first room was, if the replacement room was supposed to be an improvement on what we had booked and paid for..... The hotel had more of the feel of a budget backpackers hostel - there were no carpets on the floors, and the bathroom did not have the amenities to which travelers these days have become accustomed (small soap, small individual bottles or sachets of shampoo and conditioner and shower gel) but rather had a dispenser of anonymous gel of some sort bolted to the wall in the shower stall. Towels were thin and threadbare, and no wash cloth or shower mat to stand on whilst drying oneself. The sheets on the bed were too small for the mattress and thus could not be tucked in properly. This resulted the the bottom sheet coming loose and rucking up around one - most uncomfortable. The breakfast options were also severely limited - one could have a hot breakfast of fried eggs with ham or turkey slices and greasy hash browns plus toast, or an Asian option of noodles and toast, or cereal plus toast. The cereals on offer were cocopops or cornflakes. The end. This was also the first hotel we found in our 20-day trip around Asia that did not offer soya milk. On the plus side, the reception staff did try to help us, and were very friendly.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bali", "Title": "\u201cjailhouse with a hotel name\u201d", "Author": "PulangBali", "ReviewID": "UR125829419", "Content": "I stayed there with my family as a transit before flying back to Bali.

It was not really a problem since I only stayed overnight.. . But for those who are claustrophobic and staying for more than 1 day, make sure you ask for a room with a window. Unlike in other similar hotels, the bathroom of Fragrance Imperial is large enough that the shower is separate from the toilet. The room comes with hot pot and complimentary drinks like bottled water and 3 in 1 coffee mix and basic toiletries like toothbrush, soap and shower cap. The room is equipped with a flat screen TV , fridge and bedside lamp A light switch is also provided by the bedside, so no need to stand up to turn off the lights. The room is generously provided with power outlets which is very convenient for recharging all the electronic gizmos all at the same time. It also has a swimming pool at the roof top.
