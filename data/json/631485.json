At the reception desk is always ready to help. Food delicious, always fresh, big enough choice the only thing that repeats every day. To whom it may eat up to, I'm not bothered. Next to a bar with girls, but does not notice it. The hotel is suitable for young people, tour programs, or those traveling on business.

S-bahn is 50 metres away, and brings you in the center in 10 minutes. There is also big grocery store open 24/7 for anything you need. The staff of the hotel was the minus point of the hotel. Cold and unfriendly (except one young boy in night shift who was very pleasant and helpful. I don't know his name, but i think he is the only one there. The rest were women). I did't like they charged my Visa credit card before I even arrived there. I like to have choice of method of payment for the room, as it is usualy practice in many hotels.
