The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and there is a daily maidservice. I am in Frankfurt every couple of weeks and although this hotel is a 2 minute walk away from the main station, it is situated in a 10mph zone and therefore very quiet. Now, I do travel a lot and I have been to many hotels all over the world, so, I do know a bit about roomsizes...the rooms that I lived in were definitely larger than the most hotelrooms I have been in. The hotel has recently been redecorated and look bright and nice. The Breakfast is rather simple and consists of rolls, different breads , eggs and sausages, cold meats and chhese and cereals.The prices for the rooms are certainly good and I would always go back into this hotel as I have never had any complains. Free wifi does work fine, small tv as well and the balcony is nice as well.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR553849987", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Temple1973"}, {"Content": "Beware I checked into the Everest Hotel 4 hours ago. I checked out of the Everest Hotel 2 hours ago. Here's what I found out.The pictures do not represent the hotel at all. I booked a twin bed room believing that I would receive a room like those in the pictures. When I arrived I was told my room was in the back house. Turns out this is a separate building behind the main one. The moment I went into the room, I noticed something was missing. The toilet. Yep, everyone who stays in the back house gets to share a hallway bathroom. This was unacceptable for me. Now, I'm no stranger to traveling in Europe, and I know that bathroom sharing isn't such a big deal for many here, but at least the hotel description includes this feature. Not so for the Everest. I would have never booked the place if I new the bathroom was down the (very dark) hall. Oh, and the free wireless internet? Not in the back house. Nope, you can barely get a signal in the main building. Again, having online access is important to me, so the free wireless internet was a big draw. Too bad it didn't exist. The room I was booked into was clean - I'll give them that. Problem is, the room was smaller than most European rooms (and they're already small). And one last thing - the back house is made of cinderblock, so forget about a cell phone signal inside the room. No dice.This is why I spent less than 2 hours at the Everest Hotel. When you book a room, be sure to ask them if you'll be in the back house. If you are, cancel immediately.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR848690004", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Finklebonker"}, {"Content": "a great new hotel We were staying at hotel Everest twice in July 2006, using Frankfurt as a transit airport crossing from Russia to Canada and visiting Paris on the way so we needed a place for a one night stays before and after Paris. Frankfurt airpost is located very close to the Hauptbanhoff - the main rail station, it is 15 min local train ride so we choose to stay in town instead of staying in the airport area. I booked this hotel via HRS.de web-site, there were almost no info on the tripadvisor but the price was good (55 Euro incl. breakfast) so we decided to give it a try. We were completely satisfied with the choice - the hotel is located very close to the station if you go along the fence by the right side when you arrive there. The hotel is small, new - the building is not new but it's part was renovated, clean, rooms are spacious, bathrooms are modern and very clean, linens are cotton, the breakfast is very good, quality cold cuts, fruit salat, bakery, boiled eggs, juices, yogurts, cereals etc. The price includes free wireless internet and it worked fine. Admission desk is 24/7 although you need to ring after hours. There is a good childrens playground right outside of the hotel doors. Not a single complain. Best rooms are on the last floor - the only problem is that the elevator doesn't go up there, only up to one fllor before so you have to carry you laggage one floor by hands. But the compensation is that the rooms are actually one bedroom appartments with the door in between the bedroom and a small living room and a window that opens to the roof up and it is a fun to see the area from up there.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR277310928", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Olga62"}, {"Content": "Landstreicher pennen vor der T\u7709r   showReview(19953301, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR169702448", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Kach78"}, {"Content": "Durchschnittliches Cityhotel direkt im Zentrum   showReview(14729226, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR248284480", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Zentrale Lage in Frankfurt   showReview(11664764, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR148868296", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "jederzeit gerne wieder   showReview(11425197, 'full');", "Date": "May 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR763765598", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gut und G\u7709nstig   showReview(11425195, 'full');", "Date": "May 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR270443673", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d646470-r21441592-Hotel_Everest-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "646470", "Price": "$182"}}
