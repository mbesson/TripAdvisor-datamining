My room was ok, TV did not work and the decor is something from your granny's living room. when the people in the next room turn on the water for a shower/wash the pipes make a right noise and when you turn off the water it sounds terrible which is not good if you need to sleep. Personnally I would not stay there again, but if you are british and going to madrid ( not impressed with Madrid, Barcelona is much better and has a beach as well, and is set up for british tourists, unlike madrid, I did not find another british person in madrid) if your just going for a lads/girls holiday the hotel would be ok just for sleeping, but its not a place I would want to relax in.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice home in Madrid\u201d", "Author": "Ritva189934", "ReviewID": "UR119444261", "Content": "The name of the hotel is now Espahotel Gran Via.

We are sorry to say that the only assets are its location and food prices in their restaurant. Check-in is on the first floor, no help with luggage despite several stairs that need to be negotiated. They helped with moving luggage from the check-in counter to the room (where there is an elevator). But on check-out there was again no help with getting the luggage to street level. The attendant just removed our luggage from the storage room and went back to the counter, although I was alone with 2 suitcases and 2 extra bags. We reserved a suite, but were given a studio (that was corrected after we complained). Our reservation was for twin beds, but we got a double, with poor, worn-out mattresses. The rooms were clean, living room had a good size, but bedroom was small. Except for the bed, the furniture was OK, but rooms could use a make-over. There was only one small TV in the living room, none in the bedroom (no English channel). The bathroom was good-sized with 2 sinks, but only had one of those wall-mounted hairdriers that take forever to dry shoulder-long hair while you negotiate the best way to hold on to the ever hotter plastic handle. Shower water was forceful, but the water temperature varied and due to the small glass door on the bathtub there was no way to keep the bathroom floor dry when taking a shower. It had a small kitchenette, but no coffee-machine or water heater, and we had to boil water in a pot for instant coffee that we bought around the corner. Internet connection or breakfast were not included despite the rather steep room price, and the wireless connection (on the 5th floor) was not reliable with frequent undesired disconnects, e.g. while responding to an email. Our plane left 6 hours after check-out time, but we were told that we could not stay an extra 2 hours without having to pay for a whole additional day. The hotel does not have a lobby where you could sit and spend the extra time waiting for an early evening flight on a windy, cold departure day. One would expect a bit more leniency from a place where you just spent 4 nights. All in all not recommendable compared to other hotels in the neighborhood.", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, pirce & location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4619797", "Content": "Having stayed in a 4 star hotel the previous year in Madrid and found the room tiny, this was a refreshing change - the room was large and very clean.

The location is very good, for those who want it, an internet cafe is a block away. Good basic VIP restaurant next door,for car rental Avis and Europcar are across the street. One odd anomaly was that we wanted to book our last night there (three weeks hence) before leaving to fly back to Canada but we were told that it would cost us 35 Euros more than we were presently paying because we got an \"internet rate\" for our original booking. So...yes you guessed it! I had to hoof up the street to the internet cafe and book my room on a computer on the hotel's website and sure enough got a cheaper rate than the front desk was prepared to offer. Go figure that one! Not only were they getting less money from the internet supplier but they also would have had to pay a commission too!

It's an excellent location. The MadridVisi\u00f3n tour buses stop practically out the front door, it's an easy walk to the Palace, the Puerta del Sol, and the Plaza Espa\u00f1a.
