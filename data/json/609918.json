{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Service, Did Not Like Pricing Policy Jamahal is a boutique villa property located on the inland side of Jl Uluwatu in the village of Jimbaran.The property consists of a small check in area, pool, and private villas. Construction is currently ongoing (not disclosed when reserving) to expand with new villas. The main pool is available for those who do not book a villa with a private pool, and for anyone in the property.The villas are adequate, about the size of other resort properties on Bali, suitable for a couple or perhaps small family. The pool villas have a small plunge pool, a nice amenity, but at an extra cost. The main pool is fully adequate and under utilized, so the need for a pool villa is a purely personal preference for additional privacy at the additional cost.The villas are placed within a tall perimeter wall amongst a lush tropical garden. The construction and location is such that only minimal sunlight penetrates the villas. There is no view and occasional various noises of the business and activities happening on the other side of the wall drift into the villa. The villas are decorated in a tropical style, with an air conditioned bedroom and outdoor veranda. Meals can be taken on the veranda. The large terrazzo bathtub, shower, and toilet are located outside in a secluded and private corner of the villa.Room rates include a cooked breakfast, that was prepared on time and adequately each morning. There is a reasonable choice of breakfast options. The personal service by the staff is excellent. and attentive. Security is also well attended.The resort also includes a spa, which is located in a converted villa. The spa, although not as fancy or indulgent as other spas in Bali, provided good treatments at a reasonable price.Since Jamahal is located on the inland side of the Uluwatu highway, crossing the busy road to access the beach (10 min walking) can be. a life threatening experience. Thankfully, the resort has an agreement to use the lovely beach of the Puri Jimbaran Hotel and provides transport upon request.Jamahal is a good value for $2-250/night. Below $200 its a steal. The resort's pricing was misleading quoting on a per person basis. We are not sure if this was done because we are Japanese, but it was an unwelcome surprise. Therefore, care should be taken to ensure a proper villa price is agreed before hand.", "Date": "May 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR253232925", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "yamanote"}, {"Content": "Private Paradise       our catch of the day", "Date": "Mar 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR980811778", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hugwort"}, {"Content": "A Hidden Gem       View from inside villa to entrance", "Date": "May 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR796636374", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pickytravelerSF"}, {"Content": "Awesome place but expensive       Villa private pool", "Date": "Mar 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR525771024", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "DementorIndia"}, {"Content": "Fantastiquement romantique       La chambre", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR986847510", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "etquidautre"}, {"Content": "Un v\u8305ritable PARADIS       Piscine", "Date": "Jan 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR256848445", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "6173LIONEL"}, {"Content": "Un h\u4e48tel magique!   showReview(11050493, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR413004974", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Bruz64"}, {"Content": "Absolument extraordinaire       le bain de fleur qui vs attend \u813f l'arriv\u8305e", "Date": "Aug 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR127348065", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "alexoune"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297696-d609918-r16110577-Jamahal_Private_Resort_Spa-Jimbaran_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "609918", "Price": "$567"}}
