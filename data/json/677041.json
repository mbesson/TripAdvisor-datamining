{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fabulous Hotel We stayed here our first night in Bali. They met us at the airport with a friendly greeting and all our luggage was transported to their van and from the van to the room. In the room, a coffee table was set with a welcoming drink and a small fruit platter for each of us. The rooms are gorgeous. Ours looked out over the pool but was not noisy. It had a 4 poster curtain king size bed and a garden bathroom. It was meticulously clean. Linens were white and crisp and face cloths were provided. (Many Bali hotels do not provide wash cloths). The restaurant overlooks the pool and you have the choice of an American, Japanese or Indonesian breakfast. The American breakfast includes two eggs cooked to your choice, a breakfast meat (I am a vegetarian so I ask that this be excluded), fruit or juice, coffee or tea, and toast or croissant.The staff is extremely helpful and will help you book tours, onward transportation or whatever. I would definitely stay here again and again!!!!", "Date": "Apr 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR539046330", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "rsimao"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297696-d677041-r14802315-Taman_Sari_Villas_Spa-Jimbaran_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "677041", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
