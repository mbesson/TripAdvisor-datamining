It's in walking distance of tons of places to go out at night and to eat, and it's right next to a subway station as well. When our group couldn't initial book rooms together, they were very accommodating about putting us in the same room. The staff was friendly, helpful and respectful. What's especially great about the hostel is that everything is very clean. You get blankets and towels, and the bathroom facility is spotless. The beds are comfortable as well. Definitely highly recommended.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGenerally good\u201d", "Author": "serendipity07", "ReviewID": "UR125215748", "Content": "I liked this place, the bloke who did the nights/early mornings was a bit of a miserable git though; fired me a couple of hateful glares on the morning I was leaving, all I was doing was walking along the corridor - you'd swear I was doing something quite bizarre - bit of a downer.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat but noisy!!!\u201d", "Author": "san15", "ReviewID": "UR124042003", "Content": "Yan can't have a greater location to sleep in you want to visit Madrid. The grocery store is right in front and the subway is at 2 min by walk. Puerta Del Sol is right in the heart of the city. All best attractions can be made by walk. The only one problem is the noise around there. Spanish guys like to celebrate!!! ;) The room was very small, but that was ok. It was not possible to eat in the kitchen because of its smallest, but you can go in another place in the hostel. The decor is rustic. Great price.

Fantastic location. I was travelling alone, (a woman the wrong side of 50), and I wanted somewhere central, safe, clean, and cheap. It ticked all the boxes - cost around 30 euros for a single room, was clean and very central, and I felt completely safe. The staff there were also extremely helpful - they allowed me to leave my suitcase in their luggage store for a few hours after I'd checked out, which gave me more time to wander round without lugging all my belongings with me. To get to my room I had to go through the owners' family lounge, which felt a bit strange (especially as a couple of the older family members were watching the TV!); and when I got to my room, the noise from the street outside was horrendous. I had a miniscule balcony, with delapidated external wooden shutters, some glass French doors, wooden internal shutters, and curtains; even with everything shut AND earplugs, it was impossible to shut the noise out. However, it was quite fun just being able to look out on to the pedestrianised area below and just watch all the comiongs and goings of night-time Madrid! The hostal is on the 4th floor, with a lift, so it's not a problem getting luggage upstairs. I had no private facilities; there were 2 communal bathrooms available, and while both were clean, I didn't enjoy stepping out of the shower onto a damp shag-pile bath mat - not sure who'd been standing there just before me! Also, there was no soap or towels supplied in the bathroom, and I had to ask for a towel to use during my stay (it wasn't offered). They have a tiny kitchen, where you can help yourself to hot drinks, cereal and those little pre-packed croissants; crockery and cutlery is provided, buit you have to wash up after yourself, and I don't think the people who'd used the kitchen before me had been terribly thorough! It does mean, though, that you acn have something to eat before you leave. A better bet would be to wander 200 metres along the road and treat yourself to hot chocolate and churros at the famous Chocolateria de San Gines, for about 3 euros 50. I was grateful for the mini-safe in my room, and the staff at the Reception desk were very friendly, and I couldn't fault the location - although to get to the airport does involve two changes - no major problem as the Madrid metro is amazingly easy to use.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cStay away if you'd like to get some rest!!!\u201d", "Author": "mikel6430", "ReviewID": "UR56867496", "Content": "Surprisingly, after all the good reviews i had read, this place was horrible!!! The one thing i will give it, is that it's in a great location. Walking distance from all the major sites in Madrid. But if you're trying to get any sleep, take a hot shower, or have a reasonable amount of space in your dormitory...don't stay here!!! It was loud both inside the hostal and outside in the street at all times...24/7! Everytime i took a shower, after 5 minutes or so, the hot water would just shut off and i'd be forced to shower in freezing water!!! And the room itself, was tiny!!! It was impossible to walk without tripping over something. The beds are ridiculously small. I'm not even a big person myself, but i found myself with my feet dangling off the end, or nearly rolling off the side while turning in my sleep. I'll never stay here again, and would recommend anyone to do the same. Also, i paid in advance for all the nights i was staying, but didn't need the last night. They refused to refund me my last night since i didn't give them 24 hour notice and they didn't have enough time to prep the room for someone else. Completely unreasonable!! I informed them at 9am. They don't let anyone check in until 2pm!!!
