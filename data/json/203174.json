My wife and I, our daughter, and my sister had two rooms for 7 nights. We would gladly return there, and in fact plan to do so during the summer of 2009. The greatest asset of the Caprice is its staff: the two lovely women who run the breakfast room, the two gentlemen who assist guests with luggage, etc., the housekeeping staff, and the several desk managers are all friendly and helpful. My wife and I had taken a very short adult education course in Italian, and the staff was almost always patient and helpful as I tried to speak it. The Mr. Cunningham lookalike (I now know his real name but am not using it) was still there, still charming and helpful and unfortunately got me started on fig pizza, which is impossible to find in the U.S. The Caprice is located on the north side of the Via Liguria, four doors east from the Via Emilia. On the Google satellite map, the entrance is just under the eastern branches of the tree. It is not on an alley. The Via Liguria is a rather pleasant side street that is not nearly as congested and noisy as the Via Veneto. Between the hotel and the Via Emilia are an upscale furniture display room (Roncato), an entrance to a restaurant (La Fontana), and the entrance to CicaCicaBoom. The CicaCicaBoom closed during the time we were there, not likely, it seemed, to reopen. But open or closed it was no problem. The Via Emilia ends at the Via Liguria, and its extension to the Via Veneto is a stone staircase that leads down to the Via Veneto near a convenient bus stop (southbound routes 52, 53, 63, 95, and the wonderful 116 and northbound routes 630, 25, 55, 60, 52, 53 and 116). Along the three blocks down the Via Veneto to the Barberini Metro stop are restaurants, a very good bookstore, and an exchange bureau that sells the terrific RomaPass for E20 with no surcharge (we got 8 of them). For the most part, the Via Liguria near the hotel was relatively quiet. I am the only member of our group who smokes and so was frequently alone outside the front entrance of the hotel day and night, talking to passersby, employees of nearby businesses, municipal workers watering the trees, hotel employees, and even a few customers of the CicaCicaBoom (mostly Germans), where the prices were so very high that it hardly attracted riffraff. I found the street very pleasant. It was noisy only in the morning when employees at area businesses arrived for work on their motos and the waste disposal trucks picked up garbage and unfortunately crushed the bottles and cans during the process. To answer the question that most troubled me before I stayed at the Caprice: its amenities. It has an elevator, air conditioning in the rooms, and a pleasant breakfast room down a few steps from the lobby. It is not suitable for people with limited mobility. Websites are wrong that say that the hotel has a pool, or poolside service, or a rooftop restaurant. I am puzzled about where these errors originate, but I think it may be the small chain that owns the Caprice. When we were in Rome, Romac\u2019e (July 25-31, 2007, at page 192) carried an ad for the Caprice that said, \u201cThere is a Restaurant, Roof Garden, Pianobar, Pizzeria, and a floor completely reserved as a Meeting Center.\u201d In fact, this is all wrong. It must be that the owners of the chain confuse the amenities of another one of their hotels with those of the Caprice. I thought the breakfast was just fine. I had feared that I couldn't get American coffee in Rome and took instant Maxwell House with me. The women at the Caprice made the best American coffee I've ever had. The greatest drawback of the Caprice is the size of the rooms, as has often been pointed out. The rooms and bathrooms had recently been thoroughly refurbished, and the interior designer unfortunately chose to cover the walls of the rooms with dark green fabric, which makes the rooms seem even smaller and more den-like. Most of my hotel experience is with large five-star hotels and resorts in the U.S. for business meetings, and I too like large rooms with sofas and armchairs for relaxing and reading. At the Caprice, the most pleasant place to read is in the long lobby, where there is a PC that for a small fee can be used to get email, tourist information, etc. over the Internet. The lobby is also a pleasant place to talk with other guests to the extent you can remember any German, Spanish, or French. While we were there, there was a large American family (about 16, I think) from the Pacific Northwest who were also staying there, and according to the grandmother they were all happy with the hotel. The Caprice is an affordable three-star hotel, but if you must have a large room, you will have to go elsewhere. Still, I believe that we had a far richer experience staying at the Caprice and getting to know its staff than we would have had at a big five star hotel. We hope very much to go back there this summer.", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cHotel Caprice-Rome\u201d", "Author": "Jenzybenzy13", "ReviewID": "UR20258991", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Caprice for 3 nights.

I would blame Expedia for this except that the hotel knew that people would arrive with children via Expedia bookings expecting that the room was fully paid, yet they did nothing to correct it. This is clearly a shakedown. They have your money, you have arrived and possibly settled in, and they require an additional fee knowing that you will not have anywhere else to go and will simply pay the fee.

There were many positive things about the Caprice. It's an old hotel conveniently located near the Spanish Steps, and as such its charm is just that of an old hotel. It even smells old. The staff is great, nobody can really speak English but they're veterans at talking without words. They were very helpful, just persist and you, too, will become a veteran in sign language. One of the people at the front desk gave us chocolate for kicks, and we were always greeted going in and out. Sometimes I felt they were going to break into song and dance. The room was cozy. I was in a triple and didn't feel too crowded. Yes, it's shabby, but if you're in Rome you probably won't spend much time awake in it to notice. The beds are pretty stiff, depends on how you're used to sleeping. I liked it, though. It was quiet for the most part, the only noise we heard were the neighbors coming in after a wild night out. In the mornings, breakfast was continental: bread, salami, cheese, ham, butter and jam, along with baked goods. And of course, juice, milk, coffee or hot chocolate. Location was amazing, of course. It's 5-10 minutes from the Spanish Steps and 10-15 from the Trevi Fountain. From there it's easier to walk to the Pantheon, which would then be easier to walk to Piazza Nevona. It's close to the bus stops and underground system. There weren't a lot of negative things about the Caprice, just the kind of negative that makes you laugh. For example, the tiny elevator smelled like goat and the cultural exchange via sign language between me and the staff was a lot of fun. I don't think our bathroom door closed all the way, and one person at a time could see the TV. Like it matters, really. Why watch TV in Rome? Others have said it lacked style, but I felt it had a certain kind of charm to it that most modernized hotels don't have. A great, friendly staff and a cozy hotel beats a lavish hotel with temperamental receptionists. All I can say. I'm only giving it a \"neutral/above average\" because the facilities were average, and when you think about it, it is an average hotel. Or it's what an average hotel SHOULD be, rather. The room was cozy but my mother found it cramped, and yes, there was plenty of shabbiness to go around. Their internet was also down. Helpful hints? To get there from the FCO Airport, take the train to the Termini and then the metro (Linea A) to Barberini. You can then take a bus from the stop \"Tritone\" (a stone's throw from the metro exit) to Via Veneto, or you can bum a map from tourist information and walk it if you don't have a lot of luggage. From the bus stop, climb up the steps and it should be to the right next to... la dolce vita lap dancing. Careful of pickpockets and people trying to short-change you. If you get short-changed, kick and scream until you get what you're supposed to. The last thing they need is someone scaring away other potential customers. Other than that, enjoy your stay! The hotel is pretty shabby, but Rome and the great staff should make you forget about it in no time.", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhat you see doesn't have to be what you get...\u201d", "Author": "AliandMin", "ReviewID": "UR10264565", "Content": "We were staying in Rome for 5 days. Having seen three rooms within our first 24 hours at this hotel, we can say that it can range from the downright unacceptable to a comfortable three star establishment. Owing to an unforeseen problem, we were told that our original room was unavailable and they had a smaller one for us or a transfer to their sister hotel. When we checked the room we returned to reception to say that it was totally unacceptable. A double bed was squeezed up to the wall and the bedside cabinet didn't allow the door to the bathroom to open more than halfway. A very small window six foot above the floor allowed no natural light and certainly no chance of a view. We were then shown a marginally larger room but there was barely room to walk round the bed. In both rooms the bathroom consisted of a shower head, a toilet and a very small sink. The net result was a completely soaked floor after a shower. The decoration was poor and in need of refurbishment, the window and shutters were rotten. We wanted to reject this room but there were no others available and we were told we could move to a better room the following afternoon. Our third and final room was an acceptable double room with a large window, ample floor space and a complete shower cubicle. It was still a little shabby in places. Had we had to endure either of the first two rooms for the entirety of our stay in Rome we would have had a very miserable time. However, the assistance of the hotel staff to improve our stay was welcome. In the hotel's defence, although the facilities are poor and in dire need of a spruce up, the beds were hard (good!), the shower water was very hot and it had air con, a mini bar, safe and hairdryer, along with basic toiletries. Unfortunately, there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and the breakfast room was only open until 10am. The location of the hotel was ideal as it was near Via Veneto with its beautiful bars/cafes/restaurants and also within walking distance of the Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain. The tourist bus has a stop nearby for all major attractions.

The hotel is situated right next to the very popular (And expensive) Via Veneto but is a fraction of the cost of a hotel on the street itself. Location wise, it's pretty central to all the tourist sites in Rome. We went everywhere on foot and although places like the Vatican and the Colosseum are a bit of a hike, they're certainly walkable from the Hotel Caprice. Other sites like the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish steps are just a short walk away and we went repeatedly to all of them. Speaking of which, a quick tip to any travellers to Rome: You can drink from ALL the fountains (Of which there are hundreds), except the Trevi which is chlorinated. We bought one large bottle of water when we got there, and refilled that as we went round. To the hotel itself - We found it extremely clean, with polite, friendly staff though the decor in the rooms is a bit drab and wasn't to our liking (Padded dark green wallpaper, anyone?). The bathroom was positively tiny (See photos) to the point that if you sat on the toilet your knees would touch the wall in front of you but it was, like the room, immaculately clean and well stocked. The shower had great power to it and could be turned up so that it almost blasted you clean, which was lovely after a hot day out and about. Breakfast is an \"all you can eat\" continental affair served right through to 10:30 am. We tried to eat quite late and stuff ourselves full, a tactic which meant we could manage on just an icecream for lunch then a full meal in the evening. The food itself was fresh and tasty, comprising cereals, fruit, bread rolls, pastries, ham, cheese and salami. Coffee, juice, milk and water were available to drink. We found the bed to be rock hard, which may not be to everyone's liking. That said, a day of trecking round Rome and a few drinks on the evening meant we had no trouble getting a good night's sleep. Speaking of which - The lapdance club \"Cicacica Boom\". As others have said, it's a complete irrelevance to your stay in this hotel. We heard precisely nothing from it and saw nothing or no-one from it either. A sign and a doorway, that's really all there is. Overall, we'd recommend this hotel.

Americans seemed to hate it whereas the Europeans thought it was OK or great. The hotel is a good 20 minutes walk from the main station but for one Euro each you can get the metro for two stops to Barberini and then you are just three minutes away. The hotel is in a bit of a seedy back street, but in a nice part of town, right by the American Embassy. You can walk almost anywhere from here and get the Metro to the Vatican. The Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain are less than five minutes away, so it is a pretty good location. There is a topless lap-dancing club right next door so if you are from the American bible belt you may prefer to go elsewhere. This is only open later in the evening and you cannot see or hear anything so I wouldn't worry about it. It is a typical European city centre hotel in this price range. Rooms vary in size and can be small. The beds are standard five foot for a double and so if you are used to six foot beds you might find them tight. The furniture is generally laminated chipboard. There is a reasonable amount of storage and a safe and mini bar. We had a balcony with French windows and table and chairs outside. There is heating and air conditioning. The bathroom was a good size with bath and shower. Everything was very clean. I didn't find the staff to be rude or off as alleged by some. Do try and speak a few words of the language when you speak to Italians. They will soon come back to you in English when they have smiled at your efforts, but making the effort makes a lot of difference and it does get their back up if you launch into English and assume they understand.
