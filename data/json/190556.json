We arrived at the Central Station and it was a quick tram ride to Westerkerk which was only a block and a half away from the hotel located on a canal. Our room was in the back of the hotel and overlooked a wonderful little garden which was well kept, very private and a great place to have a coffee after breakfast. Our room was well appointed and very quiet with a good bed and bathroom. The breakfast was adequate with cereals, fruits, boiled eggs, breads, cheeses and meats, and the attendant was very prompt in filling requests for lattes or coffees of any description. With only a short reverse walk to Westerkerk we had access to the rest of the city in jig time and the hotel was only a block away from the Anne Frank House. On our first afternoon we were returning from a short walk and found the Anne Frank House almost empty. After purchasing a Museeumkart, we walked right in. The Museeumkart also gave us access to many more of the prime museums throughout the Netherlands and allowed us to skip ticket lines to get right into them. We visited the Rijksmuseeum, the Van Gogh Museum, Nemo, the Royal Palace, the Amsterdam Museum and would have visited the Contemporary Art Museum if it was not being renovated during our visit. It truly was a card that both saved a lot of money and time if visiting attractions is what you want to do. Some of those ticket lines looked quite formidable. Check out that card on the Internet to see its value and then purchase one at any of the museums. It is good for one year! The bathroom has wonderful lotions, shampoos and soaps which my wife enjoyed very much. I enjoyed the shower which was a great drench and certainly made you feel you were standing under a waterfall. All in all, a great stay and one we would vsit again.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cSophisticated small luxuries make this special\u201d", "Author": "LisaSanDiego_CA", "ReviewID": "UR127734505", "Content": "Our first visit to Amsterdam was only overnight as we were passing through--so we wanted to maximize our few hours there. Sandwiched between two canals, we chose the Canal House for the sophistication of its color scheme and location (and an in-house dining room). Upon an early arrival, we were allowed to drop (numerous) bags in the small bar and were ushered into the dining room--empty--but they rustled up a sandwhich and drinks for us. The dining room is (again) absolutely beautiful, with inverted porcelain lamp shades filled with creamy flowers. Very unusual, and the product of a neighborhood artisan. We did have to carry our bags up winding, steep, and narrow stairs, but we knew going in that the hotel was in an older renovated building. The room (their least expensive, although that is relative) was small, spotless, and luxurious in color and bath amenities and linens. It was a block walk to a primary church, the Anne Frank House (don't miss), and the first homosexual monument, and a longer but still comfortable walking distance (maybe 20 blocks?) from the City Historical Museum (don't miss). We had plenty of time to enjoy all of these activities,as well as walking along the canals, before returning to the hotel for dinner. We were exhausted and it was lovely indeed to simply return to the hotel dining room for what was really a fine meal. Breakfast early the next morning was adequate--and the beautiful room started the day off right. The hotel called the cab and they were there almost immediately. Very convenient. We did feel that the hotel was maybe hosting a version of _______'s Next Top Model. Lot's of young, skinny and very hip young women--but there were also business folks, a family, and others. If you like grey, black and purple--you will love this hotel.

We booked 2 rooms with canal views but ended up with NO view at all other than the walls of a light shaft about 1 meter away from the window.The windows only opened out about 10 cm which made the rooms very claustrophobic and the airco didn't work. The receptionist's rather displaced sense of humor certainly did not put a smile on our face when, pointing to the old black and white picture in the light shaft, she said: \"But you do have a canal view!\" Such behavior is quite disrespectful to guests paying 320\u00e2\u201a\u00ac (+tax) per room per night. This issue was raised on our departure and we were offered the dinner we had on the night we dined in. The receptionist also apologized for her misplaced joke. We had room 6 which could only be reached by walking through the open kitchen and room 19, reachable by a neck breaking winding staircase. Both are so called \"better rooms\". The rooms themselves were quite nice, excellent Vi-Spring mattresses and soft bed sheets, enough towels and a bathrobe. Both had open bathrooms & separate toilets, tiny basins, good shower... no privacy though! The breakfast included in the price was a very meager buffet indeed: matured & young cheese slices (you'd expect more of a country known for its cheeses!) & some smoked ham, a selection of yoghurt, jam, bread, some danishes (if you were early enough to get some), cereal & fruit juice. Anything from the kitchen (eggs etc) was an extra charge. The staff serving breakfast (with the exception of a helpful young man) was rather loud and not discrete at all. The lady cook who came to our table even made some lengthy remark about supplements she saw beside my plate!

We had a \"great\" room overlooking the garden on the third floor (#17-we asked for a canal view but were told it was unavailable) and my daughter had a \"good\" room also overlooking the back garden on the second floor (#10). They were both nice -- room 10 had a higher ceiling and original windows, while room 17 was larger. The rooms were kind of dark, as the walls are essentially black, which got a little dreary in November. There aren't a lot of light fixtures, but there is a good reading light by the bed. There was supposed to be a ipod dock that was missing in room 17, but we didn't need it so didn't ask reception about it. The toiletries are very nice, although they only gave us one tiny bar of soap and never replaced it even after it got down to a tiny chip. It was hard to control the room temperature - either too cold or too hot. We really liked the restaurant and ate dinner there twice. The breakfast buffet was a little small compared to other hotels we have stayed in. The only fruit is a kind of sad fruit salad, and eggs and smoked salmon cost extra. There were no pancakes or waffles to be had. The service was fast and friendly, and we felt comfortable and welcome. We loved the bar and had drinks there most evenings. The location is wonderful, away from some of the grunge of the downtown area. It's near the \"9 streets\" shopping area as well as the Jordaan which are fun places to walk and shop.

My baggage was taken to my room for me, which was greatly appreciated because of narrow staircases in the hotel. I was escorted to my room by the lady who checked me in, who also carried my hand luggage for me, and she proceeded to explain all about it.

Had no clue where to stay, or what part of town or what our options might be. Found The Canal House mostly by accident while poking around a couple of boutique hotel sites (Tablet, I believe). Intrigued by the pictures, and the simplicity of their room tiers (Good, Better, Best). Didn't have high expectations for whatever reason, particularly since we were going to be in Amsterdam for work and not on vacation. But stayed 3 nights there and, well, it was an all around surprisingly excellent experience. Hotel is located in Jordaan neighborhood and it's nearby the tourist magnets of the Red Light District and the Anne Frank House (just around the corner), and some other smaller attractions. But it's just far away from everything that you don't feel suffocated by it. It feels residential and local for the most part, but still close enough to access the tourist stuff if you want. Hotel itself is a narrow building about 4 stories high. Has 20-25 rooms total, but it feels like less. It's a little cramped and narrow inside (especially the stairs - there's no elevator either), but I got the sense that a lot of buildings along the canals in Amsterdam are like that. It was part of the local charm. Garden in the back is beautiful and worth hanging out in. Black and purple decor inside is executed well, as was overall design touches in the rooms and throughout the building. Simple and thoughtful and done well. Didn't eat in the restaurant while we were there but it's apparently a well-regarded dining option in town, as often it had many tables occupied by non-guests for lunch and dinner. Hotel staff was very friendly. Very accommodating. Made the experience personal - everyone would learn your name. But it wasn't ever creepy or insincere, and they didn't ever overdo it like some places do. Found this to be a real part of the overall pleasant stay we had. I had a \"Better Room\" (the medium sized one) and it was a touch smaller than I expected for the price (and from the photos). But it was still comfortable and convenient.

The restaurant within the hotel was a hidden gem. The menu was small but what was served was excellent and fresh. In fact, we cancelled our reservation at another restaurant one evening as we figured it didn't make sense to go out for food when there was such wonderful food right under our roof. Some people may dislike being made to walk through a restaurant's kitchen to go anywhere, but I like it. It gives me the opportunity to make a quick inspection of the general condition of the kitchen, the staff working in it etc, and it also told me that the chef was not afraid to open his kitchen up for inspection. It was a lovely white clean and bright kitchen. Breakfast was a favourite time for us every day as we had it in bed with the morning sun shining in with the wonderful canal view in front of us. The bar was small and neat and shared the space with reception. The atmosphere around the bar at night was lovely, helped significantly by the presence of experienced and charming bar staff.

A warm friendly and inviting hotel in a wonderful location. We had 2 small double rooms (14&15)overlooking the canal, daughters in one and husband and I in other. Girls were worried about it feeling 'creepy', but after first night they felt very at home and safe as the rooms were so close together with no others nearby. Our friends had a fabulous large triple room looking over the back, room 19 and with a tv which pleased their 14 year old son. Looked forward every morning to breakfast in elegant breakfast room. Very friendly staff, nothing too much trouble. Hotel is convenient for good restaurants. Asked hotel for recommendations and was given a list. Our favourite was 'De Regeur' an old brown bar with bistro type feel. Cosy and candlelit. Food mid-range price and beautifully presented. Also ate at Belgian restaurant Leve (sp?), which was good. Liked the brown bar next door to this restaurant too. One of the hightlights of our stay was the Heineken Experience. Children loved it! Lots of interactive things to do including making a hilarious video of yourselves on a boat on a canal miming to 'tulips from Amsterdam', which you can e-mail to your delighted friends! Obviously did all the museums including the Anne Frank House which was very moving. Large queues all day for this. We recommend getting there by opening time at 9 o'clock at least which is fairly easy as it is only a 3 minute walk from hotel. Bicyle tour was a good trip. We chose the 'Yellow Bike' company. Beware that there is no time to get accustomed to bike before the tour guide is off crossing lanes of traffic and tram lines. If you pedal backwards then the break is activated (also one on handlebar). My 11 year old daughter could not get the hang of this straight away and was left behind with her father. Tour Guide did'nt even notice he was 2 missing! Did'nt see them until end of the 3 hour trip. Back to the Canal House. I would also mention the friendly and helpful reception staff.

Our room (#19 which faced the rear of the hotel) was very large and bright, and included two massive windows, wing-back style couch and chair, and an antique desk. We enjoyed listening to the frequent ringing of the carillon from the nearby Westerkerk (church) and birds singing. Our favourite restaurants included the Pancake Bakery for excellent pannekoekens (crepes) and poffertjes (tiny pancakes), Haesje Claes and Keuken Van for traditional food, Kantijl en de Tijger for rijsttafel (Indonesian food with a minimum of 11 courses), and Patisserie Pompadour (the Huidenstraat 12 location) for exquisite chocolates and tostis (grilled cheese sandwiches). We also enjoyed smoked eel and vlaamse frites (french fries) with mayo from the street vendors. The Albert Hein supermarket has the best chocolate bars and speculaas (gingerbread cookies) which make unique souvenirs for family and friends back home. For attractions, we recommend the Bloemenmarkt (floating flower market) for a variety of gorgeous flowers (our trip was in June 2006); the Rijksmuseum; the Saturday antique market at the Noorderkerk (church); walking the charming elm-lined canals in the Jordaan district (where our hotel is located) and browsing through the antique, book, and bakery shops; and for something different, a quick jaunt through the Red Light District.

In those days we really couldn't afford much but having decided on taking out a small loan, my husband surprised me with a trip to the Canal House the day after we got married. It's true ladies, the romantic fellas still exist, honest. A limo picked us up from the airport (another surprise) & whisked us off to the Kaisergracht where we were met with a very warm welcome from our American hosts. Elegance, friendly smiles, lots of laughs & wonderful service kept the place high on our list of fond memories. 20 years later,in April 2006, we decided to celebrate our 20th anniversary with a return trip. This time, money was not so tight so we could afford to really relax & enjoy the Canal House experience to its full extent. We utilised the services of the recommended driver, Mario (an excellent choice) to collect us at the airport & arranged for him to take us back on the last day too. It felt so good to be back. To see the hotel had changed so little in it's elegant & timeless decor, with the gilt & marble still there, was a wonderful nostalgia trip. The new owners have ensured that the same warmth & friendship greets all guests & we instantly felt relaxed & welcome. The hotel has since been extended so we had a large airy room with the trademark traditional decor that helped us feel as though we were in a typically dutch home. The staff make a point of being helpful & we were always greeted with a smile from breakfast to evenings.

The bar is small, but cozy, with a lovely selection of local guidebooks -- not a place to spend the evening, but perfect for a drink before heading out, or to meet fellow travelers. We took a glass of wine each evening in the bar before going to dinner. The hotel posts a list of recommended area restaurants and the staff booked all of our reservations.

There are canal bus stops nearby as well - one across the canal at the square and the other by the Anna Frank House. We wandered around the neighborhood on foot and really enjoyed seeing a quieter side of the city. We absolutely loved our stay! This is not a hotel for those who want luxurious, modern or American-style amenities. As one reviewer commented, the bathtub does not have a shower curtain -- but that is because this is a European style hotel and, after all, is in Europe. You will not find large modern rooms, televisions, coffee pots and mini-bars, or be in the heart of Amsterdam night life. But, that is precisely what we liked about it - peaceful and historic ambience. My husband's only complaint was that the crowd was older (we are in our late 20's), but I preferred the less rowdy company. Canal House has old-world charm, character and a peaceful ambience, in a quiet but convenient location and is reasonable for what it offers. If that is what you are looking for, I recommend it without hesitation.", "Date": "October 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huelva, Spain", "Title": "\u201cStaying at your granny's\u201d", "Author": "sohersu", "ReviewID": "UR3914255", "Content": "Well, above everything i read before my boyfriend and i stayed there, i must say that i never stayed in a hotel in Amsterdam, my boyfriend's family owns a house on the same canal and it's pretty much the same but RESTORED, which is something that this hotel should do soon!

There was a pretty nice room that we peeked into at the end of our hall that was larger and nicely appointed with many windows. Shower Bath tub in our room was a tub only. It had a typical European showerhead-on-a-hose which was fine, but it did not have a tub enclosure so that you could not do a \"stand up\" shower--my wife found this to be a real pain for shampooing her hair and one tended to get really cold when wet. Furnishings could be described as \"old world antique\" if you wanted to be overly generous. In reality the furnishings were old, tattered and shabby. One couple from our group had a street/canal front room, which was much larger and nicer. Some street noise, but not bad, and had a canal view across the street. We were told by some employees that the owners are not local and have not put a dime into the place since they bought it several years ago and it shows it. Management / front office staff seemed cold and indifferent. On the plus side: Location is really very good. Work staff is friendly. Breakfast room, garden view and breakfast foods are A++. The off-lobby bar is old world cool and a great place to hang out and have a drink. All-in-all we would not stay at Canal House again. Amsterdam was interesting, but not high on my list to return to.

Breakfast is fairly standard European: bread and cold cuts or cheese, cereals, croissants, boiled eggs and (tinned) fruit. The breakfast room ambience is amazing though. Staff are very helpful and attentive, as are the owners and receptionist. There is one lift and the corridors are very windy and twisty and the staircases VERY steep so anyone who is 'mobility-impaired' would have a big problem. The rooms I've had have both been full of antiques and had four-poster beds but are not modern -- as I said no TV though a radio. Bathrooms are a bit tired with 70s tiled decor (half-size bathtub) but are more than adequate. The bar is not a place to while away the hours -- not enough seating for more than two groups, closes at 22.30 -- more somewhere to grab a glass of wine or a beer before going out and yes, it is a bit chintzy but heck, you have the whole of the city to choose from .
