When we first walked into the dream suite, we were taken aback by the view. You have a view of the blue mosque and the hagia sophia on one side and a view of the bhosphorus over a few buildings on the other side. The room is slightly bigger than an average hotel room. Negatives of the dream suite are as follows. - Surprisingly, they did not have enough curtains to cover all the windows. - One of the curtain rails were broken. - room was very dimly lit. - The worst part of the room however was the bathroom. It was small and ridiculously dim lit. You could hardly look at your face in the mirror. On the last day of our stay here we moved to the sultanmhet suite. In comparison the dream suite, the room was just perfect. Spacious with pretty much the same view. The bathroom was much bigger and had a jacuzzi. The dream suite in comparison had a small shower cabinet into which a six footer like me would have trouble fitting into. What really was a surprise was that the hotel was selling the dream suite suite at a much higher rate that the sulthanmhet suite. It is ridiculous to pay more for a compromise in basic comfort (read - a decent bathroom). Another annoying issue was the motion sensor lighting that was installed. We usually had to take a few nervous steps in complete darkness before the lights switched on. To talk about the positives, - The hotel is at a lovely location, walking distance to all the major attractions. - Most of the staff in the hotel are really helpful and very accomodating. Jehangir at the reception and the lady who looks over breakfast helped us out a lot. - They have a very neat and decent spread for breakfast. On the whole, we had a nice time at Lausos and if were visiting the hotel again, I would defenitely stay clear of the Dream suite. Staying in a better room for lesser money sure makes a lot of sense to me.

My wife got very sick while we were there... let's call it \"Constantine's Revenge.\" At 1am I came down to reception and asked for help finding my way to an all night pharmacy. The two gentlemen worked together to find a place across town that would be open and then called a very good taxi driver to take me straight there. If I had tried to do all that on my own it would've been a huge ordeal. Quite possibly another taxi driver would've taken advantage of me too.

Istanbul is the best place to visit at anytime of the year there is a lot of things to see from historical side and also the entertainment at the city day or night. Back to my comment on the Hotel lausos please see my comments below. Hotel it self is well located in Istanbul in the old city called Sultan Ahmet and near all the startegics and hostorical places to visits.Bluye Mosque, Sophia Hagia, Topkapi ect...sometimes no need for a car just walking through not far from the hotel. The Hotel is very nice the rooms are perfect and very clean and tidy. Room service very good. The most high rate I can give is for the staff of the Hotel which are all very professinal and well educated people.They welcome us very freindly and we enjoyed their help in identifying places to visit where to eat ect.. I really want to name to staff that I really appreciates their help during my stay in Lausos between 25th December 2010 & 1st January 2011.
