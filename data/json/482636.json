It is probably the only advantage of this hotel. 'Not far' means something about 7 min by taxi (early in the morning when there's no traffic at all). However it takes something about an hour to get to the hotel from the center of Rome by public transport (20 min by metro and 10 min by bus - if it happens to arrive soon and you haven't to wait it (its timetable depends on week days- at worst it is once in an hour, best - 3 times an hour). It is situated near (or in) industrial zone so it is really not a very safe region at late evenings or at night. As soon as the airport is near you can enjoy a terrible noise of flying airplanes (it is really loud, believe me - especially at night), bypassing cars and barking dogs. Closing the window could help but only a little just because when you close it air conditioning starts working and its noise is also very loud (how old is the system, I wonder!). And we couldn't switch it off because we didn't find a remote control for it. And we did look very carefully, believe me. Rooms What I liked about the room that it was really clean. However, it was really small, and with green walls it was really depressive and nearly claustrophobic. There's a small refrigerator and TV. Actually it is definitely not a 3* room (max a 2*). There are payed satellite TV channels and Internet for 4 euro \\ an hour Food Actually we hadn't a chance to enjoy a breakfast there. We booked this room just to spend a night before an early flight (at 6 AM) and on phone we were told that a breakfast and hotel transfer was included in the price. A bit later we learned that as long as we leave very early (at 5AM) we could only have a coffee and brioche at the hotel bar. When we were leaving the hotel in the morning we GOT NOTHING. Another funny thing was that only after we checked in and pay we were told that hotel transfer is possible only from 5.30AM and we were advised to take a taxi. Actually we insisted a bit and a driver took us from the hotel at 5.15 (it seems there were no clients leaving at 5.30=). When we checked out it turned out that a clerk forgot to take a city tax (2euro per person) and thanks God we hadn't had spent all our cash. And no one will help you with your luggage when you get into this 'hotel transfer mini bus' (the driver just sits and watch you trying open the door and working your luggage into the car). Summary I will never advise this hotel for your vacations in Rome. It is really not so easy to get to the city center from the hotel and back (especially if you are a planning a night out - metro works only until 9PM and you have to look for other options). The surroundings are really unsafe so it is not the right place for families with children. I could advise this hotel for staying 'a night before flight' but only if your another option is sleeping at the airport because other hotels are full.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cHard to value this hotel..\u201d", "Author": "LuMartini", "ReviewID": "UR104865633", "Content": "Hotel as itself is really nice (inside, of course :-)) It seems clean, modern, rooms are one of the best 3* standards I\u00b4ve ever seen. And that\u00b4s it. If I could value only the features of the hotel and the cleanless it will have 4,5/5.. But then the \"problems\" starts. Location is not so good for those, who don\u00b4t have a car. We spent minimally 3 hours a day with traveling to the city, but that\u00b4s OK - we counted with this. What is worse is, that there are no restaurants, bars.. nothing around. Just small pizza fastfood opened untill 9 P.M. approximately 5 minutes by walk. When we booked this hotel, we checked reviews here saying there is no noise from the airport. That is not really true - we had a room on the upper floor and it didn\u00b4t mind if the windows are open or closed, the noise was terrible. After 2 days we made a game from this-counted 16 airplaines during the night :-) Breakfast the first day was awesome - there was everything: bacon, eggs, sausages, ham, cheese, sweet cakes, frutis, cereals etc etc. Fantastic. But the second day there was only ham, cheese and sweet cakes. We thought, that the big group had eaten everything before us so we tryed to wake up the third day early before them and it was terrible.. There was nothing! Just sweets. I had to ask even for a bread and ham!! Maybe the had low budget because of the end of the week.. I don\u00b4t know :-) As I said the rooms were OK - very good 3* standard. Only thing was the bed. We had 2 rooms, no one slept good - beds are tooooooooooo small (KGS bed approx. 140 cm?) And the pillows - second thing would have to be changed in this hotel... So.. Not a bad hotel for a good price, but you have to count with lot of travelling, noise, poor breakfast.. It was our third time in Rome and know that next time rather somwhere else for more money :-)", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201camazing and moden 4 a 3 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "eufc", "ReviewID": "UR62184561", "Content": "the hotel was clean tidy and moden for a three star hotel amazing there was english tv channels these inc;lude bbc world,simpsons fox", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "newcastle", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to stay when visiting rome with car hire.\u201d", "Author": "beachwarrior", "ReviewID": "UR20636082", "Content": "stayed at the meeting hotel for 4 days, a long weekend iin july 2007.

We have just returned back on the 3rd February from Rome Ciampino so this review is current and updated based on our opinions of what we experienced on a 2 night stay. The Hotel Meeting is a 3 star hotel, and is approximately about 5 Kilometres from Rome Ciampino airport, however, if not hiring or renting a car on arrival, getting to the hotel can be achieved 3 ways. First telephoning the hotel on arrival and asking them to send the shuttle van to collect you, the cost of this was 12 Euro. The second way is to take the COTRAL Bus or the Metrobus, sadly these are irregular and come once every 1 hour and 20 minutes on average, not the best way to get to the hotel. The third way, and probably the quickest, is to take a private hire taxi cab, the taxi's are required to put on the meter, but in our case the taxi driver refused to do so, when we arrived at the hotel meeting the taxi driver demanded 30 Euros, the actual fare on a meter is 16 Euros. In the end to avoid a scuffle and argument at 8pm in the evening, I paid 20 Euros, the taxi rates seem to differ from driver to driver, depending on the level of dishonesty that prevails. The reception is attended 24 hours per day, and the man was very friendly and immediately made us feel welcome. The hotel seemed somewhat quiet and we discovered that there were very few guests on the Friday night, there is a pleasant lounge to the right of reception, with nice relaxer chairs, a t.v. and other amenities. You can obtain coffee and light snacks, but the restaraunt is really only for serving breakfast in the mornings. Our room was fairly reasonable size, parquette floor, decent size bed, a marble bathroom, WC Bidet and a rather small shower cubicle, we were rather disappointed that the shower temperature was poor, however, we did not complain as it was warm enough to achieve the required result. There was small bars of soap, a little shower gel,. a shaver point, nice lighting, and a 14 inch colour t.v. on the wall mounted bracket, the room has a key code safe, and a rather small mini bar in a fridge that did not work, the drinks inside were limited, and again, we were dissapointed by the selection, which included 1 bottle of still water, 1 bottle of sparkling, 1 Fanta, and 3 snacks. Again due to the fact that we were only using the hotel as a bed for the night, we did not contact the management about what we thought were minor irritations. Breakfast in the morning started at 7 am, the breakfast consisted of 3 choices of fruit juices (not fresh) concentrate, pastries, cakes, water, coffee, Tea, yoghurts, salami and cheese cuts, small bread rolls, cereal choices, milk, no english breakfast buffet more in line with a continental style breakfast, with jams and preserves. We thought the breakfast was adequate and for the room rate of only \u00a344.00 per night reasonable. As other reviewer's have commented on, the hotel is in fact just off a junction with a main motor way, its on an industrial complex, and rather tucked away off the main road, it appears to sit in the corner of a trading estate, and if going by car was fairly accessible, for those on foot, its a little off putting. We were planning to explore the attractions of Rome, and the only way to get there is to take a metro bus from the opposite side of the highway, (bus stop located close to a set of foul smelling wheel Bins) and then take the bus to the Anagnina Metro stop at the end of Linea A. The Bus is 1 Euro or a day ticket which can be purchased in advance at the airport is 4 Euro, the bus takes about 10 minutes to the Anagnina station, however, be warned the station looks intimidating night or in the early morning, pretty dirty, and lots of immigrants hanging around. Our advice would be to take the Bus to the terminal at Sub Augusta, and then pick up Linea A to Rome there, its safer, and is a busy Plazza in South Eastern Rome. Finally We stayed 2 nights at the hotel, and they could not provide us with the shuttle bus back to the airport when we requested it, stating that it was not available on Sunday's as there was no requirement for it. But the duty receptionist gladly called a taxi for us, which cost 20 Euro, all in all we were happy with the hotel, apart from a slightly luke warm shower, we would definately recommend it to fellow travellers as a good Ryan Air stopover, its fairly cheap compared to other central Rome hottels, and may just be staying at if your not too bothered about using public transport to get into Rome.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cGreat airport stopover\u201d", "Author": "musiciany", "ReviewID": "UR7816592", "Content": "We flew into Rome Ciampino airport quite late and needed somewhere handy to stay. I was not expecting great things from Hotel Meeting, but was pleasantly surprised - it turned out to be modern, stylish, clean... probably the best 3* I've been to.

If you're using it as a base to explore Rome, I imagine this would be a big problem.

We landed at 23.45 hours. The HERTZ Car Rental desk was still open for late arriving clients. We were travelling over to Pescara for 5 nights, so we needed a hotel close to Ciampino for our first night stop-over. The location was next to the 'Tangentiale' road junction, but despite it's position, our room wasn't noisy at all. We enjoyed a good first night sleep. I located the hotel without too much trouble (despite the drive/journey taking place at 00.30) The Reception was manned by a delightful chap who made us most welcome. Overnight car-parking was free. The hotel room was spotlessly clean. A wee bit on the 'compact' side, as was the Shower and WC ... but perfectly formed. Original parquet flooring and veneered doors and woodwork were in good order. approx 1.200 metres of open hanging space. There was AC, a TV and a computer point. Breakfast next morning offered us: 3 juices; 2 Yogurts; Bread; 2 Pastry varieties; Cereal (CoCo Pops) meats of Mortadella & Salami + cheese. Tea, Coffee (Espresso and Cappucino), Milk, Water, Jams & Honey. No fry-up for the all-day-breakfast 'wallahs'. We booked the hotel through Ryanair's Hotel booking link .. \u00a344 for the room, for both of us - B&B. That was cheaper than any other published rate I could find on the 'Net. Although it wasn't close to Rome centre, the hotel made a perfect stop-over for travellers moving on to other destinations. I'd certainly use it again. All information given in good faith ...

The room was spacious, clean and the hotel staff were helpful. The breakfast could have been better, as they only provided cakes and coffee. From my previous holidays, a nice hot breakfast tends to be much better! If you arriving at Ciampino airpot, then the cheapest way is to catch a bus from the public stop at Ciampino, and get a bus to Anagnina, then from there,get number 503 bus to Bandanelli. The hotel is 2 minutes walk from here. This will cost you 1 Euro. If u attempt to catch a taxi, it will cost u 22 Euro's. What u can also do, is ring Hotel meeting and they will pick you up at a cost of 10 Euros. The only problem I found with this hotel is waiting for buses. Sometimes they come every 10 minutes, sometimes every 30 mins! If u hate waiting for buses then I don\u2019t think this hotel is for you, because you have to get a bus everywhere! And services stop at around 10-30pm, so u cant stay out that long.
