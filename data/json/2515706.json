Also not a fan of te 4 toddlers in the hot tub with their floaties on. Couldn't go to the adult one since the frat boys had that one occupied fist-pumping and all. To top it all off we all had to fly home without showering because the water was completely not working. Nothing but a dribble in the sink. Couldn't even flush the toilet.

As I found myself having a day or two to kill in San Diego, I thought the amenities of the hotel would make it a good place to unwind, while checking out the local amusement parks. We were not disappointed by the facility, the pool is very nice for a family (has major pool, a wading pool for small kids and jacuzzi) and the beach is small but sufficient for kids to play. The hotel is just on the Mission Bay walk-way and my wife and I enjoyed going for a nice run in the mild weather. There are many runners and bikers in the Mission Bay park area, which makes it fun and lively. It is overall a very relaxing setting and ambience, not too far from airport and the city ($21 taxi ride, 10-15 mins from airport). The room was adequate but not stellar compared to other Hiltons. The room we had was \"motel style\" with parking in front and front door directly outside, basicly furnished and it smelled a bit. It was not so bad that I considered complaining or changing the room, but it was not up to the normal standards of other Hilton hotels I had visited, or what I expect when I travel for business. I just think the hotel is a bit old. At the same time, my room opened to the grassy yard just in front of the beach and had beatiful views of the bay, so the setting made up for the room decor. As pointed out by many other reviewers, the $32 daily parking is steep for what you get (self park) but I knew about it in advance and I accounted for in the total price of room when coimparing to other hotels. Overall it was a nice stay and I would go back when travelling with my family as I loved the setting and the pool.

They recommended La Jolla Beach children\u2019s pool area where we would be most likely able to see Harbor seals from a safe distance without interrupting them.

If not for Matt and his awesome customer service, my stay would have been ruined, as well as some VERY important plans I had arranged around my stay. My boyfriend and I chose to stay at the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa in early April 2012 after we stayed in late March 2012 for a mini vacay. We both absolutely loved the room! And the staff! The hotel staff was awesome and very helpful whenever called upon. No issues with parking here.. The parking was a breeze! (TIP: Park on the street for free! Each time I\u2019ve stayed at the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa there has always been street parking. You may still pull your car into the hotel entrance, near the lobby initially for registration, and the bell hops will Gladly help you with your luggage ~ ensuring the full hotel/resort experience. After you check-in, go park your car on the street and come back to the entrance to meet your bell hop, who will bring/show you to your room.) Back to the room! The room was very modern with beautiful decor. The carpet had a very cool chic look to it (and felt great! by the way). I like the lighting! Lamps could be turned lighter or dimmer and during the day there\u2019s no light needed as the huge sliding glass patio door let\u2019s in the most amazingly gorgeous sunlight. It almost seems as if the room was decorated with the idea of the sunlight hitting each piece of decor just right, especially in the morning and at sundown! I actually took pictures of items from the room that I wanted to purchase when I returned home! I never had to call for maintnence once and everything worked perfectly in the room. The room was pretty big and I really enjoyed the extra space and feel it always makes a difference for my stays. The view was fantastic too! Beautiful San Diego beaches right outside! I REALLY loved the room & the patio! It was nice to stay in a hotel and actually utilize the patio. The patio had two large lounge chairs which my boyfriend and I both made use of and thoroughly enjoyed. The bathroom was very large, esp when compared to other similar hotels and resorts in the area. The lighting on the bathroom is perfect! Also, love the little swing out magnifying mirror, very useful. We went out that night to a rather important event and I was able to do my make-up & hair so well in that lighting, I looked like I\u2019d been at the salon half the day! As you can probably tell by now, I REALLY loved the room. I loved the room so much that I made sure to request the same, or similar, room, in advance with a front desk rep over the phone a day in advance and then again on the morning of my arrival. I also requested an early check-in (their normal check-in is 4p and I was going to arrive at 3p) and the front desk rep informed me that would be fine. She looked up my history and saw what room I had last time I stayed and told me, \"Yes, there will be another room just like it available today\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t be the exact same room number but the same room as the one I stayed in most recently. I was extremely happy (as you could imagine, knowing my liking of the room!) I went ahead and planned my entire stay around being in this room. We were going out to a formal event that evening and I was so glad to have bathroom with the great lighting and mirrors. No need to have my make-up or hair done! Also, since this room was one of the Villas and the entrance was private, I invited a few co-workers to come over for drinks at my hotel room. I had even made plans with my boyfriend to have a special breakfast with him on the beautiful patio the next morning! However, my day took a turn for the worse when I came into the Lobby at about 3:15p and was assisted by Ramzi. This gentleman was unlike the other staff I\u2019d encountered at this Hotel, or any Hilton for that matter. He didn\u2019t look me in the eye once. When I came up to the desk and said I had a reservation for today Ramzi didn\u2019t respond at all, he just looked down. I repeated myself (maybe he didn\u2019t hear me??) and this time added my first and last name and requested to be checked-in. He just said No, no. I\u2019m sorry Maam but we don\u2019t have any clean rooms available, you\u2019ll need to wait. He then walks away toward a co-worker and I tell him Excuse me, but I\u2019ve already verified with the front desk today that I would need an early check-in as I\u2019m arriving early and it was okayed. I asked him to look at the notes under my history, and he seemed to be looking but had no response. I then asked him how long I would need to wait and he said he\u2019ll take my cell number down and I can go look around and he\u2019ll call me when a room is ready. At this time I realized I\u2019m also going to need to verify with him the room I already requested and I\u2019d most recently stayed in and he agreed nodding yes, that is the type of room I\u2019ll be getting. I asked him how long and told him there will be no need to take down my cell number as I will wait here in the lobby. He seemed angry about that and walked away, without any response once more. I said loudly, 10.. 15 mins?? how long? he nodded yes again. Okay, so here I am waiting 10 mins.. 15 mins.. NOW 20 mins goes by and nothing! At about this time I started notcing other reps at the front desk calling other hotel guests to let them know their rooms were ready. Now 30 mins has gone by, and I go up to the counter and ask Ramzi what\u2019s going on?? He says he\u2019s getting my room right now. Okay, Finally! Can\u2019t wait to get to the room so I can start getting ready (I\u2019m already running 30 mins behind now). He\u2019s helping other guests too, so I take a seat up front and comes right over and hands me keys for a room numbered 119 ~ Now I know my room number was in the 400\u2019s last time so this can\u2019t be correct. I tell Ramzi that we already discussed this when I came in and this is why I\u2019m waiting, for one of the rooms like the one I stayed in the last time I was there! You know, the one you nodded your head and agreed too? Whether this hotel had one of the rooms similar, or the same room, I\u2019d stayed in before was my deciding factor on choosing the Hilton instead of another near-by hotel. So he takes back the keys and storms back to his position behind the front desk. 10 more mins go by and he comes back over to me with a new pamphlet and two new room keys and says okay here you go! Here\u2019s the one you\u2019ve been looking for. Hands me the brochure with key, closed, I open it and it says room 122.. I think to myself, I KNOW that doesn\u2019t sound right.. If he knows room 119 is not what I was looking for, then why would he give me room 122 and say \u201chere\u2019s the one you\u2019ve been looking for\u201d (and waiting for!) But, this is a very large hotel and I thought maybe even if the room numbers are in succession, they may not be the size or have the same amenities inside. So I go along with it and take the directions from the bell boy - I get to room 122 - Wow :( What a surprise! Just as I suspected, room 122 is just on the lower level of these villas, right next to 119, which Ramzi knew WAS NOT my initial request and obviously if I didn\u2019t want a room in the villas in the 100\u2019s and he proceeded to give me keys letting me, an unsuspecting hotel guest get so exhausted from all the hoopla, I go ahead and take a look at the room Ramzi gives me and says is the same room I requested and waited about 45 mins for, only to be EXTREMELY disappointed...It was a tiny villa with a door you go through and a hallway you walk down to get to your room - open a few seconds of inspection it is obvious to me that this is not the room, or even a similar one! One of the phones was not working, the patio was set up totally different! The clock was 1 1/2 hrs ahead of time and after careful inspection, I found there to be no way to change the time. The bathroom was different. Most everything I had liked was different in this \u201cnew\u201d room. I called the front desk and asked to speak with the manager. By now I was flaming PISSED! Not only did I have to wait a really long time for a room (which was confirmed earlier that day, that in fact, Yes! I could check-in early at 3p and Yes! The exact same room type was available). Now I was given the wrong room, and not just the wrong room, but in a completely different area with no corridors or hallways. The manager was on another call at the time so I waited about 5 mins and he called me back at the room. Matt instantly put me at ease! He realized I was quite upset, let me know he would get me into the correct room pronto and he was very apologetic for the mishaps. Matt was very calm and reassuring. He said he would send someone right away to help with my bags and get me over to the correct room. The bell hop arrived within a few minutes and was very helpful and we even cracked a few jokes onto the way to my correct room. Niice..finally..back with the customer service I remember and have grown to expect from Hilton. Before I knew it I was at my correct villa, in the 400 block with just a single door (no hallways) all decor was perfect, just as I\u2019d remembered! Since the actual room I\u2019d stayed in was already occupied, Matt suggested another room, very similar - AND IT WAS! All my plans were back on track and everything turned out wonderfully, and that is because Front Desk Manager, Matt Bickel went out of his way to help a Hilton Hotel & Resort Guest! I am truly grateful that Matt was working that day! After my experience with Matt Bickel, I will continue to refer my friends & family to this same Hilton.. and I will be back any chance I get! THANK YOU MATT!! As for the rest of the Hotel & Resort ~ The grounds are amazing! Beautiful lush gardens, pathways intertwined throughout and little nooks with chairs and benches to hang out with friends, rally up the kids or have that perfect moonlight kiss under the stars (PERFECT scene for the last of the three! i know from experience). The pools are all just beautiful, as others on this site have described. Also Love the tennis courts! They have 5 tennis courts, all in great condition.

Our view was over the back garden which was basically a fence, so that was not so hot, but we didn't mind. The resort itself is very good. It's not Dubai, so don't expect a never ending buffet and marble pillars, but the resort does itself justice. The pool is heated, and the depth is 3 - 5 feet so the kids could touch the bottom in areas. There are two wonderful hot tubs just off the pool, a table tennis table and a giant draughts set. It's very picturesque and the sunset over the bay is an attractive sight. There's a motor boat, jetski kayak rental on the beach, which we didn't use as the weather was not great. The beach is a manmade looking one, but it's fine for the kids. Jogging or rollerblading along the bayfront is fun, and there are bikes to rent. There's a very good children's playground about 7-10 mins walk along the waterfront. We travelled downtown to the convention centre, to balboa park and the zoo, as well as to seaworld - all by taxi, very easy short trips. Fashion mall is much better the name sounds, and has some good toy shops as well as a wide range of clothing. Food choices in the hotel are good, for both adults and kids, and the room service choices are good too. it's fairly gourmet and the quality is quite high. As it's off season now, we didn't have the full choice of dining as some of the venues were not open. The best thing about the hotel is the staff - exceptionally friendly and happy to please - Larry in the restaurant and Ramon on the front desk were great, but all the staff create a happy, easy going and helpful environment. The only annoying thing about the hotel is the lack of in room wifi - we went to the onsite convention centre to login to free wifi. Amenities - a very good hotel shop, helpful reception and conceriege, business centre, fed ex package handling, hotel shuttle - very helpful and individualised service, great value on zoo and sea world tickets (prices similar but many additional perks included esp sea world multi entry) Why not 5 stars - well it's just a little old, the choices are just a little limited compared to modern resort hotels esp in the Middle East and Asia, but the staff make up for all of this - it deserves a 4.5 rating.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Udon Thani, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cA Very Mixed Bag....\u201d", "Author": "JAMESINTHAILAND", "ReviewID": "UR126467903", "Content": "I just returned from an overnight visit to San Diego, staying at the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa on Mission Bay. The hotel really is a mixed bag - there are wonderful things about it, and some real negatives as well. Overall, my opinion is that I wouldn't return here, or recommend it to a friend - there are too many other, nicer hotels to choose from in the San Diego area. WHAT I LIKED: *Nice location right on Mission Bay. Sandy beach out front and miles of walking trails right from your doorstep. *Large room, newly-redecorated and furnished. *Appointments and amenities are very nice. *Big, flat-screened HD TVs in the rooms. *Room rate is moderate for the location. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: *Despite the fact that the furnishings and appointments in the rooms and public areas are renovated, the infrastructure itself is not. EG, things like the door locks, light switches, air conditioning units look straight out of the 70s. The hallways were stark. This gives the impression that the hotel was renovated recently, but on the cheap, and gives parts of the hotel a very dated look and feel. *The $32 DAILY fee for parking is absolute robbery! This hotel is not located in Manhattan or downtown San Francisco, and the owners/management should be ashamed of this policy. This alone is a deal-breaker in terms of my ever returning here. *They advertise availability of free Wi-Fi, but it turns out it is only available in the reception area and conference rooms (I could not get it in the lounges outside of the restaurant or by the pool). There is no Wi-Fi available in the rooms; you have to pay for wired access. This is deal-breaker #2 for me. COME ON HILTON PEOPLE, THIS IS 2012! *Bathrooms are small and shower/tub was very dated looking. *Swimming pool/jacuzzi area was attractive, but too small for a resort with this many rooms. It was filled to the brim on a Tuesday in mid-March; I can only imagine how overcrowded it must get on a sunny, Summer day when the resort is full and everyone wants to swim! As other reviewers have suggested, this is a hotel with a lot of potential. If they spent a few extra dollars to complete the renovations, installed Wi-Fi, and reduced the rate of their parking fee by about 75%, I would give this hotel five stars....", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DiamondGirl419", "Title": "\u201cNice property---great value!\u201d", "Author": "DiamondGirl419", "ReviewID": "UR126464289", "Content": "We booked this hotel through Priceline on a $79 per night bid. We weren't sure what to expect because of some of the reviews on Trip Advisor, but I can say that I was pleased with this property. We were assigned a room on the 6th floor tower across from the lobby and had wonderful views of Mission Bay and beyond. The balcony was furnished with a table and 2 chairs and made for quiet mornings as the sun came up. Our room was beautifully appointed--the room and bathroom appeared to have been the result of a recent remodel. Very comfy bed with a nightlite attached to the headboard for those who want to read if your traveling companion wants to sleep. Check-in was very easy and quick. We purchased coffee and yogurt every morning and both were delicious. Lunch at poolside was great---we had waitresses so you could order adult beverages and foods such as grilled chicken sandwiches or burgers. The prices were about the same as any other resort we've been to. We took a taxi service to this hotel from the airport rather than rent a car. Not worth renting a car since you have to pay for parking here as well as the cost of a rental. We were only staying here 2 nights as a layover on our way to Maui. The hotel does offer a shuttle service to Old Town San Diego and SeaWorld for free. Other destinations are available for a fee. This property is well landscaped and cared for. I loved it because I felt like we were on our own island area...very private even though you could look out past the property gates and watch all the joggers, walkers and runners on the paved path along Mission Bay. Hilton also has bike rentals and I believe boats of some sort too ( I saw a dock with Hilton's name on it).. When we were here, it was off-season, so the cabanas were free to sit under...Nice touch...69-72 degrees all day...just perfect! The only thing I can address with concern is that the hot tub was MUCH too hot. Most guests here complained about it. Yes, it should be more hot than warm, but this was very, very hot (and I CAN take a lot of heat)....So if I'm sayin' it's hot...it's WAY hot. I do not recommend immersing yourself for more than 30 seconds-whew! Would I stay here again? Absolutely!

Typically when I travel on business, or for a conference I stay at a Marriott and commute or walk to the other location. Because the Hilton is out on its own, and is a beautiful resort property we opted to stay onsite. After reading reviews about the price of parking we decided it'd be more cost effective to use a taxi to get from the airport, and to visit other areas. For our 3 night stay we ended up spending about $100 on taxi fares. This was to get to and from the airport, as well as round trip taxi service to and from Old Town, and Pacific Beach. I believe this was still much less expensive than the cost of a rental car, along with gas, and $32 a day parking which is highly excessive! Unfortunately San Diego is a driving town, and not having a car made us feel trapped. There are no restaurants, are markets even remotely close. You are pretty much required to only eat, drink, and buy any odds and ends you may need at the hotel. We needed sunscreen and paid $18 for it! Our room was located in the Tower on floor 4, and overlooked the lobby and driveway area, so we did not have a view. The rooms are decent, and the bed is pretty comfortable. However I think the rooms were designed by a man, as there was no full length mirror or decent lighting, something I desire when staying at a hotel. The room felt like a Vampires Liar. Another issue that did not affect us but did cause difficulty for other conference attendees was the cost of the internet, apparently not wireless in the room, and $15 a day. We had a 3G iPad, Thank Goodness! Now that my complaints are out of the way, I do think it's important to address the positives of this hotel. First and foremost is the service. The hotel staff is wonderful! Everyone is so nice and helpful. I did not run into one discourteous representative of this hotel, and I was there for almost four days straight so this says a lot. While I didn't get to use the pool area, it looked amazing! Luckily I was able to use the running path around the bay, which was great. The west side of the property was beautiful! I think this resort would be a great place to stay with your family, in one of the condo/suites on the bay side of the hotel. They appear to be fully equipped with kitchens, so you could prepare your own meals, pending you had a car to go to the market. I personally don't think I'd stay at this property again because of the parking. It's very expensive at $32 a day, and I just would never be willing to pay that along with a $200 plus per night room cost, and I'd never go to suburban San Diego again without a car. If they lowered their parking cost to say $15, I'd highly recommend this place for families. I'd also recommend it to you if money is no object. Which unfortunately isn't the case for me. ;-/", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herriman", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but showing it's 50 year old age.\u201d", "Author": "Moustacio D", "ReviewID": "UR126142724", "Content": "My family and I stayed here for a few days. Having been to some of the newer Five Star resorts in other parts of the world, this may be a stretch to put it in the same class as those other resorts. This resort is about 50 years old and it is missing some of the newer ammenities of new resorts like plugs, bigger bathrooms and more natural light. There were some cosmetic things that I noticed like knicks in the furniture, carpet that is coming unraveled and peeling paint off the ceiling. I didn't let this bother me. We got a room ugrade and we were able to walk right out our back door to Mission Bay beach. that was VERY nice. In fact, being in Mission Bay was really convenient. We were minutes from Sea World, the San Diego Zoo, Old Town, Seaport Village, the Gaslamp Dictrict and La Jolla. It was probably the most convenient location you could ask for. I am a loyal Hilton traveler and still had a pretty good experience there. A couple things to be aware of. Parking is $32 A DAY and they were doing some tree trimming and took up a lot of parking spaces near my room. As a result, I had to park far away and walk. Kind of a bite for $32 a day. I also had breakfast vouchers but they were only good for $13. I did not know that the first day. Still, the $13 is enough to get you plenty of food. One last thing, the service areas (i.e. laundry, back doors for employees, etc.) are not well hidden. As a result, you're walking through some dirty areas (or not as well maintained) to get to some places. The pool is nice and they had two hot tubs and a children's pool.

Because we were traveling with another couple we asked if we could have two rooms with king size beds. Even though we used the discounted website, the hostess cheerfully changed our rooms and quickly reassigned us two king size rooms. One room overlooked the freeway while the other one overlooked the bay. The room overlooking the freeway had several minor issues. The paint in the room was chipped just above the desk. The carpet was pulling back and frayed where it met the tile. The cold water did not work at the sink. The room was large and very comfortable overall. The other room had a nice view of the bay with no issues of which to speak. Both rooms were reasonably clean, with some dusting issues.

One downside is that my wife and I were forgotten at breakfast.

There are positives and negatives to the hotel. The negatives include the fact that *everything* is very pricey, so if you have already paid resort prices for the room, they will continue to overcharge you every chance they get. Parking - $30/night. Room service - ridiculous - for example if one person wanted to get cereal and coffee for breakfast, it would cost about $15, and about $20 after tax and service fees (20% tip is already included in the check). We didn't even try to eat at the fancy restaurant on-site, although it did look very nice. But for $30 an entree, we could get a nice meal outside the hotel for both of us and enjoy our night out. That brings me to another negative - the fact that the hotel is in a remote area, and having a rental car was necessary unless we only wanted to stay on the resort, or pay expensive shuttle prices to get anywhere. Another problem with the hotel was that the room was not exactly what I would consider a resort level of quality. The \"view\" was of the parking lot, but I was OK with that, as we did get a balcony and just being able to step outside into the sunny weather was nice. Another issue is that the bathroom did not have enough ventilation. The fan was very weak, and (at the risk of the manager implying that I'm being dishonest, as with another reviewer), YES, there was mold. There was a moderate amount of mold on the ceiling above the shower. It did not bother my health, however it is a problem, and if the rest of the bathrooms have such a lack of ventilation, I can only imagine how big the problem is throughout the hotel. The positives of the resort include that all the staff we encountered were great, including the service staff, front desk staff, and shuttle drivers. Everyone was helpful, the grounds were beautiful, and the pool and jacuzzi area were very nice. The location was convenient (only if you have a car), as it is close to the Old Town, Mission Bay, etc. It was great for taking walks, and they offer a variety of water sports and rentals at the resort.

Staff helpful, courteous and friendly. I had a very positive encounter in every instance (except one in the \"ugly\" section). 2. Especially great was Fernando in the Acqua Restaurant. I ate there four evenings. He was exceptional in his service, friendliness and knowledge of the wines and menu (and sorely missed the last evening). Food was excellent, but I think a little overpriced. E.g. dinner for one with a glass of wine was b/w $60-75. 3. I had a nice room - ground floor, bay view which was great for the mornings, and watching sunsets. Since I am a Hilton Honors Gold Elite, I got a free upgraded room, free continental breakfasts, and free internet. That was a great value on this property, and it's why, in part, I have brand loyalty to Hilton properties. Bed was super comfortable. 4. I had two chaise lounges outside my sliding doors that were very comfortable and perfect for enjoying the sunshine and watching people walking/running/enjoying the bay. 5. The property was quiet, restful and well-designed. It was nearly empty when I was there, so if it is packed at other times of the year, maybe the serenity would be lost. 6. Great looking pool area (although cool weather made it unusable for me, not their fault obviously), but in different conditions, I would have used it much more (there are jacuzzis, a larger pool, table tennis, etc. 7. You can rent a bike and other water sport equipment right at the resort. I did that twice, and took a ride over to Fiesta Island or along Mission Bay. Very nice. 8. Room was clean and cleaned well each day. Again, I want to emphasize the staff were all first rate, professional and courteous. BAD: 1. No wireless in rooms (a hotel of this scale should have wireless in the rooms, being tethered to an 8 inch ethernet cord on the \"desk\" was a real hassle). 2. No business style desk. Very small surface space with an uncomfortable chair. They would do well to cater a little more to business travelers (wireless, a decent desk and comfortable desk chair would go a long way). A couple of other minus: 3. The door entering my building would never lock closed, so anyone could walk off the beach and into the building without a key card, didn't leave me feeling very secure. 4. Overnight parking for guests is $28 per night (pretty ridiculous for a location that isn't downtown), it effectively doubles your rental car costs. 5. Ducks were in the pool most of the time I was there (pretty gross), pool area unstaffed. 6. There is a Marketplace onsite for snacks, but be prepared to pay a lot, i.e. $2.50 for a Dr. Pepper, $9.00 for a bag of chips and a Naked Juice, $15 for a small bundle of wood for my fire pit. 7. Other charges to be aware of, wired internet access is $11.95 per day (unless it is comped b/c of your Hilton Honors status). That, plus paying for overnight parking adds $40 a night to your price, good to keep in mind if you are following a budget. BTW, $11.95 is per device. UGLY: My one negative experience with a staff decision was when I took the complimentary shuttle to SeaWorld when I had a free morning. It is advertised as leaving every morning at 10. I scheduled my short time at SeaWorld and the shows as exact as I could to maximize my time, knowing we were 5 minutes from SeaWorld. Once we were on the shuttle, the driver announced he was going to take someone to the airport and we would \"get a tour of San Diego\" So, once underway, instead of turning right for a 3 minute drive to the Sea World entrance (again, very close to the hotel), the driver decided to turn left and drove me and two other guests who also got on the shuttle to go to SeaWorld, all the way to the San Diego airport to drop off a fourth passenger who wasn't in any particular hurry to get to the airport. Instead of a 5 minute drive to SeaWorld we took a 35 minute drive to SD airport, missing the first morning show at the park. Very disrespectful of the three passengers going to Sea World and unnecessary, by the admission of the fourth passenger who was going to the airport, and hadn't requested a rush. OVERALL: If you have a family, its a nice central location to SeaWorld, LegoLand, Zoo, etc. and located on the beach. Potentially romantic location for a couple, esp. if you get a bayside with the two chaise lounges and fire pit.

Our rooms were peaceful and in great locations looking out onto the bay. There is the wonderful and sunny park located next to the resort on both sides of the property. Perfect for walking or jogging. Plus it's relaxing to just watch the kayakers, rowers, and boarders. The property was beautifully maintained- pool area (beautiful with the clean and updated cabanas), and hot, clean hot tubs. Everything was just great. The staff (all of them, front desk, restaurant folks, front desk manager, maintenance people) were extremely nice, helpful and professional. We dined twice in the beautiful California-style restaurant. Just great!! The patio dining was perfect, beautiful weather, etc. We did not want to leave! Yes this is a resort, and yes resorts are typically more expensive than regular hotels. There is a spa onsite with beauty and massage services, and there is rental for bicycles and other fun stuff.

Let's face it, it's in the middle of Mission Bay, minutes from Pacific Beach and the I-5, easily access to San Diego but offers a good location to stay away from it all when you need it. The hotel itself is pretty big, spread out across few buildings. From the outside it looks like a resort to begin with and it doesn't look very aged even if it has that old charm feeling to it. Somehow it was very well blended together. Bottom line, from the moment you step into the property, you feel relaxed. However don't feel too relaxed as the property is popular for parties (the night I spent held 3 wedding together), and public does has access to the property (to a certain degree) 24/7. If you are not a big fan of the teenagers/kids, you might want to ask for a private corner room that's away from the bay. I stayed at the bay front room with a fire pit, and foot traffic is almost a constant thing especially with the bay front rooms. But the patio/fire pit has a lawn separating your private and public property. Bottom line it has a respectable distance from your privacy and the view (public). The room itself is very colorful and cozy. However the bathroom needs bit more lighting as the shower is almost impossible to get sufficient light inside. Oh yes and the water pressure can use a little more help as the shower head designed to work best with higher pressure seems just spitting out drips of mist instead of a down pour of water. Here's a tip you might find very useful, BE CAREFUL WITH THE KEY CARDS! And I mean it, they are very, VERY weak. Not sure if the cards themselves or the locks are causing the problem but if you keep your card close to anything that emits any electrical magnetic field (i.e. your cellphone, even your own credit cards) it'll deem your room keycard useless and getting a replacement card 2 in the morning at the front desk doesn't sound like fun if it happens to you. When you are about to get some rest, hit the bed and close your windows/sliding doors. You will forget about all the above and simply felt asleep quickly as the bed is just like all the beds Hilton offers, comfortable and great to sleep on. Beddings too! Entertainment wise, the pool is a great place to relax and well, swim. They do have a kids pool for the kids but it seems like the resident ducks are using it as their own pool. Better than rubber ducks if that's what your kids like. The regular pool is well lit, designed and very nice to swim in. Oh there are two, yes count it, TWO hot tubs. The poolside services are a bit slow but very professional and prompt. Personally I found the best entertainment is to purchase 3 to 4 bags of duck feed (at $1.5 each, no tax) at the shop next to the duck pound and just sit there and feed the ducks. It can provide at least 15 minutes of fun PER bag. It lasted me an hour and lots of silly, innocent fun. Now to the downside... PARKING. Let's be honest, it's not cheap to park anywhere in San Diego, tourist or not. This place is no exception neither. It cost a bit and if you really want a place to park, arrive early. You can try to park outside else where but do keep your eye on the parking regulation signs as getting towed or a ticket isn't always worth it. Over all this property offers a good view if you can afford it, great for family but business/couples do seek somewhere else (look north) as this place is filled with family and foot traffic might interrupt your privacy. However if you want a convint location with a good view of the Mission Bay, this is your choice.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterbury, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with great service a few minutes outside of city!

When we arrived, the two restaurants were closed for repairs, with a temporary setup in the ballroom. In addition the pool bar was closed -we were initially told this was due to the end of summer.

When we asked what was going on, the manager on duty actually admitted to not knowing what was going on in his own hotel. It went downhill from there and we contacted our travel agent to move us out elsewhere - which we did. Things happen but the way they were handled meant we had no faith in the management here at all. For the record, we were given a $50 discount for the inconvenience but for us, this in no way equated for it. Aside from this, the room we were assigned in the Tower for the short duration was very nice and well appointed. If you have a car, expect to pay $28 per night for parking. If you don't have a car, this hotel is ok if you are happy to stay on site or be prepared for an expensive taxi bill, otherwise you may feel 'trapped'. The drinks menu had no prices on it so we had to keep awkwardly asking staff which was annoying. Although the food was good, we were only offered the same, limited restaurant menu and I ate the same thing on the two consecutive evenings, so this would have been a problem for a long stay unless you have means to get off site - you cannot simply walk to an alternative here.

It is presented as an upscale resort style hotel and we splurged for a garden villa, expecting a true Hilton experience. I am sorry to say, we were disppointed and felt misled by the resort presentation on the Hilton website. First of all, the hotel seemed to be trying to squeeze money out of its guests at every turn. The website says each room features high speed internet. Nowhere is a mention of this being not free. Only when you click on individual rooms' info, do they have a tiny notice saying there might be additional fees. By the way, the internet connection is per cable (no wireless) and costs $11.95 per 24 hours. The breakfast is not included in the price of the room and adds up quickly, as does the parking charge of $28 per night. There is an outdoor pool on the property, with a small paddling pool for toddlers next to it. There are lounge chairs around the pool, free of charge, and then shaded cabanas that need to be rented and reserved in advance. I didn't ask how much they were to rent, but considering that there was no mention of the actual price anywhere in the hotel add or the notice at the pool, AND the outrageous prices of poolside snacks, I can only imagine it was just as overpriced as everything else in this hotel. A small ice cream bar cost $5 by the pool. There were notices telling people no outside drinks or food were allowed by the pool, I guess to encourage people to spend ridiculous amounts of money on drinks and snacks. There is beach nearby and Hilton has its own boat dock there as well. You can rent a jetski for $99 PER HOUR, for example. The front desk staff were lukewarm at best. One night I found someone's lost room key card, took it to the front desk, waited almost 10 minutes in line to return it, saying I found it lying around near the pool bar. No thanks, nothing, just a very bored \"Oh yeah?\" and the woman took the card and that was that. I booked the room as a package which gave me a 50-dollar credit towards the spa services, which the front desk confirmed at check-in. Later on I had a manicure at the spa, the manicure was $45 but they add 20% gratuity automatically to each bill, and that plus tax meant my total was $63. I told the spa coordinator that I had a $50 spa credit, she called the front desk to confirm it, and then told me should couldn't deduct the credit from my bill, but the front desk would do that at check-out for me. No problem. Of course, when the bill came the day of our check-out, the spa charge was there, all $63 of it. So I had to go to the front desk to get it cleared up. I told the man they forgot to apply the $50 spa credit, expecting a sincere \"I'm so sorry\". He couldn't have been less interested. Looked into the computer, then said \"Yeah, there is a credit.\" He didn't say anything else, so I politely asked for an updated bill. He said yeah, all right, and I was still standing there and he finally realized that I wanted the correct bill, like, you know, NOW. He asked \"Do you want me to print it now?\" I said YES. He asked: \"I can just send it to you as an email.\" I said I'd prefer it printed out right then. He FINALLY did it and gave me the updated bill. This whole thing was like pulling teeth. Seriously, is it so hard to do your job? Now, there were POSITIVE aspects to the hotel resort as well. We ate at the Olive bar one evening and the food was very good and the service fast and accurate. Our room was clean and had a small balcony. There was a small fridge and a safe. The housekeeping ladies were all very friendly and our room was always nicely cleaned and tidied. The location of the Hilton resort was good, right in the Mission Bay, near the beach and a park with picnic areas and a playground. The nail tech at the spa was very nice and friendly. We had expected more from the Hilton and it speaks for itself when I say that you can getter better value for your money at the Hampton Inn (by Hilton) than a Hilton Resort.

Could not check in until 4:00pm (which was OK as we were at Sea World for the day). When checking in the \"night\" staff were most unfriendly, almost like robots. When we asked about the parking fee our question was met with (and I'm paraphrasing) \"Well your other option is to park elsewhere and have to walk back which will be about 40 minutes.\" But it was more the way it was said as opposed to what was said, very curt. SO, we had no choice really but to pay the $28 per night fee. When we got to our room, there was absolutely NO spaces near our room. We had to walk a good distance with our luggage, and for that we could have parked \"elsewhere\" for free. So I did call the front desk and she was able to credit the parking back to us, but again curt. When booking online, the type of room we thought we were getting was \" ... two queen beds in one of our two story villas...\". For the price it sounded right however, it was a tiny little room with two queen beds stuffed inside that was in a two story complex (Villa??). SO, I called again to the front desk to see if there has been a mix up with our reservation, and, what a shock, curtly was told \"..this is what was booked...\". So I asked to be moved to a larger room (not to mention the light in the bathroom was out). WELL, I may as well have insulted someone's mother by the way that was received. I was being, umm, placated and they sort of considered my request. I only had to call back two times to get someone to call me back to tell me there was a room with a king bed available. Having three people and one being a teen, that wasn't going to work. So in our tiny over priced room we stayed. Now, the day staff...FANTASTIC!! From the pool attendants, to the Concierge to the gals at the front desk to the staff at the restaurants. No complaints whatsoever. The up side is, the Hotel is in a good location with close proximity to most things. Rentals, (bikes and water toys) are right at the back steps. But there are so many other hotels, I am sure with the same caliber or higher, which will most certainly get our future business.

We spent two nights in the Gaslamp District on a business trip and then wanted a more \"vacation\" area to relax and chose the Hilton in Mission Bay to spend our remaining two days and nights. The front desk folks were great and put an expidite on getting our room cleaned as we were checking in early. While we waited for the room, we got a key to the pool area and started checking out the area. The Hotel is located in the middle of the Mission Bay parks and there is an OVERABUNDANCE of great walking and biking trails. The hotel pool is adequately sized but of course crowded in the middle of the day in the summer. The pool bar/restaurant has reasonably priced drinks and food. The Hotel Restaurant, where we ate two nights, has a traditional hotel priced menu BUT they offered a prix fix menu of appetizer/meal/dessert which was a good deal. We were not disappointed with either meal we had. Breakfast is served in this same main restaurant or you can get coffe and a quick bite at a \"Starbucks\" type coffee shop. The hightlight of our short trip was spending Saturday \"touring around\" the Mission Bay area on bikes rented at the hotel. Dan, the bike tender, was GREAT and gave us a perfect map of the area and where we could bike. He had us get the best bikes and made sure the bike tires were perfect. Then he suggested a great place for breakfast/brunch, The Eggery on Mission Beach and fully explained all the little areas we could get tripped up on when following the bike trail signs. So, at 8:30am we were off our our biking excursion. We biked halfway around Mission Bay, around Seaworld, over the bridge and onto the beach boardwalk. We biked up and down the boardwalk, found the Eggery and had a GREAT breakfast, then walked all over the area, onto the Pier, got our feet wet in the cold ocean and did ALOT of people-watching. We got back on our bikes, were up and down the boardwalk again and then followed the other half of the bike trail back to the hotel. It was amazing to see the hundreds of locals taking advantage of the Mission Bay parks with picnics, birthday parties, company outings, baby showers....you name it! It was a SUPER workout and when we returned to the hotel at 3:30 - 7 hours later - , we calculated that we probably biked about 20 miles that day! It did not seem like it at all since the weather was PERFECT, with a nice breeze. I would HIGHLY recommend doing this to everyone. It is mostly flat, so even using the one-speed crusier bikes was fine. The hotel does charge you per hour for the bike but a full day maxes out at a 4 hour charge. Yes, there are a TON of other things to do in the area but our day of biking is something we will never forget and look forward to coming back and doing this again.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Santa Margarita, California", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location for San Diego vacation\u201d", "Author": "Stevensmom", "ReviewID": "UR117148643", "Content": "I have stayed at this Hilton for years.

Not quite ultra luxury bath like a Four Seasons, but really well done. Every hotel employee we encountered was gracious, genuine, and helpful.

The sunsets were great as well as the fireworks from SeaWorld every night (at least in summer). It was a convenient location with regard to getting around San Diego, right off I-5. We got to/from the airport in less than 10 minutes; LaJolla was an easy 20 to 30 minute drive; Old Town just an exit or two away; San Diego Zoo 15 minute drive; and of course SeaWorld was 5 minutes away! You do need a car if you stay at this location and want to get around. Although the location is convenient to the highway etc., the resort is in a isolated location i.e. nothing within walking distance. However, the hotel is full service and there is a restaurant/bar (Acqua & Olive), casual pool bar/restaurant, coffee shop (Aroma), full gift shop/convenience store, spa/gym/tennis courts (which we didn't happen to use), water sports. It does have a \"beach\" technically but it's the bay. So if you are looking for a true beach experience i.e. Pacific Ocean - you'll have to head out to one of the several beaches. It does cost $25 per day to park here which we knew ahead of time but it's worth mentioning again since it seems to be a surprise to some based on the reviews. It seems to be a family-friendly place - lots of kids at the pool and lots of kids activities at the pool. They had a family movie night one night at the pool; another night S'mores on the beach.

I was very impressed how clean and updated the resort was. As soon as we stepped foot on the property I was greeted by a friendly staff and helpful service. I instantly new we had chosen the right place for our family vacation. The front desk staff was very knowledgeable about the area and answered all questions that I had. When we arrived at our room, we were able to park directly in front of our door which was a huge plus considering parking in San Diego is hard to find. Once we were in our room we not disappointed. The room was very clean, large and it had a huge sliding glass door. When that door was all the way open, it seemed as if the entire patio and outdoors were part of the room. We had a garden view room which allowed us to watch our children play in a large grass area while my wife and I had a glass of wine on the patio. When the kids were bored with the lawn area we were only steps from the pool and the beach. With this hotel being on the bay it allowed my two boys to play in the sand and water yet not have the fear of them being tackled by large waves or the crowd of Mission Beach. The pool and restaurants are top notch. The pool is large and has an awesome relaxing atmosphere...a real oasis (plus it has a kiddie pool for the little ones). The restaurant on site has spectacular views of the bay where my family and I were able to watch wind surfers from the patio and enjoy our meal. Because the resort is on the boardwalk we had the opportunity to explore all of Mission Bay by way of walking or by bike. We actually rented a four seater bike (through the Hilton) and cruised the boardwalk for an hour. What a great way to cover lots of ground yet still be able to appreciate your surroundings. Finally, what is a San Diego trip with the family without visiting the parks? This place is is practically on Sea World's grounds it's so close, it's around the corner from the San Diego Zoo, and a few miles from Old Town and Mission Beach. Perfect location!! But to be completely honest, my family and I would have been perfectly content staying at the resort all weekend and never attempting to battle the holiday crowds.

The hotel is also located just a few minutes from Old Town. We went to Old Town for lunch and it was a great place to walk and spend a few hours. I must admit, it is a little expensive to stay there and the $25 dollar a night parking fee is a bit excessive. There were a lot of cars and it was difficult at times to get a parking spot.

For me, resort means offering everything you need on the property for a complete vacation. If you use that idea then this property is certainly a full service hotel but not a resort. So before I go too far and you think this is a terrible hotel let me say we would go back. It's just that you need to temper your expectations. This is not a luxury resort. It's a very nice hotel in a good location (near Sea World and on the bay) that fits well with families with young children. There is a small kiddie pool (1 foot deep) and the main pool only gets to 5 feet deep and is 3 feet deep in most places- so our 4 year old had a great time by just avoiding the middle of the pool. It also draws a family crowd so he had plenty of kids to mess around with whenever he was poolside. Their kids camp is only offered in the summer months (another reason they are not a resort in my opinion) so that was not available, making the poolside encounters that much more important. As we experienced with HIlton in Hawaii we do wish they would put a bit more heat in their heated pools- it was not ice cold as it was in Hawaii but it could have been a bit warmer to make staying in a bit easier. They also had a great food option for those not wanting the full service restaurant: a 7-day happy hour with half price starters and drinks. It made grabbing a quick meal each evening much more affordable and was certainly good enough for us on several occasions. The issue is there is only the 1 restaurant and the bar area so leaving the property was inevitable unless you are really a creature of habit or just there for a long-weekend. Where is the hotel lacking? First, they charge $25/day for self parking. This is essentialy a suburban hotel so that struck me as way too expensive. Second, our expectation of the beach was quite different than the reality- it's not a sit out and sun yourself beach- it's a narrow strip of sand separated from the hotel by the bay-side walking/biking trail (the trail was a nice feature for getting out of the hotel). The rooms are spacious enough and in good (but not great) shape. The TV was new but the signal sketchy if you touched it. The two reading lights besides the beds didn't work at all and the chain on the lamp by the window pulled off on Night 1 (thankfully in the 'off' position). They also went a bit too far with the cheap flourescent bulb in the can light near the doorway which gave a harsh light when it was turned on (and was the only light in the room besides 2 lamps) that made us prefer to leave it off- and we were down to 1 table lamp for the whole room. They would fix things as you called- but you had to call. The shower on/off handle clearly looked like it was added on when the original one broke as it simply didn't look like it belonged there. They also have the old, what I call atomic toilets whose sound resonates for several floors - you will know when your neighbors above have gone to the bathroom and only a sound sleeper can sleep through a toilet flush in the room. So a bit more attention to detail would be nice. But the rooms are comfortable (though with the usual glut of pillows on the beds) and spacious enough. They also have two other features I wish they highlighted more clearly: refrigerators and an in-room safe. Being able to stock the small fridge was great but we were not aware it was there when booking. The safe is always nice given how much we just seem to have that has some value. The food was fine- good not great. It met our needs but we headed for other places just for variety. The larger number of CPK and other food boxes/bags suggested others felt the same way. It was nice to have poolside bar service though we found it odd in this day and age that the female servers were blonde and in short-shorts and short-sleeved shirts while the men practically had no skin showing besides their hands and faces. It's not offensive to me but it is a bit too obvious to go overlooked. So for a good hotel in a great location consider this property. It's not a value option by any means but it was a nice, comfortable base for our 7 days in San Diego. Hopefully they can smooth out some of the rough edges and it could be a really great place.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLIARS!\u201d", "Author": "Zandronovo", "ReviewID": "UR105038158", "Content": "The front desk people are liars!

We enjoyed being on the gentler waters of Mission Bay rather than the busy loud neighborhoods of some of the oceanfront hotel areas.

We were on the 6th floor of the tower portion, and wished we were closer to the lower main hotel area. We had asked for a water view and it did qualify as that, and we were thankful not to be on the east side which faced Hwy 5! We got in after a long day's travel so we were just thankful to get to bed that night. The tower was obviously an older section, redone nicely, but the room's ventilation system smelled old damp and musty. It was too cold out to leave the screen to the balcony open to get fresh air all night. That would be nice in the summer though. We would request a non-tower room for that reason and one other. The motor noise and exhaust from shuttles, buses, limos taxis and etc that were allowed to idle between the tower and the front entrance created more echo and smell than they realize! Even a beer truck pulled by and honked me out of bed one morning at 8 AM. Thanks, Bud Light. Yeah, I should have complained. The restaurant was very nice, but maybe too nice. The whole family enjoyed the breakfast buffet, but it was too expensive for us to do every morning. It cost us almost $100 for a family of four each day with tip! That was a bit of a problem at dinner too. After tramping around the theme parks, zoos and etc. we would have loved a more casual option in the hotel for dinner.

Overall, there is nothing inherently wrong with the resort, but it just underwhelmed me. First, off the pictures on the website made it look as though this resort was on the ocean proper. Yeah, I guess if you look really closely and read very carefully you will be able to discern that the water in the pictures is from more of a river that is located behind the hotel. Just know---this is not the ocean. The water is dead still and the beach isn't that great. Yeah, they have boats and things to rent, but the water is pretty unimpressive, unless you have never been to a real ocean before. The Hilton is located in the middle of a large park, as well, so there are plenty of people around and the walkways are filled with people riding bikes--not very nice to walk on (good for riding bikes though). The grounds look pretty nice, so I can give that a plus. The pool seemed too small for the resort, and though it was nice, is guaranteed to be crowded, all the time. This is a pretty good area to check out some beach bodies, however. I am a Hilton Diamond VIP and though I wasn't treated poorly, I never felt as though I was being treated any different than the average Joe, despite the hundred plus nights I stay at Hilton properties yearly. This is ok for a Hampton Inn, but at a resort I feel as though this is a bit of an insult. The hotel check in time is 4pm, which is fine, but I tried to check in about 45 minutes early, and was told that the room wasn't ready and that it was a nice room and that i should wait and they will call me when it was ready. Other people were checking in and going to their rooms, so I thought \"this must be a really nice room and I am getting upgraded like I should be given my Diamond status\". I wait till 4pm and they call me to let me know my room is ready. I go to the room and it is just a regular room (#406 on 02/12/11-02/13/11)!!! No different than any other Hilton hotel in the U.S. No different than any other regular room in the hotel, except that the outside area, which are nice and have a couch/bed thing, is connected to another rooms outside area, because we are a corner room! The building we are in is shaped like an L, and our room and the room next to us are on opposing sides of the inside of the elbow. So our outside area is virtually unusable, unless you like being that close to your neighbor with no separating feature (the rest of the rooms have a wall). That was a disappointment, especially after I waited thinking I was getting an upgrade to a \"nice room\". The room wasn't bad, again standard Hilton, but wasn't \"special\", I expected more from a \"resort\" though. It was particularly noisy, however. It seemed to have a \"water running through pipes\" sound that never ceased, even at night. Anytime anyone walked by and was talking we heard the conversation loud and clear, because the front door had qaurted inch gaps on all sides between it and the jamb. Not a big deal in warm San Diego, but not a good sound dampening system. There is only one restaurant (that I found--the hotel info book is useless), which is the same as any other Hilton. We ate breakfast at the restaurant, \"Acqua\" (Diamond VIPs get free breakfast, which is nice), and it was really pretty good, so I can't complain there. You will need a car, though, if you plan on eating anything that isn't $30 a course. I wasn't charged for parking, but you are normally supposed to pay, and so I give them credit for not charging me, I guess that makes up for any other lack of VIP benefit. We also were given two bottles of water at check-in for being VIP members, so again they did give me some benefits. This hotel is nice for what it is---a hotel, but as far as being a resort, just know that it has that title predominantly because it has a spa. I probably wouldn't recommend it unless you got a great deal and you just need a place to stay,---like a regular Hilton.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Everett, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "DFNizzi", "ReviewID": "UR96476452", "Content": "Arrived at check-in early and was warmly greeted by William and Angie.

We booked two rooms at the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa as part of a Southwest Vacation package, and we stayed from 1/1/11 to 1/6/11. Our package included two free nights per room, which turned out to be a great deal. I was completely satisfied with our room accomodations, and would highly recommend the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa. When we checked in, our room was not quite ready, as it was early in the afternoon. The young lady at the desk asked for our cell phone number and told us they would call when our room was ready. She gave us a key we could use to look around the hotel property, then we headed for Balboa Park. When we got back at 4:00 p.m., we had not received a call, so I just assumed they forgot to call. Actually, the room still wasn't ready, so they upgraded us to a better room! We got a very spacious room on the second floor of one of the wings with a great view of the ocean. We thought it might be noisy, because I-5 is very close to the hotel, but our room was exceptionally quiet. The boys had a room on the first floor which wasn't quite as spacious as ours, but still had a great ocean view. The beds were awesomely comfortable - I slept like a baby. We had one minor maintenance issue (the bathroom door squeaked which was annoying when we had to get up at night), but that was quickly resolved when I told the folks at the front desk. The property was lovely. Even though it was unseasonably cold in San Diego, the boys used the pool (which was heated nicely, according to them) and the hot tub, which they really enjoyed. I used the fitness center, which was nicely appointed with treadmills & ellipticals and weight equipment. I struck up a conversation with a local woman who was on another elliptical, and she told me that she had a membership to the fitness center there. It is pretty upscale. It even had a changing room with a sauna, lockers with digital locks and showers. There were plenty of towels. We did not eat at the hotel, but I did get coffee and danish at the coffee shop by the registration area. I waited in line for about 15-20 minutes to get my breakfast items - that was the only thing I would say could have been improved. There was only one gentleman working behind the counter, and although he was friendly, he seemed a bit overwhelmed. There was a steady stream of people waiting. There was a $25/day fee for parking, but since I knew about it and was expecting it, there was no surprise. Because the hotel was right by I-5, we were able to easily access all parts of the city with our rental car, so we explored from Coronado and points south to Torrey Pines State Reserve to Temeculah and the wine country north of San Diego. We had a wonderful trip to San Diego, and the hotel stay was part of it. I would certainly stay there again, and I would also go back to San Diego.

Easy access to I-5 within minutes. (2) Nice Pool (3) Well manicured grounds (4) Friendly check-in hotel & maintenance staff (5) Parking in front of the room is very convenient (6) Starbucks on resort property is a plus (7) Maid service was first rate (leave a small tip each day, it is the right thing to do) CONS ===== (1) Not a true 4(four) star hotel, 3(three) at best as this is an older place that does show it's age. Bathroom are the worst, mold/grime is clearly visible on the caulking and ceiling; the need to be gutted. Upon room review, make sure to check the bathroom first and immediately request a different room at the first sign of disrepair! (2) Parking is ridiculous at $25 a night. Even if this place had a 24-hour security guard/gate it still would not be worth it. Hilton take note, Disneyland charges $15 dollars a day and they have FULL security with cameras, come on, get with it. Stop gouging us!!!! Had to budget around this cost all week, dissapointing! (3) Restaurant albeit good, WAY too expensive. NOTE: if parking were less, perhaps it could be justified. (4) Extra cost for the exercise room, nonsense for a supposed 4(four) star hotel this should be included. (5) Bay is not that pretty at all; very murky resembles more of a retention pond. Having a bay view just is not worth it....don't pay for it. NOTE: this place is not near the OCEAN, don't be fooled! (6) There were bugs in the rooms, several small spider bugs and pinchers were present. FINAL THOUGHTS =============== (1) Hotel staff during my entire 8(eight) day stay never bothered to call to check in and see if everything was ok. Very poor customer service. Four(4) star hotels are concerned with their guests comfort.....didn't seem like they were interested. (2) If you can get room for $70/80 a night, it is ok, otherwise pass on this place as there are much better places to stay in the San Diego area (Imperial (Cornado), Mission and Solana beaches, LaJolla, Carsbad, Del Mar and or Oceanside.

I am a seasoned traveler and I know the difference between BAYVIEW and BAYFRONT. Apparently the people at Hilton do not know the difference. My room was room 310 in the villas. It was on the side of the building, not the front. The so called bayfront view was blocked by a three foot cement wall so you really couldn't see the bay. The room (310) was a disgrace. Wallpaper peeling the bathroom, toggle on switch missing, lamp not working, tv reception crappy, floors dirty, sprinkler in hallway outside the room leaking, dark rooms. What a dive!

I had picked the naval base because we were splurging to stay at the Disneyland Grand Californian later in the trip. My husband is military and this is one of our final trips before he deploys. The are surrounding the base was less than desired and because my husband had just gotten off work when we left for the airport he needed a nap. I decided to bid on priceline for a 4* last minute and was given the lovely Hilton Resort and Spa for only $10 more than what we were paying at the base. I was a little worried as the reviews are mixed. I would definitely give this hotel a 3.5*/4* for its wonderful amenities. We were given a villa in the Remo area which was on the ground floor and had a patio and a HUGE lawn area that our son could burn off steam. He didn\u2019t need to do this as the beach was right there and he rather spend his time playing in the sand. The beach looked like it was racked every morning and there was a pathway that went up and down the beach and many people used for running. The pools were wonderful too. There was a kiddie pool and bigger pool with a zero entry. There was a also a spa, with a wonderful view of the beach. Some areas of the hotel could have used a better cleaning (i.e. the waterfall and pools and wine glasses sat by room for 2 days), but they were not that bad. The room was an average room, with a refrig. The room had some areas that were worn as the other reviewers had stated, but I found them good enough. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was updated with granite countertops. We were not in the room that much as we utilized the beach a lot. We used the refrig to store milk and drinks for breakfast. The front desk attendant also mentioned that if we needed a microwave that we could rent one for $20 a day or I could just ask the restaurant to heat up my sons toddler meals. There was free wifi in the courtyard area and happy hour from the bar is everyday from 5-7pm. They will even give you a drink in a plastic cup so you could sit outside by the pool. The parking was the only outrageous thing at the resort ($25 a day) and to be honest we are not even sure they went around to look for the ticket hanging in the window. I had left it off most of the time and we didn\u2019t have one problem. All and all, I would highly recommend this resort for anyone with little ones (our son is 2 1/2), looking for a hotel on the beach (although I wouldn\u2019t swim in the water-too cold), a wonderful pool area, especially with the zero entry and a kiddie pool.

We thought the breakfast was very good, and an evening meal though expensive was enjoyable, we decided it was worth the extra for the ambience. However, we stayed in the two storey rooms on the corridors overlooking the gardens and the corridors were quite shockingly tired, the corridor we walked through to get the hotel (100's I think) was very smelly, rather like a sewer and reminded me of a youth hostel - definitely not 4 star, more like 2.

The walls are a bit thinner than you'd expect from a hotel of this class, however. The overall feel of the resort is good, with lots of open areas and seating. The pool area is nice but becomes a bit crowded during the day, but the beach is just a few steps away so it's easy to find a spot. It's along Mission Bay which has a great walking trail. As for location, it's great for what it is. You're not in the middle of everything but Mission Bay is beautiful and offers lots to do. If you're looking for nightlife or shopping you'd be better served to look elsewhere. We have 2 small children and they had a great time at the pool and at the beach, and unlike at some other properties we did not feel uncomfortable having our children with us. That said, the service leaves something to be desired. There were a number of little issues that left us feeling like this is a 3 star service hotel, not a 4. A few examples: some of the restaurant service was quite slow, although the waitstaff was uniformly friendly. Also, the bathrooms in the restaurant were not well maintained. Of 3 sinks, 2 did not have any soap in the dispensers, and my wife informed me that the waste baskets in the women's restrooms were overflowing (and not during a particularly busy time). The food was very good to occasionally exceptional, however, though quite expensive. As for other staff, they were mostly helpful with an occasional exception. For example, a linen cart deliveryman was at the the elevators and occupied the 1st to arrive without offering it to waiting guests. It was not like there was an endless stream of people waiting, either. It's things like this that can make people paying premium rates feel less than valued as customers. If the resort were to fix these small but quite important details it could, given its location and otherwise good offerings, be considered a true 4 star resort. And of course, no review would be complete without a complaint about the ridiculous charges assessed by most hotels in this class. No free Internet in the rooms? $25 to park when this is not a downtown location? These things leave one feeling as if Hilton is picking one's pockets. Coupled with the overall level of service, I would have to say this is a 3 star, not a 4. Good, but not great.

However, once I booked it, I had a feeling this wasn't going to go well before we even got there. The hotel didn't return my calls for starters, then we got there and were given a single King when I had requested a double Queen. They brought a rollaway instead - after we waited quite a while for it. (Granted, I did get a call from the front desk asking if it had been delivered yet, which it hadn't). They didn't even bring it IN the room; they knocked and presented it to us (I was traveling with a friend), and WE had to roll it into the room, move furniture around so it would fit, and set it up, which then made a desk and chair unusable because it was too tight. When we checked in, I asked for a manager to call me in the room to discuss the parking situation. They charge $25/day for parking (ridiculous, given they have plenty of room for guest parking). I am disabled and have a disabled parking permit. I wanted them to reduce or waive the parking fee. The manager never called me. I ended up with a \"supervisor\" being brought out to speak with me as I checked OUT (not a manager). He did halve the parking fee and said \"next time\" I stayed there, they would be sure to \"take care of me\" - shouldn't they be \"taking care of me\" from the moment I make the reservation?!? I even told him we were not done with our vacation but were so disappointed by the room and service that we had decided to stay our prepaid 3 nights because I couldn't get a refund, but that we were going to stay at another hotel for the 4th night. That was an opportunity for him to comp a room for our last night, but he didn't make that choice. My travel buddy had breakfast there one morning: $22 for a measly meal. And I had martinis at the bar one night - $14 each! Crazy! Even the bartender recommended not ordering certain desserts because they were \"the size of a MINI Reese's peanut butter cup\". MINI, mind you. Peace and quiet? Only rarely - on the one hand, seeing the SeaWorld fireworks every night might have been fun, but they didn't even mention it on check-in, so we were startled every night by the booming noises from across the bay and didn't get out in time to see the whole show. Not to mention the \"young adults\" who were running around our small building of units, outside our door, and knocking plates and glasses over on the room service tray we had set outside by our door. Oh, don't forget: there is a fee for EVERYthing. Parking, wi-fi, gym access, etc. A total ripoff. The room was dated, very dark. There was a floor lamp that I couldn't figure out how to turn on; ends up it has a foot switch, but it was so dark on the floor in the corner where it sits that I couldn't see it. Why didn't someone come and orient us to the room? We did have \"Doug,\" a kind of shabby but nice older man unload the bags from our car but that was it.

I rang & was told to ring room service for a cup of tea. The in-room booklet says there is a mini-bar - there is not, only a small noisy little fridge (empty) in the wardrobe. I spoke to the Concierge (who tried to be very helpful) and said she would get room service to bring hot water, tea bags and fresh milk to our room - an hour later, she gave up and bought a cup of Earl Grey tea at the adjoining coffee shop and brought it up to our room with sachet milk. Half an hour later, room service finally turned up with hot water only. How hard can this be!!! We went out between 10am & 2.30pm - no maid service - there is a notice in our room on whilch you can request a servicing time - we requested 5pm. When we arrived back at 11pm - no room servicing - we rang and asked for fresh towels. We noticed also that the top sheet had stains on it. I went out the next day and purchased my own tea bags and fresh milk.

You get the sense that the owners know their location is great for families and they do just enough upkeep to keep people interested in staying there. There are definitely pluses: the beds are very comfortable, staff tries to be accommodating, and it has a pool, spa and conference center. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure, in room safe and refrigerator were all pleasant surprises. Great access to I-5, Sea World, downtown and coastal beach towns. The property sits right on the beach with a large (cement) \"boardwalk\" walking/biking path running alongside the bay. If you like taking a walk/riding a bike on a scenic path right outside your door this is perfect. Mission Bay is beautiful and very peaceful on winter weekdays. The pool looked very nice, and the conference center seemed to be in better shape than the rest of the facility. Free wifi connection was sporadically available in that lobby and in the registration area. The minuses are significant. First, as others have noted the buildings are older, rooms and halls are dark. Several rooms had a musty/mildewy odor as did the halls. Our building's outside door locks didn't lock at night so it didn't feel very secure knowing anyone could walk into the building at night from the nearby parks or walking paths. The recent renovations in the rooms are attractive but we tried several rooms due to musty odor, malfunctioning phone/TV, or absurdly poor location of the parking lots right up to the first floor patio door. There's a huge tent sitting in the parking lot which is used for special events. If you are in the tower building on the first floor be prepared for the intrusion of car lights shining right into your room. The 2 story villa buildings have no elevators so they assume everyone is ok hauling your bags to the 2nd floor room or being in the tower. The worst is indeed the noise. The doors must be hollow since we couldn't escape any hallway noises of housekeeping carts and personnel shouting to one another in Spanish or the heavy footsteps above our room which awakened us each morning. The bathrooms were renovated but the paint is chipping, and there's a panel over the tub area that is reminiscent of a 1970's era apartment. The halls and rooms are dark, and they only illuminate the ceiling hall lights and not the wall sconces, despite the unappealing dark appearance. The front desk staff are impresseive since they appear to be doing everything. The Hilton charges $25 a night for parking, plus $12 a day room (ethernet) internet connection. There is no concierge on duty for this \"resort\" ; which even 3* hotels frequently have, so to call this a resort seems outrageous for what you are getting. Overall, it is challenging to stay here, but the accessibility of the parks and paths, location right on the bayfront, hard-working front desk staff personnel, and general location made it a better experience. If you have patience and a patient front desk staff it has the potential of being a good vacation spot.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cThe most wonderful, helpful staff anywhere\u201d", "Author": "ooonor", "ReviewID": "UR56497265", "Content": "Wonderful bay-view room, large, clean.

It was as if the baby was in a crib wailing in our own room. It truly felt as if we were sharing rooms! Maybe it was just our run of bad luck with the room situation, but I don't think it's convenient for anyone (including those with young children) to play musical rooms. The front desk hotel staff was surprisingly hostile when I innocently \"reminded\" them we had free parking included in our hotel package.

(No \"water features\" such as waterfalls or slides in the pool, though - was definately targeted at adults rather than at kids). - Room was well furnished, very comfortable - Had a great view from the balcony of the bay (we got lucky here, not all rooms had great views) - Somewhat close to Mission Beach (it was about a 10-15 minute drive - longer than I had originally expected when I booked the hotel) Cons: - $22/night for \"parking\" is excessive. This isn't downtown San Diego! If you're booking a room, make sure you factor this cost into the overall cost as it may affect your decision to stay here. - Housekeeping wasn't that great ... we found that our room wasn't completely cleaned when we showed up (trash cans weren't emptied, in-room coffee area wasn't cleaned/restocked). - Prices for boat rental / skiing / etc were crazy high. I spent less for 5 days at disneyland than what they were charging for 1 hour of water skiing (no, I didn't go water skiing).

If that more or less fits your travel profile, there is nothing not to love about this place. It is \"isolated\" if you don't have a car, but it is 10 minutes to every beach in SD if you do. There is a beautiful park next door, and biking/running/walking trails right out your front door, along with bike and water-sport rentals. The staff was excellent in all regards. We did have a problem when we tried to check in early and were assured they would put a rush on having our room cleaned so we could check in. By 4:00 they still did not have our room ready so they upgraded us to a Garden Front Villa which was tastefully furnished and very comfortable. The towels were fine - don't know what to say about \"sharp edges\" review. And, yes - it costs $22 to park your car but I am from Seattle and this is common there, too. Being from rainy Seattle I have a thing for palm trees, and the beautifully landscaped grounds at the Hilton feature many. For only a 2 1/2 hour flight, I felt I had left the states for a tropical paradise when I arrived at the Hilton Mission Bay.

Location: On Mission Bay across from SeaWorld. Watch SeaWorld's fireworks each night while you relax at the pool. Bad: Cost - You will be charged for EVERYTHING. Need to get on the internet from your room? There is a charge! Want to go to the Gym? There is a charge! Kids participate in the kid's program? There is a charge! Want to utilize one of the hotel's bikes? There is a charge! Want to make Smore's (which are highlighted in the hotel's advertisements)? There is a charge! Coffee Bar - This is not Starbucks; but they sell Starbucks coffee. Plan to stand in line for a long time to get your morning latte. Be careful, there is a female staff member that will not be only rude but will talk about you when you leave (yep she gave me her full opinion on a previous customer's outfit). Coffee Bar also closes early; so if you need a jolt after 1pm you are out of luck! Gratuity - Watch out! Gratuity at the restaurant and bar are normally automatically included in small print line item. However in bigger letters the bill ask you to write in a Gratuity amount; yep they want gratuity 2xs! Take a moment and review your bill at the restaurant and bar - there is a good chance you will find the gratuity already included. Party - Weekends are a BIG party time for local college kids to come to San Diego and party. Good chance you will wake up to some loud kids having a good time. Isolated - This hotel is on 17 acres with only 1 restaurant. Too far to walk to another restaurant. So if you don't have a car and don't want to pay too much for taxis; then you will need to eat at the resort. Breakfast is around $15 per person; Dinner is around $25 per person. Concierge - Nice group but are not too knowledgeable on local attraction costs and hotel policies. Activity brochures are hidden around the corner from the Concierge\u2019s desk. Worth looking for the brochures and doing your own research. If you are a AAA member; call AAA directly to get their pricing for tickets to local attractions; they are normally less then what you can get from the concierge - yet the conceirge will always state they are less. Priceline - If you received your room thru Priceline (minimum bid is $80/night) then you will get the lower rooms in the tower. These rooms are fine; however your view will be of the parking lot. You can pay to have your room upgraded. Internet - In room cost money. Wireless in the comman area (by pool or lobby) is spotty. Rooms - Are dated and may have broken items (door handles, lamps). More of a 3 Star then a 4 Star; but it was not dirty and house keeping did a good job on keeping it looking nice. Transportation - While this hotel is on 17 acres; they still charge a huge parking fee - $25/night. Since it is out of the way; taxis charge a premium for usage.

I have never written a report before about bad towels but these were so bad that I felt it necessary to warn future travelers. They are not thin or cheap towels but have thick and sharp ridges in them. When drying off after a shower it actually HURTS to rub these towels against your body. I don't know who picked out these linens, but they should get rid of them. For a higher end hotel, charging premium rates for water views, you should have plush and pleasant towels for bathing.

There was not even a coffee maker even though in their description it states there is one.

We talked for at least ten minutes and in that time she never ONCE mentioned how dangerous it is for Americans to travel to border towns. We were the ONLY Americans anywhere in sight. Lots of police and armed soldiers everywhere. We had no idea, had not paid attention to news on this story, which is unfortunate, but it is inexcusable that a concierge in a hotel 20 miles from the border would fail to advise us of the danger. On our last night at the hotel there was a very loud party going on in the room next to ours. Through the thin walls the noise carried nonstop. Our calls to the front desk at 12, 2:30 a.m. got the security guard to stop by the room----and that was completely ineffective. We were woken up again and again until the party finally ended after 3:30 a.m. There were several options: moving the partiers to another part of the not-too-full hotel, or else breaking up the party.

A taxi to/from the airport runs $20-25 each way, depending on the taxi company. I also found that airport shuttles vary in price significantly. It was $17 from the airport to the hotel & only $9 from the hotel to the airport with a different company. The hotel staff were friendly & helpful.

A few glitches that i would be aware of: During our late December 2008 stay the \"pizza oven\" was broken and apparently had been for a month.

We entered our room which looked exactly like pictures we had seen on line. They have done renovations and everything is nice clean and newer. We utilized the on site restaurant Acqua and bar The Olive as there are no options within walking distance due to the resort's location. I must say that we really enjoyed lunch at Acqua including the Ahi tuna salad and fresh, warm baked bread. We also had breakfast at Acqua and although it was pricey $36 before gratuity, it was delicious! My husband got a wonderful crab/egg dish and I got an omlette made my way with potatoes, toast and fruit. All the food at Acqua was very fresh and delicious. The wait staff was friendly too. On our second evening we headed down to the Olive for drinks and the bartender Aleem was friendly and professional. He gave my husband and I complimentary drinks in honor of our anniversary, nice touch! The only negative comments we have are the computerized wake up system did not wake us up at 5:00 AM. Also, we called the valet and asked him to get us a cab for 6:00 AM, no cab. Had to ask the front desk staff to call a cab.

I called directly to try to get 3 rooms close by with extended patio that the cousins might be able to play on and visit other rooms/hang out easily. Told agent that it was important to me and was willing to pay more for a room for my request. With taxes, the rooms were about $400 a night each. Upon arriving to our rooms, which were nicely situated all next to one another we found out that the extended patios were walled in in the back so not easy access among the rooms and also were dusty with pine needles all over and their once nice outdoor furniture grimy. Not inviting at all. Had to call to get it cleaned. Also front desk never told us us that one room only had 1 king bed instead of the 2 queens we requested and needed ( 4 in our family). Strange, since we even requested an extra room key card so our 2 kids could share it. Rooms were fine with the extended section with an small counter top area with frig but a very uncomfortable sofa/chair ?

Also found (perhaps same mice - he threw it out the back patio somehow) mouse in room next door right outside the sliding glass door. We never opened the slider door to patio after that. Called (before 10 AM ) to ask to have the bathroom cleaned really well - never came until mid afternoon (4 pm ?) even after going to the front desk in person at 2 pm to ask why no one had come to clean the tub and bathroom. and I think they only did the standard cleaning job. Can't say I want to ever go back there anymore. Other than that...the hotel is nice with it's own dock for water sport rentals, Mission bay view, and close location to Sea World. If you go there don't pay for an extended patio room unless you make sure you are getting the flat extended patio looking out at the bay and also avoid the height of summer.

But rentals were a bit pricey and bicycle selection was limited and condition was not great (squeaky chain, worn handgrips). The 2 Queen room was unusually spacious, as was the bathroom. It had a nice sliding door that opened out onto the path along the bay. I could even see the fireworks from Sea World each evening from the patio outside my room. However, the tub was either in need of re-surfacing or poorly done, as the bottom had an unappealing two-tone look where the top coating had worn through. The most upsetting was being awoken by mosquitoes at night. I killed a few each day before going to bed, and am guessing that they were let in when the room was cleaned.

I agree that it's a secluded location, so if you just want to get away from it all, or have a meeting where you just want to walk around a bit during the day, it would work, and if you had a car it could even serve as a reasonable base for San Diego attractions.

We were close to Sea World, however, anyone staying at this resort would definitely need to have a car to get around San Diego. It is not walking distance to anything. The good points: - We loved the beds! - Personal care items were nice (Crabtree & Evelyn) - Large Safe - Decor was classy - In-Room refrigerator - Flat screen TV - Resort grounds were nice - Resort gym and tennis courts were nice Things that could be improved: - Better lighting in the room - Heating in bathroom could be improved - In-room internet access should be free (why is there a charge?) - On-resort parking should be free (again, why is there a fee for parking for guests?) - No movie channels.. what?!

If you have ever stayed at there propert Paradis Point in San Diego, you know what a dive the Hilton Resort is resorting too. We had booked our stay in our usual room on the bay. A king room with lanai with a fire pit. Great location, however they recently renovated the rooms and removed the ceiling fans in all there rooms. With an energy crunch, who does this. We no longer could enjoy the cool breeze with our fan as we had done in the past. Instead we had to run the air conditioner. What a waste. When they renovated, they put in some funky type wicker furniture that is not comfortable. The patio furniture is just as uncomfortable. When you are paying 480+ a night you expect better. The stay started out with the staff just completely rude. The young man checking me in was quite unpleasant, wanted to know who had made my reservation for me as they had not done it correctly. Like this is my problem. He did not greet me with Welcome back, Mrs. Smith like they had done in the past. Then the bellman. What a joke. He piled everything up on the cart and knocked over our 200 dollar radio and the speaker cover broke off. He never replied with sorry, he just wanted to know if we had any more stuff. He was rude and obviously did not want to be there. Our second day was suppose to be a relaxing one by the pool. However, someones small child pooped in the pool. My 4 year old is not terrified of swimming in there pool in fear of seeing poop in it again. As it floated right past her. They solution to this was bus everyone to Paradise Point. This wasn't quite working for us. So we swam in the polluted bay along with most people. You would have thought they might offer to bring out some lawn chairs for us. No such luck. I believe the facility has fired all there long time employees who are union. As they were picketing at the hotel during memorial day weekend. I wouldn't waste your money at this place.

From the time we checked in to the time we checked out we were greeted with smiles and \"how can we help you?\" Even the grounds staff were friendly with a \"good morning\". On two occasions we asked for more coffee for our room and not only did it come within 5 minutes, the front office called our room a little while later to find out if we had been taken care of. True customer service! The pool is very large and there are plenty of chairs. I especially enjoyed the little kids pool since we had our 3 year old with us. The pool is 1 ft and is perfect for little swimmers. Didn't have to worry about the older kids splashing and horsing around too close to the little kids. The Banana Cabana offers a full bar and grill as well as snacks and drinks for kids. A little over priced but what resort isn't?? We ate dinner at the Bayside Grille and had one of the finest dinners we've ever had. True fine dining. Don't expect fast food when eating at a 4star restaurant. Good quality food takes time but is well worth the wait. Everything was cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. I highly recommend the mushroom crusted halibut! We didn't eat there for breakfast or lunch so I can't tell you if the service is faster at those times but I can only assume so since they never had a wait time. Expect prices to reflect the qualtiy of the food. If you want fast, cheap food try Dennys. I've often said that bad travelers write bad reviews. People who treat other people badly will in turn be treated badly themselves. A little kindness goes a long way and a simple thank you every once in a while tends to get better service than behaving like a horses rear-end.

We had stayed with friends last year and went back to enjoy a relaxing stay by the bay. We splurged on our room to get a bayview lanai for $400 a night so that we could enjoy the beautiful view. I called the hotel to clarify the room and asked which room was a patio so that we could enjoy the grassy area outside the room. The reservations at the hotel told me that this room had a patio so we paid our $400 per night plus parking and set it up. We arrived early hoping to enjoy the pool while we waited for our room. The pool was closed for some contamination problem so we sat by the bay. Finally when check-in was official, we went to get our room. The $400 room was on the second floor not the first. When I explained about the first floor the management said too bad we are full. They offered to cancel my reservation at no penalty but that was it. So we headed off to our second floor room to check things out. On the balcony, our $400 view of the bay was obscured by a huge tree. The room had been renovated inside since last year and they did a nice job with the color schemes but the trendy furniture on the balcony was horribly uncomfortable. That night we went to the nice restaurant. We were greeted by the hostess and asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. I asked for outside and the hostess quickly announced that there weren't any tables availabe. When I asked how long the wait was she rolled her eyes and strode off to check. She seemed aggravated by my request. That sentiment was standard among the staff at the hilton. They were all dismissive and curt...not what I expect for $400 a night. After all of that fuss, my kids got food poisoning at the restaurant that night so for the entire next day our balcony was lost to the dirty laundry. On our final day, room service for a pot of coffee took one hour and they double charged our room. I have never paid so much money for so little.

Checkin was quick and easy. (Be forewarned if you use Debit to backup your account, they will put a hold on your account for $100 for EACH day of your stay!) The Room: Our room was 377. The hallway had that funky smell that has been mentioned in other reviews. Smelled like fresh paint to me. It was noticable but not too bothersome; I could not smell it in the actual room. My first impression of the room was \"WOW\". It was very contemporary - not my style, but very nice nonetheless. Also liked the balcony area. Beds were very comfy. The NOISE: This is where the WORST part comes in. I have never stayed in a hotel where the noise was almost unbearable. Light sleepers beware! The noise tended to peak at the 11:30 pm timeframe - about when the Sea World folks were returning and then start up again around 7 or 8 am. You can easily hear footsteps, voices, doors, and of course the unique toilet flushing sound. Sometimes it sounded as if it was several floors above. It was quite obnoxious! I'd managed to wear my 3 yr old out every day of our stay, so luckily SHE slept through it all. Restaurant: We ate breakfast at the terrace restaurant every morning. It was consistently good. I ordered from the menu two days and did the buffet one. Both were good. The buffet had a little of everything and then some. $22-24 for one adult and a child (includes tip) wasn't great, but it was convenient and tasty. The service was excellent. General appearance: The grounds in general were very nice and well groomed. You could see people working each day on maintaining this. The pool area was lovely and had quite a lot of shade in the mornings. It looked like a nice place to just sit and relax even if you weren't enjoying the pool. Parking: As mentioned before, the $20 parking fee is outrageous. We did self park each day as I did not want the hassle of waiting for a valet. We never had a problem parking close to the tower.

The jacuzzi was very crowded with children and so we couldn't use it after dinner. i'd go here again in a less crowded(non school holiday)month.

Well maintained landscaping connects the buildings and at its core is a main lobby with restaurant and pool. Parking is limited to one side of the hotel, and all the rooms seem to face towards the beach or landscaping on other side, so once you leave your car, you feel like you're really in a resort. Our room was not a suite and yet spacious with its private balcony and cathedral ceiling. The hotel is right on the beach of Mission Bay, so it's an easy walk from even the furthest room. On either side of the hotel are public parks, so you can walk on paved sidewalks for about a quarter mile in each direction, take the kids to a nearby playground, or enjoy a picnic on the grass. Some downsides are that the hotel is close to the interstate highway, so the sound of the traffic is omnipresent if you're outdoors. The beach, unfortunately, is on an inner bay, so no waves--just still water like being on a quiet lake. Great for kids, though, who won't be struggling with waves or an undertow at the ocean. During our stay, however, the water was contaminated and you weren't able to go in for a swim or ride a boat. The biggest disappointment was a $20 charge to park the car--not for valet, but for self-parking in an open parking lot--a ridiculous price considering the high cost of the hotel and a poor welcome to a resort. Hilton should reconsider this. The Hilton San Diego Resort advertises itself as a resort, but it's definitely a mixed bag. Any problems associated with its location on the water or by the freeway can't be easily be overcome by the hotel, but it should certainly warn its guests, especially if they can't take advantage of all its amenities or expect a romantic secluded spot on the ocean.

The highspeed internet in the rooms costs $12 a day (though I was able to tap into their wireless connection for free) and parking is $20 a day! And there were plenty of places to park - don't know why they have to charge for that. They have a basket of munchies set out, but if you eat anything, I'd run to the grocery store to replenish the stock. A tiny Toblerone candy bar was $3.50! And the bottle of Evian water (20 oz) was $5!! They do have Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, which I asked for extras of. The pillows are down, so you have to call for non-allergenic ones if you are allergic to feathers. But after an hour, a guy brought me up 4. Then they called to make sure I got them. They do have snacks and drinks in the gift shop that cost about the same as you would get in a movie theatre. The pool area is really nice and clean. The pool is 12 ft deep and must be heated a little because it was much more pleasant than the frigid ocean. They provide the pool towels, so you don't need to bring your own. From our balcony, we could see the Sea World fireworks each night up close. We didn't go in the bay, but they have jet skis, wind surfer thingies and a nice wide sidewalk to rollerblade on. The rooms were very comfortable and the beds were awesome. The tv was a flat screen, but once again, anything beyond basic cable will cost you.

We visited the pool and it was monopolized by San Diego families that had found a way to use the hotels facilities by getting thru a door by the 400 building. After reporting the issue of the overcrowded pool and security issues, nothing was done. Also, there was an incident with our reservations on hilton.com for which they attempted to charge us a second time, and when we explained we left our confirmation at home they said it was our problem to prove otherwise. I spent an entire day of my vacation trying to straighten it out, away from the pool again! No credits or courtesys were given to my family. I was not suprised, in that it seems with the security issues and billing, and confirmation issues the management has changed their attitude towards guest. The clientelle now is very grunge oriented and younger, and the managements attitude in extending services reflects more to the new clientelle.

So we decided to head to San Diego as it was within fair driving distance. Determined to go and have fun we settled on the Hilton Resort. This was based on their proximity to Sea World which we had free passes to. And 2. Kid friendly amenities. I called Hilton directly to see what their prices were compared to the lowest online which was Expedia. The reservationist quoted a lowest available rate $20 higher than Expedia and did not include breakfast or the garden lanai. So I booked with Expedia. We paid quite a bit for the room ,but hey it was the day before a very busy summer weekend. and we wanted an easy and as stress free a getaway as possible. First impression for the resort was WOW. Post card perfect. Check in went smoothly . They did forget my breakfast vouchers but they did make good on it. And complained about Expedia while they did so. As she hands me the vouchers I said I am short a set. She said no, the free breakfast was only good for 2 adults. Expedia did NOT make that clear. The room view was an immediate wow. Wall to wall sliding glass window . That led to our private lanai overlooking the bay. I can see why some say to get this view it was spectacular. And as we walked the resort throughout our weekend we could also see why some people say \"stay away\" as some rooms/patios were in very conspicious spaces. The room came with everything we could need, fridge, mini pantry, granite counter & sink, coffee pot, and a well stocked bathroom. We had just passed housekeeping outside and requested they take away the \"treats' before my kids accidentally got into it.. $5.00 bottles of water and $2.75 packs of M&M's were not in my budget. As we went through the room setting up and getting things put away we noticed the celing fan over the dining area was not working. As we were feeling quite muggy & hot we called housekeeping and asked for it to be looked at. We figured it just needed a battery. That was at 1 pm. We went to lunch on premises since we were a bit tired and didn't want to get back in traffic. There were 3 parties of 2 couples, and yet it took 25 minutes to get our lunch served to us. And after 2 messages gave up on getting a Coke with my lunch. Our server came up to us a the end and volunteered the fact that he had gone on break and forgotten to get the drinks to us. YIKES. We go tour room and maintenance is STILL there fixing the fan. We were feeling generous as were happy to be away. So we decided to go shopping. We came back . He was STILL there. at 6:15 pm mainteneance FINALLY finished fising the fan. Of course, meanwhile I am trying to track down a manager and finally camped out in the lobby until one arrived. He apologized and said it would get fixed as quickly as possible and would I like to go to the bar and get a drink? Yeah right! I point blank asked how I was to be compensated. He said due to to whom I had booked the stay through there is nothing Hilton could do! What?!! This made my blood boil. I paid $389 per night up front and that was somehow deemed beneath the Hilton standards?! So of course, I got loud and made a fuss. In The Lobby. Got 2 $50 dinner vouchers to include the mandatory 18% tip, and tax and to be made good for room service. And got 4 free vouchers to Americna breakfasts. Same details~ roughly another $100. (beware there is a diff in price between free continental that expedia offers and american breakfast) and we got our parking costs comped as well. And a few more inciental freebies. After that \"little\" incident we were treated quite well. We did not make use of any of the preplanned children activities. But they were plentiful. We did make use of the regular pool extensively, as well as their \"Sandy Beach\" for the kiddos. We didn't get in the bay water there but the kiddos were happy to be in the sand and we laid out on 1 of 4 covered deck chairs. The villa we were in was only 2 floors. And had it's own hot tub. This is besides the 2 hot tubs that are at the pool areas. The villa was surrounded by lush foliage and truly made us feel we were away from the daily grind. Housekeeping was completed each morning by 11am as we requested. Concierge was fantastic as was every dept we dealt with, after the \"incident' of course. We did notice the room was damp ~ not musty. That could have been due to us having come from the extreme weather climate of South Arizona. And the ince machine on our floor was not in working order. Iniitial treatment left us sour.

I'm still trying to figure out why this resort misses and can only put it down to poor management. The feeling of hospitality and service was definately lacking to a great extent. Part of it was due to inexperience and lack of training, part of it was due to the unfriendly demeanor of a few employees. Having said that, it may be that the staff's attitude is a defensive response to the boorish behavior of some of the guests particularly at the check-in desk. I agree with previous comments that your experience at this property will be greatly enhanced by your room assignment and that seemed to be a problem with quite a few people during our stay. If you're paying Priceline prices it's not so bad, but if you're paying rack rates it can be a big disappointment. Ask to see a map of the resort when you're checking in and ask questions about the location of your room in relation to parking lots, freeway, etc. Once you get past the room issue the resort can be enjoyable. The grounds are nicely kept and the pool area is pleasant. But, as other Trip Advisors have noted, it does not have the ambiance of other four-star resorts.

We waited and checked back with the front desk 15 minutes later and they said that our room still wasn't ready, and after we showed some fustration the supervisor put us in another guestroom. He forgot to change the number of our new room and we had to return to the front desk after unloading our baggage to the incorrect room and all. He gave us \"complimentary\" continental breakfast vouchers for our troubles, but when we used them for the continental breakfast, the waitress explained that it was only a 14 dollar credit per voucher...even though it says \"complimentary\" on the voucher. The continental breakfast came up to 18 bucks per person including tax, but I would not even pay the difference for this breakfast. The selection was very limited and the food was not that great. It was a good thing that we had a car, cause we mainly ate elsewhere. Speaking of car, parking is 14 dollars per night and there is no overnight street parking, so you are forced to park in the hotel's lot. Parking is rarely enforced, if at all, and I doubt they will tow any car parked in their lot, because the repercussion from the customer will outweigh the act of towing the car (if that makes any sense). I was never given a parking permit to display on my dashboard even though I checked \"self-parking\" during check-in, and my car survived through the weekend (and my credit card has not been charged). The room was nice. We did not stay in the tower that people here have been talking about. There was no moldy smell. The beds were nice and comfortable. The bathrooms were large. The noise from neighbors were not noticeable, aside from the shutting of the doors. I think there is a fee for the gym and the business center, though we did not check. The pool was alright. I think people preferred the pool to the bay when it came to swimming and laying out. The bay water seemed too dirty. I think the hotel charges for \"housekeeping\" gratuity, so we did not tip the maids at the end of our stay.

The grounds are nice, well kept, expansive banquet facilities with weddings, 'proms' and business functions going on, a full building dedicated as a spa, great pool featuring 'banana cabana', resturant right on the bay, guest access direct to sandy beach where there's sailboat and jetski rental. Now for the bad - THE ROOMS. We were checked into a room on the bottom floor located as soon as you walked in the tower door, that faced the lobby, valet, and all the busy-ness of a hotel on Friday night. The screen door opened up directly to the driveway to valet, an inferior room that we wondered was maybe the result of being a 'discount purchaser'. You get what you pay for?! The bathroom was tiny and the tub still had hair and stains in it. So we asked for another room and were given a 2nd floor one in another building. When we went to check the 2nd room out, thinking it was on the first floor because our room number started with '1', the hallway on that floor was littered with room service plates, nats and bugs flying around them, and the smell of sweet-dampness (kind of how bad fruit smells). It was syrup... and fruit... and eggs, pancakes, jam - seen on the many plates outside almost every other room door, that were obviously sitting out from breakfast - at 3pm in the afternoon! Came to find out odd room numbers were on the top floor, made our way up the stairs (no elevator) to our 2nd room. Soon as we opened the door, there was the most terrible PEE and musty smell in this room. We wanted to give it a try anyway (and not be headaches to the front desk), opened windows and turned on the ceiling fan (a plus) but couldn't get rid of the smell. We thought maybe the carpet had been cleaned and not dried properly, but soon found out when we tried to put our kids drinks in the room fridge that it was old, moldy, brown and rusty inside, emanating that old, foul smell. No wonder the room was damp and stinky! We called front desk to complain ... again. And were given a room a few doors down from the second, that was better - new fridge, mildly damp smell (maybe the humidity in San D ). So overall a *decent* stay, but here's the thing - NOT WHAT YOU'D EXPECT OF A 4 STAR by any means.

I said in a rather loud voice that I was disappointed that the staff did not recognize that this was a safety issue-- having a toddler and a sliding glass door that opened onto a busy parking lot. I surely hoped that there wouldn't be any accidents, I said loudly. Amazingly enough, they found us another room. Still only one bed, but they sent over a roll away. So, my teenager and I slept in the king and the 6 year old and the 2 year old slept on the roll away. The room was fine except for a few small details. The room smelled like cigarette smoke, but aired out pretty quickly. There was no key to the mini bar (even after I asked for one to be sent up... no one came). The maid forgot to refill the coffee on the second day. The second bathrobe was missing from the room. The towels were really rough, but nice and large. The shampoo and conditioner were FANTASTIC. The room service menu was horrible. It was all \"shi shi\" food, with NOTHING for the kids. For dinner the first night, the two little kids had to split a $12 Angus burger (\"please leave off the garlic aioli sauce and send fries instead of the Herb crusted potato wedges). Oh and a WARNING. Many hotels these days add the gratuity onto the room service already. Then there is a space on the ticket for a tip. Don't tip the server, or else you'll be tipping twice!!

The majority of the rooms in our villa block had arcadia doors that opened in the back onto gorgeous green lawns with putting green, hot tub, etc. Our room was flipped so that the arcadia doors were in the front (next to the front door) and the patio (two lounge chairs) sat right on the parking lot. Needless to say, the patio wasn't used and I didn't feel safe opening the curtains for all of the parking lot to be able to look into our room. So beware. The room itself was very small, barely enough room for two double beds. The room had an old motel feel to it, low ceilings, although the beds and furniture was top-quality.

It was more like 10 minutes, hauling my luggage and hot and sweaty. The first room I was put in was very nice, however the balcony was inhabited by a family of sea gulls and covered in bird mess. The parent birds stood at the window and squawked at me non-stop, apparently trying to protect the baby bird also living on the balcony. I called the front desk and they said \"oh, you're in that room...we'll move you right away.\" Apparently they all know this room is a problem, but still put people in it. The second room was ok; it was a handicap-accessible room and the towels were frayed, the coffee maker burst a leak the first morning and spilled coffee everywhere but in the coffee pot, however the staff did give me a credit for the inconvenience. Second morning my shower drain backed-up (not a bathtub, a walk-in with no boundary on the floor) and dirty water flooded the bathroom floor. I had just gotten out of the shower and needed to get dressed, do my hair, etc. The staff sent someone up and gave me another credit, however I was late to my morning appt. because I could not use the bathroom to get ready!

There was a cabana at the pool that was open for lunch and drinks in the afternoon. The prices at the cabana were a little high but the portions were large and they gave free refills on the soda all afternoon and with 2 kids that was a big savings. They should have kept it open later in the day during the summer.

Mission Bay Dr., you can see people barbecuing, flying kites, on their wave runners on the bay, and children playing on the large playgrounds. It was a neat sight to see, especially with the sun shining on the water, making it sparkle! We arrived at the hotel at 2pm to check in. (Check in is actually listed as 4 p.m..) Upon checking in, they asked if I wanted to valet all 4 days I would be there, or if I'd like to self park. The valet parking is $16/day or $14/day to self park. I thought this idea was completely ridiculous! You receive a piece of paper to place on your dashboard to show what dates they are valid from. But... Who really polices this? Parking was very tight and it was nearly impossible to park close by to our building each day. We soon realized people were parking on the street instead. Had we known this, we wouldn't have agreed to the self park upon checking in. Upon checking in, we had no bellhop assist with our luggage, nor offer, even though he was just standing there looking straight at us. Rather than offering to take our bags, he jumps over to another person in line and offers to take their bags, even though I got there first. We have checked in to many 4 and 5 star hotels before and have never received service like this before. Aside from the lazy and unattentive bellhop, service didn't get any better. We requested a room overlooking the bay over the telephone before our trip, and the agent said they'd honor that. Much to our disappointment, the person who checked us in said, \"Well, we already have you set up in the room.\" No big deal. We were on the 1st floor in the building over looking the parking lot. What a view and the noise! Was this not negotiable because I obtained this room through priceline bid? The room was very clean, beds were very well made, and toiletries were stocked every day. Just like in any other hotel, they won't change the towels for clean, new ones, unless you put them on the floor. Towels were so hard and crunchy! For a 4 star hotel, you'd think along with the soft, high thread count sheets, they'd have soft towels. Again, very minor. In the restroom, it had granite countertops, good water pressure, but an ugly sight below the countertop. The front of the counter is actually a faux cabinet door, and is one big piece of wood. It was coming apart and was really ugly. Aside from that, the furniture was pretty basic. The room had a kin size comfortable bed, 2 side tables, a table with a mirror in front of it (which was great when I was doing my hair in the mornings), with a chair, a comfortable arm chair, and dresser drawers with a flat screen tv on it.

The great thing about the Resort is that you don't need to even the grounds of the hotel to have fun! My boyfriend and I spent an entire just exploring the grounds and soaking in the sun. Very relaxing! The Resort is a bit pricey, but the staff will completely take care of you. We've never had a problem with them, not even when we brought our dog with us (yep, they takes pets too!!). I've stayed in plenty of hotels in San Diego on vacations and weekend getaways, but the Hilton San Diego Resort is by far the best!!", "Date": "April 29, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d119721-Reviews-Hilton_San_Diego_Resort_Spa-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$151 - $405*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1775 East Mission Bay Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515706", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1a/d7/09/resort-pool-in-the-evening.jpg"}}
