Also located about 30 mins walk from the T-Cat terminal which is convenient to travelers hoping to get to the airport via coach. In general only 2 of the ladies at the front desk were helpful and friendly while the rest were not helpful; probably due to the language barrier. The rooms were clean and quite well equipped, with tv, hot water kettle, mini fridge etc. Although the rooms were quite compact but in general I would be quite happy to stay there again.

I have stayed in quite a few business hotels in Tokyo and this is by far the best one. I originally chose it for the location: walking distance to Tokyo station, right next to the Tozai, Hibiya subway lines and a short walk to the Keiyo line. The staff are friendly, the internet connection is free, the breakfast buffet is extensive and very good value and when we booked through their website, we got a special couples deal which included a bottle of wine in our room. Of course the rooms are tiny, but the ones at the end of the hall are slightly larger.", "Date": "Feb 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR884438724", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JoM_9"}, {"Content": "Not Bad at All       The tiny room", "Date": "Dec 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR760438754", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "cclemens31"}, {"Content": "Not too bad ... We stayed at this hotel twice in December 2006. It's definitely not the best hotel I've ever stayed at but it's ok for the price. The rooms are very cosy and we found the bed quite hard and uncomfortable. My boyfriend and I stayed in a double room but I would recommend staying in a twin room as these seemed to be much larger. Like many places in Japan, the restaurant downstairs doesn't cater for non-smokers. The best thing about this hotel was probably the location - it's about a 5 minute taxi ride from Tokyo station and the subway is a 1 minute walk away. Overall, this hotel isn't too bad. I probably wouldn't stay here again though.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR439647571", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "erin1708"}, {"Content": "Excellent business hotel The Hotel Universe chain is an excellent choice in Japan, and a higher end version of that wonderful Japanese institution, the 'business hotel'. Business hotels are designed to be functional, not spacious. If you want spacious then try a full-on Western style hotel (and pay through the nose for it too). Personally, I think business hotels are great and they make Japan affordable to travel in.The Tokyo Hotel U is as good as all the rest I've stayed in, although a _little_ tricky to find compared to most business hotels. The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are confortable and clean and a decent size _for a business hotel_. It is close to one of the major train lines and it's easy to get about greater Tokyo from there.They have staff that speak English and German, but not many, so it's random luck if you get a non-Japanese speaker when you check in. I don't see this as a problem - if you've booked ahead (and you really should given how busy they are (book directly with the hotel online, not through a travel agent)) then you just hand over the booking printout and they will sort you out. I've never had any problem (whether I bothered to speak Japanese or not) and the staff have always been helpful and accomodating.All in all, it Hotel Universe Tokyo is my first choice each time I have to go through Tokyo.", "Date": "Jul 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR721095527", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Good, affordable hotel in downtown Tokyo Stayed at the Universe for one night in june '05. My girlfriend and I werevery happy with this hotel. The room was small but quite nice...there was a new flatscreen TV and recently redone bathroom. Staff were friendly enough. Room was spotless. For $145 Canadian it was a very good deal, expecially considering its great location (right by subway) downtown. Breakfast was a bit disappointing. Mostly japanese, some western but the scambled eggs tasted strange. Still, for 840 yen its cheap as far as tokyohotel breakfasts go; and since I don't like seafood I'm sure others wouldbe quite fine with it. (btw if you're on a budget and you want a western breakfast, just hit one of the many macdonalds for egg mcmuffins and / or pancakes, coffee etc - its cheap)But as far as the hotel goes - I'm not aware of a better value in the heart of tokyo.

While it's true that the rooms are small, they are just what I was looking for in Tokyo. I was traveling alone and was constantly on the go, so the size of the room wasn't an issue. The staff were uniformly friendly and helpful, and just about all spoke functional English. They gave me some great tips on how to get to places I was trying to find.I was putting pictures and stories of my trip on a website every day, and needed to get online every evening to upload my files. The in-room internet access requires you to borrow a network box from the front desk, which you are expected to return in the morning. But when the staff saw that I would be borrowing the box every night, they invited me to keep it until I checked out. That's indicative of the treatment I got from everyone there.The location of the hotel is incredibly convenient. It's literally around the corner from Kayabacho Station's Exit 3. You can access the Tozai and Hibiya lines there, and you're only one or two stops away from just about every other subway line in the city. Additionally, you need only walk four blocks or less to get to a convenience store, a post office, a bank that will exchange foreign currency, a nice little soba/udon place, and a great Japanese pub. And if you're in a nostalgic mood, you're a five minute walk away from the Sumida River and maybe a ten minute walk away from Nihombashi.On top of all this, it's an incredible bargain in the central Tokyo area. The international hotels some might recommend cost at least two to three times what I paid here. If you're in Tokyo on business and will have visitors, this may not be the hotel for you. But if you're there as a tourist, I don't see how you could do better.
