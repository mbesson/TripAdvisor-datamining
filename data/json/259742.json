The first night I arrived I went down at the reception with a list of complaints: - no heating in the room (I could hear quite a loud noise of the AC working but, the room temperature would not change at all), - the telephone with no signal, - and most importantly no hot water for the shower!!! The only proposal coming from the reception was changing my room with another bigger one (as if that was the problem!). I did not accept any foolish proposal and waited until next morning to have shower. In addition, the telephone got its signal back but the AC was never working. I had to lower my expectations and accept that situation up to the third day of my stay. I woke up at around 10 am and prepared for shower - guess what, hot water still missing!!! This time, called the reception and asked to be transferred to another hotel... The answer this time was: wait for 40 mins for the problem to be fixed. It got indeed fixed after 40 mins, but I was waking up the next 2 days cross-checking for services that I believe (mostly sure) even a one-star hotel would have provided. Not to mention the quality of the food served in the morning buffet...The famous Italian coffee? Better buy some instant nescafe than try the one offered by the hotel... I have seen other couples in the hotel staying mute in front of common problems and I just can't accept this attitude... Wondering of the excellent online reviews... Was it my fault that I happened to be a guest of the hotel at a low season? I paid the normal price and did not even ask for extra services - just the basics... So finally, really hoping that my herein message will either help with the clients' decision-making or make the hotel respect all the contractual obligations deriving from their current star-standing (in at least the basic standards that has to be provided to the customers)", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in Rome near Termini Station\u201d", "Author": "IamChuckC", "ReviewID": "UR119632156", "Content": "Hotel Ateneo Garden Palace is a wonderful hotel, with spacious, comfortable rooms, pleasant and competent staff, and good breakfasts.

Our double room was 150 euros (with a conference discount). It was small but perfectly adequate. We were delighted to find a private foliage covered balcony through the double French windows, complete with table and two chairs, overlooking a small, tree covered private square.

For this, the location was perfect, just a few minutes walk. For sightseeing, I would say it is not great - it is a rather long walk to get anywhere at all. On the other hand the train station Termini is rather close. I should start by saying I usually try to rate hotels according to the typical standard and cost for that location, but since this hotel was booked for me by the organizers and I have visited Rome only once before, I do not really know the standard. However I have visited other parts of Italy and most other European capitals so hopefully this assessment is fair. I found the hotel acceptable, but very basic. The single room was 140 euros (possibly with a business discount, but I am not sure) and very small, with only basic furnishings, and acceptably but not perfectly clean. The bed was, unfortunately, terribly uncomfortable. There was apparently wireless internet but I didn't manage to get a signal. The front desk staff when I arrived spoke very little English. The hotel is listed as 4 stars, but I am not sure what this is based on. There is a free buffet breakfast served in a lovely room - the food is limited and not great (mostly pastries, but also some fresh fruit). However I have found it is unusual to get breakfast at all in Italy, so this was a plus.

Oh my, words will fail to describe how much I disliked this place, it's neighborhood, but I'll try. While Paris gets a bad rap about being dirty, as of my last visit in Oct 08, it's undeserved, while Rome, the \"Eternal City\" where it's citizens dress so nicely, have really let their city go to pot. Graffiti everywhere, trash, homeless, beggers, gypsies, and enough people selling fake Omegas, Rolex's, Mont Blanc pens, and LV bags to choke a horse. While all this is bad, and detracts significantly from the history of this cradle of civilization, lets concentrate on the hotel. Where to start; how about mold and water damage on the walls? Or the bathroom, with it's broken toilet seat, trim coming off the door, mold in the shower. The tour director asked if we reported the seat being broken, my response is simply don't they clean it daily? Shouldn't they have noted the issues? That is the problem in a nutshell, the management does not notice. Now I've never run a hotel, but I'd be looking for new cleaning staff if they could ignore the state this place was in. The remote for the TV had no battery cover, and a year old piece of scotch tape trying (and failing ) to hold the battery in. The dining room (a bright spot by appearance in this wreck), had major issues. Our last day there the staff were in tears, and the eggs looked like warmed-over leftovers from the previous day, ugh. Seriously unhappy people not working, not bringing you coffee, and sullen when you interrupted whatever was going-on. How they can claim four stars, even in Italy, where let's be honest, hotel ratings standards don't seem to match the rest of Europe, is beyond me. To sum it up, I disliked this hotel with just about every fiber of my being. We only stayed because we were a part of a tour group, otherwise, we would have been so out-of-there. And yes, it is close to the Termini Station, but in Rome, that's not a good thing. The neighborhood is not one you want to take a casual stroll through after dinner. Even the little square in the front of the hotel, with the overflowing trash bins and permanent homeless people camped out points to this being a neighborhood in decline. It's a pity that for all the attention the people of Rome spend on looking good, they don't seem to take more pride in their beautiful city.", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "wellington", "Title": "\u201cbugs in the bed\u201d", "Author": "peterwellington", "ReviewID": "UR22763426", "Content": "arrived there on the 25th november, the hotel is in a very \"ordinary\" part of town about 2km walk from the main station. something you wouldn,t do at night. when we were ready for bed pulled the bed covers back to find a large bug running across the bed sheet and lava eggs under the pillow. the hotel staff were rude and didn,t want to know. finally after a standoff they moved us to another room. i have never stayed in a hotel were the staff are so rude and unhelpful. would not this hotel recommend to anyone.", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "tlc_too", "ReviewID": "UR21915144", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights as part of a Trafalgar tour.

There was only one computer set up with internet in the lobby but at least it worked - in other hotels we weren't so lucky.

The room and bathroom exceeded our expectations because they were reasonably large (see photo), it appeared to be freshly renovated, and it overlooked the garden, so it was quiet and comfortable. We spoke with a couple who had a room across the hall who were not happy with the street noise. Air conditioning was available, but we preferred to leave the window open. We appreciated the availability of many electric outlets around the room because we often were charging two computers, a hand phone, and a digital camera all at once. We especially appreciated the free wireless Internet access in the lobby. The refrigerator in the room kept things cold, but they did not have a freezer in the hotel for our ice pack. So they kept the ice pack in ice and gave it to us on our departure. The few channels on the TV were all Italian language channels. The breakfast included cereal, ham, cheese, and yoghurt. There is a small neighborhood about a 5 minute walk away with a supermarket, a gelato store, and many restaurants. There is also a good pizza restaurant across the street. We have to estimate the value based on the TripAdvisor price because we don\u2019t know how much the tour paid for our room.

There is free internet service and a computer to use in a nice large parlor/sitting room. Staff was very nice. Breakfast was served each morning in a very nice dining room, and was excellent.

Our room had very noisy air conditioning that was impossible to turn off - even the hotel staff couldn't manage it. Also there were smoke alarms with flashing lights placed directly over our bed, this was obviously very distracting when trying to sleep. The view from our room was very disappointing with graffiti everywhere, and the general area was very intimidating, not somewhere you'd like to go for a romantic walk with your partner.
