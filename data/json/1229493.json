{"Reviews": [{"Content": "You get what you pay for The staff at reception are relatively nice and can offer lots of information about the area.I opted for a single room with a window. However the window was of little use - as it just looked onto the other side of the hotel - so nothing exciting to view.The rooms are very small, and barely enough space to open a suit-case. There is no wardrobe - but you are provided with a few hanging hooks on the back of the door.The en-suite facilities are small but functional and the air-con is a much needed component.Laundry costs $10 to do.Be aware the hotel is close to a Mosque and their prayers over the tannoy start at 4-5am in the morning - so you'll definitely wake up with that.Other than that - nice small convenient hotel.", "Date": "Dec 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR124812535", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "T_Virdee"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1229493-r22933180-Haising_Hotel-Singapore.html", "HotelID": "1229493", "Price": "\" id=\"hotel_1229493\">"}}
