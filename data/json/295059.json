The hotel's breakfast room has great views over Istanbul and offers a wide range of foods that should suit every diet. We asked for a smoking room at the back of the hotel & that's exactly what we got; it was relatively quiet and there was enough room for us both and our suitcases though not a lot of wardrobe space. The wifi worked fine for us and we had no problems connecting. We walked down and across galata bridge to the old town every day (about 30 mins to spice market) and trekked back uphill from Karakoy each evening for meals out and drinks. There are plenty of transport options and the tram at Karakoy (about 10 min walk downhill from hotel) will bring you to the archeological museum, topkapi palace, blue mosque, hagia sophia and the grand bazaar for 2TL per trip. Our air conditioning only worked to give hot air but thankfully the large window opened so we controlled the room temperature with fresh air. The room safe was useful and when we had a problem with it a staff member was with us immediately and resolved the issue. All staff of the hotel were helpful and friendly with plenty of English speakers when we needed assistance.

The photos on the website are a bit misleading. The issue with the airconditioning mentioned elsewhere in the forum seems a general problem. We put it on full blast yet the room would remain warm. Another guest complained and got upgraded to a suite for the last day. They seriously need to get this fixed. The internet was terrible the first 3 days.

We went to the hammam that was just a few blocks away... sorry don't remember the name but it was not cayoglu and it was not great. If you have experienced bathouses before then this is disappointing and not worth the price. If not then give it a try or go to Cayoglu (sorry if I'm misspelling). I fully recommend this hotel. It was very reasonable and an excellent hotel in a great location", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but no personality\u201d", "Author": "crazytravelernyc", "ReviewID": "UR45755944", "Content": "If I were in Istanbul on business, I would stay here. The rooms are what you'd find at a city Hilton. The location was terrific for touristing and at night an easy area for finding restaurants. My husband and I stayed here and I agree - a bit noisy at night. The rooms are right over Istiklal Cadessi, and it's a main street where people walk, shop, go to restaurants. There was some police activity late one night, and a siren sounded waking my husband and me. The front desk was not helpful - couldn't recommend any other restaurants other than \"360\", were not very attentive when you were standing at the desk. Lebi Derya is the hotel restaurant - fantastic views and excellent fish dishes. Worth a visit whether you stay there or not. Breakfast was buffet-style with bread, fruits, cold cuts and yogurt. The coffee was from a Nescafe machine. Fine for a start to a day of touring the city.", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brasov, Romania", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but a little noisy\u201d", "Author": "Adda314", "ReviewID": "UR36223493", "Content": "We stayed at the Richmond hotel for three nights in July. I was on a business trip with my husband. Have to say the location is perfect! Right there on Istiklal street (3 milion people / weekend passing by) with shops and restaurants. It is close to the metro station also. We had a nice, big room on the second floor overlooking the street. The breakfast restaurant has an awesome view, is spacious and well lit and the food was a good selection. The room itself was ok, with a sofa and we had internet wireless which was a big plus for us. The downside - the noise from the street. Every once in a while we had to check if the windows were closed, it felt like they were not, that is how noisy it was especially in the evenings. The same with the connecting door we had. One morning we were awoken at 7am by the family with small kids next door. We came late in the room and we usually were too tired to be bothered by the noise but for someone who comes on vacation might be too much. The staff is ok. I would recommend it to everyone that goes to Istanbul and I would return there also. In the evenings look to the smaller streets from the main street. We found a nice, secluded, intimate terrace on top of a building. It wasn't the cleanest one but the waiter/owner was awesome and we had a great peach narghilea and tea there.", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Excellent service but they do not let you have a guest in your room even for a minute!\u201d", "Author": "WorldtravelerCyprus", "ReviewID": "UR34445108", "Content": "I stayed three times in the hotel.

I feel thought that it is a little bit expensive but still it worth the money. Ah! I forgot to say that I went with my friend on the room in order to take my suitcase and as soon as I got into the room they called me from the reception and they asked me to tell my friend to leave the room. I said no, so I had to pay the double room price!!!!! Thats why I didnt go again!
