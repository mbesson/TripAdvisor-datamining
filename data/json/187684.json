We had a fantastic stay at this \"boutique townhouse\" hotel -- the service was fabulous and our room was very comfortable and well appointed. We stayed in their Willow Suite, which was essentially an apartment -- a bedroom with king-sized bed, a living room with couch that pulled out into a queen sized bed, a dining room, an enormous bathroom (with separate tub and shower, and 2 sinks), a small kitchen, and a rooftop terrace from which we were able to see fireworks on New Years Eve. It was a HUGE space especially by London standards. There was a TV in the bedroom and a TV and DVD player in the living room. It was extremely comfortable for our family. The hotel does not have a bar or restaurant, but does have 24 hour room service which was top notch. We had a fantastic afternoon tea as well as yummy breakfasts. 22 Jermyn went out of their way to make sure our children were comfortable. They have a wide assortment of childrens' DVDs (we enjoyed watching Harry Potter!) and bring popcorn and soft drinks to your room for you to enjoy while you watch your movie. They even babysat our children so that my husband and I could go and enjoy dinner out by ourselves! They also have child-sized bathrobes for children. The furnishings were elegant and comfortable, and the hotel provided wonderful L'Occitane toiletries in the bath and a bowl of fruit and nuts (in our case, it was tangerines and walnuts) for us to snack on. The staff was extremely friendly and always greeted us by name -- they all even remembered the childrens' names! The hotel is very located in the St. James area, and a stone's throw from Piccadilly Circus. Jermyn Street itself has lots of wonderful boutique shops including Fortnum and Mason, Paxton and Whitfield cheeses, and several men's outfitters. This hotel comes with my highest recommendation.

The room had an AC unit under the window but was too noisy to operate all evening and, as neighboring extractor fans made opening the window impossible, it was quite stuffy. The staff offered to move us to a nearby room but as it was only on the first floor and located above an alleyway (which had a high degree of foot traffic late into Saturday night) we decided to stay where we were.
