Our room was 218 overlooking the bay. It was a beautiful view but for an additional $80+ I would rethink it next time. As we were on the 2nd floor facing the bay and the street we really couldn't open the windows. There was absolutely no privacy to leave the curtains open. For one night stay and few opportunities to really enjoy the view it really was wasted on us. Back to our room. It was absolutely lovely, very small, but very well thought out and had everything we needed. It was immaculate. Our bed was comfortable and the room was \" pin drop\" quiet even though we were facing the street. The compact size was not a problem for us as we have traveled extensively in Europe and it is the norm.

The Griffon has an awesome history and story and its location in the Bay area, in the heart of everything, makes it a popular place to stay. On first appearances the hotel, its distinct style (oriental impressions) and trendy, unpretentious vibe is indeed a winner, even if it is small. On closer inspection though, things start to crop up that make you reconsider whether this place is worth the money; First thing- The hotel's front doors are always open. Trust me Brothers and Sisters, this is NOT a good idea; the smell of sewerage from the street invades the lobby and lingers around like an unwanted guest. What is even worse is the fact that the hotel's restaurant is right beside the lobby. Imagine getting a whiff of that as you sip your pinot and dig into your 'Catch Of The Day'...yummmmmmm. Second- The rooms are small, as in, you literally cannot swing a cat in there (though beautifully designed) and poorly ventilated. The carpets smell musty and the window seat looks a little worn out and it sits above the super loud AC unit. Third- I dont know about anyone else, but my window (on the third floor) was facing what i think was the fire escape (the window was foggy and made with that thick textured glass makes everything outside look all distorted like). So in addition to having no view, I also had no natural light coming into my room. I'm telling you, i would leave my room at around 8am, thinking it was gloomy outside because it was so dark in there. Imagine my surprise when i noticed that it was sunny outside! The interior designer here was a clever one because to counter the gloom in the room, they installed an artificial 'natural light' just above the bed, to make dim wits like me feel like it was sunlight shining down from the heavens onto my face. Needless to say, when i discovered otherwise (i.e. a whole 5 minutes after coming into the room for the first time) i seriously was not impressed. Fourth- The price was too high for such a small room, with musty carpets and no breakfast. I am especially cross about the no breakfast thing though. I am guessing, no, I am positive that guests at this hotel are actually paying for the location and the concept of awesomeness. I will admit that from the looks of things, this hotel does have a certain charm to it, but i WILL NOT be caught paying this much for a hotel that clearly needs an upgrade, a facelift and some love.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWe have mice, but otherwise we're great.\u201d", "Author": "RealUSCfan", "ReviewID": "UR119337759", "Content": "Stayed there 4 days in October 2011.

We found that the Receptionists were not particularly welcoming and checked us in without providing any information on breakfast or really anything else about the hotel services. We also found that they were not particularly knowledgable when we asked them for information on getting to the Beach Blanket Babylon show, a well known San Franscico show we had tickets to or about a strike on the BART, which we had heard about on the news. Our booking included a \"Continental breakfast\" and when we asked the unhelpful receptionist she said they did not have a continental breakfast option - this in fact worked in our favour and we were able to spend a specified amount each morning on breakfast which we were not then charged for! Our room (411) was relatively small and dark with the basin in the bedroom rather than the bathroom. It had two windows which overlooked a internal \"shaft area\" which seemed to accommodate all the air conditioning extractors and other peoples windows. Not only did this make the room dark, it also meant that there was noise from the extractors. The room did grow on us - the bed was comfy and we had never planned to spend a great deal of time there, as we were out exploring the city. Breakfast was served in Perry's, the restaurant that is part of the hotel. Breakfast was good - particularly the extra options available for brunch on the weekends. The service provided varied each day. We also ate at Perry's on the Sunday evening after we got back from the evening tour at Alcatraz - nothing special but it was tasty and quick. The location was good for being close to Emberacardo Station and other public transport options. It is also walking distance to the Alcatraz Ferry and Pier 39 (15 - 30 minute walk depending on how fast you go), but overall not particularly central to any one thing/attraction. We were leaving early on our last morning to fly to Las Vegas, so we asked if we could deal with the bill the evening before. The receptionist was not able to tell us what was on our bill and appeared to not want to deal with us properly. Having said that she did work the bill out and it was put under our door at some point during the night.

If you are looking for resort accommodations or an expansive suite, it will not work for you. But if you're comfortable with a quaint and quirky boutique experience, close to the Embarcadero and AT&T Park, this is a viable option at a reasonable price point. Just stayed two nites in a deluxe king room. As other T/A reviewers have commented, this room is very small, if not bordering on tiny. I did not have a tape measure but I guesstimate it was no more than 200sf, with a 7' x 6' bathroom carve out housing a tub/shower and toilet. The low sink/vanity are in the sleeping space, as well as the king bed, two nite stands and a desk, so there is little room to move about. The TV is a good size flatscreen with Comcast CableCard, but it is mounted way above the vanity near the ceiling in an awkward viewing position-- too bad because a simple swivel stantion would fix this. There is also a small refrigerator under the vanity, and a coffee maker too. The rest of the quirkiness vibe continues with a light well window that berths a small bench seat, which really becomes a luggage rack as there is no other space to stow besides a small, open closet. There is no dresser, and drawer storage is limited to two, tiny, floor level drawers in the window seat and the nite stands. Oh and don't miss the lighted sconce above the toilet, which faces a long, door-mounted mirror so you can watch yourself as nature calls! Some T/A reviewers have commented about a musty smell, but there is an awning window high above the right corner panel of the light well that you can crank open. The downside is you will hear pidgeon warbling very early in the morning if you do, On the quaint side, this is a 100+ year old building, with a long history that goes back to the barbary coast days and an owner who was a bootlegger. The elevator is 30\" wide, cramped, and slow,,,,,so take the steps and wind up in the bar! And for the eco-types, score bonus points for sustainable design, environmental, and energy efficiency initiatives that were purportedly enhanced in a 2007 renovation, albeit I was suprised by a sliding thermostat relic for the HVAC. The exposed brick wall is also obtrusive, and if I were management, I'd slap a nice wall mirror on it to open up the room. On the plus-side, Peets coffee, fesh fruits, newspapers, and WiFI are complimentary, albeit the latter was SLOWWWWW....room was clean....front desk efficiency and hospitality were exceptional! Bottom-line.....these cramped quarters are good for nite or two and best for single travelers, or a couple with limited essentials. The restaurant (Perry's) is convenient and busy.....the food was good (we had Sunday Brunch), the service was spotty, and the drinks fell somewhere in between. Of course with Chaya and The Boulevard within whistling distance, there are options......or take a little stroll to California Street and try Perbacco or Tadich for a great dinner.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ljubljana, Slovenia", "Title": "\u201cHotel in a great part of the city\u201d", "Author": "Suzana4", "ReviewID": "UR116599038", "Content": "I stayed in Griffon for 3 days and enjoyed the San Francisco.

Matt, was so incredibly nice and helpful that I decided to stop by and check the place out. The warm and inviting atmosphere of the lobby and adjoining bar and restaurant are hard to describe. You just get a really friendly and inviting feeling upon entering the hotel. Each staff member we met was just as wonderful as Matt. The location on the Embarcadero across from the Ferry Building is ideal! There are plenty of restaurants close by, it's centrally located for walking and there is a YMCA two doors down. Perry's Restaurant, on the ground floor of the hotel, is fantastic. They offer a full menu of really reasonably priced entrees, something for everyone. We ended up having two dinners and one breakfast at Perry's; it's really convenient! I highly recommend the Bay View Suite; it's very spacious with a great layout of a bedroom area and separate living room space with killer views of the Bay, Bay Bridge and Ferry Building. The standard rooms offer the same view and would be fantastic if you don't plan on too much hanging out in the room. We chose the suite which worked out perfectly for the two of us and my parents to have a drink and hang out before dinners. I will definitely book a room for my parent's next annual visit as well as recommend this gem of a boutique hotel to other friends and family! To recap: * Wonderfully helpful and friendly staff (Matt was great!). * Classic SF boutique hotel; a gem. * Perfect location; convenient, safe, great area to walk and explore, plenty of restaurants. * Convenient restaurant and bar in hotel. * Bay View suite is really spacious, great layout, killer views.

I grabbed coffee and a rolled up cheese/lunchmeat sandwich each morning. YMCA access--I didn't use it this trip, but our corporate rate included free access at the great Y next door. Other rates allow access for a small fee. The not-so-good: Internet--Neither wired nor wireless worked my entire stay. I got a feeble excuse from the front desk that it was the weather. I didn't pursue the issue because I had easy access at the office, but if I hadn't, it would have been a big problem for me. I did resent lugging my laptop on this trip for no reason, though. Lighting--The rooms are designed very efficiently, with all I needed but extra pillows. However, the lighting over the sink was atrocious. I turned on all the lights, and it was still dark. Hopefully, if you're doing makeup, you can bring your own lighted mirror. Room service--Though no different in any other hotel I've stayed at in SF, it really is ridiculous to order a sandwich and drink, and with fee/tip have it cost nearly $30. There are just too many great options close by that are much more delicious and cheaper. I love Mijita in the Ferry Building, plus Yank Sing in the Rincon Center.

My room had no views, and the window looking out to a small courtyard surrounded by other rooms - no problem, as I got out to enjoy the views! Rooms were well-appointed with a modern decor, large plasma TV, lovely Aveda toiletry products and a large, comfortable bed.

Also located one block from nightly markets, an open ice skating rink around Christmas, great close-up views of the Bay Bridge and also The Ferry Building (an beautifully old restored building which is one of several ferry stops and has various restaurants as well as retail shops for great browsing), it should suit all tastes and budgets. I also enjoyed the close location to the financial district, as I was across the street from a post office and within walking distance to many other services, including banks, an AT&T shop for mobile phone service, a great bagel cafe, Noah's, the BART system (for an easy trip from the airport) and one of the cable lines. The free internet access for hote guests was a bonus, and the continental breakfast was more than just cold croissants and coffee, with healthy options and great service. Finally, on my last day I was not feeling well, and they gladly extended my check-out to 1.00.

The facilities are pleasant enough, but there were at least two other problems: - the \"free wireless internet service\" doesn't reach the 3rd floor; and the old T-1 wiring connection has been disabled - Housekeeping isn't particularly thorough--there was a gross stain on the brown bedspread (blood? coffee? semen? mucus?).

The staff was accomodating as well. Unfortunately, we needed a hotel with a restaurant and room serivce which were advertised. When we arrived on a Saturday we were informed the restaurant, bar, and room service were closed for a private party. If they e-mailed the confirmation I feel they could have advised us of this inconvenience. We were also advised the restaurant was closed on Sunday, so we had no opportunity to utilize these services. The hotel made no conselatory effort when we expressed our displeasure. The rooms are also tiny....very tiny. Botique hotels very often have small rooms but two adults could barely pass by one another in the room and there was no space to set up a suit case stand. To add to the situation. Many of the rooms open on to a light well that is very tiny so you get no natural light. The rooms are sealed but there are only heating systems so when the room gets warm or stuffy there is no way to draw in cool or fresh air.

Pros: Cute, historic charm. Nice exposed brick wall in room and great Aveda bath products. Good location, although we usually had to walk a block or two to get a cab. Continental breakfast was nice. Everything appeared very clean. I requested more towels and they were sent up quickly. We were very impressed with all of the staff, including the front desk, in the restaurant, and at breakfast. Cons: Many people said small rooms, which usually don\u2019t bother me, but our room was beyond small. I actually felt a little claustrophobic because the window looked out into a very small, dark, dirty brick cave-like hole. There are also very few king beds because many of the rooms are too small to accommodate them. Despite booking months in advance and requesting a king bed multiple times, I could only get a full bed. The rooms must also be all different sizes because I was with other people who paid the same rate and both had slightly larger rooms so you may get the luck of the draw on your room. The sink and mirror in the room was a little strange but at least there was good counter space. The location of the TV mounted on the wall was just too high and awkward. The bed and linens were below average and the pillows were definitely very old, as they were extremely flat. The shower had very low water pressure. In fact, I think the sink faucet had more water flow and pressure than the shower. I was on the third floor, close to the elevator and the stairs, right above the fireplace downstairs and there was a definite smell in the hallway that other people wrote about, but I couldn't smell it in the room. I could however, very clearly hear every word being spoken in the hallway, even when I could tell that people were trying to be quiet. There was also a substantial gap between the door and the floor which let in a lot of light in the night. Lastly, the temperature controls were not very good. Sometimes the room was too hot and sometimes too cold and the basic warm/cool control in the room did very little to change the temperature. Verdict: Hotel Griffon tries very hard, but is average. It is probably better to stay in an upgraded, guaranteed King room with a view, but for those prices I would just stay somewhere else, especially with two people in a room.
