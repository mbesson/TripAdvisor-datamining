On the plus side, after we complained about the unacceptable state of the pullout couch's mattress (what's considered their triple room) the problem was dealt with the same day and we received a letter of apology and complimentary chocolates from the hotel. The walls in this hotel must be paper-thin, because we could hear the TV on in other rooms, children screaming, and stomping any time we were in the room. The breakfast was overpriced at 18 euro. (Hint: there's a supermarket less than half-a-block away where you can pick up most of what is offered at a fraction of the price. The room has a mini-bar that can be used to refrigerate any perishables.) We dined at the restaurant on our first night...one time too many. The food was barely edible and overpriced. I've had better meals on the side of the road in India! The wait staff's behaviour was appalling. Wifi was an additional charge of 9 euro for 24 hours. The two courtesy computers in the lobby were constantly being used by young children playing games or on social media sites. This is particularly frustrating when you would like to quickly check flights, routes to attractions or make dinner reservations. I wouldn't recommend this hotel.

One couple in our group of friends were unceremoniously told on arrival in the late evening that the hotel was very busy and over booked and they would have to move to a 'sister hotel' and another couple in our party were not allocated the twin-bedded room which had been reserved directly on the phone with the hotel. In both cases the member of staff on Reception was unacceptably unpleasant in his attitude and handling of the problem, which made the initial problems so much worse. I must stress that all other members of staff were superb in their attitude and did their very best to placate our friends. It is just a pity that they were let down so badly by their colleague. Also, although we had asked for a Non Smoking Room, an ash tray in the room,the smell of smoke sometimes in the corridor and through the vent in the bathroom (??!!) and the absence of a 'No Smoking' sign did made me wonder.

The personnel is extremely friendly, we got all kinds of help and even free coffee and croissants one day. Can't praise the reception people enough, The only two drawbacks are the following: (a) If breakfast is not included in your room rate, it's way too expensive. Don't have breakfast at the hotel, walk 200 m and you'll find nice and cheaper places. (Don't even think about a little breakfast place around the corner... it's as expensive as the hotel. Pass that place and continue walking); (b) There are bit two computers for guests to use in the reception area. This should be enough (actually, there should be internet access in the rooms) but very often those computers are taken over by children, who spend hours playing with them. Perhaps the hotel should consider restricting use of those computers to grown-ups, who have to do urgent things like checking in for their fights. Children do have a games console in the lobby, so they don't need two additional computers. All in all, and apart from these two minor objections, a very nice hotel at a very attractive price.

We got a room that looked out at the inner courtyard behind the hotel. Keep in mind that the hotel has airconditioning but that it is hardly ever switched on. It was above 30 degrees during our stay but the aircon wasn't switched on at time.

If you are coming from the airport- better to hire taxi rather than lug your luggage along all those steps in all the berlin subway station.

Double glazed windows, large airy rooms. I could not have wished for better. The bar was really nice, with the enourmous Berlin beers. And the food! We ate supper our second night at the restraurant. I savoured every morsel. I chose the salmon, with potato and bacon and Kenyan beans. With a butter and garlic mousse. My husband chose the pork steak, baked potato with sour cream (biggest potato and sour cream dressing I have ever seen) and cabbage. The portions were large and by the time I finished eating, I could barely manage to get to my room. The cost was reasonable as well: with tip about 50 euro but was well worth it. I should mention that we also had four massive beers with that meal. In my last few trips, no meal has matched that of the hotel's. The staff in any part of the hotel were all the same: polite, helpful, friendly and uber professional. My German language skills are not great and they all spoke French and English to a standard that made me feel that my German was just embarrassing. Eric at the front desk was incredible. So nice and helpful. He made us feel that we were the only guests in the hotel. I even wrote to Novotel to say that he did a brilliant job. The location is great. It is in what was once East Berlin. The hotel is central and only a few stops from the Alexanderplatz. The area is nice, clean and we felt completely safe going out at night. This is always a concern of mine as for years I travelled solo and will always scope the area. If I ever visit Berlin again, I am staying here. We managed to get \u00a3100 off the price of the hotel as the rooms are not cheap.

I hope this changes and novotel starts doing just like Best western hotels in which wifi internet is free of charge in the rooms.

Complimentary tea, coffee and mini-bar (the latter a booking deal you have to look out for, but it's there). Comfortable beds, good sound-proofing, controllable heating and a good, deep bath and shower. There's a small fitness centre:- gym and sauna both free of charge. There is a solarium as well but I dodn't use that so can't say if this is a chargeable extra. If you fancy a swim, there's a decent public swimming pool right opposite the hotel entrance.

Breakfast provided a choice of waffles, fruit, yoghurts, hot food, sliced cheese and meats etc. There are 2 computers in the Lobby, free to use, and a games console - again free. The hotel has a modern design and easy feel - the staff go out of their way to help and nothing was too much trouble. You're well-located for most of Berlin's sights here. The hotel is about 20 minutes walk to the Brandenburg Gate to the west, and 10 minutes to Alexanderplatz to the east. You could get a train from Schonefeld to Alexanderplatz. I've chosen this option before when travelling alone:- it's cheap and reliable, but this time we took a cab - a 30 minute journey and about 35 Euro.

As others have commented it is in an excellent location. Although on a fairly busy road, the area is in general quiet so good for sleeping. As others have commented, it is only a 2-3 minute walk from Spittlemarkt (U2 line) u-bahn station. Also as another reviewer said, it is easiest to get to the hotel if you exit at Leipziger Strasse exit, not Fisherinsel exit. Go out onto Leipziger Stasser, turn right and you will see the novotel sign right ahead of you. In addition to the u-bahn, it is possible to walk across the road from the hotel to the lovely Nikolaiviertel and on to Alexanderplatz. We ate one evening at the georgbraeue Brauhaus along the river in the Nikolaiviertel and there are a couple of other restaurants in this area. We had an excellent offer including breakfast. Our rooms were good. Spacious and although functional, very well-designed with a sofa and coffeetable. The bathroom was a fairly good size with bath and shower although it wasn't the most user-friendly in terms of changing between the two. Similarly a button on the hair dryer had to be continuously held for it to work which wasn't the most convenient. It was good to have tea and coffee but we found that the creamer sachets weren't always replaced and for some reason only one drinking chocolate sachet was ever given. Staff at Reception did arrange replacement supplies for us when asked. Breakfast was excellent although did not really vary at all during our 4 mornings there. There was a great selection of fruits, yoghurts as well as bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, meats, cheese, waffles (cook your own! they were delicious), breads, 3 different types of honey, lots of jams/preserves etc etc. The free apple mac computers in the lobby are a useful touch but were often being used during our stay although we were able to access them when needed. Although we had read that taxis could be very expensive to Schoenfeld airport. we decided to ask the hotel to order us one for our return flight due to the snow and having a morning flight and it cost just under 34 euros although the traffic was light. For 4 adults, we found it great value to get the daily small group ticket at the u-bahn station which allowed up to 5 adults all day usage on the u- and s-bahn for 15 euro 90.

There is a double bed and an expandable sleeping sofa for 2 persons. The room can fit 4 persons for sleeping. The sofa is ok but not like a real bed. You need to ask for additional bed linned, pillows and so in order to fit 4 persons in the room. The bed is not Sofitel level but is above average. Not to hard and not to soft. Pillows were not my favorite but they rarely are. The hotel seems quite new. All room facili-ties are in good order. The bath room is a good reasonable size. Not fancy with marble but functional. The bathtub is a little smaller than normal size and not very \"sexy\". Good pressure on water and it can be very hot! There is a coffee facility in the room but in my opinion it is only for emergency! There is a Xbox (in a play area) next to the reception and two Apple with Internet explorer for free us-age! This is a good thing for kids! The breakfast is 17 Euros per person. We did not use it but went to the Balzar Coffee shop on Karl Liepknects strasse (100 meters from Radisson Blu hotel). Here you can have good coffee and sand-wiches. The parking facilities are excellent (not free). There is an underground garage (closed with gate at night) but you can enter 24h. The spaces are fairly large, good lightning and there is a short walk to the lift. We used the bar and there was a good selection and service. The prices are a little above normal level but ok for a hotel (Weissbier is about 4,90 euro). The hotel seemed completely full but everything just worked fine (we saw there was a line for the break-fast area one morning but that was it). We took the Top tour sight seeing tour (15 euros per person). The red bus was ok, but the every 15 min. departure did not. We waited at one point almost 45 minutes. The yellow busses (other company) pasted us 4 times. Go for the one with most departure \u2013 especially in high season. Go to the Italian restaurant La Rustica near the Hackescher market train station. Very good pizza and good service. We had 2 salads, 2 pizzas, drinks and coffee for 46 Euros. My only downside of the hotel is the pricing of Internet. Flat rate for 24 hours is 19,90 Euros. This is too expensive \u2013 but cheaper than other hotels. (Remember to bring a longer cable \u2013 the one in the room is only 1 meter). The speed is 2mb up and 2mb down. WIFI was not performing properly but I didn't investigate it further.

The hotel is 150m from the Spittelmarkt underground station (but not signposted when you come out of the station!) and is beside the Liepzigstrasse - a busy dual-carriageway. Rooms up to number 15 (115, 215 etc) face onto the road and so are very noisy if you have the windows open - however, with the very good windows closed we couldn't hear the traffic. If you like to sleep with the window open, ask for a high number room at the back of the hotel which faces blocks of flats. By the way, we spotted a particular neighbour in a tower block watching the hotel rooms through binoculars, so keep the net curtains shut if you value your privacy! We also found the rooms to be very warm, even when the Air-con was switched on and set to HIGH and COLD. Our friends had the same problem. It's in a great location - within 3 stops of Alexanderplatz and 10 mins walk to Checkpoint Charlie, the University and Potsdamer Platz. There's an Indian restaurant next door (empty) and a Chinese about 5 mins walk toward CC (which looks nice but was quite poor by our standards). The hotel is a modern boutique style, very nicely finished and with Apple Macs at reception for guests to use. The rooms are smart and very clean and the beds are very comfortable. The breakfast is buffet style with a great selection - but not worth the 15 Euros they want - make sure you get this included in your deal as there are no cafes nearby that you could go to! There is also a gym and sauna in the hotel but we never used these - there is a public swimming pool next to the hotel if you want a swim while you're there. Strange there is no mention of this in the hotels info anywhere. The bar is also HUGELY expensive - nearly \u00a310 for a cocktail which we got elsewhere for \u00a35. We opted to buy at Lidl, just 200m along the road and stock our HUGELY EXPENSIVE mini-bar in the room with our own drink - your 5 euro bottle of Holsten Pilsner in the mini-bar is 49 cents at Lidl!!!!!! PROS - great location but pricey. Staff and cleanliness of hotel and rooms very good. CONS - Very pricey bar and mini-bar and a pricey breakfast which was not worth the 15 Euros (unless included in your package). Noisy rooms if windows to be left open.

They even had a rain and massage shower. Value for money on that one. The hotel is in the Mitte area within walking distance to Alexanderplatz and Nicolai Viertel. There is a supermarket (Edeka) just around the corner. Only bad experience was at breakfast. Selection is very basic with not even a handful of hot items. However, we could have survived that if it was not for the extremely rude breakfast lady who pas present there that day. On Friday morning the 11th of December a lady with a pair of round glasses, thirty-something, a harsh non-smiling facial expression and a kind of ponytail was working there. She wanted to seat us in a very crowded area, however since we were there with a two-year old and a five year old, we requested for a more quiet seating area. We could see a couple of available tables a little bit away. At first she didn't understand (most of the staff speak only German), but then she eventually nodded. When my husband went over there to sit with our daughter she came running all of a sudden and literally poked his shoulder very hard in front of all the other guests while yelling something in German about the tables being a la carte. The worse part was the rolling of her eyes at us directly in our faces as we were imbeciles. We felt very embarrased and moved away to another table. However, the rest of the breakfast experience was shadowed by this rude \"welcome\". We lost our appetites and the next morning decided to skip breakfast down in the restaurant. We just spend two weeks travelling in Malaysia and Singapore last month where we also stayed at several international chains, including Novotel. In Asia this kind of behaviour from a staff member will be unheard of. Just to add, we were the only Muslim tourists there. My husband has a beard and I wear the head scarf.

I'm sure that the management at the Novotel Mitte trains their staff in the highest level of service and politeness towards ALL guests. However, the management should also be aware of the fact that most hotel guests are in general very sensitive to bad behaviour from staff members. Just one bad incident can make a guest forget all the other nice things and never want to stay there again.

If one is willing to stay for at least two days and to pay the entire price at booking with no option of rescheduling or cancellation it permits enjoying the comfort of a very good 4 stars hotel while paying less than in many of Berlin's 3 stars hotels. This bargain price may have had something to do with the fact that I was there at the beginning of August which probably is not the high season for the hotels of Berlin. My motivation for choosing this hotel was the air-conditioning of the room which worked very well at these summery temperatures and fortunately is not switched off upon leaving the room. The only minor drawback of Novotel Berlin Mitte is its vicinity. It is neither ugly nor frightening, but does not offer many restaurants and shops within a ten minutes walking distance. Although generally this Fischerinsel area is very calm the hotel is situated directly at the artery of Gertraudenstrasse, where traffic starts to become heavy already at 5 o'clock in the morning. Then one would appreciate even better sound-proof properties of the windows, though they are not bad in this respect. Apart from that the picture is 100 percent rosy. The decoration of the rooms is that of a typical design-orientated hotel: elegant, bright and comfortable, although I would have preferred a less stylish look if there had been more cupboard space in return. Enormous attention is directed at details which are intended to make the guests feel well. For instance, half a dozen (!) different body care products are provided, further pillows of different softness as well as extra blankets are available in the cupboard and a shoe shining machine in the corridor can be used for free, to name just a few. The additional blanket may be advantageous because originally there is only a single blanket for a double bed, which will not be appreciated by all those sharing the room. My room was in a top condition, perfectly clean, equipped with an excellent bed and a fairly large flat screen TV. The buffet breakfast included in the \u2018city breaks\u2019 rate is marvellous. I do not think that somebody could miss anything there. Thus, if you succeed to get the more than 40 percent reduction on the regular room rate due to the \u2018city breaks\u2019 option of Novotel Berlin Mitte you will definitely be happy about the good bargain of enjoying its very high level of service for such a moderate price.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lisbon", "Title": "\u201cGood choice in Berlin Mitte\u201d", "Author": "javp", "ReviewID": "UR36666114", "Content": "I admitt that I am a fan of the Novotel chain.

As any frequent traveller knows, value for money is poor in these hotels if you pay the appropriately-named \u201crack-rate\u201d plus the high charge for breakfast. But there are \u201coffers\u201d all year round, and if one is lucky enough to know the dates in advance, many bargains can be had by \u201cshopping around\u201d among the various Accor, Hilton or Holiday Inn offers (to name but the best-known chains \u2013 Novotel belongs with Accor). My verdict: Novotel Berlin Mitte has a competitive advantage over Novotel Charenton in that you get a centrally-located hotel (by the way the best U-Bahn station is Spittelmarkt, not M\u00e4rkisches Museum \u2013 the Accor people could not care less about customers without cars, and their location maps and directions are generally useless for pedestrians) at the cost (I paid 85 euros per night incl. breakfast) of a \u201csuburban\u201d hotel like Novotel Charenton. I remember Tripadvisor reporters complaining about the fact that the WC was separate from the bathroom \u2013 the general rule in Novotels. But it is IN the bathroom of the Novotel Berlin Mitte. A bathroom with a combination bath/shower. In the Novotel Charenton, I only had a shower (poor value for what claims to be a four-star hotel). In London, Novotels have both a bath AND a shower. So you never know what to expect when you book \u2013 irritatingly for hotels with the same name. Likewise, some London Novotels have a shaving mirror. Novotel Charenton does not have any, but Novotel Berlin Mitte has them \u2013 a \u201cluxury touch\u201d at a rate far inferior to London ones. On the other hand, it did not have the rotating desk typical of Novotels, and it had an old-fashioned TV, compared with the flat screen I got in the much cheaper Ibis Gentilly in Paris two weeks ago. Interesting international comparisons can be made between the Novotels I have so far patronised in London, Paris, Berlin and Hamburg. Only the London Novotels offer fried eggs \u2013 with the best bacon. For some reason the German and French cooks in the Novotels do not know the trick of frying bacon \u2013 theirs is far too dry and hard. The choice of meats (notably hot and cold sausage) is best in Novotel Berlin Mitte. The bread rolls are also excellent. If you prefer perfect toasted bread go to London. Novotel Charenton comes a poor third \u2013 probably reflecting the fact that the French do not attach much importance to their breakfast. Novotel Charenton would no doubt be best for dinner, on the other hand (though I have never had dinner in any Novotel). But the Novotel Berlin Mitte is not far from the Nicholas Quarter (Nicolaiviertel), where you will have a marvellous sauerkraut downed with a pint of excellent Berlin lager at for instance Zur Rippe restaurant at an unbeatable price. Give a wide berth to Zum Nussbaum, where you will be rudely turned off (even though in perfect English) if coming after 22:00 on a Saturday night. Conclusion : if what you want is a comfortable room with excellent breakfast and quick access to the city centre by public transport, the Novotel Berlin Mitte is for you.

I don't speak much German and the staff generally spoke pretty good English. I was at the back of the Hotel which was quite good as there was a view over some gardens towards the canal. There were a few 20 floor tower blocks nearby but not close enough to overlook too much. The front of the Hotel would have been noisier as there is a busy 6 lane highway, so the back suited me as I like to open my window rather than just use the aircon. The Hotel seems built to a good standard with wide hallways and spacious rooms, I think it was built about 5 years ago. I was next to the lift which was handy, but the motor could be faintly heard but not enough to be annoying. I think there were 3 lifts and 3 staircases. The bed seemed comfortable and pretty firm which I prefer. One of the best things was the buffet breakfast which gets served till 10.30am. I ate bacon, scrambled eggs, sausages, fat chips then croissants with jam followed up with fruit salad, but this was only a fraction of what was on offer. My aim was to fill up so that I could get by with just a snack during the day which I managed quite well. There was a handy lobby bar for draft pilsner beer etc, and a restaurant where I tried a pasta dish which was not bad for about 10 Euros. There is a handy supermarket only yards from the entrance where I stocked up on German Cheeses, Sausages breads and deserts for when I wanted to snack in some evenings rather than eat out. The Hotel is only a couple hundred yards from the U Bahn Station and this links to Alexanderplatz for getting the S Bahn to the Airport (EUR 2,80). It cost me EUR 38 for a taxi from the Airport (Schoenfeld) to the Hotel. The checkout time was noon and they have a secure place to store bags which was handy as I had a late flight out.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location, convenient price\u201d", "Author": "GGZ", "ReviewID": "UR19629219", "Content": "The hotel is modern and really well situated.
