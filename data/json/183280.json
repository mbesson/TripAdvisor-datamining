The hotel may look industrial like and dated from outside, and located in the industrial area of Montreal. But if you want to sleep in a quiet environment with a comfortable bed to sleep at night. This is the one. These are my comments about this property: 1st : Check In, despite on the Easter holiday, Sunday 24th April 2011, with a hotel staff 'Peter'. Service was quick, professional but friendly with smile. 2nd : Discovered that wireless internet did not work in my room, talked to a hotel staff 'Jerry', who later I found out that he is a FOM. Wireless connection was fixed when I returned to the hotel that afternoon. Jerry was really making sure that everything function fine. Personal thank you for this once again Jerry. 3rd : House keeping service was topnotch, you see yourself, photos are here! When I was here, swimming pool was close so I did not used it. Fitness room required an access code to get in. There was also a guest laundry. Breakfast contains of two choices, American and Continental - not a buffet style. You really need to have a car to make your life easy if you want to move around in and out of Montreal, I rent one, a 4WD, parked in front of the hotel, and nothing wrong seemed to happen during my stay. To sum up, I will definitely come back again next time to this property. I get what I want, a quiet environment, comfortable bed, functioning wireless connection, a small business center with complimentary printing system, a cash machine at the corner, a cozy Italian restaurant at the corner, and free airport shuttle services and polite hotel staffs! To previous comments : I think the hotel has changed its management team. Carlson made a very good job. Finally, two thumbs up to Peter, Jerry the FOM and the House Keeping Staff who I don't know who he/she was.

The bathroom ceiling was mouldy crumbling industrial ceiling tiles (the particle board kind), which is extremely stupid to put in a bathroom. The bed was old and broken. They tried to piece it together with some new 2x4's and nails. The matress was equally terrible, very soft, and had springs that were poking out all over the place. The TV was a 15inch old CRT tube TV that barely got 10 channels. The only good thing about the trip was the shuttle was convenient to the airport... but usually very late. I would advise against staying here, try the comfort inn... its cheaper and a million times better.", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Park Inn & Suites Montreal Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d183280-Reviews-Park_Inn_Suites_Montreal_Airport-Montreal_Quebec.html", "Price": "$90 - $124*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7300 Cote De Liesse</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Saint-Laurent</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Montreal</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Quebec</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">H4T 1E7</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "183280", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7e/c9/7ec9fc3751c4ec41c9d617e539eb29656large.jpg"}}
