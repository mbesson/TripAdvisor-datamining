The rooms are a decent size, well appointed without being cramped and very clean and I was pleasantly surprised to find my bed made up each day (towels were not replaced but that's fine by me). Toilets were also kept very clean. The staff were lovely - very helpful and friendly.

(I had emailed and called in advance to inform them of our arrival time because it was so late). The hotel occupies the fifth floor of a fairly grotty looking building. However, we were pleasantly surprised when the door to Cressy opened to reveal a fresh and clean reception area. There is a lift but you have to make sure that you shut both sets of doors or the lift won't move. We only had one day where somebody had left one door open so we had to walk down rather than use the lift. We paid for our stay upon arrival (we could have paid afterwards if we'd liked) in cash (no choice about that). We were a group of three friends who stayed in a room with a private bathroom. I would advise people travelling in groups to pay a bit extra for a private bathroom so that they could be up and out before the heat made it uncomfortable to go walking. Our room was larger than expected, clean and behind 3 locked doors (door to building, door to Cressy and then room door). This fully met all of our requirements as the purpose of our holiday was to explore Rome, see the sights and then sleep in a hotel room that was safe and relatively quiet. The only noise we had was the traffic. We slept with the window open on the first night but the traffic noise was horrific so we resorted to closing the window and having the fan on. Location is fantastic! We walked everywhere apart from to the Vatican (we walked back from there) and saw all the sights we wanted to in the 5 days we were in Rome.

The room was nothing incredible (we were in a room without a bathroom), but it did have a mirror and a sink which was good. The shared bathroom was nothing especially beautiful but was kept fairly clean and was working perfectly. The location nearby Termini was for us backpackers a blessing, letting us unload quickly after getting of the train. There is no sign out front, but you can look for Pensione Catherine (it shares the same building). Rome isn't as huge as it looks on the map, so although the hotel looks like it's out of the way, you can hoof it to the other side of the city (Vatican) within an hour. Less than a block away on the opposite side of the street is an incredible internet/phone cafe that was ridiculously cheap (a euro an hour for internet - you can even pay by minute/page - and ten cents a minute to call home to Canada).", "Date": "May 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "3", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant for a short stay.\u201d", "Author": "dandyUK40", "ReviewID": "UR4591150", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Cressy for a long weeekend in March 2006.
