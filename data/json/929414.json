If you're looking for anything else - don't go here, it won't have it. Main gripes: The beds were VERY uncomfortable. Just a thin, unsupportive mattress on a hard base. The curtains were flimsy, see-through and barely stretched the length of the window so lots of light poured into the room (from streetlamps etc) even in the middle of the night. We opened the window to make the room less stuffy but then got disturbed by the refuse collections immediately outside the building at 7am. Also there was lots of noise from traffic on the street outside at all hours. There was no en-suite, so the bathroom was shared with ~10 rooms, and there was no sink in the bedroom. Might have been fine, except on our floor there were two bathrooms: One for \"men\" and one without a gender label, which I took to be the women's bathroom but it seemed some men were using it as their first choice because it was closer to their bedrooms . The shower cubicle was made of see-through glass, so either you had to shower exposing yourself to anyone who came in to use the toilet/sink (potentially both genders) or could you lock the door which meant noone could use the sink or go to the toilet while you're in the shower. I was especially annoyed when I couldn't use the sink to clean my teeth because there were 2 BOYS who had locked the door on the women's bathroom to take a shower. Minor gripes: The decor is shabby, and the place didn't really feel clean. Towels thin and a bit grubby. I gave it 2 stars because of the cheap price, and the staff were very friendly. However, if you don't have a tight budget and want any degree of comfort from your stay - I really recommend staying somewhere else.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pavia, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGoing to Berlin?\u201d", "Author": "GeorgesPiriou", "ReviewID": "UR125198602", "Content": "Six months ago we spent a week at the sister hotel in Adlershof, much closer to the airport.

Bathrooms were at the end of the hallway. No sink in the room. Forget about refrigerator, micro or coffee-maker. Or one of those electric tea kettles popular in Europe. None were there. The bath towels resembled kitchen rags, as seen in Europe quite often (not fluffy!). There was only one man\u2019s toilet/shower per floor. It did not bother us since we tend to wake up after most of the other people. We did not buy the 10-Euro ($14) breakfast, which was overpriced for this class of a hotel (rather hostel). You can try the Berliner\u2019s favorite Curry-wurst for some 2 Euros at a joint downstairs or across the street. One thing that worried me about this hotel was the occasional summer heat waves in Europe. The place does not have any kind of air conditioning, just big windows. When we stayed there, the temperatures were very moderate and the place was getting stuffy. In case of a heat wave, it would be very uncomfortable. Furthermore, I do not recommend this hotel to beer drinkers, as in order to pee at night, you have to dress in the middle of the night and walk to the end of the hallway, where the bathroom is.

It was excellent to pop into the garden on one end of town and pop out close to our destination. You can even see a little bit of the zoo on bike trails through the park. As for the hotel, they offer a pay breakfast which we did not opt for. The rooms are spartan in furnishings but adequate. The rooms were cleaned daily. The desk help spoke excellent English and were helpful and nice. There were two vending machines in the lobby. The room had one bar internet and the lobby had four bar internet, so I went to the lobby to use the internet which was spacious and decent. They offered German language newspapers in the lobby. The TV had exactly ZERO English language channels. I wish they would have had at least one as this is how I relax just before bed time. The bathroom was decent by European standards. The bed and bedding was fine but not luxury. We had a court yard view, which was not particularly nice but it was quiet. There is no A/C which was fine for 6 of our 7 days at the hotel but on the last day, I sure wanted A/C or a fan.

We got a room on the fourth floor and it was indeed quite big. The furnishing is rather simple, almost ascetic (not to say uncomfortable - the beds were very good). Everything is in good condition though - no loose handles or wobbly chairs etc. Our room had no bathroom - we had to share with other guests on the floor which wasn't bad as only two of the four or five rooms on the fifth floor didn't have their own bathrooms. A downside of the room was that the elevator only reaches the fourth floor so we had to carry our luggage up a flight of stairs. The hotel staff speak fluent English and were all kind and helpfull. You can leave your post at the reception to be sent, buy stamps and snacks, store your luggage or ask about local curiosities and will always be served well. Something you should know is that the hotel has a specific policy considering linen and towel changes: unless you ask for a daily change at the reception they will change it only about 2 times a week (of course you do get fresh linnen at check-in!). The biggest drawback was the wifi access (or rather lack of it) in our room. We had to go down to the fourth floor to have a stable signal. The second thing we didn't enjoy was that there was no air-conditioning in our room (on the top floor of the building) which made it pretty hard to cope with over 28 degrees Celsius outside. However, I do have to admit that the hotel is a clean and pleasant place to stay in Berlin and it does have an excellent location too (close to the Zoologischer Garten U-Bahn and S-Bahn stations). Before our stay we had doubts about staying so close to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedachtnis-Kirche (known for its six bells which toll a few times a day) but it turned out not to be a nuisance at all.

Also, I would recommend to take a ride on the regular city bus #100 and #200 (bus stop in front of the ZOO station for both, and you can do the loops on them, as they have a slightly different routing), as they go by all of the tourist attractions, and you can get on and off as you like. Make sure that you purchase a Berlin Welkome Card (19 Euros) that is good for family of 4, and gives unlimited city transit traveling, plus discounts to some attractions, plus more. And last but not least, if you are traveling with teenagers who like skateboarding, make sure you come in the evening to the plaza in front of Europa Center, as you may witness how few guys show off their skills in skateboarding, and I must say, Tony Hawk watch out, there is a great talent in Europe.", "Date": "August 6, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Berolina Hotel an der Gedaechtniskirche", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d929414-Reviews-Berolina_Hotel_an_der_Gedaechtniskirche-Berlin.html", "Price": "$46 - $102*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Rankestrasse 35</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10789</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "929414", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c6/cd/c6cd93605683e97171ce498c94803f4e5large.jpg"}}
