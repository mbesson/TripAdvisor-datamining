The room my family of four stayed in was nice--the kids slept on a pull out couch in the entry room. Our double bed was in a second, fairly spacious room.

I was picked up at the airport promptly and taken to the hotel where I was greeted like one of their dearest guests. Turkish people are one of the most hard working and friendly people out there. Hakan and his staff are helpful and endlessly wonderful. I stayed at the appartments and -being somewhat direction challenged- they made sure I can find my way around (although the location of the hotel is genious). When needed, they would gladly come to rescue:) They secured me most terrific tour guide who was very knowledgeable, friendly, pleasant and just very cool.

We stayed in one of the apartments which was very nice - a great sea view which is a good way to appreciate Istanbul as one of the world's great harbour cities, and it also gives a bit more privacy than I imagine the main hotel would have. The hot water in the apartment ran out very quickly, but reheated equally quickly so was only a minor irritation (you might not notice if you're not one for long hot showers like me - or if you visit at a different time of the year, since it's usually hot in Turkey anyway). As might be expected from such a small hotel, the owner takes a personal interest in every guest and he checked with us more than once that all was well. We were partly attracted to this hotel because it shows up on a Google as one of relatively few that are gay friendly, and our experience bore this out (they didn't bat an eyelid at two men sharing a double).

All of them have been excellent, and the month we spent there in November of 2011 was no exception. We like the spacious \"two room\" concept of Room One. We love the room arrangement, the comfortable bed and the luxurious and large bathroom. Breakfast is simply outstanding. Orange juice is squeezed freshly for you when you arrive at the breakfast. There is a wide variety of breads, cheeses, meats and an excellent arrangement of olives. Add tomatoes and cucumbers, fresh eggs, yogurt, dried and fresh fruit and cereal and you have many breakfast choices. US guests will appreciate the brewed coffee, which is not easy to find in Istanbul. I can not say enough about the staff of the Apricot. My husband was ill almost all of the time we were in Istanbul, and spent many days right in bed. He received better care from the staff of the hotel than he did in the ultra-modern hospital where he went when we returned from Istanbul. Hakan, the owner, was very concerned for the welfare of my husband. He obtained medicine for him, and offered to take him to a doctor and/or hospital many times. He checked on our status several times each day. The incomparable Ayse is just amazing. She prepares and serves breakfast, keeps all the rooms clean and tidy, and provides lots of hugs and smiles making you feel totally at home. In our case she took special care of my husband. She provided medication, and on several occasions brought food she had made at home that she hoped would tempt his appetite. On those days that we ventured outside she made sure he was warmly dressed, buttoning his coat and making sure he had on a hat. We could simply not have received warmer or more comprehensive service. We arrived only a few hours after Lynn, a partner in the hotel, had passed away, and we all missed her vibrant personality. Fortunately, while the staff was grieving, there was no slip in the outstanding service. We like Room One in the main hotel, but if I were able to walk a few more blocks I would look seriously at the Seaside Flats also offered by the Apricot. These little self-catering jewels have good sized balconies with outstanding views of the Sea of Marmara. The design and decoration of these rooms is exceptionally well done. Because my husband was ill I did more entertaining in the lobby this year than ever before. The staff was gracious to all of my guests, providing beverages and cookies. Even if we stayed up very late there were no objections. Much of the original hotel has received new wall paper, and the Wi-fi worked perfectly during all of our stay. I also appreciated the assistance of the young men who worked the night reception desk. They were very helpful in ordering meals delivered to me, and they even tracked down some \"US style\" chicken noodle soup. Being ill on a vacation is not the way we would select to spend our time in Istanbul, but if one has to be ill, the staff at the Apricot could not take better care of you.

Room(s): We decided to rent the flat (they have 2 for rent) a bottom and top flats. (the second story flat is a private residence) Top Flat - Great room, a double bed, sitting area, great window, bath and view of the Marmara Sea. The flat was well decorated and very clean. If you needed a refrigerator or microwave, you needed to request one a head of time. There is no elevator, there are narrow stairs made of wood. There were various offers to bring our luggage up and down the stairs - It did not seem that were not looking for tips, they just wanted to keep the property maintained and free of scuffs and and avoid denting the walls. Bottom Flat - This was not as clean or as outfitted as the top flat. The floor could of been a bit cleaner, but everything else was clean enough. It seemed that the bottom flat was still in construction mode as we found supplies throughout the flat. Again you needed to request a refrigerator or microwave ahead of time. The back deck looking over the sea was nice, but beware of the wooden bench, it was oozing sap from the wood and I got a bunch of sap over my laptop and pants. It seemed that they just got the bottom flat livable in time for our arrival. Room summary - Overall, not bad (really good deal) given the price that Lynn had set up for us. Considering that both flat were included, we paid less than we would of for a room in a three star rated hotel. Both flats together slept 5, maybe even 6 with the additional mattress. Note to light sleepers - be aware of any hotel in this area of Sultanahmet as there are regular trains coming through. I did not notice them late at night. Location - Location, Location, Location - Wow, the hotel and flat are in Sultanahmet and close walking distance to most attractions. The neighborhood felt very safe and anytime of night or day. The neighborhood had hotels, private residences and even some K\u00c4\u00b1raathanes. Staff - Great -This is what can make or break things, and the staff made our stay very nice. I'm sorry that I was not able to meet Lynn, but Hakkan, John and everyone else was very friendly and helpful. We tipped them often, but I don't think that it was expected, but very appreciated. Breakfast - Included with the room; coffee, tea, water, fresh squeezed orange juice, jams, bread, sandwich meat, spreads, boiled eggs, vegetables and a couple different cereals. Very sufficient for a small boutique hotel. If you are looking for an experience of living close to the way a Turk may live, and not rely on major chains, I would recommend this property.

The newer part of the hotel is a few streets away and is part of an old, character apartment that had been recently renovated. We were given the option of which part to stay. We chose the newer part because the rooms were bigger and the bedroom had a cute balcony with good views across the Sea of Marmara and the dozens of ships lying at anchor.

We love Hakan. He is a gracious host with a wealth of information and he is always happy to help you plan your adventures in Istanbul. Recently Lynn became a co-owner of the Apricot. I thought everything was perfect prior to this change, but I was wrong. The best hotel got even better with the synergy these two people provide to every guest. Together they are better than the sum of their parts. Lynn brings a rare level of enthusiasm to the hotel. I looked forward to waking up every morning so I could walk down the stairs and hear her laughter and listen to her stories. She is vibrant and dynamic and makes sure you enjoy your experience. She loves Istanbul, and it is impossible to talk to her and not catch that energy yourself. Ayse, the hotel maid, is a treasure. She literally waited on us hand and foot. I had recently had hip surgery and could not put on my own shoes. She pushed my husband out of the way and insisted that she do it herself. The other staff members are just as enthusiastic. Lynn's attitude is contagious. She really will send a staff member with you if you are not certain of where you are going. Our daughter visited us during the last week of our stay in Istanbul. She enjoys a brisk walk early in the morning. Every morning she was accompanied by a hotel staff member, who not only kept her company on her walk but also provided a wealth of information on everything they passed along the way. Using some rare sixth sense, it seemed like every time we got off of the tram to return to the hotel there was someone from the hotel to meet us and carry our packages home. If I said \"What are you doing here?\" the response was always \"looking for you\". Breakfast is completely amazing. From fresh eggs to a huge variety of outstanding breads, to the selection of olives, the thick yogurt, the cherry preserves, the goat cheese, often produced from the goats the hotel owns on property south of Istanbul, the fresh vegetables and fruits, and, of course, the remarkable freshly squeezed orange juice. I really miss my normal Apricot breakfast of tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, olives, yogurt, simmit, soft-boiled egg and whatever fruits are in season. This is the only meal I ever eat that provides seven servings of fruits and vegetables in a single meal. Breakfast entertainment is even better than the food. Lynn makes sure that guests are introduced to one another, and then it is inevitable that you exchange information and experiences with your fellow travelers. Lynn and Hakan are so interesting that it is always difficult for us to leave the hotel on our daily adventures. We really did spend a couple of days in the hotel without leaving it. We had a couple of days when we were not feeling well. Ayse brought us food and beverages and Hakan ordered our evening meals from good neighborhood restaurants. It is not a five star property, and there might be a bit of fraying around the edges, but the building rings with laughter and energy and embraces you. The room rates are among the lowest in the neighborhood, and such low prices permit us to spend at least a month in the hotel. If you sacrifice the trappings of a five star hotel, they are more than compensated by the amazing level of service we receive. The hotel enjoys an excellent location in Sultanahmet. All the historical sites are within easy walking distance. The property is only one block away from a street that is very busy with many restaurant choices. Yet, the hotel itself is located on a tiny quiet street. I find the views of other quaint little boutique hotels to be quite charming from my room in the hotel. We never travel without both of our laptops and the Wifi connection is great. The TV provides a limited number of English speaking programs, but my husband is totally addicted to some series from the UK. I enjoy CNN International. In addition to the main building the hotel also offers a couple of small apartments. These rooms are jewels. They offer amazing views of the Sea of Marmara. Every item in each room has been carefully selected from the hand-blown glass fixtures to the custom made draperies. These Seaside Flat rooms provide a high level of luxury, and are both charming and romantic. I have never felt more \"at home\" anywhere than I feel at the Apricot. From the minute I see my name on a sign at the airport to the last breakfast, which is prepared and waiting for me when I depart at an unreasonably early hour, every minute we spend here is lovely, charming and pleasant. Were I to win the lottery I would simply move into room one and live in the hotel full-time. We miss every day that we are away from Istanbul. I wished I could give it six stars because that is what it deserves.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, fantastic service & great Turkish hospitality\u201d", "Author": "Keyamom", "ReviewID": "UR86738686", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for our entire stay in Istanbul & we had a great time with not much to complain about.

Situated in the old part of Istanbul ( the SultanAhmet area ) and just a few minutes to the Arasta Bazaar and Blue Mosque it is a wonderful location and the service and hospitality are excellent. Hakan the owner arranged for the shuttle to pick me up upon my arrival at Istanbul Ataturk airport. The shuttle was there waiting from me to arrive which I was very happy not to have to wait around. The driver was great and within about 30 minutes or so I was at the hotel were I check in and made my way to my room. The front clerks at the hotel ( Goksel and sorry cannot remember the other older man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name ) where extremely helpful and polite. They were always available to call you a taxi or help if needed. Also I should remember to thank the cleaning lady who was also very friendly and cleaned and made up my room everyday during my 3 nights spend there. Everything was perfect. The rooms are of standard size, comfy beds with ammenities such as TV, Wifi, telephone, small balconies and with a very large bathroom. And my room had a jacuzzi tub however I did not have any time to enjoy that pleasure. Some of the other rooms also have mini-bar fridges and a couch ( I had friends staying there as well in another room on the floor above me ) I had a room that faced the Blue mosque but because of a new building being built just behind the hotel I did not get a view of the Blue Moque except for one of the minarets..but that was not a concern for me because there are plenty of places in Sultanahmet to get fantastic views from above..plenty of restaurants and bars/pubs where you can access their terraces for a drink or two to enjoy the splended views. Breakfast was nice and in typical turkish style of of tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, cheeses, bread, fruit, etc.... Along with filter coffe available. Nice touch. While I was there there were a variety of guests staying at the hotel and I loved my chats with the lovely Singapore family with the 2 boys.

But I loved this hotel... mostly because the service was great here. As soon as we arrived, we were given a run down of the city, where everything is and how we could get to places, where to eat, where to avoid getting gypped. The front desk just acted like we were friends, and gave us the load down. The hotel is old, but kept very clean -- or as clean as you can for an old building. We stayed in room 5 for 3 nights, and was asked if we would mind switch to room 1 for one night. And we did, since the reception guys are so nice and friendly. Although, I did enjoy the bathroom in room 5 much more. Room 5 is on the third floor and had a balcony, but we never went outside. The view of the Blue mosque is blocked by a building and a construction site. Since both my friend and I are girls, and we've been ogled at all day by men, we were afraid to go outside in our pjs. The bathroom is very nice and has a hammas, but we didn't use it. But the shower was great after we figured out how to use it. Room 1 has a view of the street and is on the second floor. The street is very quaint, so I think I enjoyed the view in room 1 better. However, the bathroom just had a tub and not very well constructed one at that. It has a shower head, but no curtains. So when you take a shower, water get spilled everywhere. Kinda annoying. All the bedding is very comfortable, clean, and white. The queen size bed could be split into two smaller beds for non couples. Room 1 even has a sofa bed and living room (but very small one at that). Breakfast is excellent, I always had 2 helpings of yogurt. Internet is very slow, but it works for email and such. Basically, we enjoyed our stay there.

I felt that the hotel, while adequate, was not as good value or as pleasant as I had hoped. I was due to be met at the airport, and had e-mailed the previous day to confirm my flight details and that I was arriving on a domestic, not international flight. There was no sign of anyone when I arrived at the airport and it took 2 hours and several calls to the hotel, with the help of the airport information service, to sort it out. On arriving at the hotel there was no apology or explanation, and the man at the desk spent the first 10 minutes trying to tell me which turkish bath to visit, before even letting me into the room! I was in room 5, which has a view of the Blue Mosque - it is a reasonable room - however, it is a little odd for a hotel room.- there was no nightstand or bedside chair (a very great disadvantage if, like me, you wear spectacles and need somewhere to put them at night!) There were lights above the bed separate from the main room light, but no way of turning them on or off. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and the room warm (important, when visiting in december). The room did seem in need of redecorating - there were water stains on the ceiling. The bathroom appeared to have been recently redecorated - there was a fancy shower, plus the 'turkish bath' (marble seat plus tao & brass bowls) however, the shower had been rather inexpertly plumbed in, and there was visible wiring above the sink. I found the service very hit and miss, too. One day my room wasn't claned or made up at all, and on another I found the master set of keys which had been left in my bathroom, and apparently not missed, which did cause me to have doubts about the security of the hotel. Over all, I would say the hotel was adequate. It is well placed, within easy walking distance of the Blue Mosque & Hagia Sophia, but not particularly good value for money. It's fair to say that I was staying out of season, and Hakan, who I understand is the owner, was not there for much of the time, as he was apparently supervising building or renovation work elsewhere.

With a guest to staff ratio of 2:1, we always received plenty of attention and assistance with whatever it was we wanted to do. This hospitable staff knows what we need before we know we need it. This is a small boutique hotel, and it cannot be compared to a five star chain hotel. It is a plain and simple property. Nonetheless it boasts several unique and charming elements. We love the huge marble bathrooms, the little handmade soaps and the extra towels. Our room was immaculate. Small Turkish hotels do not have much storage room for clothing one would normally put in drawers, but there was a huge wardrobe that had room for everything we packed. Unlike the tiny rooms that are common to the boutiques of Sultanahmet we enjoyed a huge suite with a giant bedroom, huge bathroom and cozy sitting room. It was sufficiently large enough that we lived there for six weeks without annoying one another. English channels on the TV were appreciated, but the high-speed wireless internet connection provided us with even more evening entertainment. For guests who do not arrive with their own laptops, the Apricot provides a computer for guest use. Many rooms have stunning views of the Blue Mosque, and the location of the hotel is perfect. It is a block away from the bustling tourist area, but set on a quiet street with almost no street noises. The double-glazed windows block out the morning call to prayer so we have to crack open our window so we do not miss it. Free transportation from the airport to the hotel was in the form of a luxury van. The driver gave us cherry juice and cakes and endured our tortured Turkish on the drive from the airport. Breakfast is ample, and served well into the morning hours. Typical Turkish breakfast foods of tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, cheeses, bread, lovely, thick Turkish yogurt and sour cherry jam were augmented by a selection of fresh fruits, cereals, eggs, meats and drip-brewed coffee (which is almost impossible to find in Sultanahmet hotels). The hotel is lovely, but we stay here because of the staff. They are on duty 24/7 and ready to meet your every need. If it rains they provide umbrellas and carry them over your head until you tell them to return to the hotel. If you are hungry but too weary to eat out they will arrange delivery from good restaurants, and provide a table with china, silverware and crystal as well as attentive service. If you want to eat authentic Turkish food, they will guide you by the hand to tiny little corners in Sultanahmet where you can eat fish only hours away from the sea, or authentic Turkish meals prepared with some grandmother's favorite recipes. I cannot even begin to recount the unique services we received or that I saw other guests receive. You can expect that the owner Hakan, will do whatever is necessary to assist you with your experience whether that is making plane reservations to Cappadocia, driving you in his own car to the doctor or pharmacy, getting up in the middle of the night to make sure your internet connection is working, celebrating Valentines Day with a bouquet of flowers or driving you to some place you wish to shop or eat. Hakan is the most service--oriented person we have ever met. We had a customs problem. Omer drove us to the customs office and spent seven hours with us getting things worked out. Then he drove us back to the hotel. We used eight hours of his time and the hotel car and no one would accept any financial compensation. The day we left, Hakan arranged for a taxi to the airport. Then he and Omer followed us in his car. Hakan got out at the airport with us and stayed with us until our massive amounts of luggage had been checked by the airline. We did not touch a suitcase from the minute we entered Istanbul until after we left. In 2007 we first came to the Apricot as guests. Since then we have returned as family.

When we arrived in Istanbul, naturally tired from the long trip, we were asked to wait in the lobby without any explanation. After about an hour the owner appeared and said that the bathroom was being \"re-marbled\" and we could either wait until it was done (at 22:00) or go next door. We went next door to a basic room without the view or balcony we had reserved. The next morning we went back to the Apricot and still couldn't check into the room. After a day of sight seeing we finally were allowed into the room where we found that there was nowhere to put our clothes--no closets or drawers, and no hangers for the closet. There was a large water stain on the ceiling, rips in the wallpaper, and a very strong smell of cigars which never dissipated. There was even a dirty ashtray in the room! The bathroom did have beautiful new marble, however the shower did not have a shower curtain or shower door. Since this was our first hotel in Turkey, we thought it was like bathrooms in China and other places we have stayed that just don't have shower curtains. We learned the next day, however, that the door just hadn't been installed and they wanted us to use the \"turkish bath\" (a basis and 2 water taps) instead of the shower. Something that wasn't the hotel's fault, but still detracted from the experience, was the excavation going on across the street which was noisy and was part of the \"view\" of the blue mosque. The location was good, however, and the person at the desk was very friendly and between my approximately 50 words of Turkish and his similar amount of English we were able to communicate enough to do things like pay the bill and find out where the internet connection was located. Although other reviews mentioned that the owner was very friendly and helpful, we really couldn't speak as to that one way or the other as he was not around except when telling us that our room was unavailable--which he did without any apology or real explanation. (We ran into other travellers later on during our trip who had a similar experience with Hotel Apricot. Another hotel owner told us that the Apricot is known to intentionally overbook rooms in case some of the people with reservations don't show up.) When we came back to Istanbul for another 3 nights, we arrived at the hotel to find that there was no toilet paper. My husband went down from the 3rd to the 1st floor and asked for some and was told they were out. Luckily we had some tissues with us. The shower still didn't have a curtain or door and the shower head was leaky, spraying even more water all over the bathroom. The promised wake up call for our early departure for the airport never materialized but by this point we weren't relying too heavily on the Apricot and had set both cell phones on alarm to wake us up. I was really surprised, based on the strong reviews this hotel got from others, that it was so mediocre--not terrible, just nothing special.

Police/military personnel guarded the entire route from the air port - it made us feel special! When we arrived, cold, wet and tired, Hakan and his staff quickly helped us to our room and then helped us order take out from the Doy Doy restaurant near by - then arranged for it to be delivered! It was very much above the normal service one would expect. I just can't say enough wonderful things about the staff. Every day they assisted us in planning our activities (including how to avoide the area's President Obama was visiting our first day). They did our laundry - and every day our room was spotlessly cleaned. Each time we would pass the reception desk I would attempt \"Thank you\" in Turkish. Everytime they would laugh with me and give me the correct pronunciation. I never did learn to say it right. Forutnately the majority of people we met in Turkey clearly understood the English words. The room was sufficient in size for our group of 3 (my husband and 12 year old daughter and I). Other than the before mentioned problem of a lack of a shower door, the bathroom was very nice.

I stayed here for a long weekend over New Years in room number 5. Room itself could use a little update, the paint is chipping, there was some water damage on the ceiling, and the water in the shower had trouble maintaining its temperature. However, the bathroom was large, the room was clean, all the decorations were very nice, and of course the view. We had a small balcony that looked right out to the Blue Mosque. Words can't do justice. The mosque is beautiful and its presence is as much a part of the room as the bed or the carpets. The call to prayer is so loud it might as well be coming from a man on the balcony yelling into a bullhorn. While some might be put off by the thunderous chanting at 6am to me it was an unforgettable cultural experience. If you go to Istanbul to experience the real city, this is probably the hotel for you. Both the owner and the other people working at the hotel are very nice. They could not have been more helpful or friendlier. They went out of their way several times to help us out. The hotel itself is very pleasant as well, on charming street in a great neighborhood, well within walking distance of important and historic sites.

So why then is this hotel mentioned in all the top guide books. My guess is the reason is Hakan, the owner. He has charm to spare and probably has courted every guide book author into including his establishment in their listings. What's interesting, though, is that none of those books specifically mentions the major selling point of the Apricot, something I learned about from previous reviews in tripadvisor. Two of his rooms, No. 2 and No. 5, have unobstructed views of the Blue Mosque. Other hotels may boast of their Blue Mosque view, but inevitably it is from an outdoor roof-top restaurant or breakfast room. That means you have to be fully dressed and prepared to brave inclement weather. If you are in No. 5, which is on the top floor (warning, no elevator), you can see the Blue Mosque from your bed or step out onto the balcony in a robe. This alone is worth the room price. Speaking of which, the Apricot is a budget hotel and on or off-season you will not be paying much for that view. Understand, though, that this IS a budget hotel. So the entry to the Apricot in wet weather includes negotiating astroturf and towels laid down over the mud, the check-in desk is miniscule, the breakfast area humble, and the gratus spread, well, if you like baloney, the lone meat, you're in luck. Still, that's no big deal. Hakan is a pleasant, informative host, and, if you're lucky to snag No. 5, a great trip to Istanbul is almost guaranteed.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Motza Ilit", "Title": "\u201cCharming and conveniently-located hotel\u201d", "Author": "Larry100", "ReviewID": "UR20757130", "Content": "Everything positive written in Tripadvisor is correct.

We chose this hotel based on TI reviews, location, and price and we were not disappointed. After some hesitation (difficulty in getting a reply to email confirmation) regarding our initial reservation, we could not have been happier. Hakan and his assistant were very helpful and proved all their supporters to be true. We found the Apricot charming. Absolutely the best thing about our room was the view of the Blue Mosque, so beautiful while lit at night. Usually I do not have difficulty falling asleep, but did not want to close my eyes to that impressive sight! We could lay in bed and it was the last thing we saw before going to sleep and the first thing we saw in the morning. Also stunning at dawn, and then..... that wondrous call to prayer. Everything after that was just the icing. Yes, the breakfast was basic, but delicious and fresh. The dining area is small, but with a lovely window overlooking the street. All sights are close, easily within walking distance. My daughter and I never felt unsafe or threatened while out walking together. Rooms were clean and bathroom large and functional. Although the room was described as small when a triple, we found it fine for us and very nice to have the balcony. Once arrived in Istanbul, we often experienced that famous Turkish hospitality and in the near future I will submit more on that in the TI Forum. As guests of Mr. Basaran Ulusoy's \"TURSAB\" travel agency, we were fortunate to have had many meals and services provided to us, therefore did not need to take advantage of Hakan's wealth of knowledge. He did however, suggest a restaurant with a rooftop terrace (Doy-Doy) on our free day which we enjoyed very much and was reasonably priced. He also provided efficient transportation to the airport upon our departure. We were especially taken with Hakan's young son and enjoyed hearing him recite the English he had learned in school. What a charmer. The great photos shown on the previous review for the Apricot and room #5 are a true representation so I see no need to duplicate those. They capture the comfortable feeling of this hotel, although nothing can truly express the beauty and warm hospitality of Istanbul. We have stayed in many different types of places in several countries, and I have to say that my favorite \"view from a room\" is definately the Blue Mosque, room #5 , The Apricot Hotel.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cApricot was excellent\u201d", "Author": "zizumum", "ReviewID": "UR18634957", "Content": "I did a lot of research on sultanahmet hotels before choosing the hotel for my istanbul trip. Since I was accompanied by my toddler son, few things were on priority. 1. I should be close to the main tourist spots 2. I should be close to the tramline 3. I should be close to the train station 4. The location where i stay, should not be on a crowded street so as to avoid any disturbances at night 5. The hotel manager/staff should be able to guide us and give us recommendations etc. Whew, long wish list, but I tell you, i got all this and more at the Apricot. The hotel fulfilled all my requirements. The main attractions were a 5 mins walk, the tramline less then 10. The room was quite spacious neat and clean. The bathroom was so big with a turkish bath. The shower had good pressure. The room lights even had a dimmer. I chose room no5, which had a fabulous view of the blue mosque. It was so beautiful at night. The room also had a balcony with 2 chairs and a table. The rooms were sound proofed, and even that wasnt necessary, since it was so nice and quite outside, necessary for my son who sleeps at 8. Lots of nice restaurants in the nearyby Akbiyik street. But the best thing Apricot has is its manager Hakan, he is such a helpful guy. He took time out everyday to plan out our day, and used to guide us as to how to reach our destination and back. He even gave us good tips on where to shop, and bargaining tactics etc. He also took us one day to a baklave shop, (Karakoy gullugolu) which is an excellent pastry shop (highly recommended) Once we were getting late for the whirling dervishes ceremony at Sirkeci train station, he got us dropped off in his own car. Since we stayed there for 7 nights we got free pick and drop from the airport. Hakan speaks very good english and he alongwith his hardworking colleague Omar makes sure that we are right at home. Breakfast was served in the reception area, although they are working on making a small garden at the back of the hotel.The breakfast was served at 8:00am, but it was very basic, cheese, olives, tomatoes, cucumber, butter and bread. Cereal too. Oh one thing i forgot to mention, you get 2 english channels on tv, CNN and BBC Prime. All in all, Aprioct was a great experience, thank you to all the forumites who gave me good advice on selecting Apricot. We are definitely going to go back there next time we visit Istanbul. Things that i love about Aprioct: The view from the balcony. Specially at night. Hakan, the helpful manager and Omar his assistant. Things that i didnt like: Well, not many just one.
