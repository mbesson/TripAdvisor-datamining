{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Convenient Location We stayed here on a business trip with a conference on site for 4 nights. The executive room we stayed was about $85 a day plus tax was just fine. It's a typical Chinese hotel. Although they say the rooms are smoke free, but you can still smell it. The breakfast was included in our room. The selection was quite nice compared to most US hotels. It comes with juices, milk, cereals, buns, bread, eggs, bacon, sausages, fresh fruits and a wide selection of Chinese food. You need to avoid breakfast rush hour at around 7-7:30am as there were bus load of tourists. It's Chinese restaurant is quite good and we had lunches there couple of times. The location is quite convenient. Right across the street there is Red Theater where bus loads of foreign tourists come to see Kung Fu shows each night. I'm sure they sell tickets at door too. Within 5 min. walk, there is a Peking Duck restaurant at great price. Of course, Tian Tan park is nearby. The service is good and hotel staff is very friendly. Many sports stadiums and Chinese sport government agencies are also located nearby. It could be a good choice to stay during the summer Olympics. Try to avoid rooms facing the main street.", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR942520426", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jennifermadison"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d671783-r15508627-Tiantan_Sports_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "671783", "Price": "$41"}}
