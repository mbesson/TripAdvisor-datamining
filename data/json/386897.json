Centrovital met these criteria 110%. The fitness center is a membership gym but connected to the hotel and guests can use it free of charge. Of the 100s of hotels I have stayed in, this gym ranks at the very top. Top of the line equipment, 20 meter pool, trainers to assist...just fantastic. The hotel is new, the rooms small but clean and functional (would suggest an upgrade to the TVs, time to go flat screen).

I found the hotel to be quite nice - the rooms were comfortable...not the luxury you often find in an American hotel of this class, but very up to the more austere European standards. My mom and I shared a \"double\" room - which turned out to be identical in every way to my cousin's single room. As is typical in Europe, the bed is just two smaller beds pushed together. So we just pushed the two beds apart. We found all the staff to be friendly and helpful - including front desk, workout area and spa. I really loved the \"wellness\" area of the hotel. There is a great pool - kept at a nice temperature. And the sauna is awesome. Of course, it's co-ed and nude...so I expect many Americans will be uncomfortable with that. But just relax and enjoy the experience. I was in the sauna during the morning when one of the staff members came in with some water with menthol. He went through a whole routine of adding the menthol steam and then spreading it through the sauna room by spinning a towel above his head. It was amazing. There is also a full size gym area - with plenty of cardio and weight lifting equipment. We also all had a spa service. My mom and cousin and loved their massage. I thought mine was pleasant, although I had hoped for something a little more deep tissue. Probably my fault for requesting the wrong service. One thing I'll warn you about. If your primarily goal is to spend time in Berlin, this isn't the hotel for you. While there is easy access to a S-Bahn (train) into Berlin...it's a quick bus ride or pleasant walk to the station...it's still a bit of a trip to get all the way in since the hotel is at the end of the line. But, if you want a place to relax AND have some fun in the city. Then this is great. Also, amazing breakfast buffet. Full spectrum of hot and cold food - including omelet made to order. Just so you are aware - the price for the buffet was included the quoted cost of our hotel room, although the cost was separated in the final bill since there is a different level of tax for rooms and food. Turns out, the difference in price between our double room and my cousin's single room was exactly the cost of the second breakfast buffet.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aalborg, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel...

We had booked a room at Centrovital on April 20 for the night of Sat 18.7. to 19.7. Our friends later decided to join and booked 3 nights there as well during that time. When we arrived at Centrovital on the 18th around 13h, well before check-in time we were told there was no room for us, since the hotel was full. This was the day of the U2 concert and of course everything else affordable in Berlin was booked as well! The hotel offered us a room in a hotel which was another 15 mintue drive AWAY from the city. Since the hotel is located near the final stop of the subway, this was not an option - plus, we had friends booked at this hotel who did not really want to repack for one night. When we said we would change, but into a hotel closer to town, the hotel said this was impossible. Also they claimed it had been impossible to contact us! We might not have given a phone number in our online booking through www.booking.com but through our booking code it shoudl have been possible to write an email MUCH earlier. When we found a (more expensive) place in town and asked to hotel to change us to that... ALL OF A SUDDEN they did find a room!. This hassle cost us almost an hour and a lot of nerves. We have the feeling that since we booked so early at a cheap rate, that our room was rather given to someone who paid later and full price when Berlin hotels filled up for the concert. This is not right. The hotel gave us some vouchers for their restaurant, but since we were there only one night we of course could not use them. Some more notes to the stay: The hotel does NOT have aircondition! The rooms were awfully hot and with window out to the street cafe, sleeping with open windows was not an option either. Also, the airtraffic is too loud. In the morning, the breakfast room was closed early due to some happening - and guests were told to use the hotels cafe facilities which a were very small. First, there was hardly enough space. Then their coffee machine was broken, and things available upstairs not available here. The staff was clearly not able to handly all the incoming complaints from various tables. All in all this was quite a disappointing experience and I could not recommend this hotel to anyone. We think it was a lame excuse that they could not reach us. Overbooking on a day of a concert of a famous band also does not seem acceptable to me.", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southport", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel Excellent staff totally fulfilled all expectations of a great city break\u201d", "Author": "Searsjohn", "ReviewID": "UR33996127", "Content": "Loved the hotel.Staff were smart,super efficient,curteous,friendly,very helpful and all spoke fluent english.The hotel was spotlessly clean(the pool/spa area you were made to wear a gown and plastic flip-flops which they provided for a small fee).The rooms were a tad small and somewhat clinical but nevertheless clean and extremely functional.Very in keeping with modern day germany i guess.

In the evenings we found a fabulous chinese right opposite the hotel or strolled into spandau centre where we found a couple of good places to eat.Pubs there very lively with quite an atmosphere. the town of spandau took approx 10-15mins and the s-bahn about 20.almost all the top sightseeing places of interest were within easy reach of an s-bahn stop.A great way of exploring Berlin is by bike.When we next visit we certainly will.

Traveller's tip on saving a few bucks The hotel provides a free pass for local transport and you can use it to catch the bus from within 100 yards of the hotel to the railway station (4 stops) where you can catch a train into Berlin (about 15 minutes to the main shopping centre).
