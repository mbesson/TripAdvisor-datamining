Next to The Buona Vista MRT and closeness to the shopping and eating at Rochester Park and Holland Village makes this truly a place worth the commute into CBD if one has to. Those headed to the parks in Jurong would find it convenient too.The rooms are well appointed with tasteful modern furniture / furnishings and I was upgraded into a Single bedroom suite which has practically all the household and entertainment gadgets one desires, free wifi and a coffee shop with lots more coming. Its feel is new and fresh and the views are beautiful treetops and the lovely university opposite. Maybe the only feature that put me off was the heavy (read Fire) door between the living and bed rooms and the narrow passage to the washroom once it was open. For a long staying guest this could get irritating moving within the rooms, besides giving them a workout!!. Suggest you check the deals and promotions on the internet as prices can vary widely for walk-ins. The staff werent able to explain the booking vs rack rate too well and i didnt pursue it thanks to the upgrade (which i think is de rigure at the top end). I will stay again because it has a very nice feel to it....and ofcourse use other facilites like the pool and the gym which is pretty neat.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHome away from home\u201d", "Author": "Zypocket", "ReviewID": "UR126024166", "Content": "A very new high end hotel.

During my first week, I was very pleased. The room are well designed (if compact), the beds are very comfortable, wireless access is reliable, and for me, the location near the science park is extremely convenient. Buses and MRT are close by (w/in 5 minutes) and there are several good restaurants around the back side of the hotel. If you are a runner, the Botantical Garden is about a 10K round trip with two turns to get there. The fitness room has good equipment, including 4 treadmills (though no towels are provided...yet). The staff have been friendly and helpful.

Staff appeared flustered and chaotic. Being a new hotel is not a good enough reason for the chaotic experience. Processes, roles and responsibilities should have been ironed out before they opened their doors to the guests. The room does compensate my check-in experience. I booked the superior room and I would say it's just meant for 2. Even though I had requested for twin beds (we were there with our 8-yr-old girl), it was configured to double as there wasnt enough space to separate the beds. The toilet has a fairly decent size. It was able to accomodate a bathtub. The room boasts a unique touchscreen deskphone but I'm sure it wouldn't wow a guest that much as we wouldnt need to use it that frequently. As the hotel is actually in the heart of office towers, it will be advisable to come back to the hotel with a full tummy and pack drinks and munchies along too. Overall, we enjoyed the peace and quiet of the surroundings and the comforts of the room. Will be back there if we would want a peaceful weekend getaway again.

Called the main line a week before 31 Dec to enquire about the room but was told it was fully booked and to call reservations directly instead. Next day I tried calling the reservations dept but no one answered. Tried my luck at the font desk and was told there was one room available but was a twin room. I didn't book it cos I wanted a king room. Tried calling reservations again and finally someone answered. I was told there were a few king rooms available. Not sure why different info was given. I wanted to confirm that there was DVD player in the room (as stated in the website and also confirmed by the front desk) but was told only the suites had DVD players. By then I was quite frustrated by the different info given by different staff. Decided to go ahead and book it since most of the hotels in Singapore were already fully booked. Following day, reservations called to say that they will upgrade me to a one bedroom suite since I requested for a room with DVD and since it was the joyous season. That managed to appease me for the lack of service previously. Day of check in: Was quite crowded with people waiting at the lobby. The service staff seem quite flustered unlike the usual in other hotels. Was given a room quite promptly though. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to even get past the lift as the card didn't work on the lift. A hotel staff saw that my card didn't work and offered to use his 'management card' to allow me access to the level and go to the room first and change the card later. He even followed us to the room just in case the card didn't work on the room door. Since the card didn't work on the lift access, it definitely didn't work on the room door as well. The kind hotel staff then used his card to help us open the room door and what a surprise we got! There was someone in the room already and imagine their shocked faces seeing strangers breaking into their room. Luckily they weren't doing anything private. By then I was starting to get irritated. We had to go down and inform them of the situation and I reminded them that I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite and that the room I was given was not one. They seem surprised which I don't understand why since the hotel voucher I was given already clearly states that it was supposed to be a one bedroom suite. I had to explain to them that reservations already promised me blah blah voucher already states blah blah and that I was given a room that was already occupied Was told to wait while they settle all the hooha before finally I was given an EMPTY room. The only saving grace would be that the room was nice and spacious since its a one bedroom suite and that made me forget about all the unpleasantness, at least for that day. Wanted to have a late check out and asked for the price and availability. The front desk has to call me back twice cos they didn't know how much or anything about the late check out procedures. Perhaps the hotel is still new and procedures are not firmly in place, staff not properly trained yet. The staff are nice though, just that there are many things they don't know.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel but doesn't have any restaurant\u201d", "Author": "Onnie_ks", "ReviewID": "UR122349831", "Content": "Was staying in deluxe room for a couple of nights.
