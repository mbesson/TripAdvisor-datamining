The hotel staff reserved a taxi for us from Fiumicino airport to the hotel (50 euros). After landing we were at the hotel in one hour in the very heart of Rome. The hotel is an old palace. First we stayed at the first floor - and the room was cosy and beautifully furnished and decorated. It resembled the hotel in Stresa owned by the Borromeo family where we stayed last autumn. During our second visit we stayed at the second floor facing Via Cavour. Still the room was very quiet though there is some traffic. The whole staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good and versatile and well maintained and serviced by a kind lady. The hotel location could not be better if you value the closeness of main attractions of Rome (Colosseum, Forum Romanum, Forum Augustus, Piazza Veneto...). S.Pietro in Vincoli (Michelangelo`s Moses, chains of Saint Pietro) and Santa Maria Maggiore churches are reachable with five minutes walk. The main railway station Stazione Termini is reachable in ten minutes walk as also is the Teatro dell Opera. There is regular train connection from Termini to the airport every 30 minutes, costs 14 euros. Metro station Cavour is within 2 minutes walk. One trip (90 minutes) costs 1 euro. Forum Romanun is within 10 minutes walk. Close to Borromeo Hotel there are very many and excellent trattorias and restaurants offering good Italian food with fixed price menus (10-15 euros). We made a sidetrip to Nice and had our main luggage stored at the hotel. We were extremely satisfied with choosing Borromeo Hotel for our stay and I am certain thet we will use this hotel again during future visits to Rome!

We were initially very happy about this however the quality of the suite (room 97) was far far below a 3 star standard. It was not in the main part of the hotel but up a back staircase next to a staff room or office.The rooms were dirty and smelly, cold, there was a leaking tap, black marks in the bath, a hole in the bedroom door, no plug in the bath and a large number of ants crawling around (we even found one on our young baby the next morning). We were so disappointed with the standard of the room that we considered leaving Rome the following day (we had already paid for the room for 4 nights). We complained about the room to the hotel handyman who was extremely helpful and understanding. It turned out that we had not been upgraded but had been put in the room temporarily as all furnished rooms were occupied and we were due to be moved to a furnished room the following day. This had not been mentioned at check in and I am therefore doubtful as to whether we would have been moved if we had not complained. The following day we were moved to a furbished room which was an excellent standard for a 3 star hotel. It was very clean with nice and new furnishings. The breakfast is basic but with lots of choice everyday. We were also provided with a cot for the baby at no additional cost (initially we were told it would cost 15 EUR a day but after the suite incident the charge was waived). Unfortunately the cot did not have a mattress and instead had a wooden base covered in a few sheets so we had the baby in the spare bed instead. Overall we had a good stay in this hotel. The location is excellent, a short walk from both the main station (no need to get the metro) and the Colosseum.

When I asked him to book it for me, he actually advised me to make it myself, as the cost was cheaper on the hotel's own website (Since we were staying 5 nights, we got a 20% discount). OK, as for the hotel. Great location for the traveler who likes to use public transportation. We arrived at FCO at 9:00am, took the Leonardo Express to the Termini and it was not even 10:00 when we arrived at the hotel. While it was to early to check-in, they gladly secured our luggage and allowed us into our room at 12:30 (well before the 2:00 check in) (at at no additional cost). The hotel is about 1/2 way between the Termini Metro Station and the 1st stop on the B line (Cavour). There are a wide selection of restaurants, shops, etc all around, and a little market (KS Market) ascross the street that we wisited daily for wateer and juice when we would come back to the hotel The room: Was just about perfect for us. 1 double bed, a desk with TV and a wardrobe. More than enough room for our clothes and luggage. The bed was firm yet soft, and the housekeeping gladdly gave us extra pillows (Since the ones provided were rather flat). The room was warm and dry (nice since was raining outdoors), and the tempature was easy to control. As for the bathroom. Quaint would be a good descriptin. Average in size for a Old Rome hotel, but was pleasantly surprised by the size of the shower. It had all the necessaties and while the cold water was a bit hard to regulate, the HOT was envigorating. Only 2 items to note: In our room the TV had no sound (not that we watched a lot, but there were a few hours to kill with the rain and all), and the bed was the only place to sit, as there were no chairs in the room. Ammenties: The Internet (wifi is available and has a strong signal, but not included in the price (The Desk clerk said 1E per hour, was actually 2E), and you pay for it in blocks of 1 hour at a time. The breakfast in the morning was acceptable. It is not the best or the worst by any means. Decent selection, from traditional Italian favorites, to eggs and (greasy) bacon (I would have preferred that the eggs not had the bacon intermixed with the Bacon since my travel companion does not eat pork, he was not able to enjoy them), and a reasonable selection of pastries, fruit, cereal and beverages. Better yet, it was included in the rate of the room. Price, this trip for me was last min and had to be planned on a budget. I was so happy to have received all of this for just around $300 (6 days 5 night / Sun - Fri). This was my 5th visit to rome and this is the first time I have ventured out to a different hotel.

The best thing about this hotel is that it has a great central location for people who like to walk, like my husband and me. It is located on Via Cavour, just a few blocks from Rome\u2019s Termini. The area around the hotel was fine, in spite of its close proximity to Termini. Upon our arrival, we had a pleasant walk from Termini, dragging our small carry-on suitcases. In fact, after checking out, we didn\u2019t not take a ridiculously expensive taxi back to Termini. Instead, we walked downhill one block to the very conveniently located Metro Station and rode it back to Termini for 1 Euro each! Our room was small by US standards but it was an OK size room by Rome standards. It was very clean and we had a very comfortable bed. Our room also had a window looking onto a courtyard. It was nice to have fresh air in our room. Our bathroom was always very clean too. The breakfast room is enclosed, on the roof. (There is also a second patio a few feet away which is open air.) The breakfast food was standard fare and very nicely presented. The lady in charge was very pleasant too. We discovered a small street behind the hotel when we exited the Metro Station one afternoon. This discovery proved to be quite helpful. This is evidently a \u201clocal\u2019s\u201d trove of little stores, as well as an Internet Caf\u00e9, a fantastic bakery, and a pizza shop! In fact, one afternoon, we bought a pizza and took it up to Borromeo\u2019s roof top patio and enjoyed our pizza in the afternoon sun of a wonderful Rome afternoon! Being 3 weeks into our month long trip to Italy, we desperately need a laundry! Lucky for us, Borromeo\u2019s Front Desk staff directed us to a laundry almost directly across Via Cavour from the Borromeo. The lady there said she\u2019s have our laundry done and folded in a few hours and for a very reasonable price! We were delighted! Only problem we had at Hotel Borromeo was using the Internet which we really needed after being out of connectivity for 10 days on a Mediterranean cruise. We absolutely failed to get Internet service in the hotel! We asked the Front Desk for assistance, but they were not helpful at all, which was really disappointing. They refused to let us hard-wire to the Internet as a previous hotel had allowed. They directed us to the Internet Caf\u00e9 on the small street behind the hotel. To make a long story short (and it is a long story!) , the explanation we were given at the Internet Caf\u00e9 was that you cannot use Outlook Express in Italy. We\u2019re still not sure this is true! Getting on the Internet was very important for us and we really appreciated Igor\u2019s assistance. He is a staff member -- in some capacity -- of the Hotel Borromeo. He was very willing to help, but with the dismal results. On the other hand, the Front Desk staff acted like they didn\u2019t really care and did not try to be helpful at all. The non-refundable rate we paid for the Hotel Borromeo was reasonable for Rome, and we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who\u2019s more interested in what\u2019s going on in Rome \u2013 than the inside of the hotel room!", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chula Vista, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat service and comfort!\u201d", "Author": "Nicholle M", "ReviewID": "UR121805907", "Content": "This hotel is convienently located close to the Colesseum, Metro Station and Termini Train station.

If you're not a walker, it's pretty close to the metro station as well. My one complaint about this hotel is the breakfast area, which is on the top floor. Don't eat the yogurt!! I'm not sure Italians have the same standards as North Americans for keeping cold foods cold and hot foods hot. My yogurt had mold in it... and the room itself was very, very warm.

The room had the standard amenities, towel service, TV, wake up call, etc. All in all a decent value for the money. The good: - A short walk from the Roma Termini station (500 Meters), and an even shorter walk to the Cavour station. - Nice trim in rooms; somewhat luxurious feel (wood trim, high ceilings, marble flooring, etc.) - Breakfast included; much better than your standard continental breakfast, as there was scrambled eggs, ham, numerous pastries and cereals available. - LCD TV in room with a lot of stations, some of which you can change the language to English. (I doubt you\u2019ll spend much time watching TV though, you are in Rome after all.) - English speaking staff. - Safe in room. The Bad: - Rooms are quite small; very limited space in main area. - No bathtub, only a medium sized shower, which unfortunately did not drain very well. - No alarm clock in room. The so-so: - The hotel sits above the subway line, so you do hear and feel the rumble of the subway, however it is not so bad.

We came in before the room was ready, so we went sightseeing and came back near 9pm completely spent. When we went into our room we found out that instead of a quad room it was a double room where they managed to cram 2 more beds. Under cram I mean there was barely space to get into a cabinet and about that much to get into the bathroom. One of the roll aways was next to a double bed, and the other was at the foot of the other beds. You had to actually crawl over one bed to get to another. So much for European fire safety code. Do not get me wrong, I've been to enough hotels in Europe to not expect much in terms of space. This was not a quad room by any mean. We tried to catch a manager the next day but could not. I complained to the duty guy. The next day (for the 3rd night) we came back to find out that all of our stuff was moved into a larger room they called suite. I found the manager the next day and he said the first room was that we booked, and then they \"upgraded\" us for free. Still trying to resolve with Expedia, since the whole thing was prepaid.

Old toothpaste on the plastic of the cup wrappers and a spot of blood on an unused sanitary towel bag... We were moved for our second night to a far superior room in the hotel proper.

The rooms were hot, and stuffy. Some of us were one floor up from the busy street, and when we opened the window for air, we got fumes and noise.

I got even more depressed when I entered the bath area. The marble tops had white streak marks. I was most disgusted. The bath is very narrow and I don't know how a big sized person can manage here. They only leave two bath towels every day, and I was so irritated because all the fluff from the towel remains on you after using it. Our toilet would not flush and when I told the desk clerk he sent up the same guy who helped us with our bags, who tried to do something, but could not fix the toilet. We spent the rest of our stay with a faulty toilet. The plastic cups for water were stained. I felt like running out of this room after enduring all these nasty experiences. Unfortunately my husband had paid up front through hotels.com so we could not leave this hotel. The breakfast utensils had disgusting stains on them. The only thing bearable about this hotel was the coffee. The location is convenient but the hotel is very noisy.

My husband and I had a double room on the second floor (room 215) at the back of the hotel and my M-I-L had a single room (204) on the second floor down the corridor from us but at the front of the hotel. After 2 nights, we asked for her to be moved to the back of the hotel because of the traffic noise in the mornings. She had much better nights sleep once she was moved. More on this later.... The Hotel Borromeo is situated on a long road; the road also has occasional pubs and restaurants. The Hotel is within easy reach on the bus terminal (a 10 minute walk through the main busy streets). Hotel looks a bit rough from the outside because of the graffiti, but Rome is covered in it everywhere. On entering, there is a (very) small reception area with the reception desk and a small a 'bar' area to the side of it (bar = a small counter with a small selection of spirits on a shelf). There is a small 2-seater sofa in the reception/bar area next to the main doors. Ground floor lift takes you to the bedrooms and the top floor 'restaurant' (restaurant = a small covered roof terrace) The restaurant has about 10 breakfast tables, that can seat up to 4 people at a squeeze and an island which has bread, cakes, yoghurt, cereals, boiled eggs, butter, jams, milk, orange juice, tea and coffee. Breakfast is self-service. The bedrooms are very small. A double bed (comfortable and clean but only one pillow each so if you want more you will need to ask, we did and they delivered promptly), sheets changed daily, a bedside table each side with a small drawer and lamp, a dressing table with drawers and a built in wardrobe with some shelving and small hanging space. You have about a foot either side of and at the base of the bed for additional room, so its basically in the door and only one person can stand in the floor space on either side of the bed (unless you want to get friendly!! - when in Rome x). The television has a remote control, only has one channel in English, which is CNN. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which proved to be a real negative, especially with M-I-L. Having said that, the receptionist will make you a hot drink in the 'bar' if you want one (charged to your room). There is no room service so we had to go and collect it via the lift ourselves. Safety deposit box functional and situated in the wardrobe. Bathroom has a loo, B-day and sink area and the tiniest bath I have ever seen! The white plastic shower curtain gets VERY friendly when having a shower, which is basically a showerhead in the bath - but its very hot and powerful. Large bath towels provided (changed every day) and hand towels (which are actually cotton table cloths). We has 3 sachets of shampoo, but none of the usual bath/shower gels etc provided, so if you book here, take all your own toiletries. The hair dryer is a standard on the wall hairdryer. Bedroom very warm with easy to use temperature controls. Also has air con. We were at the back of the hotel so no noise from the front street. If you book this hotel and are a light sleeper, tell them you don\u2019t want a room facing the main road, it gets very noisy in the mornings with traffic (mainly motorbikes/mopeds). Fixtures and fittings could have done with a bit of TLC throughout the hotel and it could do with a bit of sprucing up in general. We literally used the hotel to shower, change and sleep. If you are looking for luxury (even just a bit) this is not the hotel for you. We wouldn\u2019t stay here again, or recommend it to friends, unless they were young and just wanted to have somewhere to shower, change and sleep. Whenever we go away, and we do so quite frequently, we like to be able to relax in the room before going out to dinner, or sit in the bar for a few drinks and a chat before/after getting ready to go out for the evening.... we missed on this trip, because this hotel doent have the facility to do so. There are a lot of hotels in Rome, all very close to main attractions, and some very reasonable rates. You can\u2019t go wrong with the areas as everything is in close proximity to all the attractions.

Rooftop terrace is a welcome bonus, as is the breakfast included in the price (and there was a limited fruit selection with breakfast when we were there.) Free wireless internet access was also a pleasant surprise (there was no access from our room, but it worked well on the 3rd floor terrace. Note that you need to get an access code card from reception, and that you need your passport or other id for this.) Our room did not overlook Via Cavour and we were not disturbed by street noise. I am imagine it is quite noisy if you overlook Via Cavour. Concerned about other posts saying that confirmed reservations had not been honoured, I contacted the hotel in advance and asked advice about travelling from the airport. They then arranged a car to collect us; a very nice Mercedes turned up and we were delighted.

We arrived in the evening and to be honest the first impression of our room was not brilliant. However the following morning with the curtains and shutters thrown back the room became very light, airy and sunny. We had the \"suite\" on the third floor which had an outside terrace area, it was just a shame that we didn't really have the weather to make use of it. The room was basic and probably did need a bit of TLC but on the whole it was very clean with towels and linens changed regularly. Location-wise it was perfect, easy walking distance from the Colusseum area, the Termini and most other tourist areas of Rome. Even the Vatican was do-able if you put your mind to it. Lots of great restaurants within strolling distance of the hotel which was great after a long day on your feet (and also great after a bottle of red and an Ameretto with your dinner!)", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sitges, Spain", "Title": "\u201cYour confirmation email may not be valid!\u201d", "Author": "SLPMadrid", "ReviewID": "UR6814971", "Content": "If your credit card is not accepted at the time of booking, the hotel will not notify you of this and will cancel your booking.

The hotel staff upon arrival were quite unconcerned by the cancellation and did not seem to find anything wrong in sending confirmation emails to customers whose bookings they had cancelled.

I'm glad I booked this one over others I considered, as this was situated really well for exploring Rome. It was only a five minute walk from the main Termini station and also had another metro station just down the road. From the outside the hotel looks very nice and the reception area is quite impressive. I have to admit I was slightly disappointed with the room when we first arrived, as it could have done with a coat of paint, and it looked a little dated. However, it was very clean and had all the necessary facilities, such as safe, tv, hairdryer and even a minibar. The breakfast could have been better, but I would guess that most of the hotels serve similar things. Here there was bread, cheese, ham, egg, cereal etc. There are several restaurants located very close to the hotel (literally 20 seconds away!) mainy pizzeria's. There are also a couple of bars and also touristy shops. This is great if you fancy a meal or some drinks without going far. Overall I would definitely recommend the hotel, even if its only for the great location - it really is an ideal base for seeing the city as it's so easy to get to the train station, and it's also in walking distance to plenty of nice restaurants and bars.", "Date": "February 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiwi in London.", "Title": "\u201cExactly What We Needed.\u201d", "Author": "looksshiny", "ReviewID": "UR6700113", "Content": "For a weekend in Rome, we found Borromeo to be the perfect choice.

The location is faultless 5 - 10 minute walk to the coliseum on a slightly busy road but the shutters and double glazing along with a bottle of Italy\u2019s finest red meant we had no problems sleeping. After checking in we were informed that we would have to swap rooms after the 1st night this somewhat disturbed our 3 night stay. At least we got to see 2 rooms; the first room was large but very tired the walls dirty and the double bed was two singles pushed together. The bathroom was fine but the shower holder was broken. The layout reminded me of a hostel with a small reception being the only representation of a hotel, the rooms just ran directly above this and the large banging doors, thin walls and an American neighbour with bronchitis meant for a noisy stay. Our second room was slightly better the wallpapered walls made this more homely but these too were well overdue a lick of paint. Again the bathroom was fine but like our previous room the shower holder was broken, consequently every shower during the stay was a struggle. The staff were very friendly and spoke good English however, I was somewhat concerned regarding the safety of our passports as when we collected them they were lying on the front desk within reach of any Luigi public. We only had breakfast in the hotel once and this was as expected, basic, but it was fine although we had to negotiate the workmen on the top floor where the building work was taking place. I would recommend this hotel as a base for exploring the beautiful city but nothing more (CNN can be slightly repetitive CNN can be slightly repetitive CNN can be slightly repetitive).
