{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fine place to stay in Berlin It was very clean, the staff were friendly and spoke some English. Our room (room 1) was large with a bay window, very light and sunny and had a sofa and easy chair as well as twin/double bed. The bathroom was fine - shower (no bath) and loo. None of it was up-to-date. It could be a fantastic spot if done up. The floors creaked badly but no one seemed to stay above us ( I think it might have been offices) so it didn't worry us. There was some traffic noise but there were double windows keeping the worst out. Breakfast was ok - the usual self service continental food and drink. We loved the old building and being in a hotel that wasn't a modern block, at a reasonable rate. Position was very good.", "Date": "Jun 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR113316038", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Candyjo"}, {"Content": "nie wieder!   showReview(7664955, 'full');", "Date": "May 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR504354648", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hoost"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d529501-r16961211-Am_Olivaer_Platz-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "529501", "Price": "$136"}}
