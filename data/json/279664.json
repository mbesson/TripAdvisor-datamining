Americans that have never been to EU they may be surprised at how small the room and bathroom are. The room was very comfortable and I cannot express how clean it was. Location was fabulous. Just a very short walk to Kings Cross St. Pancras station. Lots of restaurants, shopping, etc. nearby. You cannot beat the location for the price. The only issues that I have are: that there is no elevator, I had several bags since I was on trip for both personal and business so was traveling for 2wks. I was put on the top floor and had to lug all of these heavy bags up a very narrow stairway, I was disapointed that there was no offer from the hotel staff to help me with my bags. The other issue is that the hotel still uses actual metal keys for the room and there is no secondary lock on the door. This didnt bother me so much but I would not let my wife or daughter sleep in one of these rooms alone.

Breakfast was filling, they offer a full English (beans, egg, bacon rashers & good sausages - that's a good enough English for me.. not bothered about tomatoes or mushrooms!) together with toast & marmalade/jam/butter/choc spread/honey, a pot Tea or Coffee & glass of juice. On one occasion I just felt like some bacon & toast...where I was given extra slices seeing as I just had that, and my breakfast partners' plates had nothing missing from theirs\u2019 ..as regards the staff.. sometimes you have to understand that different cultures act in different ways, however they were always well mannered & to the point. Breakfast is from 0700 - 0900hrs, yes at 0900hrs we were advised that breakfast time was up, but still politely - there was one gentleman who wasn't quite finished yet & I didn't see them chucking him out - I have a feeling that the b\u2019fast staff are the cleaning ladies too, so understandable that they'd wish to get on with their duties - that's what times are given for I guess ^_^ The hotel is in an extremely central, quiet & clean area, literally minutes walking distance from Kings Cross. I would stay at this hotel again if I was going to be in the area - it's not a luxurious hotel, if you want luxury go to a 5 star place & be prepared to pay for it...what I look for a place when travelling, is mainly a clean/cosy room & bed to sleep in, clean bathroom to wash in & most importantly feel safe - I feel we got what we wanted & good value for money here.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Attard, Malta", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, basic accomodation\u201d", "Author": "minafs", "ReviewID": "UR126222835", "Content": "Stayed in this Hotel for 4 nights mid-March 2012.

Stayed here for 3 nights end of feb into march with my wife & 3 year old son. Had a room with a double and single bed in it. This meant it was a bit of a squeeze, but for the price what more do you expect! Room was cleaned everyday, no problem with that aspect. Things are dated & do need modernising, especially the toilet/shower room. Beds were like\"put me ups\" & small to say the least, but comfortable enough. Breakfast was basically what you were given, \"full English\" minus tomatoes, hash browns, black pudding , fried bread or mushrooms! Not exactly full. Even though we had paid for our 3 year old we asked for just beans & sausage for him which he got, sadly they were then missing off our plates! Reception staff were always friendly and greet you with a smile, more than can be said than the eastern Europeans who did he breakfast & housekeeping.

It is only a few minutes from the Kings Cross tube station, and in a fairly quiet square with a pleasant garden. The reception was ok, friendly staff, but we arrived back at the hotel yesterday at around 4pm and couldn't get in - they had locked the front door and didn't respond to the bell-ringing. He eventually turned up to let us in after about ten minutes - no explanations about where he'd been. The room wasn't bad for a cheap hotel - basic but the beds were comfortable.The ensuite was basic but ok. The breakfast this morning was again, not bad - a full English is thrown in with everyone's stay. This consisted of bacon, fried egg, sausage and baked beans; there was also a fairly suspect glass of 'orange juice', tea or coffee and toast. The main problem was the noise in the hotel. We arrived back to the room at midnight, exhausted after a night standing, and went straight to sleep. However, we were woken at 2am, 4pm and 6pm by three separate loads of guests/ deliveries arriving - our room was on the ground floor next to reception and the window looked straight onto the street so this might not have been an issue for other guests.

I paid \u00c2\u00a345 a night for a single ensuite and thought that price would be difficult to beat. The bed was also surprisingly good for a budget hotel - I suspect it was reasonably new. However, there's definitely a price to paid for budget. The rooms were small, particularly the ensuites, although not impractically so. They were also very warm, although that is perhaps because they were small. My room seemed clean when I entered, but day-to-day cleaning was perhaps not thorough as I might have expected. The main reason why I might not stay again is the noise. There was very little street noise, but I could hear much of the noise within the hotel - the TV in other rooms, the movement of people above, footsteps on the stairs. The hotel didn't quieten down until about midnight but I was woken every morning before seven by breakfast preparations. To the Scottish family, who stomped and trumped their way down the stairs every morning at 7am on the dot, I'm glad you made the most of your time in London but it wasn't the pleasantest start to my day.

There was no in-room coffee or tea. I wish they would have allowed us to leave our luggage in the room before it was ready, we had to leave it in a fully accessible breakfast room, so I carried my computer with me all day before we could come back. The walls are extremely thin, we could hear the people nest to us talking, even though they used a fairly low voice. The knobs on heaters were falling off. Note that you have to ask the front desk to turn on the heating, if you want your room warm, and again the next day, because they will turn it off. The bathtub had hairs in it, I don't think the cleaning job was too thorough, the shower head was nearly entirely clogged with rock deposit. There is nowhere to hang towels. The breakfast ends at 9am sharp, at 9:10 the breakfast room was dark and set for the next day, the staff refused to give us anything, so we went to a nearby coffee shop. I think they chase people out before 9am to be able to tidy up by 9. I would say that it is one of the best choices in that city square, which is full of very low budget hotels, including a salvation army. The area felt relatively safe, though. It is quite a walk to downtown and the usual tourist sites, about 30+ min fast walk, but it is very near the King's Cross subway and the Pancras International rail station. You will probably need a day pass for subway to see the sites, though, or I recommend staying closer to the river. Next time I will stay closer to Thames, so that I could just walk to the sites, since the subway day-pass is not cheap (7 \u00c2\u00a3). If you are traveling by rail, take advantage of Virgin Rail 2-for-1 admission to most of the important sites, it saves a large amount of money.

Of all the reviews this hotel seem the best so we booked it through booking.com \u00c2\u00a390 for the 3 of us, including full english breakfast. On arrival the lobby area was nicely decorated (it was Xmas time) and smelt very festive. An english speaking man - who i think is the owner checked us in and directed us to out room. We had room 34 which was on the ground floor just to the side of the reception. When we opened the door the 1st thing i noticed was how clean it smelt. The decor was clean and when you opened the wardrobe you could smell that it had recently being cleaned. In our room was a double bed and a single bed with plenty of room to move around the beds. There was a sink in the room then there was a frosted door that had a toliet and shower at the other side of it. We all had a towel left on the end of our bed. There was also a wardrobe and LCD TV with freeview We left the room and went into London for the afternoon, when we returned the room was lovely, cosy and warm. The beds were very comfy. The only fault we could find with the hotel, which isn't even really a fault, is that as it's a really old building the floorboards above us were very creaky and you could hear people walking around above you. In the morning we could smell breakfast being cooked. We went down to the breakfast room, which again was very tidy and clean. We were seated straight away, given a glass of fresh orange each and then brought a pot of tea and basket of toast. 2 mins later our cooked breakfast was brought out. It was really tasty, nice thick cut bacon and fresh sausauge. If you don't want a cooked breakfast they do have cereal that they offer to our little boy, but he wanted sausage and egg. When it came to checking out and paying we were dealt with by a nice english lady - who again i think was the owner. The location could be better, as soon as you step out of the front door you can see Kings Cross station and St Pancras is just next door.

All I ask is to have somewhere clean & to be treated in the polite manner I treat others (so really not very fussy). I booked this hotel 2 months ago for myself and my partner who has incurable cancer. I placed on the booking form that we needed a ground floor room and to check in slightly before 1pm, as we were travelling from Manchester. I also rang up and asked if this was ok and was told it wasn't a problem. To cut it short we turned up and were treated with contempt from the young man on reception whom I showed the booking form to. He eventually gave us a key to a room on the top floor. We said nothing and just struggled up very narrow stairs to the top floor. The room was clean, but there was no info regarding the hotel, breakfast, suggestions, complaints or complaints book. The next day I went to the dinning room at 09:11 and sat down at a table. Two women came from the kitchen & started yelling \"no more, we finished, you go!!!\". Other diners tucking into their breakfast burst out laughing. I asked the lady to stop shouting and said it was ok, but would it be possible to get a cup of coffee? The two eastern european women started to yell at me in another language. I got up and left the dinning room. I informed my 3 friends and my partner, whom were still in there rooms what had happened. After my friend tipped (around \u00c2\u00a310) the kitchen staff we got some toast and coffee. One of the kitchen women said later \" I tell boss you weren't told time to eat tomorrow\". I said thanks but I'll put my own review on Trip advisor. For \u00c2\u00a365 it isn't worth the money, pay an extra \u00c2\u00a310 and get treated with decency. The same man was still on reception when I checked out and my partner informed him that he forgot to inform us when breakfast was, the man was very rude and we just paid up and left.

The latter is very important for South Africans, with an ever dwindling exchange rate. On enquiry, we were assured they had accommodation available and we then investigated further and found some quite complimentary comments from guests. Well - the reality is completely divorced from the description and commedations available on the internet. We arrived at the hotel, on 13th June, having telephoned confirmation previously, and were greeted by a bolted Reception door with a hand written sign saying use the next door. We rang the bell and after a while, the door was opened. My own first thought on entering the dingy interior was that the carpets and walls had not seen benefit of cleaning for a good 10 years or more. The carpet was filthy and the walls were marked with stains and very dirty. On the left hand side, there was a door into what is presumably the normal reception area, and there was a person sitting behind a desk. Immediately in front of the desk, the carpet had been removed, and there was a large piece of what looked like flattened corrugated iron - quite obviously covering a hole or holes in the floorboards. On the far side of the tin, were some bare floorboards. The receptionist very reluctantly got to his feet, and with some ill will assisted us to take our suitcases down to what can only be described as a basement. I had already told him by this time that I was not happy with the appearance of the hotel, information which did not seem to bother him at all. We had asked for a family room, as it was cheaper for us than a double and a single, but what greeted our astonished eyes was hardly a family room. It looked just like a very basic hostel type of room, three iron bedsteads, paper thin mattresses (and doubtless blankets too, though we did not stay long enough to test that theory), one pillow per bed and the \"en suite\" was ridiculous. There was an opening from the bedroom into a quarry tiled area which had a handbasin to the left, and to the right a w.c. and, behind a very dirty plastic curtain, a shower which absolutely reeked. There was no door for any of these offices. There was a minute courtyard - overgrown and full of rubbish - outside the window, but no curtains or blinds to speak of, and another room about 2 yards away, which looked directly into our room. We were all stunned with disbelief at the appalling conditions and the final straw was a small black insect-like creature actually crawling over one of the bedspreads. We wasted no further time, but got our suitcases up the stairs and out into the square as fast as possible. I told the receptionist as we passed that we could not stay there, and he did not appear at all surprised or concerned. I then phoned my son who fortunately for us, lives in London, and he very kindly got us into a very nice hotel in Wimbledon. I am fully aware that we chose to go for a cheaper hotel, in the interests of economy, but I wanted to bring this matter to your attention because I am sure we are not the only people to have had such a shattering experience. The booking agent for the hotel confirmed that the description and copies of visitor comments are passed to them by the hotels themselves so they are, presumably acting in good faith, or else is in cahoots with these hotels. I know that it is very difficult to police the internet but I think it would be advantageous if an anonymous inspector could be sent to visit hotels such as the Howard Winchester, and can then take up the misinformation with the people concerned. It makes one most reluctant to take anything at face value on the internet when one has that sort of experience, and in my own opinion, the Howard Winchester is a health hazard of note. Not even in South Africa, which no longer pretends to be first world, have I actually encountered livestock crawling on the beds! I am sending a copy of this letter to the booking agents and to the Department of Health and Safety. I look forward to your comments.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cWhat do you expect for \u00c2\u00a350?!\u201d", "Author": "Romangate", "ReviewID": "UR17054122", "Content": "Ok - this isn't the Ritz but for \u00c2\u00a350 a night for a single en-suite room which is clean and very well positioned for St. Pancras, I can't complain at all!

I had read other reviews on here but thought all I need was somewhere to rest my head and get some sleep for 2 nights so thought it would be fine. I was certainly not expecting anything more than 2 star service however nor did I expect to be woken up at 8am each morning by the workmen demolishing the existing reception area!!! We were on the first floor, up and along one from the main entrance (reception)where the work was going on. First night wasn't too bad and I slept alright until the 8am wake up call, hammers, crashing, banging! Nice! The next morning we didn't have to be up so early and were looking forward to sleeping in until 9. (not unreasonable an expectation in my mind) We could hear the guests above us until after 1am (floors are very thin, can hear all movement above you and if I stood in the bathroom I could hear word for word the conversation in the room above us) and then woken up AGAIN by workmen at 8am. I feel we should have been advised this work would be going on, but no mention of it when I booked with the hotel or checked in. I booked direct. Window didn't fully fit the frame so there was about a 1inch gap at the top of it. Shower head needed a clean years ago, it was filthy, the worst I've seen anywhere. The bathroom was basic but had all you need. The room too was basic but again had all we needed for 2 nights and was quite clean. I would not recommend the hotel and would not be staying there again. There are plenty same price range hotels in that area. I do have to say for Kings Cross Stn it's location was ideal, but that and the \u00c2\u00a360 night rate was all it really had going for it. All I wanted was a decent nights sleep and was most unhappy at being woken up through the night by movement above us and then again first thing in the morning by hotel employed workmen. Long days in London coupled with little sleep does not make for a great visit. We didn't stay for Breakfast either morning so can't comment on that. Stay there if you have to but check what work they've got going on as when I went to reception at 8.15 am approx to complain about the noise they didn't really see what my issue was! I was told my room was not directly above it but given the front doors were wide open (noise coming in the 1inch gap in the window) and the walls are so thin I can assure it sounded as though the hotel itself was being demolished underneath us.", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Location, Great Price, Happy Days!!\u201d", "Author": "NUFC4Life", "ReviewID": "UR15748380", "Content": "Four of us stayed in a family room which cost only \u00c2\u00a390 for the night and included a cooked breakfast in the morning!!

We arrived exhausted and drenched (a torrential downpour coincided with getting to London Marylebone). The man on the reception desk was charming and chatty, and the reception area was spotless and nicely decorated with good use of marble and mirrors, in a retro (original d\u00c3\u00a9cor, it turned out) way. The exterior is pleasant, and fairly similar to the other budget hotels on the square. I imagine that those booking this hotel do so because of the excellent location and cheapness of the rooms. One doesn't book a hotel of this sort for its luxury or amenities. The rooms were on the 2nd floor, and there was no lift. The stairs was narrow and steep, but not unmanageable, even for the older member of our party (in her 70s). The rooms are tiny. We faced the square which was nice; we wondered about noise from outside but heard none (although two of our party were woken by loud laughter from late-returning hotel guests during the night). Rooms were immaculately clean (better than some far more expensive hotels I've been in), as were the tiny 'en suites'. In effect, these were lo-tech wet rooms with a shower area at one end, cloaks size sink in the middle, and WC at other end. Lots of hot water. Very small towels. But very clean linen throughout. We did not linger in the rooms, naturally, as we were only there over night en route to the continent via Eurostar the next a.m. The beds were very comfortable, and one of our party has back problems, so that's a good recommendation. Two of our party had the full English breakfast before we left the next day. This was included in the price. It was of a much higher standard than we had expected, with quite nice sausages, and good mushrooms in particular. Bacon not terribly crisp. I had 'continental' - fairly basic - toast (lots of it provided, but fairly characterless), marmalade, juice (fine), coffee (ok) and weetabix (the only vaguely healthy option). The waiting staff were highly efficient (waitress service rather than buffet breakfast) and the woman on the desk when we checked out was, it turned out, part of the family who owned the hotel. The hotel is a couple of minutes walk from Euston (basically, one crosses Euston Rd) so absolutely ideal for Eurostar use, and we definitely plan to stay there again when next on a flying visit to London.", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cKudos from an Ant....\u201d", "Author": "AntsInvasion", "ReviewID": "UR10088371", "Content": "LOVE, love, love the HW!

My only complaint is lack of outlets. Most of the rooms only have one outlet, so you can either watch tv, or plug something else in.
