{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Only if you're desparate Well, the saying beggars can't be choosers applies here. My husband is a musician and was playing a show in Frisco, TX. I thought we were going to sleep in the van for the two nights we would have been there, but (long story short) someone in the band booked a handful of rooms for the whole gang. Needless to say, he picked the cheapest hotel he could find. I didn't complain to him since the room was free....and really was grateful that I didn't have to sleep in the van. This hotel is one step up from sleeping in a van.I guess it could have been worse, I mean~ at least the bed was clean. The moment we walked in, I noticed the tomato sauce splattered all over the kitchen area. While cleaning that, I noticed something was in the microwave....someone had left a sandwich in there. Not a big deal, but to me this means the room wasn't cleaned thoroughly which is a big problem in my eyes. The other problem was the A/C ended up not working properly. It was well over 100 degrees during the day, so at first I tried to tell myself it was my imagination, but it really didn't work. I didn't even try to complain about it b/c the front desk person was completely useless. He couldn't give us the number to any cab company, nor could he suggest a place to eat. I suppose if you just need a bed, a bathroom and a roof, this place is fine. If you're looking for anything pleasant, you should look elsewhere.", "Date": "Oct 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR295458284", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "MedusasWisdom"}, {"Content": "This Homestead is no home I had few, but specific needs. None were met. I requested portable cribs in my online reservation. When I arrived they informed me they had no cribs and I was on my own to obtain them - even though the check-in document I signed had my online request printed right on it. When I asked to speak with the manager about it, no manager was available. I needed a non-smoking room. The first room they assigned to us had an obvious cigarette smell. They were gracious about reassigning the room; however, the second room had only a temporary scent of a strong industrial deodorizer. All my clothes came home smelling like cigarettes anyway. The beds were terribly hard and uncomfortable. When we turned on the heat, dirt and ash spewed out of the heating unit onto the bed. There were cigarette burns on both the sheets and bed covers.When I checked out, the individual at the front desk was completely incapable of performing any financial functions. He could not change the credit card on file. He could not divide the bill. He could only take the room keys and check the box. He was completely unhelpful and unapologetic for his incompetence.Spend a little extra and stay at the Marriott up the street. You're better off.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR101619235", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "schweetbubble"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d217716-r20860834-Homestead_North_Tollway_Addison_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "217716", "Price": "$84"}}
