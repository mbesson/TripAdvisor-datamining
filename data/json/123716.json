We were given a small discount on the room rate because the AC was not working when we arrived. Front desk guy suggested that engineer was due to fix it, but he never arrived. We were given a desk fan instead. We arrived just as the room was being made up, which enabled me to see the bed stripped down. The bed looked OK, but the pillows were yellow. The maid looked surprised when I asked for clean ones, but she complied. Our room was not very clean. The bathroom door frame looked like it hadn't been cleaned for years - thick with the type of black dust that you get around door frames. Glanced down the back of the unit housing the TV and it was thick with cobwebs. The carpet was filthy. Bed was comfortable enough, but having seen the state of the pillows that were replaced, couldn't help but wonder what I was sleeping on.

It is extremely poor to other Howard Johnson's I have stayed at. $59.99 per night Thought I had found a great deal. Just walked in the door and it stinks of smoke. The beds are so hard I could use them as a table to eat from. The toilet stuck and I had to fix it, cause it was continuously running. The pool looked much larger in the pic, but that is fine for the moment. The pic of the rooms are very deceiving. They look nice in the pics and the rooms looked bigger than they are. We got 2 very small pillows. There are light bulbs that need to be replaced. There are smudges on the walls and they have missing paint. The ceiling has black mold on it. I was told by the operator that Sea World was real close. But it is quite far away. You have to go through the college parking lot to get from the hotel to Sea World. Sadly this is not what I was expecting. I just hope the one near Disneyland is better than this. We came for a nice visit and a relaxing time hoping to have a nice place to stay. I can say a few real nice things about this hotel. It has a huge fridge and has a safety box. I really hope the breakfast is as good as the operator said it was. I am not sure who cleans these rooms, but maybe they need to spend just a few more min dust off the old spider webs off the ceiling and dusting the counter space. The carpet needs to be vacuumed a bit better and I know there is a spray that gets rid of pet and smoke smells. Maybe they need to invest into some. I have stayed in places costing the same and they were much nicer that this. You often get what you pay for. The hotel was cheap and shoddy for the price we paid. Could have had a better room at hotel 6 or 8.

The neighborhood is fine. Starbucks down the street and other eateries. I mention Starbuck's because the continential breakfast and coffee was not desirable. First, let's say the night staff is friendly, but the check out clerk was a little cranky. My fiance and I planned a little get away from our children, but the getaway turned into a night mare. If it wsn't for the fact that I was with the man I love I would have been utterly disappointed. Secondly, The rooms we were given were smelly. They smelled of mildew, funk, and porta potty after the \"number 2\". The bed was even worse, but it was just the comforter. After removing the comforter, the sheets were okay. Third, the heater was a switch (a light switch) and a huge unit which over powered the space that it occupied. It had a cord which was taped together with electrical tape. I was afraid to turn it on, but I was not willing to freeze. Finally, the shower...it took almost 30 minutes for the shower to get to a decent temperature to even attempt to put your body in. The tub was yellow stained and the towels were crispy. They felt like they were laundered by hand and line dried.

But we did. We had reservations at the Radisson in Downtown San Diego but for an extra night it would be almost $300. My family and I decided to stay somewhere out of town outside of the main area. Bad decision. The hotel itself is worse than a Motel 6. I would have been better off staying in Hotel Circle. The manager is hard to understand but polite and we had no problems getting a room without reservations. When I checked into the room the overall first impression was OK, nothing more. Standard crappy little motel for the night. Understandable. The beds were OK for a motel, very soft. The television worked without any problems. One major problem was the incredibly disgusting stench that was inside the room, luckily we ha a Glade Plugin, it was bearable for a night but it definitely smelled. The bathroom had serious issues, more specifically the toilet. It looked like someone tried to pull it from the ground, when being used it felt like you were rattling around on a rollercoaster. By all means I would say without a doubt that it is a safety hazard. During our stay we discovered that someone at one time tried to break into the room because the door frame was pulled away. The so called continental breakfast is an even bigger joke, it consisted of milk, coffee, tea, and stale cereal and even older donuts that looked like they were from 7-Eleven. All in all the motel provided us with a one night stay, we tried to stay out of the room as much as possible and left as early as we could.
