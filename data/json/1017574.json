This place was so bad that my husband and I switched to a different hotel within an hour of check in! First, the entrance is hard to find. We hauled our luggage around Rome for much longer than we needed to because the hotel is a little buried. It is in a good part of town (close to the train station and Via Nazionale), but on a small side street with little signage. I was immediately concerned when there were bars over the doors and we had to be buzzed in. The lobby was small but the gentleman at check in was very friendly. However, our room was the major problem. I think we got room 102 that people have warned about in other reviews. I'm convinced it's a converted closet. We saw one room with a room number and then a tiny door next to it with no room number, just labeled \"private\". That was our room! It was so small that we could not lay our suitcases down to open them. Literally. And to walk to the bathroom, I had to walk OVER the bed because I couldn't squeeze by the space between the end of the bed and the \"closet\". I'm 4'11\" and weigh 115 pounds. If I can't squeeze by, that's saying a lot! We tried to be optimistic and my husband opted to take a shower to start fresh. About 60 seconds into his shower, the bathroom almost flooded because the shower drain was so backed up. He had to turn off the shower every minute for a minute to let it drain before repeating the cycle. We had had enough and immediately went to another hotel around the corner on Nazionale to book a new room. (Sidenote: We had a great stay there - see my other reviews!) We then notified the front desk we'd be departing and, to their credit, the man was very sorry and repeatedly tried to upgrade us to stay. BUT why would you put someone in a bad room in the first place?

Were this hotel scores high in my opinion is the very friendly and obliging staff, Lito in the reception was great he gave us a map with all the sights marked of with the easiest routes to and from the hotel with bus numbers to always get us back to the hotel. He ordered taxis when we needed them and stored our bags on the last day. The girl in the breakfast room was great she made the most wonderful coffees and teas any way you liked them with seconds and thirds even, on the last day when my daughter came down late just before our taxi arrived she rushed to get her coffee and a croissant and insisted she ate it so she would not be going out on an empty stomach, they were all so thoughtful.

We stayed for 13 nights. When we arrived to check-in, they escorted us across the street to Hotel Opera, which apparently is owned and operated by the same people. The switch was fine for us and not unexpected, because we had read about it in other reviews. Once you have made reservations, any email question that you send to them is answered quickly. I found it quite amazing. So, here are my observations. Please recognize that I am an American and have done extensive business travel (in the USA mostly) and am used to pretty nice hotels of a 3-star and 4-star level. So be sure to bear that in mind as I give my opinions. Do NOT expect your room to be the equivalent of a Marriott hotel room. If that is what you expect, then expect to pay much more elsewhere. 1. The room was neat, clean, and adequate. It was everything we expected, based on other reviews. It was small, did not have an 'easy chair' or a small table for eating in the room. Again, it was too small to accommodate those amenities and we did not expect it. It had a closet for hanging clothes, plenty of drawers, and a large safe to lock up valuables and laptops. 2. The bathroom was very nice. The towels hung on a heated rack, which was nice because we were in Rome for the first snowfall in 26 years. The shower was all-glass and very clean and suitable. My only complaint is that there were no washcloths. We made do without washcloths. Maybe if we had asked for them we'd have gotten some. (I don't like to act like an American tourist and be too demanding. I want to respect the culture of the host country) 3. The internet was free and adequate. I did not like to get a new userid and password every day, but again, there may be a very good reason for it. 4. The breakfast experience for us was a highlight of the day. The very friendly attendant made us coffee any way we pleased. For us it was cappuccino for my wife and caffe Americano for me. You couldn't buy better coffee anywhere. Plus the attendant remembered our coffee preferences each day.....made us feel quite welcomed. The tables were covered with linen tablecloths. We ate off china, nothing cheap and disposable. The room was very nice and inviting. There were cold cuts and cheese, coffee cakes, cereals, and the most delicious bread-rolls. We ate the bread-rolls every day. There were no hot scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. Again, we appreciate the culture and enjoyed what was presented. Be sure to try the bread-rolls. They look like a rosette and are crusty. We pulled them apart and ate them with butter and jam..... excellent. 5. The staff. What can I say? They were friendly, spoke English, and always immediately took care of any request (such as a burned out light, extra plastic cups, tv instructions, etc). They were also very likable and seemed eager to be of service. I wish we had used them a little more.....some of the Rome attractions were closed because of weather and the staff would have checked for us and saved us a trip. They also immediately knew the appropriate bus line to take to any attraction. They also suggested an alternative to taking the Leonardo deVinci Express Train back to the airport, saving us 16 euros. We also asked them for restaurant recommendations and were pleased with the result. So my hearty endorsement of the hotel staff. They couldn't have been better. 5. Rome is a very noisy, busy city. Some of the guests were occasionally noisy in the hallways during sleeping hours. Our room was not quiet. There was street noise. Sirens, and early morning trash pickup were clearly audible in our room. If you expect a sound-proof room you will be disappointed. 6. Hotel location was tremendous. Close to Roma Termini station and close to Via Nazionale, a main street.. Close to attractions. We took the Metro train to Saint Peter's, but walked to everything else. 7.

We arrived at Termini station late one night and decided to walk to the Hotel - it wasn't too far, however it is quite dark and scary around the station at night (a note for solo travelers), however we stuck to the main streets and found the hotel with reasonable ease. The gentleman that works at night is absolutely lovely!!! He was so warm and friendly on our arrival, helped us to our room and after staying in a number of B&B's and hostal type accommodation we were so pleased when he opened the door to a large beautiful room and large bathroom (we booked a double room with private bathroom). Air-conditioned, beautiful marble floors and well the bathroom was great - after travelling for a month we were both hoping for a room that was not too small and we were not disappointed. I had requested a room with a balcony overlooking the street and it was quite lovely. The hotel is in a good location - we walked most places and loved getting lost in the streets of Rome and finding beautiful places to eat. It was so nice to come back to the hotel at the end of the day, freshen up and then head out for dinner somewhere. I would recommend trying Hostaria Romana - an absolutely awesome restaurant - must try the carbonara and the buffalo mozzarella (I still dream about these dishes often!!). We went their twice because we loved it so much - we walked there from the hotel (as with most places in Rome)!!! Google it to find the specific location! A few things to note: if you are accustomed to large hotels, this might not be exactly what you are used to, it is a number of rooms on levels of a beautiful building that comprise of Hotel Opera (not one large building that is solely a hotel), the air-con is a must when travelling to Rome in summer, there is free wireless, TV with cable (not many english channels), breakfast in the morning (unfortunately you will need to rely on other reviews on this point, we slept in and missed it most mornings!). Also - we took advantage of the airport transfer for 40 Euro when leaving Hotel Opera - it was great (albeit a bit scary driving in Rome!!!) - we were picked up by a gentleman (he looked like Karl Lagerfield!) in a lovely black Lexus 4WD and off we were to the airport. In retrospect, I wished we had have used this when we arrived at Fiumicino, as we arrived late in the evening and the trains from the airport to Termini are not that regular and it was busy and really for 40 Euro at that time of night being picked up and driven to your hotel door is well worth it. This is offered as a service through Hotel Opera.

The rooms were small but comfortable, clean and especially of note is the great service and professional of the hotel staff, in particular the Front Desk.

There also is a small elevator. The people at the Front Desk are committed to making your stay pleasant and memorable. They are concerned, professional, responsive and communicative. Prior to arriving I had emailed them often and got immediate and helpful\\ responses. You also can arrange airport pick-ups through them (with a company they use) and you pay the driver directly. Again, very reliable. The hotel is directly across the street from the Opera House in an area with numerous small restaurants and cafes. A block down is Via Nazionale, a major street with adorable shopping and eateries, and two short blocks from the hotel is the Republicca Metro Station and from there you can reach anywhere in Rome. For those who like walks, you can walk to the Trevi Fountain and the Victor Emmanuele Monument. And regarding the bill, I chose to pay in Euros and received a 5% discount.

Thanks to all who took the time to share their impressions. The hotel did not disappoint. It is a small boutique hotel on a quiet one-way street in the heart of the old city. The Teatro Opera is just across the street. For some reason Taxi drivers had diffiiculty finding this hotel, so we began asking them to take us to the Teatro, instead. The location is hard to beat. It is just a half-block to the bustling shopping and transportion routes of Via Nazionale. There is a Metro station nearby and several good restaurants in the neighbourhood. Many of the well known tourist sites are within walking distance. We tended to walk to the sites, stopping at cafes alomg the way, and then take a taxi, bus or Metro back at the end of the day. The hotel has a small but comfortable lounge, a nicely appointed breakfast room and 10 newly renovated hotel rooms, We booked a King bed room with a balcony through the hotel's internet site. Upon arrival we got exactly what we had requested. The intelligent design of the room resulted in ample storage space and comfortable movement within the room. The decor gave the room a calm and sophisticated look. The small but modern bathroom included a walk-in shower. The mini-bar was stocked with soda, water and birra at prices less that the street vendors. The lounge included two computers with free access to the internet. Having access to the internet meant that we learned that the departure time for our flight home was changed, which resulted in less waiting time at the airport. The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. A special thanks to Mr Litu who not only fixed the safe in our room and the cable connection to the TV but also offered restaurant recommendations, made reservations, and provided us with a bucket of ice cubes at the end of each afternoon. The breakfast room had a pleasant atmosphere. The breakfast buffet had a good selection of brioche, croissants, potatoe onion pie, fruit, cheese and pasteries. Your choice of coffee or chocalata caulda is delivered to the table with a pitcher of orange juice. The waitress was efficient but not particularly friendly. At first, we thought she was having a bad day but her demeanor did not change during the week, A couple of cautions. We noticed that there is another hotel called the Opera Hotel not far away. Be careful when booking to make sure you are at the Hotel Opera Roma. The hotel is owned by the same people who own the Sonya Hotel which is just down the street.. It can be confusing for new arrivals. At the entrance there is a brass plate sign with the Sonya Hotel name and a smaller brass sign with the Hotel Opera Roma name. The breakfast room has the Sonya name on it and the brochures at reception and in the rooms are for the Sonya Hotel. It is as if the owners have not yet decided whether to market the Hotel Opera Roma as a separate hotel, or as an annex of the Sonya Hotel. We recommend that the owners feature the unique qualities of this great liitle hotel, rather than blurring its identity with the Sonya.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cSkippable\u201d", "Author": "Mahjarunner", "ReviewID": "UR67099879", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel from June 2 through June 5, 2010 (4 nights). We originally were assigned to room 106, which was terrible. The bathtub leaked all over the floor, the air conditioner made a gushing sound (what the fluid rattling around up there was is anyone's guess), the street noise overnight was unbearable, and there was some sort of compressor that made a terrible noise from 8am until 9am, but was then shut off. For the first time ever in many years of travelling in Europe, I requested a room change, and it was immediately granted. We asked for a move to an upper floor facing away from the street, and they took care of moving us while we went out and saw the sights, which was nice. They didn't seem too concerned about the reasons why we wanted to move though, and over the next 4 days, I heard 3 other people request room changes that also went unquestioned. This leads me to believe they were either putting people back in room 106, or they get a lot of complaints. That said, we were totally fine with our new room which was 214. It was very quiet, smaller, had fewer amenities, and no view. We paid 170 euros per night and they didn't discount that despite moving us to a smaller room and having such a bad experience with the first night, which I thought was a little tacky on their part. I also don't see how this is a 3 star hotel. The guys at the front desk were foreigners, but honestly, they were some of the nicest people in Rome. The only exception was the Italian woman who staffed the breakfast area on weekdays (with black hair). The Italian woman with blond hair who staffed the breakfast area on Saturday was wonderful. PROS: -convenient location -comfortable, if small (okay tiny), beds -internet access by computers provided in the lobby -friendly people at the front desk -good breakfast spread including a variety of breads, yogurt, cheeses, sliced cold cuts, cereals, orange juice, and fresh coffee / cappucino drinks -air conditioning -secure lobby and access to rooms by card key -balconies in some rooms that face the street -furnishings in good condition, including flat screen tvs mounted on the wall CONS: -hostile woman overseeing the breakfast area (really, I've never experienced someone who so clearly hated her job, all of the patrons, and never smiled once in 3 days) -they kept the same breakfast goods out until they were gone. For example, several of the pastries that were new when we started out on Tuesday were on their last helpings by the time we checked out on Saturday. We counted squares just to make sure we weren't misjudging this, and also you could tell because they got progressively staler. -tiny bathrooms (and I mean tiny compared to other Italian bathrooms which are already small to begin with) -lots of street noise -nothing special, its like staying at a Best Western - just basic", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Navarre, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLovely, small hotel with fantastic location and staff\u201d", "Author": "gagirl7143", "ReviewID": "UR66926926", "Content": "Booked Hotel Sonya and upon arrival we were told that we were moved 1/2 a block away to Hotel Opera Roma since we were staying 6 days and it was their newly remodeled site.

The general location is a little hard to find the first time--really pay attention to the directions on the website, and bring with you a detailed map. After a day or two, we didn't have any problems, but I wouldn't criticize anyone that decided to take a quick taxi ride (e.g. from the train station) to locate it the first time (Rome streets are so confusing!). The rooms are newer and more modernized. The staff was really nice and the manager went our of her way to help us print out museum tickets that we were having problems with. They honored coupons that we had printed from the Hotel Sonya website. We got two free tickets to one of the Hop-On, Hop-Off buses in Rome, which totally saved our feet the last day touring around Rome. We also paid in cash to get a discount. As Americans, this seemed odd, but apparently this wasn't out of the norm in Rome. They did take a credit card number when we checked-in, just in case.

We were very fortunate to have our room upgraded to the multi-level room you see on the web site. It was lovely and we highly recommend this room. The breakfast included with the reservation is excellent, with lots of wonderful pastries along with fruit, yogurt, eggs and beverages. The hotel staff was very helpful in arranging our double decker bus tour of Rome as well as booking our transfer back to the airport. Prior to confirming our reservation with the hotel, we exchanged many emails and the staff answered all of our questions quickly and thoroughly. They were very helpful and friendly to deal with.

When we arrived at the hotel we were not greeted warmly, we were asked for our passports and shown our room. The jacuzzi did not work-it was empty b/c they were having problems. This was disappointing but we understood. The next day we were glad to see it filled but the water was cold. We inquired about the temperature and we were promised an answer in the morning but we never received one. This happened every night of our four night stay. We were finally told there was no way to make the water warmer, so we were unable to use the jacuzzi the entire time. We are still unsure about whether this reflects a difference in the way we expect a jacuzzi or if there was just something wrong with it. We expected a jacuzzi with hot water and jets, while the water was cold/room temperature with jets. At check out we brought up the issue again. We were given a slight discount after we uncomfortably pressed the issue. No one ever took responsibility for the jacuzzi issue and we constantly felt as if we were bothering them about it.

There is free internet access computers in the lobby, or you could take a hotel laptop to your room if you preferred, at no charge. We even had 2 sodas from our 'mini-bar', and it cost just 4 Euros total for both - that was less than buying one at the carts on the street!! Our room overlooked the front entrance and the side of the Opera House, and we didn't have any trouble with noise - and actually enjoyed the afternoon music rehearsal we could hear on one day. The hotel was charming, centrally located, and the service was absolutely 5 star!!!", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "AMSTERDAM", "Title": "\u201cPleasant hotel near centre and Termini station\u201d", "Author": "AdelbertJ", "ReviewID": "UR46067470", "Content": "We enjoyed our five day Rome stay in this nice, little hotel.

It is close to the train station, but once you've arrived by train you don't need to be in that area - you're going to spend a lot of time walking to the sights and if you're squeamish about walking at night in a city, you're going to be very unhappy. We were glad to have a TV but the stations were really limited without switching to pay-per-view, which is mostly porn (as openly advertised in the bedside pamphlet) so we avoided it all together and were a bit grossed out. On the good side, the breakfast was delicious and the bigger rooms had nice places to spread out / unpack. The staff was very nice and gave us a free mini laptop and internet access so we could check on things at home via email. Overall, stay somewhere else - the Hotel Opera oversells itself.

When looking for hotels we were so overwhelmed as there are so many to choose from, and Rome is SOOOO vast that its nearly impossible to determine where it is to stay location wise. We chose Hotel Opera Roma (formerly Hotel Sonya) mainly for the price. Rome is incredibly expensive, and we decided to find a basic hotel that was clean and decent location, but try to keep it around $200 canadian a night. Hotel Opera was really the only one that fit our budget and from the pictures looked very clean, there were mixed reviews on location, but for the price, we booked it. When we arrived...the hotel went above and beyond our expecations. The hotel is AMAZING. The rooms are small...but who cares! They're modern looking, spotless, air conditioned, and very comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and the water pressure in the shower worked wonderful. Breakfast was included in the price. You walk into the breakfast room and the first thing you see is a friendly face asking you how you like your coffee. The lobby has two computers, and the hotel gives you free internet access which was such a blessing because we used it to email friends and family back home so we didn't have to use the phone. The staff is undoubtedly the nicest people in ALL of Rome. Honestly, italians are rude. People are mean, and they mostly do not provide service with a smile. But at Hotel Opera...its so refreshing because they are soooooooo nice! If it wasn't for this hotel and our wonderful stay there, my overall trip to Rome would be just mediocre (because like I mentioned before, Italians are quite rude even at restaurants and major sites. Our food experience in most of rome was mediocre, which was so disappointing and everything is expensive!). So thank you to the staff for making my trip to Rome a little more memorable. Before you arrive, make sure you email the hotel and ask for shuttle service from the airport. Its 15 euro one way for each person. You can take the train from the airport to the Termini and walk 10 minutes to the hotel OR from the termini take the metro to the 'Opera theater' stop and walk 3 minutes to the hotel from there for about 11 euro, but if you have lots of luggage...I don't recommend it. Arrange with your hotel a shuttle back to the airport while you're checking in so that you don't have to worry about a ride when you check out. Location wise...this hotel in my opinion is GREAT! It was perfectly situated. Its about a 20 minute walk to the spanish steps, trevi fountain and collseum...but if you don't want to walk, then DON'T. The metro is only like a 2minute walk away, and for 4 euro a day, you can ride all day to where ever you need to go, Vatican, Colleseum, Spanish steps, trevi fountain, Termini Station...it will take you there in minutes. Its so easy to use! We never used a taxi not once our entire stay there. There was absolutely no need. The only time we walked was when we were out after 1am (metro stops running), even then, we didn't find the walk that bad, especially because we the hotel provides a map, which honestly is the best map ever. We never got LOST because of that map. Our first time finding our way around was a little difficult because there are no street signs in Rome! The street names are on the side of buildings which can be hard to make out, but after figuring our way around the first time, you just start to remember the routes, so the next time you walk back, its easy. I liked that our hotel was central enough to be close to the major sites, but its nesteled on a tiny side street so that you're away from the hustle and bustle of the crazy Roman traffic. Me and my best friend are both female and we would be out walking about until 1-2am in the morning, and never felt unsafe. The neighborhood is not shady. That is why i think that is perfectly situated. I've seen hotels by the spanish steps and trevi fountain, and I'm glad that we did not decide to stay there because its way dirtier, shady and full of traffic and people, and the hotels look run down and old. I am very happy with where our hotel was situated. There are restuarants and pubs around the hotel if you want something to eat nearby, but I can't really recommend any of them because I didn't really like the food nor the service at any of the places we tried, so go around and experience yourself, you may have a better experience than me. If you want AMAZING italian food for great prices and friendly service, I highly reccomend taking a day trip into Florence, you won't be sorry. The best italian food of our whole Italy trip! So to sum up....STAY AT HOTEL OPERA! Even if it costs a little more, its worth it for the service and location!", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Isreal", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in rome ,clean and modern rooms Good value for your money\u201d", "Author": "noamIL", "ReviewID": "UR45724464", "Content": "stayed at Hotel Opera Roma for 3 nights and realy love it ,within 10-13 minutes from termini station and subway stops ,if you walk from termini station to the hotel the easiest way is to walk to Piazza Repubblica & walk down on Via Nazionale than make left on via Firenze (follow the Hotel Centro sign the building is next to the hotel) . on my arrivel I was given a room on the 5th floor which had a strong cigarette odor after complainnig that I can't stay there I switched to a room on the 1st floor (No 102) which had a bigger bathroom and save me useing the realy small and nerrow elevetor. the rooms are not that big but very clean and have all modern facilities from flat screen tv ,safe ,air condition unit ,mini bar ,hair dryer (with 120v-220v outlet) Free WIFI I even got a complementary asus eee laptop for my entire stay which was a big plus for me . the breakfast is very basic but good to start the mornning. the street of the hotel is very quiet and felt safe all the time however in some rooms you can hear any noise, the stuff is very freindly & speak english and given me a city map and marks all main attractions for me. this is not the chipest hotel if you are on a budget but it's worth every cent ,I will definitely see myself staying there again .", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA", "Title": "\u201cCLEAN ROOM,COURTEOUS & HELPFUL STAFF, GREAT LOCATION, QUIET STREET.\u201d", "Author": "memorabiliak", "ReviewID": "UR45280684", "Content": "Very enjoyable 3 night stay; staff very helpful in accomodating us.

While their wine wasn't worth drinking, it wasn't as bad as some places and our palates are used to good California wines. There are some decent wines here and if you want them, you'd better find them yourself in an enoteca or be willing to go to a significantly more expensive restaurant known for their wines. Eye Witness Italy reviews wines for each region and they look reasonable for not specializing in this area. Our hotel, Hotel Sonya and Hotel Opera Roma (their new section half a block away where we are staying) has been tops also. Everything was renovated in this new section and this has been the best bed I've ever had in many trips to Europe. Excellent air conditioning, cleanliness, service, everything you could want including free hotel-wide WiFi.

My wife, daughter, and I stayed at the Hotel Opera Roma from 8-10 August 2009 (Room 106) during the last leg of our 2.5 week backpacking tour through Europe. Hotel Opera Roma is located on the very quiet Via Firenze at Number 11, just east of Via Nazionale, and two blocks from the Repubblica Metro station. It is within 15 mins walking of the Colleseum, Palatine Hill, Roman Forums, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and Spanish Steps. This newly renovated high-quality facility has a staff that is entirely dedicated to the best customer service possible. When we checked on on Saturday afternoon, the gentleman at the reception desk was professional, friendly and curteous, and took pains to show us to our room and explain the features -- keycard locks to the main hotel door, the hall door to the wing in which our room was located, lighting and A/C controls, etc. Two nights later, the gentleman was very helpful in assisting us with printing our boarding passes for the flight home. Breakfast is included with the room, and is served in a nook on the first floor, with customer-service focused waitstaff. There is a wonderful selection for breakfast, in the typically delicious and filling European style. Especially good were the large pie-like baked pastries cut into small sections, and the black coffee is without a doubt the best black coffee that I have ever had. The gentleman tending to drinks always brought a second cup automatically, and the woman that bussed the tables and set them up was equally friendly, courteous, and efficient, and did an equally efficient job cleaning the rooms. Our room was SPOTLESS and completely sqared away and picture-perfect each day.

I reserved here to be near Termini, but I saw a sign they had at the counter about car service. The night before my flight they arranged a private car for me to go to the airport.

Within walking distance to everything!\u201d", "Author": "Quicker", "ReviewID": "UR29633301", "Content": "What a great stay! Hotel is super friendly. The service was top notch. Rooms are small, but have everything you need...fridge, waters, TV, wifi, clean bathrooms (very important in Italy as some bathrooms leave much to be desired). If you are looking for a room with tons of space and expect to spend leisure time in the room, then this may not be great for you, BUT if you are looking for a clean room, authentically friendly service in an area within walking distance to everything (Borghese gardens, Coliseum, Trevi area) then this is the place. Oh, and did I mention the staff and the great service? LOCATION: You will need a taxi or bus to the Vatican, but everything else is within walking distance. There are many good shops and coffee bars around the block, and the hotel is situated right off of Nazionale which is a main strip for shops, food, etc. Literally, it was a 5 min walk to the Coliseum located to the south. 5 min to the Trevi area with tons of gift shops and some great little wine bars and restaurants, but be sure to wander off the beaten path as that is where we found some of the best places where the locals gather. Train station is only about 5 blocks. Don't bother with a taxi because the taxis are more hassle than it is worth. If you don't have too much luggage, then just break out a map and walk the 5 min walk. AMENITIES: During our travels, we spent very little time in the hotel, however we wanted a good hotel, clean, good price, friendly service, great breakfast and this was the place. If you want 5 star service (room service, spa, restaurant, etc) then you will have to spend substantially more, but these services seem redundant when you consider that great any Italian trattoria or cafe is only a block away. Ask the people at the front desk about good coffee shops, wine bars and trattorias. They will give you recommendations for good local spots that you would otherwise never find and trust me, you will enjoy. This is so much more authentic than sitting at the hotel bar, right? NOISE: We stayed on the front side of the hotel, and the rooms were fairly quiet. I have seen other reviews with complaints of noise, and if you are a very light sleeper, then you should expect problems at pretty much any hotel in Rome because let's face it. Rome is a bustling city and is noisy, but during night hours at Opera Roma, I felt that the noise level was more than reasonable. Some cars can be heard on the street, but for the most part, the street was quiet, and the noise did not penetrate the rooms. ROOMS: The rooms are small, but most European accommodations are not spacious unless you are willing to pay the extra price. All in all, the rooms were perfect for my husband and I. The bed was large, there was a closet and safe. The bathrooms were very clean. Rooms had a TV, wifi and closets. The shower was very small (no bathtub in my room) but it was clean and functional. Water pressure was awesome! If you want a spacious room, then buyer beware because you will pay the additional price. We stayed at two hotels in Rome and the second we paid more and did have more room, but the cleanliness and service was lacking. I would definitely choose Opera Roma over the other. Probably not great for kids but I didn't see the larger rooms, and there were couples there with children of various ages, so obviously it is feasible. BOOKING & PAYMENT: I recommend using the hotel website directly for booking or calling. They all speak perfect English and various other languages. Knowing Italian always helps when getting around Roma, however Opera Roma accommodated Asian, German and French travelers while I was there as well. Ask to pay cash for a discount. You will save about 10 or 20 euro per night. LOCATION & AVAILABILITY: The sign out front is small, but if you find Via Firenze, then you cant miss it because the street is only about 2 blocks long and is situated on the left side of the Opera house. The owners also have Hotel Sonya a block away. Opera Roma only has a few rooms, so if Opera Roma is full, ask about Sonya as the staff and ownership are wonderful and Sonya has recently been renovated.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milano", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Bruno1971", "ReviewID": "UR28476419", "Content": "I had a fantastic experience in this Hotel in Rome I was in the suite..........free wi-fi - clean hotel - people very nice and helpfull - good breakfast but the suite is incredible...fantastic my wife did not want to leave Rome because of that!!!!", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "BRU", "Title": "\u201ccomfortable, reliable hotel\u201d", "Author": "anonymousBRU", "ReviewID": "UR28127451", "Content": "The hotel is located in a quiet street.

The hotel staff and amenities were absolutely incredible, and we would highly recommend this hotel for travelers on a budget, since it's simply a hidden jam in Rome, which gives you much more than you'll expect for the price you pay. It all started with a very good communication via emails and Skype, with a very fast booking conformation, without and advanced deposits or credit card charge, and with full cooperation with our requests (such as early check-in or luggage safe keeping since our flight arrived at Rome early in the morning). The Hotel is within very convenient 5-6 min. walk from Termini, and even with heavy luggage on a rainy day, it wasn't that bad... We checked-in at around 11:00 AM and received our lovely room (no. 207) immediately. The rooms are very modern and squeaky clean. Everything was working properly and the house keeping staff did a marvelous job every day. The windows and wall are all sound proof and very isolating, and you can hardly notice the weather outside even when it's stormy. The bathroom features a full sized tub with a Jacuzzi, which was a real delight every night, after a very long day of walking and sight seeing all over Rome. Breakfast was a treat as well, with the hotel's wonderful staff that comes to know all your 'breakfast habits' and tries to accommodate your every wish, with a smile. Breakfast included everything that is featured in the hotel's web site. With home made cakes and great Italian coffee. Also, in case you are wondering, I can verify that all the pictures in the hotel's web site represent the exact reality that you'll encounter upon arriving to the hotel. The rooms, the entrance, the lobby and the breakfast hall, are just as pictured. But above and beyond the facilities and the breakfast, I have to commend the wonderful staff! In all the shifts and during our entire 8 day stay at the 'Opera', we always encountered the most helpful, kind and polite staff, which went above and beyond in order to help us out. Just for example: in one of the mornings, we had an early train to catch to Napoli, which was booked and paid for in advance. Our money for that day was locked in the safe (the private one, in the room), and from some reason, it just wouldn't open. At 6:30 AM, the reception staff, tried to help us open the safe, with no luck, and with the departure time for our train getting closer and closer. After a few minutes, my girlfriend (Which on that Rome trip, also became my fianc\u00e9e), asked him whether we could get some cash and deal with the safe when we return. Without any doubts and immediately, we got the amount that we requested (200 euro) in cash, and not once until our check-out, 5 days later, we were asked to settle the bill. There are more examples like that one, but I guess you got the idea. To summarize, Rome is unbelievably charming and romantic, and for us, Hotel Opera Roma, was a great experience which helped our vacation to be more that we could dreamed of. We will definitely go back. After sending our families to enjoy as well! Thank you Reza and all the wonderful staff.

The bathroom is awesome with double shower. Location is great within walking distance to everything, we walked to Trevi, Spanish steps etc. If you want to go to the Vatican or Travestere (Travestere is good for dinner reasonable prices) very easy catch the bus on Via Nazionale. The reception staff are very helpfull they will tell you what bus to catch and any information you require. Free internet was a bonus. Breakfast is Italian style. When you check out reception will hold your luggage so you can continue your sight seeing, if you have an afternoon departure. We booked direct with the hotel, communcation was very good and prompt.
