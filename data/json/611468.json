{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Quiet but Perfectly-formed My boyfriend booked this as an anniversary over-night day trip. We HAD thought that it was near the Brandenburg Gate but actually was near Sevignyplatz Station! We arrived on a Saturday around 5:30pm. It was all closed up but LUCKILY we had our mobiles on us- the web-site had not given any instructions in this instance- we rang and were told to go to Cafe Solo next door where our key was! Once inside there was nobody about except, the internet was on in the small lobby where there were also some leaflets. We made our way to the room number stated on the key- WOW!It was HUGE! Airy with a big window, 2 twin beds pushed together and a sofa-bed with a shower and sink in the corner! In a quiet area but if you don't mind a walk to a not-quite central station then this is for you- an area reminiscent of Brooklyn! Not far from Kurfurstendamme Strasse! Breakfast was a buffet limited to German breakfast of white natural yoghurt, meats, cheese, rolls with spreads, teas in a samovar and cereal (muesli or cornflakes)", "Date": "Oct 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR230302243", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LMTav"}, {"Content": "Einfach nur ekelhaft...   showReview(7694357, 'full');", "Date": "May 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR959197742", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Dynamo53"}, {"Content": "Au\u813den hui, innen pfui!   showReview(7591264, 'full');", "Date": "May 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR520818252", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AshtrayHeart"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d611468-r6030284-Hotel_Pariser_Eck-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "611468", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
