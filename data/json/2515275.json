There even is free (albeit crappy and VPN-blocking) WiFi and a quite decent breakfast included in the room price. The rooms are small but bright and well-insulated. Double communicating rooms are available for families at a special price and there is a diminutive set of computer games for kids in the lobby. The location is not as bad as other reviews would imply: at 3 minutes walk from a line 14 metro and RER stop, it is ideally reachable from Gare de Lyon and very well connected to the RATP network. Rue de Tolbiac is in the 13th arrondissement, near the National Library and the Paris Diderot university, in a neighborhood that has recently been reclaimed from a former rail corridor. The architecture and atmosphere there is quite different than in other parts of the city, more modern and upbeat. At the same time, the 13th arrondissement also houses the largest Asian community in Paris, making it a great place to hang out in the evening, with quirky shops and cheap but excellent dining opportunities.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice and cosy hotel with responsible staff\u201d", "Author": "Ti_Cheng", "ReviewID": "UR126654446", "Content": "Hubby and I visited France last Christmas (Dec 2011), we stayed in 2 different hotels during this trip, and we were glad that All Seasons Paris Tolbiac Bibliotheque was one that we selected. The hotel was the former Holiday Inn hotel, rooms were a bit small, but since we are going out most of the time during the day, we only need a room with good shower and nice bed to sleep. The rooms gave me a very welcoming feeling, I totally feel that we were like going home every night after our visit to places. The shower was fantastic, very strong water pressure and I enjoyed the wifi service that provided. As most of the TV channels were in French, our only entertainment at night is to online or browse with our iPad, the wifi service definitely came in handy. I want to highlight 2 of the staffs that work there, one of them is a lady named Dana and another one is a man named Vincent. Both of them made our stay a really pleasent one and they have truly shown to us the real good service hotel can provide. Remember the second day after we checked in, hubby and I were planning to go to Disneyland Paris, and eventhought we have advance booked the tour bus with the previous hotel that we stayed, Dana nonetheless explained the journey and what we will expect during the trip, I find her really care for each of her customers, she even told us to be careful of pickpockets whenever there are a lot of people and be watchful of each other, make sure we take care when we go out. And about Vincent, he is as caring as Dana, always welcome us with a smile and also very courteous, he is never tired of our questions and really take time to explain to us the directions from one place to another. All Seasons Paris Tolbiac Bibliotheque is definitely a cosy little hotel that valued for money! AI will go back there again should we have a chance to visit Paris again!

I would recommend it only if you have a lot of time to spend in Paris as the main attractions (Eiffel Tower, Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Louvre, etc) are not very close to the hotel (25-30min by subway). All in all, I found more cons than pros. Pros: clean bedroom, decent breakfast (croissant, bread, apples, apricots, fresh orange juice, jam, nutella, cereal, eggs, tea, coffee), very close to the subway (about 2min walking), amenities (LUX soap and also soap bars and shampoo), check out at noon. Cons: expensive parking lot (18 euros per day), the recepcionist that did our check out didn't speak good french nor english, small fridge (a 2l bottle can't fit in there!), far away from the main attractions, the sink of our bathroom was clogged, old magazines available for guests at the reception (I got an \"Elle\" magazine of 6 months ago!), free WIFI didn't work in our bedroom and the computer downstairs has a very slow internet conection (some websites could not be opened).", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scherpenzeel, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money, great place to stay for Paris visit\u201d", "Author": "Dutchman1955", "ReviewID": "UR125064937", "Content": "I stayed for 4 nights in this hotel, which might seem a little out of the way, but it is only 100 meters from the M\u00e9tro Line 14 Station Biblioth\u00e8que.

I had booked a single room, it was located on the 2nd floor on the street side, it was clean, not small at all (small table + chair), I liked the fact that curtains were able to totally darken the room at night, the only disadvantage being the streetnoise in the evening/at night. The room had FREE WiFi, LCD-TV and airconditioning. A bit of a \"pain\" was the bathroom: taking a shower meant that the whole bathroom went \"flooded\", as there is only a small glass wall and no curtain - knowing that curtains are difficult to keep clean, a slightly larger glass wall would be much appreciated. Among the positive aspects were the free breakfast menu (croissants, pain au chocolat, baguette + cheese, meat + fruit + marmelade, honey, butter + tea, coffee, milk) where you could make your own FRESH orange juice! and free WiFi.

The staff were friendly but not particularly courteous - i.e. you could order food to eat in your room but you have to go down to the reception desk and collect it yourself once it's ready. I would recommend that you don't eat in the hotel (except breakfast) I arrived late at night and was very hungry so ordered the lasagne but this was an extremely disappointing microwave meal and completely cold when I collected it from reception.

This hotel is now called the All Seasons Hotel ( a member of the Accor hotel group). They were changing the logo, on the outside of the hotel, when we stayed there the last few days of August, 2010.

I still like it. The room was still quiet, clean, and the A/C worked well. you have cable TV in the room, with both BBC & CNN for english speakers. The hotel offers complementary newspapers, the Herald Tribune ( English ) and Le Figaro ( French ). The big change is in the breakfast buffet. It now costs only 6 euros per person, instead of 13. The downside is that they no longer offer bacon, eggs, or potatoes on the buffet table BUT, they now have a machine that makes FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUCE ! What a treat ! From the Roissy-CDG airport, take the train to the St. Michel station, then transfer to the RER C line.
