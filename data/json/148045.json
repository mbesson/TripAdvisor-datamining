I still feel compelled to do so in order to prevent others from wasting vacation dollars without at least understanding what they are getting into. First of all, El Conquistador DOES NOT HAVE A BEACH ATTACHED TO THE PROPERTY. You know how a cruise ship works, where you wait in a line to board a boat which takes you to a shore beach (and then wait again when you need to board to go back), with your time at the beach limited by the hours that the transport boat operates? This is the situation at ElCon, as the only beach is a 15 minute ferry ride out of the marina (3 pm is the last ferry to the beach, and last ferry back is at 5:30pm). You take a tram to this ferry ride, by the way (if they are working, otherwise it is a 30 minute bus ride around the property). Had I known this, I would NEVER have stayed there. Imagine what a pain this is. You spend a lot of money and fly hours and hours and the one thing you really want, a turquoise Caribbean beach a few steps away, is not only far but is also controlled and limited by access and time. Worse then finding out that there is no beach without travel, you finally get there and all of the water, except for a few tiny spots suitable for standing (not big enough for swimming) is FILLED WITH SEAWEED (I don't know what you call it - eel grass? Basically it is long ribbony dark embedded weeds that to me is pretty gross and being a little skittish I wonder what could be hiding in there). It's everywhere - almost no one was in the water. Even in the few clear areas where you could stand, floating sea weed is in the water and keeps brushing by your legs. People basically just sat in their chairs in the hot sun (there are only a few umbrellas) and drank the $10 a pop teeny tiny pina coladas or expensive beers. You could rent a jet ski or kayak, but if I fell over the weeds it would have made me pretty unhappy so I declined. Then there was the beach sand. What a mess! It is filled with dried up seaweed, chunks of broken coral, a water bottle top here and there, etc. Note: There was no big storm right before I was there. There is so much seaweed growing everywhere that this has to be a constant problem. They could at least use a machine to clean the beach, since that is all there is to enjoy on this little island off the resort's coast (and it is the resort's only beach). I would also WEED THE WATER. A big swath of it, so people have somewhere relatively clear to swim. Maybe that isn't possible, but it's a thought. My favorite thing to do on beach vacations is swim, but I went once to the beach at ElCon and never went back. I stood in the water for a minute or two and then got out. Now back to the resort. If you are still game for a visit, DO NOT stay in the rooms closest to the marina on the 2nd tram level. The \"funiculars\", or trams, broke down frequently, and at one point both (there are only two) were down and I had no way to get back to my room (I therefore arrived at a business dinner dressed for the beach). I didn't have time for the back up bus ride, which when adding the wait for everyone ahead of me to go in the huge line, would have taken way more than the 30 minute drive promised. When the trams are running, the walk through the VAST property, to the tram, plus the wait, then the walk to the rooms, including the FOUR STAIRCASES up to the third floor (at $10 a pop for a drink, you can't provide an elevator???), then down a long hallway, and then back again, takes about 40 minutes minimum if all goes well. So when you go to the main building for anything (pools, restaurants, casino, shops - it's all there), don't forget anything back at your room!! Basically, get a room in the main building if you want to stay at ElCon. A friend who stayed there was quite happy with his proximity (he did say that his room smelled moldy). Our inconvenient room down the tram ride was quite spacious, tastefully decorated, and had a nice, though distant, view of the water. The many white, waterproof surfaces on the modern furniture were dirty, but I guess I could have spent a little time wiping them (I just wasn't inclined). The staff...With few exceptions, I found the people there to be genuinely friendly and fun. It seems that for the most part management had a good eye for hiring nice people. Unfortunately, management then failed to properly train or empower them. When things go wrong, the employees are not empowered to do anything to compensate or make the guests happy. When both trams were broken and forty frustrated guests stood in the hot air waiting for the people locked in the stuck tram to be released, all of the employees were like, \"Oh well...\". One gentleman listened sympathetically, then did nothing. No follow up. People shut out of their rooms with business dinners to attend were offered no amenities. A man at the front desk told us that a manager would be contacting impacted guests to discuss the situation. No one ever called. This is a management problem, not an individual employee problem, as it is systemic to this place in every part of the resort. I went to one of the top floor, expensive restaurants and the hostess was munching on her dinner as we discussed table availability. Literally sitting and eating it as I walked up. I sat with an empty pina colada for thirty minutes while a table of employees ate next to me at the marina bar restaurant. Every server was more interested in chatting with their fellow employees and bringing them food and drinks then asking me if I wanted another. I'm happy for their camaraderie, but I've just never seen anything like that before. There are many instances where you might be in an elevator or the tram, or standing in line somewhere, and the employees around you are laughing and chatting loudly in Spanish to one another and having a grand old time as if you aren't there. I'm not sure how to describe what is off about this, but it seems as if they are the ones on vacation and the guests are the ones stuck in a constant quest to figure out all of the many obstacles that go with this property. One thing I will say is that they seem very happy working there, and they all seem to enjoy each other's company. By itself, that is a positive, and I'm sure it says something good about how management treats employees. Still, I think the staff would be even happier working at a place where the guests were taken better care of, because that leads to better reviews, repeat customers, a full hotel, and job security. In addition to the four staircases we climbed in the heat every time we needed to go to our room, the giant escalator to all of the nice restaurants on the top floor was broken the entire week we were there. I have never in my life seen an escalator broken for so long. Am I wrong or can the down escalator be put in reverse so at least the uphill climb is assisted? Is it that difficult to find someone to repair an escalator? If you look around the resort, there are MANY places needing paint, a broken tile replaced, carpet changed (like the ripped carpet at THE FRONT DESK?!), etc. It looks like a bit of a recession thing, but it's all simple and quick fix stuff. What a shame as the resort is really beautiful and it's all cosmetic. Again, it seems to be a management issue. In fact, I never once saw any senior looking manager milling about anywhere. I guess I could have missed him or her, but surely he or she is missing a lot of what is going on. The best things about this resort...The view is spectacular, really. You are up on a cliff looking over magnificent water (too far away to see the weeds). I heard the golf course is good, although with the ONE HOUR DRIVE FROM THE AIRPORT and the other issues, I'm afraid to say that the El Conquistador is a big no in my opinion. There are just too many other resorts in gorgeous, sunny places with perfect, clear beaches which are attached to the property. These places often have beautiful golf courses, and many of them do not require a one hour drive from the airport. Out of those options I would choose a place where the property is in good repair and the staff is well trained. After that, I'd be OK with paying $10 for that pina colada.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eagle River, AK", "Title": "\u201cNot bad, but not Five Star in my opinion.\u201d", "Author": "AKmama3", "ReviewID": "UR128463053", "Content": "Husband and I visited the resort for a business trip, so most expenses were paid for by the company. We did, however, choose before our trip to extend our stay a few days after the business part was finished, so those days were on us. The resort was beautiful and the view was specatular. Our room was just ok, it was in a very noisy location and we could hear busses and rolling luggage almost constantly during the night. The tub didnt drain well at all and we were ankle deep in water everytime we showered. We did inform housekeeping. My two biggest complaints about the resort are (1) Most of the staff we encountered during our six days were rude and unhelpful. It was as if we were wasting their time. We arent high maintence people by any means, so when we asked for directions or assistance it was basic and minimal. The response and treatment from the staff was terrible, especially at the front desk and at the casino (which is a joke). Ive been treated better by the staff at my local Quik Lube during an oil change. (2) I absolutely expected paying high meal prices and looked forward to it! I love food! We were at a Five Star resort after all and I assumed the food would measure up to the resorts rating as well. I was sadly disappointed. We had probably the worst sandwiches ever at the cafe next to the Ice Cream Shop. Dried out meat, too much bread and flavorless. Subway would have been better. For the price, I would have expected it to have at least looked like they put a little effort into it. The Striphouse was awesome! The steaks were done to perfection, juicy and of great quality. The service was outstanding and the atmosphere was one of a kind. A gem! Blossoms was terrible! Tasted like what a run-of-the-mill Asian buffet would taste like. The Stingray was very nice. We sat outside on a lovely warm night and dined on perfectly steamed clams and seared scallops. Very nice evening out. My complaint with the food is that if your going to charge me as much for a sandwich and fries as you are for steak and seafood (etc.), then it had ALL better be top notch! The food was pretty much a crap shoot! My husband and I actually cut our trip short and spent our last two days in Old San Juan. The hotel we stayed at was very cozy and the staff was so nice and accomodating. It was soo much fun!

To start off, the property itself was very impressive. Check-In We were greeted by a bellman that loaded our luggage onto a cart and whisked us to the check in at the main lobby. Check-in was smooth and we were given the option of several rooms, and opted for one near the main lobby. Good choice, as for the most part evenings were quiet without any disruptions to our sleep. The person who checked us in was helpful and took the time to answer our questions regarding the property. Room The room itself was pretty spacious and the bathroom was huge. The carpets were worn, but the bed linens and mattresses seemed to be in good shape and were good quality. The bathroom was large, but it had a mildew smell to them and mildew stains in the shower grout. We fixed that by buying a bottle of bathroom cleaner with bleach and spraying it down the first few days we were there. Rooms were cleaned daily and the done at a satisfactory level. Pools There are a number of pools on the property and they are very nice. The problem is getting a chair(s) at the pool. The hotel seems like it allows anybody onto the property, and it appears that it does not have any controls over who can use the pools/facilities. If the hotel does have a policy for restricting the pool use to guests staying at the hotel, and/or their guests, it does not appear to enforce them. You can park your car in the parking lot, unload your car and head to the pool without showing proof that you are a guest.We observed cars that would pull into the parking lot. People would unload their vehicle with coolers and plastic bags with their personal items, and walk onto the hotel property without showing proof that they were staying at the hotel. There would be groups of these cooler people at the pool that would ambush chairs as soon as other guests picked up their towels and left. Before you know it, you had a large group with their own base camp that seemed to take over certain areas of the pool. There are better controls at public pools where you have to show ID or proof of residence or pay a small fee to use the facilities. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind knowing that anybody can just walk off the street and use the facilities without paying for them or being a guest of the hotel, then I guess you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be OK with this.This was similar to the water park. There didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be anybody enforcing whether you had a bracelet indicating that you paid for your water park visit. There seemed to be a number of people enjoying the water park with no wristbands. Hereto, you just walk from the pool, take a tram (where nobody checks your hotel guest card) and walk right into the water park. There is no gate, nobody checking whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a guest. Just walk right in and use the facilities. Again, there appeared to be little if any control as to who can use the facilities. We realized that after we paid and received our wristbands and were at the water park for an hour or so. The place where you paid for your wristband was located inside the park, and we had to search to find it.The only time we were asked to show proof that we were guests was when we charged food/services to our room, or when we boarded the ferry that took us to Palomino Island, the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private island beach. When we would validate our parking ticket, the valets would ask if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a guest of the hotel or a visitor. So they seemed pretty aware and accepting that visitors come to the hotel and use the facilities. By the way, they have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no cooler\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or outside food policy for Palimino Island. That is strictly enforced. We saw several people in line who had coolers were told that they could not bring them aboard the ferry. Even when you enter resort at the front gate, we were not required to show proof that we were guests of the hotel. Restaurants Restaurants are pricey and the food is average. Our first morning we ate breakfast at the one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153casual restaurants\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and selected the buffet. It was pretty straight forward something along the line of what I got as a complimentary breakfast at another hotel, except here you could have an omelet made for you. When I got the bill, it was close to $90 with tax and tip. That seemed a bit pricey for a breakfast buffet. $24 for adults and $12 for children.We ate at several other restaurants, and again the food was average, the service was slow and the prices were pretty steep for what you got in return. We ate lunches at the pool, and wound up going off property for dinner most evenings. Conclusion I do recommend the hotel with the caveats listed above. We booked this last minute, and it seemed like a logical choice since it is a Waldorf Astoria owned property. We spent a few nights at their flagship hotel in NYC and were very happy.

Pros: 1. stunningly beautiful views 2. easy one hour ride from San Juan 3. water park was a blast (3 slides, pools, pool \"river\") 4. Palomino Island is a private beach via 15 min ferry ride - quiet, plenty of chairs, activities for rental, bar and restaurant, umbrellas for rent, great for adults and kids. 5. staff was always friendly 6. rooms have quiet AC and are comfortable - great bathrooms, changing areas, balcony (Las Brisas wing) 7. Pools have towels and plenty of chairs/places in sun and shade 8. Outdoor cafe by lobby is the best restaurant - good pizza and more reasonably priced. 9. Plenty of activities offsite via the concierge 10. casino is small but $5 blackjack is fun 11. Starbucks onsite but expect lines in the morning Cons: 1. Skip the main restaurants - expect $40+ entrees and the food is good but not great. 2. Shops for snacks/food - everything twice the cost you'd pay at home. In fact, all of the restaurants and food items (ice cream, burgers, pizza, you name it - double the cost). 3. You need to rent a car to get off the island to hit local restaurants which we didn't do. 4. Main breakfast buffet is pretty good but $28 with tip per person for adults. 5. To get to the beach, you have to ride the funicular down to the marina, then catch the ferry which runs every 30 min - timing can be tricky, and if one of the funiculars are broken, you can wait in line. Not a bad thing, just be aware of this. 6. Everyone, I mean everyone, is from Massachusetts or Connecticut. I found that odd. 7. Service is slow (bars/restaurants) and they are pretty casual about having one person floating around with a tray by the pools. Tips: 1. rent a car and get the off property for a day - probably cheaper to do the rainforest excursion that way, or others. 2. Bring some wine/booze/snacks to your room (pack some for the trip) 3. Pack long pants as it can be breezy and cool there at night. 4. expect to spend $100 a day extra on top of what you've already paid (unless you are doing inclusive package) 5. If you are staying in separate rooms, make sure you are not separated by the funicular ride - this would be frustrating and can waste time. 6. A light breakfast at Starbucks is 1/3 the cost of the breakfast buffet. But doing the breakffast buffet allows you to skip lunch which can be convenient. 7.

While I agree with some other reviews that the property could use some updating here or there, it was obvious the rooms had already had some updating (minus the shower, but that was ok), plus it was such a nice, expansive property, it was easy to look past that. The views towards Palomino Island are just fabulous. We really didn't eat at the restaurants since our food was provided typically buffet style for a large group, but I'm sure it's a similar taste throughout the property, and everything we had was good. Did have a cheeseburger at the island restaurant one day when we wanted to hang out at the beach, and that was pretty good! Pricey, but it's what you would expect at a typical resort like this, so no shock there. While we did not come here this time with family like we normally would, I would not hesitate to come back as I think everyone would have fun, especially the kids. There was a waterpark to keep them occupied, plus various activities out at Palomino island like miniature golf, soccer, horseback riding, snorkeling, volleyball, etc etc. I also did not realize until the last evening that a little market area was not too far from the property, so next time I would probably venture off over there to check out the local restaurants too. We also golfed one day at the resort, and the course was beautiful (but very hilly!). The rental clubs were very nice too, which was great.

I'll tone that down just a tad though and say \"5 star name, 3.8 star hotel, 6 star restaurant prices\") Our family (myself, my wife and our 12 yr old daughter and 8 yr old son) just arrived home yesterday from 6 days at the El Conquistador. We had a wonderful time and overall I would recommend the hotel and I would stay there again. We had rented a car in San Juan (Enterprise) and drove the 50 minutes out to Fajardo. Highways are well marked; however, once you are off the main road use the GPS since there are few to no signs with road names. Back to the hotel...my only complaint is that the resort food is WAY (again, WAY) expensive. We had 2 meals at Cafe Caribe (dinner the night we arrived, and breakfast the next morning) but never ate on property again. Dinner (for what was basically cafeteria food) for the 4 of us was $100. Breakfast was $65. I'm sorry, but thats robbery. From then on we jumped in the car and drove a couple of minutes to a local Panaderia and each had eggs, toast, bacon and coffee/juice for $3.50/each. Breakfast pastries at the same place were 75 cents. We had lunch at stands or took sandwiches back to the hotel. The best meals we had were in Luqillo at the Kiosks. Terruno (I think #20) was the best, although Congas was just as good. We had dinner the last night at Metropol (Cuban) in Fajardo. The food was awesome and reasonable. I had the Fiesta Cubana platter $14 which sampled 7 or so of the favorite dishes. We were actually recommended to go to Boricuba, but found it dark, lonely and the parking lot overgrown like it had been derelict for years. Weird that the Concierge had recommended it as 'one of my favorites'. We had booked a garden room, but found that we had a beautiful view of El Yunque and also of the ocean out towards Luqillo over the golf course. Bonus. It was nice to have a patio/balcony with chairs which was a fav morning and late evening spot. There are so many different wings and levels to the hotel that its wise to look at the buildings and ask to be in a certain wing. We were in the Las Vistas wing which has direct access to the pools, spa and golf/tennis and is near the lobby. The trade-off is that we had a few minute walk to the funicular which takes you down to the marina for the boat to the island/beach. If you want to the close to the marina, ask for the Las Brisas or Las Olas, but of course then you will be walking to the pool or lobby. (although Las Olas has its own pool) Overall our room was clean and comfortable, and large. Other reviews said 'paper thin walls', which was not our experience. Our walls were concrete, but I think that review was the Las Brisas wing. We had 2 queen size beds, a reading chair with ottoman, desk with chair, TV console with drawers, and night stand with iPod dock. There was also a counter with coffee maker and small refridgerator. The closet is large and in the bathroom, which has a separate commode area. We rented a movie from the DVD machine near the Business Center one night ($5.45 rental). For some reason the TV then wouldnt go back to the regular TV channels and was stuck on AV2, but a call to guest services produced a 'technician' in about 10 minutes and he had it working in 2 minutes. The pool complex was wonderful. If you have kids the two pools in front of Las Vistas are the better ones. The upper pool (nearest the casino) gets more adult traffic as it has the swim-up bar and restaurant. A small inconvenience is that the only towel shack is at the upper pool, so one of us had to trek up and down the stairs for towels. We visited the beach on Palomino Island on 2 diff days. It is beautiful and the water was clear and warm. You can play mini-golf, sandbag toss, soccer, volleyball and basketball for free. Snorkel equip, tubes, jet skis etc are for rent. (we didnt and I dont know how much they were. Well, I think snorkels were $9). Horseback riding is $69 per person!! I'm sorry, but does that come with a steak dinner? I dont care if it is on a private island... The island also has a couple of gift shops where you can buy trinkets, sunscreen ($12/can), hats ($22), t-shirts, masks/snorkel ($22), and other sundry. Of course expect 'resort' pricing. We bought a few things the day before we left and on check-out I saw that the charge had shown up twice, so double-check your bill before you sign it. Self-park was easy. Drive in, push the button, get the ticket and park. Before you return to your car visit the parking counter and get your ticket 'validated' (aka. charged to your room). You have 20 minutes then to get to the car and put it in the machine on your way out of the parking lot. Lets see....what else? Starbucks is a busy place in the mornings, per usual anywhere. The little market next door is a ripoff. The other store closer to the lobby is slightly more reasonable. Wifi...worked great in the room, lobby and Starbucks. Nowhere else. Note: ATT and T-Mobile/Sprint are in-network in PR. Verizon is roaming, so pay up or turn it off and leave it in the room safe. Back to food for a sec...You can find a gillion places serving breakfast (desayunos) etc by going down to the entrance and make a left (Cabezas) and quick right (Avenida Conquistador). When you get to the 2 speed bumps turn left (still Ave Conquistador) and you'll see the Panaderia a couple of blocks down on your left. Otherwise, if you go past the Panaderia there is a Burger King another block down. BTW...for those daring enought to read this book I just wrote, order the PR Entertainment Book a week before you leave. For the $25 you will find restaurant coupons, rental car coupons etc. I used the Enterprise Double-Upgrade coupon and got a midsize, and we used about 3 other ones. The book paid for itself about 3 times over.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cFamily Vacation\u201d", "Author": "PaulDBoston", "ReviewID": "UR128106379", "Content": "I am writing this review on the 6th day of our 7 day stay. We were given a 2 bed room in the Marina, 2nd floor, ocean view. Overall we could not be any happier with the room location- it is in the heart of the action and quieter than being up above in the main resort. Travel to and from the main resort is a bit of a walk, but I have not found any difficulty as the two funicular cars are well timed so that the wait is no more than 5 minutes. Staying with the family including kids ages 6 and 9, I like the marina because it is near the Ballyhoo restaurant,which is one of the less expensive choices where most of the action is. It is also great for the kids to be at water level, so we can walk the marina and see the bots, easy access to the water park and there is a cafe take out breakfast, the ferry to the Palomino Island, shops, etc. There is really no reason for us to go up to the main resort except to check out different restaurants, pools, etc. My rating of this resort is broken down into three categories: good, bad and ugly as follows: Good: the location of this resort is truly unique; the views from the upper resort are like nowhere I have ever been, and from the marina at sea level it is outstanding as well. Overall, the property is older but well maintained, and efforts have been made to provide updates in key areas. The staff are generally helpful (see below for more on this). There is a lot going on at this resort, more than ample to fill a week for the family without becoming bored. Bad: When you travel to a resort, you know it will be expensive, with that said the prices of food and drinks at all restaurants are ridiculously high. My Wife believes this is necessary to fund the huge overhead of this property including the ferry to the island,and operating the island itself. I would strongly recommend family travelers rent a car at the airport, so that you can make a huge Wallmart run to stock up on necessities and be able to get out of the resort on occasion. Aside from prices, I have found some of the staff to be helpful, and others that could not be bothered. One example of this was my first experience with the concierge- upon check in I needed to quickly find a place to get the kids some lunch as we had been traveling since 5 AM, and by 3 PM they were really hungry. Overwhelmed with the many restaurant choices, I approached the concierge to ask for advice about a good place to eat, preferably something that would not take too long. The individual at the desk threw a binder of menus at me and said here you go. I asked several questions, and received little to no guidance; I felt that my request for help was inconveniencing this person as she was constantly checking her text messages. We ended up at the restaurant at the main pool and the service was horrible, it took about an hour and a half for a basic lunch. Fortunately, this was the most extreme example of bad service to date and since then things have improved. The Ugly: I was surprised to find an active water leak in the ceiling of the closet in our room, and active mold growth indicating this leak was not new. Called the operator to report the issue, and was met with the attitude that this was not a big deal. I explained the heath risks of mold to the individual, and was then transferred to a supervisor who said she would refer the concern to housekeeping for further review. When we returned to the room that evening, the mold had been removed but the leak continues several days later, causing us to leave this area free and clear of all personal items- not what you would expect at a 5 star resort. Summary: huge resort, very unique and special location. Very expensive; you will continuously pay every step of the way. WiFi does exist, but the bandwidth is so narrow that it is effectively not possible to get anything done- the speeds are slightly better than dial up. Some people here are very helpful, but overall the customer service attitude seems to be from ambivalence to please don't bother me, I am checking my text messages. I am giving 4 stars overall, but I think 3.5 is more accurate.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington Dc", "Title": "\u201cFive Star Name Three Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "MelDC", "ReviewID": "UR128064066", "Content": "My family and I spent 6 nights at El Conquistador over spring break . I had read many reviews prior to our visit on TA and most of them were spot on. We arrived early Monday afternoon and check in was a breeze. ROOM We had booked a room in the Las Olas section of the hotel. We chose to stay in Las Olas because the rooms are a bit more spacious than other parts of the hotel and this section also has its own pool which is nice if you have little ones and you want to avoid crowds. The room we were originally assigned was on the 3rd floor of Las Olas. We had a stroller for my son so the bellman suggested that we request a lower room in that section as there are no elevators in that part of the hotel. The front desk staff quickly obliged our request and we were taken on our way. The room had a king size bed and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bed which my daughter slept on. The room on the first floor of Las Olas had an obstructed view and the funicular stop was right off the balcony, which was extremely noisy. We requested a room change for the next day which we were granted. Carrying the stroller up the flights of stairs was a pain but worth it in the long run. The website says that the room has a mini fridge and neither room that we stayed in had one; also of note no minibar. Walls in the hotel are paper thin and hallways are noisy so if you are a light sleeper you may want earplugs. The air conditioning sounds like a 747 taking off each time it comes on. If you have a baby know that the hotel provides (for a fee) pack and plays as opposed to cribs. It had almost no padding on the bottom so it feels like your baby is sleeping on a board. Maid service was a bit frustrating. Most days we left our room around 9am and returned at 4 to a room that had not been serviced. FOOD My husband and I often comment that on vacation our worst and most expensive meals are the ones we had at the hotel. We ate at the hotel our entire stay. The prices are in line with every place we have been. The food is OK\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6nothing great nothing horrible. I would say avoid Blossoms if you can. It was strange because some meals seemed to take far too long and others were rushed, no consistency but exactly what I expected. If you want a quiet meal do not eat on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patio\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Italian restaurant. There is a piano in the area and every parent seems to think it is darling when their snowflake pounds away on the thing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6its not cute or endearing, it is annoying and I say this as someone with two children. One of the most frustrating aspects of the trip was the Starbucks; the line was well over a half hour long each day. This was not due to the number of people, as my Starbucks has a line out the door every day and I am always out in no more than 10 minutes, it is just the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153island time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attitude. GROUNDS For the most part the hotel grounds are very nice. Here and there you see wear and tear. We did not find the funicular as annoying as other reviewers. By staying in the Las Olas section you can actually walk down to the Marina level, so you only need the funicular when going up to the main hotel. The week we were there the hotel was full and most of the time we did not feel any crowding. My husband golfed and said the course was well maintained. We were not as impressed with Palomino as other reviewers. It was a bit of a pain to take the boat over with a 5 month old, get there and have to set up your spot. Once you are there you kind of have to make a day of it since the getting there is at a minimum 30-45 minutes by the time you board the boat and ride over (not to mention the waiting in line). We did the waterpark one day, which my 6 year old loved. I do think the charge for it was a bit much considering it only had 3 slides; one days admission should be included as part of the resort fee. The hotel had a scavenger hunt game set up for kids while we were there. The kids had to collect bands from different locations at the hotel. Each location had a fact about Puerto Rico or something unique to see. My daughter loved the game and it was a great way to see and learn about the entire resort. Overall, if this was a Hilton I would say the trip was a success. By putting the name Waldorf Astoria on the hotel, I expect more as far as the staff anticipating my needs. I would expect a first rate experience and things like room and beach service, neither of which were available. We found most of the people on staff to be very nice and accommodating of our requests but some of the things should have been standard given they we were supposedly staying at a high end hotel.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cI feel El Conned!\u201d", "Author": "Allwitty", "ReviewID": "UR128025398", "Content": "My review in three words: not so much I'm writing this review from the confines of the thin walls in my Las Brisas room. I don't even know where to begin. This hotel is an utter disappointment. It's so dreadful it's inspired my first tripadvior.com review. I absolutely regret making the decision to stay here. Three more words: Dirty, dirty, dirty There are dirty carpets all over the second floor of Las Brisas and the lobby. Coincidentally, these are the only two carpeted areas I've been in. We entered our room and found hairs in the sink, and on the floor, and on the bed, and in the tub... I had to stop looking. Walls are cracked, water damaged, and rooms are appointed with dingy furniture. Forgetful Food Fail Get the service straight first, worry about the crust later! They never put my daughter's steak order in at dinner tonight. So my son, my husband and I were all served our meals while my wide eyed daughter wondered where her dinner was. 20 minutes after our dinners show up, hers finally makes an appearance. No apology from the server, nada. This happened while we sat next to some sort of manager meeting where they discussed improvements that could be made to the pizza crusts served at the retaurant. Erm... Why not focus on service first guys? Then focus on minutia later. It's surprising that this is a Waldorf. I should check the spelling on the signage here. Maybe I'm at a Waldorph-Asstoria and not an authentic Waldorf-Astoria. If this is not a knock-off Waldorf-Astoria there are Walsorfs and Astors doing 360's in their graves right now. More negatives: This place needs a serious update. The funicular is more like the scaryicular. The ride is rickety and rusty. I don't mind waiting for it as long as it's safe! I mentioned the dirty part already right? The bathroom/closet combination does not work for me at all. You have to walk through the bathroom to get to the closet. Most architects will say you don't want to have to go through a wet area to get to a dry area. This place looks cheap, feels cheap, with a not-so-cheap price tag. To be fair some positives There are a lot of amenities. From Starbucks to a shoe store this place is loaded with amenities. Fortunately the Starbucks and retail shops are not as ramshackle as the rest of the hotel. The pools are nice. But, that reminds me of another negative. $70 for a family of 4 to ride on three watersides and a lazy river makes me feel so used, especially after shelling out a fair share of cash for a dismal dorm of a room. Oh! I just thought of another positive! The view from my ocean front room is nice. Will I return? Just one word for this one, NO! I cannot believe that this is a $500 per night room.

Strip House was delicious, and was where we dined more frequently, partly due to the absence of children. There are no adult-only areas, which was probably the biggest disappointment. Palomino Island was quite nice, however it somewhat cumbersome to get over there. On our first night there, we took a taxi into town and bought food, liquor, and beer for our lunches & snacks, which saved a lot of cash and no one at the resort seemed to care. Near the resort, there is a small fishing village and park (an easy 10-15 minute leisurely walk). We walked there to eat at some local places, as the resort didn't provide much of a cultural experience in the way of food, or anything else. We also did a bioluminescent bay kayak tour (not resort-sponsored) that departed from the pier in the village. Even walking there at night, we felt pretty safe.

THE GOOD The view is incredible and our room at the marina was clean and comfortable. The waterpark is a lot of fun for the kids (ages 11 and 13) and for me as well. The main pool up top is a typical big resort pool with swim up bar and a nice water volleyball pool. There are plenty of lounge chairs at both and friendly staff. The beach is a 30minute trip each way counting wait time but is a nice beach with plenty of trees for shade and decent snorkeling just off the beach. We scuba dived and the staff was friendly and competent. They have an ice cream shop at the main resort that was great for the kids and plenty of little tourist shops that cover anything you forget and make it easy to get gifts. The workout facility in the spa is top notch bit ironically the only place the staff isn't friendly. Overall the staff is solid to good. THE NOT SO GOOD The restaurants are way over priced even for a resort. My wife and the kids and i split two entrees and had two appetizers my wife and I had two beers each and the bill was $260 enough said. The vehicular which connects the main resort to the water park/ marina etc.,. breaks way too often. On two of my three trips it's been down and it's a major hassle. They charge to use the water park, there is a $38 per day resort fee and on checkout there where things on my bill that were not mine. At the beach it costs $15 per person for mask and fins and the worker left it closed for 45 minutes with an \" out to lunch\" sign. RECOMMENDATIONS Rent a car from enterprise and park it for free in their lot (otherwise its another $20 per day to park) and go to one of five or six restaurants within 5 minutes that are pretty good and while not cheap cost $90 to $125 for dinner for four with two people getting a couple drinks each. Get a room in the marina that way you are near the waterpark and transport to the beach. Buy a case of beer/ water and soft drinks on your way there or be prepared to pay another $50 a day for incidentals. This trip costs me a thousand per day with airfare so I wasn't trying to be cheap but I also saw no need to spend another $200 per day on dinner/ beer and soft drinks. My family loved the trip and we will go back so it was worth it.

My first night at the hotel they put us in the oldest part of the hotel unrenovated and built in the 60's. With my children I was frustrated by the service and was told by the person who checked me in that they were filled above capacity and I get what I get basically. I threatened to leave the hotel and call my credit card company to dispute the charges as it was the room was not what I paid for and they changed me to an 80's style room. That was better but OMG the bathroom was sooo outdated. I had so many problem rooms keys didnt work, $70+ for every meal including breakfast. And every 1 out of 3 hotel workers were rude. I finally got a car to bring down the costs for food and I also felt isolated by the location since I could not walk anywhere near the hotel and found this was the best way to really enjoy PR without spending another $1500 to eat which is what I would of spent for me and my 2 9 year olds. The service is soo subpar, no waiter service or bar service by all the pools and they use some kind of trolley to get up and down the mass resort which breaks down every 24hrs while packing 20 pp in a trolley at time a time like sardines. The only good part of the hotel is that it is in a beautiful location, it has lots of little shops, wifi all over the property, and a variety of restaurants (since there is no way to get around by a car) to help ease the tension of feeling as if you are on a deserted island. They also have a beautiful island called Palomino where you can take advantage of the water sports and beach (no beach on the main property major bummer!) the only problem you have to take a ferry that only runs from 9-5:30p missed that boat and you are literally stranded on a desert island. Unfortunately the beach is not that big so you really have to find a place to stretch out. But it was better than nothing.

This hotel lacks all three. The hotel used to be Wyndham and that is what it should be, or even better a Hilton. Rent a car in San Juan and drive to the resort, when you get to Fajardo you have no clue that the resort even exists as you drive through a neighborhood. Once you are at the hotel property you feel safe and shelterd from the outside world of Fajardo. We stayed in a 2 bedroom at the Las Casitas which are more like apartments adjacent to the main hotel which is a 5 minute walk. We spent most of our time at the El Conquistador which is the central hub for all activities. The hotel needs a major facelift and updates. The main pool looks like it is still from the 1960's, the cabana's are an embarassement and very outdated. If you are going to associate the Waldorf name to the hotel then it needs to be Waldorf quality which the main pool is not. The Las Casitas main pool is newer and looks over a cliff and has a negative edge pool which is exclusive for only people staying at Las Casitas. The main lobby of the hotel is not bad, the best things about it are a Starbucks Coffee shop (slow service) and the ice cream shop for the kids. The Caribe restaurant is horrible, not owned by the hotel, poor food, poor service and very expensive. The Strip House upstairs was the best restaurant we ate at and this is what you would expect from a Waldorf property, only if everything else would emulate the Strip House at the resort. It is a long walk to the tram to take you down the hilll to the water park and the boat to Palomino Island. There is no beach on the hotel site, you need to take the boat to Palomino Island, actually it was a relaxed environment, the beach was nice, water good. You need to pay for everything once you are there, snorkel equipment, horseback riding, jet skiing, etc...it adds up. The waterpark has 3 slides and a lazy river. I was very upset when I had to pay to use the waterpark for my family of 5. It was almost a $100, eventhough I am a hotel guest paying over $600 for a two bedroom casita, I though it was very tacky. I have stayed at the Waldorf in Maui (Grand Wailea) and they do not charge for the slides and niether does Atlantis. The tram broke down on several occassions and we had to wait to get back to the top of the resort which was very annoying. The capacity on the two cars is limited compared to the size of the hotel, I suggested that they build some stairs to the top, I would walk them everytime. When I checked out, there was a 14% resort fee charged per day, I was shocked and upset and told the manager the most I have ever paid at a resort was $25, this is highway robbery. I do not like being taken advantage of especially when they charge you to use the water park and nickel and dime you for everything else. The best deal at the resort is the Starbucks. A few more things, the pizza at the restaurant by the pool is horrible, it tasted like frozen pizza you buy at the store. They really need to improve the food quality for what they charge if the hotel is going to be called a Waldorf property. Something that stood out, when you go to a high end resort in the tropics you expect tropical fruits, etc...so I want to order a bananc smoothine and I asked if they use real bananas for the drink and they said not we use a syrup mix, that was a big turn off right there. The resort is good for kids, a lot of activities and entertainment for them, but don't expect a Waldorf experience.

Good burgers by the pool (Virgin Burger). Great Steaks at the Strip House and Great Fish and Wine at Stingrays. The service at all the places was very good. Now, the downsides: - the interior is a dump -- putting it mildly. We had a leak from the ceiling. I tried calling for repair, but our room phone didnt work. A quick call on my cell and the leak was fixed but a mess was left behind. I thought, no biggie -- we'll call housekeeping --- but the problem was our room phone still didnt work....followed by our patio door being stuck on the open position...etc, etc. - the furnishings were scratched, torn, stained, etc. - maid service was unreliable. Called for evening turndown service each night (once they fixed the phone) -- zero for five on that front. - the funicular + ferry to private island gets old really fast. The first day its fun. But, as soon as one funicular breaks (which happened) and one ferry doesnt show for 45 minutes (which also happened), it becomes a nightmare. Long lines without the protection of shade isnt fun. - Wifi doenst work. Even though they tell you there is no problem and that no one else complained, everyone we asked said the same thing. (They are very quick to collect the 14pct \"resort\" fee which includes the wifi and funiculsr/ferry service, but not so quick to provide reliability in these paid-for services) - front desk service which is indifferent and has no regards for guests.

They are in heaven here. Patricia checked us in and was amazing!! The property is lucky to have her!! Our room was great again as it was in the Las Brisas tower. We were in room 3432 which overlooked the Marina and water park. We also had a view on Palomino Island(the private island) and on a clear day we could see all the way to Vieques Island. This year all the nicer restaurants on property were better than last year which when staying on property and eating with our kids was a nice surprise. We had one minor issue with the Bio Bay tour that we booked through the concierge for my oldest son and I. My son had been looking forward the tour for the better part of the year....since our last trip. We booked it as soon as we got to the property and had received multiple confirmations from the concierge. On the evening that we were supposed to go we drove down to where we leave from and they initially didn't have our reservation and all of the sudden they had it but at a later time...NOT the one that was confirmed. We could not do the later time. My son was devistated to say the least. I had not seen him this upset in a long time...having looked forward to this for the better part of a year. We went back to the hotel and went to the concierge to voice our displeasure. We ended up speaking to BOTH Manny and Victor who promised they would do all they could to maybe get us on the tour the next day to which we said Great! It would make my sons day and most likely his trip! The next day he wanted me to keep going to the room to see if we got any messages. In the latter half of the day we got one and he was so excited! BUT to out avail it was only an automated apology for a fire alarm. I used to work in the hospitality industry. We all know where a lack of communication gets us BUT to say something and NOT follow through at all is rather pathetic. Maybe they thought my son being so upset and the mishap was just a joke but to us it was not. Their lack of a response says a lot about how much this issue meant to them and their professionalism as a whole. All they had to do was let us know that they could not do anything and I could have given my son an answer.

We did get to relax at the waterpark as the boys ran around and around the lazy river finding little friends to play with......also at Palamino Beach when they snorkeled and found shells. The cost for meals, drinks, and stuff is not that outragious when you compare it to other resorts such as this. The cocktails are a bit weak at the pools, however. We stayed in the Las Brisas room which was in the middle of everything so was very convenient to go either direction of the resort. The funicular (both) ran fine. The rooms were a definetly \"used\".

The sand was very rough but the scenery made up for it! The food at the resort was nothing to write home about. I thought the prices were excessive (e.g. we bought 4 juice based non-alcoholic drinks - $24) but we were at a resort. The golf course was beautiful, although we did not play.

We had initially planned to spend the day in Old San Juan and then drive to the El Conquistador resort right around check-in (4). We called ahead and the folks there told us to come on by, register and partake in the amenities while we wait for the room. Thankfully, the room was ready right when we arrived! After a turbulent flight with 3 and 5 yr olds, there was nothing better than entering our own private room then off to the pools! We had acquired a Las Brisas Ocean View room, as this was the most recommended by other travelers here on tripadvisor, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! Our room was close to everything! The funicular was one floor down and the casino/restaurants/front desk was all on premises. The main pool was here too! Palomino Island - is a beautiful island, private and only accessible via ferry. The lines for the ferry can be very long, especially after 11a, but if you're on one of the late ferries, your day at the beach won't be as good. Try to get out on the 10a ferry. That way you can find a set of chairs under palm trees. The umbrellas are $11/ea, but you do get them the entire day. The cabanas are $20, but you can only squeeze two chairs underneath, and there's no breeze. The shaded spots under the trees are definitely the way to go. If you want water sports, you'll have to arrive early and reserve. Jet skis and 3 man kayaks seemed to have long lists. El Coqui Water park - fantastic time with the kids! The zero entry pool and baby slide is perfect for those kids who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tall enough to play on the bigger slides or go to the deep end (3'6\"). Only gripes I have with this place are that they charge hotel guests - something I thought they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do, and it appears that they let non-hotel guests enter. The place got really crowded and rowdy. It was so rowdy and inappropriate for toddlers, that by 2pm we left. Camp Coqui - My kids loved the night camp while mom and dad went out and enjoyed a quiet dinner at the strip house. Even though we're back home, my kids still plead to go back to Camp Coqui. Now for the not-so-nice stuff. They charge for EVERYTHING. Fridge? $20/night. Valet? $20/day. Water Park? $80 for a family of four. The prices for food and drinks are also very expensive. $17 for a bowl of cereal via room service, or $7 if you want to eat it in the restaurant downstairs. They give you these charge cards and if you're not careful you'll easily ring up thousands of dollars in charges like we did over our 5 day stay. Everything from overpriced sun block, to a $400 dinner at Stingray, to $500 in drinks for 2 for 5 days!! Obviously, we splurged. So my tips to have a great time at El Conquistador are to do the following: - Splurge on the Las Brisas room - Purchase your own alcohol at one of the various shops on the way to the resort - While renting a car may sound cheaper than paying for the bus transfer, after everything it really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. If you wish to explore the area, take cabs. - Eat at La Estacion. It's a stones throw from the entry gate. IT opens at 5, and you'll need a reservation if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there early enough. The ribs are fantastic, as is the whole red snapper - Take a cab to the bioluminescent bay; it's the same bay you can see from your window if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying on the north side of Las Brisas. There are a bunch of waterfront places to grab snacks and beer. - The water park is good, but Palomino Island is better and free - Bring water-shoes for Palomino Island. The coral/rocks are sharp and abundant. - Buy your supplies at Walgreens on RT 3 rather than packing it or buying it on the resort - water, milk, sun block, booze, snacks, etc - DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES, or Delta. They both charge you for checked bags! AA's staff were rude and the seats were uncomfortable. And some things we were worried about after reading some of the reviews here which didn't pan out are: - The funicular isn't really that bad. The express side takes you up and down in a couple minutes. It's also air-conditioned. - The local town is pretty run down and not easy to get around if you don't have a car or have a taxi waiting for you - While PR is a US territory, the further you get away from the larger cities, the less english people tend to speak. In conclusion, we had a great time! But we would probably not be going back again. The 1hour drive from San Juan, coupled with cost of everything didn't seem worth it. If we are to go back to PR again, it'll be for the port on our way to a cruise. For the price we paid for everything on this vacation, we could've easily had a suite on a 7 night Caribbean cruise!", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cdestination wedding\u201d", "Author": "c t", "ReviewID": "UR127497093", "Content": "I just watched a video of a family wedding I attended on nov 12 2011.We had a group of 90 people!!

It was great. First off, like all the other reviews note, the property location and views are fantastic. Perched on a the cliff, one can see Vieques, a string of other islands and water water everywhere. Let's start with the rooms. They were spacious, clean and well-tended. The \"turn down\" service was a nice touch. The bathrooms and walk-in closet were good. (We wish the door to the closet was off of the room and not the bathroom, but that's a minor point.) We had a room overlooking the water and that was spectacular. (The balcony railing was high enough that we didn't worry about the kids.) We were relatively close to the funicular (see below), and that meant we could hear the cars coming up and down. That wasn't ideal, but it actually didn't disturb us. I could see it bothering a light sleeper, though. I won't repeat what lots have writen, but there is no beach there, one has to take the ferry to a private island. And to get to the ferry, we had to take the funicular down the hill. If you are in a rush, it's not ideal. If the journey is part of the experience, then it's fun. We went to/from the island on 3 different days and loved the boat and the ride (just 15 mins). Ferry runs allegedly every hour, but it seems to go more frequently. Both of the funiculars worked the entire time (except one morning one was out of service). The longest wait we ever had was 5 minutes. The island (Palomina) is great. Basically its own beach resort. Hundreds of chairs. (never a problem). Horseback riding (both kids did it and loved it.). Kakays and snorkeling rentals. Water is very warm and very shallow. Soccer field. Basketball court. Several bars. Low-key outdoor food spot (surprisingly not shockingly overpriced -- kids burger and hotdog around $6. Adult sandwiches and salads between $10-14. Drinks weren't crazy.) Mini-golf. Horseshoes. Basically, you could go to the island at 9 am and be there until 5 and have LOTS to do. Back at the resport, there are several pools. Nothing fancy or special. Three hottubs, all good. Poolside bars, never waited for a drink. There are a number of restaurants on site. We ate at the hibatchi one, the fish one by the marina and the italian one. They were more expensive than the norm, for sure, but definitely not unreasonably crazy overpriced. We never did the buffet or big breakfast, we just got oatmeal or a breakfast sandwich from Stabucks. Food was fine, nothing special. ALWAYS kids options, which was very nice. And the wait staff were pleasant and we always could get a seat. The casino was small -- there are 1cent slot machines which was funny. There are 2 arcades for the kids. There were lots of shops, and stores at multiple levels. Ultimately one never had to leave the premises. BUT WE DID. And, frankly, the best part of our visit were the off-site trips we took. First, we went to the Rain Forest (El Yunque). It happened to be pouring when we went, but it was still fun. We had rented a car, so we drove ourselves and did it solo (didn't go through the hotel or tour). It couldn't have been easier. The drive to the Rain Forest is 25 minutes from the hotel. We stopped at the visitors center and got maps and saw a little movie, all worth it. The driving through the forest is windy, but very easy. Don't picture a difficult drive, rather just a slower windy drive. We stopped along the way for pictures. We did a 2 hour hike to Britton Tower in the rain, which was not particularly challenging but great for the kids. BUT YOU MUST STOP AND EAT AT THE LOCAL DIVE JOINT AT THE 7km mark. It looks sketchy, but the food was divine and authentic and local! No joke, best meal we had. Even the kids thought it was great. One night we did the 8:30 pm kayak trip of the bio luminescent bay. We did not do the hotel tour, but instead had the concierge arrange it through \"Kayak Rentals\". These tours leave about 10 minutes from the hotel, so VERY EASY to get there (our car; but could easily have cabbed or they will pick you up). It cost $45 per person and lasted 2 hours. It was amazing. Truly. It was pitch black,except for the water, which lit up the entire time. Our guides knew enough to educate us, but it was more about the unique experience. Again, our young kids loved it and wanted to return the next night. We ate dinner down by the water at EL RACAR, another local joint that was excellent. (The following night we ate at a local joint called Popeyes -- think sailor, not fried chicken -- which wasn't as good and the service was terrible.) Both of these are authentic, local food. Outdoor seating only. A handful of tables. Definitely not fancy. But good grub and a great alternative from the hotel. We highly recommend this property and the activities.

So, when I heard that the hotel had been bought by Waldorf Astoria, I thought it was the perfect time to stay at El Conquistador. Well, let me tell you...it's no Waldorf Astoria! If the parent company has put a dime into the hotel, it doesn't show. The furniture in the lobby looks like mismatched pieces from your grandmother's attic; the hotel annexes, which were added on in the 50s and 60s, are straight out of \"Mad Men\" and, at the very least, need to be re-stuccoed to cover the wear and tear of the past fifty years; the guest rooms, while quite spacious, are in desperate need of redecorating. Basically, it looks as if the Waldorf merely added a little paint and some new carpeting and called it a day. The hotel needs a $20 million makeover for sure! And let's not forget the service...or lack there of. Forget having anyone come around to bring you a drink at the pool. Ha! There was no pool or beach service at all. And towels were almost impossible to find. At a Waldorf, I would have expected towels laid out on every chair and servers circulating with drink orders. Isn't that how resorts make their money? And speaking of beach chairs, the chaises at the beach were abominable! Old, uncomfortable plastic mesh chairs, many of which were broken. Oh, I could go on. The only thing that was consistent with the Waldorf name was the cost, especially for the food (which was truly mediocre and exhorbitantly overpriced).

We brought our two teenage sons ages 17 and 13. We rented a car and drove from the airport which took about an hour. We have visited Puerto Rico before and stayed at the Rio Mar. I liked this resort better, it felt more friendly and the location was fantastic. The resort has the most beautiful views, it is sited on a large cliff with multiple buildings layered down the hill. We stayed at the bottom at the Marina location in a unit which was right on the water with views of Palomino Island which is where you ferry to the beach. The lobby is on the top of the hill/cliff where most of the restaurants, shops and entertainment venues are. The ferry to the beach at Palomino Island is right at the Marina location which is where we stayed. If you stay in the upper level buildings you have to take the funicular (tram) down to get to the ferry. It could take up to 20 minutes if there are people waiting in line. We really liked the location because we could jump right on the ferry (which leaves every 1/2 hr or so) to get to the beach. Also, the water park is right at the Marina. Our boys loved the water park and spent a lot of time on the slides there. You have to pay extra for the park but it provided major entertainment. We ate at the Marina restaurant several times and it was a decent place to get a burger or salad. We bought breakfast food and snacks at the nearby grocery to keep in our room because we didn't want to take the time to sit at breakfast nor pay the high prices. We also purchased wine so we could have a drink in the room. We snorkeled off the other side of Palomino Island using the boat company that picks up right at the Marina. I didn't think it was worth the $60 because the snorkeling off the beach at Palomino was better. I have read on this site that some people feel the property is in need of repairs. Really, the only thing that I noticed was a few cracks in the concrete and other than that I didn't see anything else. The rooms were comfortable and clean. They felt like a room at an island resort, not antiseptic and perfect like a high end NYC hotel. I loved the room, it was spacious and has a small fridge, coffee maker and a nice large bathroom. People also wrote that the trek back and forth from lobby to marina was a hassle. I could see that if you were staying on the upper levels and were excited about getting to the beach and had to wait for the elevator, tram etc. it could get annoying especially if you had little kids with you. If you want to avoid that, stay on the Marina and you will only have to wait for the tram etc.. when you are going up to the lobby. There is a small coffee shop/restaurant at the Marina so you don't have to go to the lobby to get food or drink. Just a side note, we noticed a lot of small kids (under 10) and not that many teens. At any rate, there was lots to do to keep teens busy and entertained between trips up to the lobby, water park, beach and off site trips. We didn't see everything in the four nights we stayed.

And can not believe Hiltons name is on it! As diamond members we have stayed in several wonderful Hilton hotels. I was very excited about this trip and looks so pretty. Yes the views are great but come at a price. And the beach is private and very nice however is a 8 min ride there and the ferry only goes till 330 pm over and a 5 pm return. So there are no late walks on the beach and if you wanted to run to the room for something forget it. Also the resort is very large and takes you a five min.walk And a fun ride on the funicular to either a pool or ferry depending on where your room is located. Which brings me to the next point. There are only 2 of these funiculars and one was not working for 2 days people waited in lines for 15 min or better. Not fun and when you are wanting to get the the ferry that leaves ever 30 min. Good luck! The room was old and had mildew on the walls and on vinyl head board. The views were beautiful but again at a price and not worth it! The concierge was awful to say the least. Not at all helpful. And when we had her book our spa day she totally screwed it up. The one thing we had her do and she couldn't even get that right after telling her twice. We finally used our iPad on the deck because you can not get Internet in your room, to book other things. The restraints and bars were all horrible no one can make a drink right or consistent. And when we complained we we told there is nothing they can do because the restraints bars etc. Were rented spaces and that they are not linked to the Hilton hotel. To me Hilton should hold a standard that all must meet to \"rent\" a space. This hotel is far from anything and are stuck eating there. Prices a resort prices and would gladly pay IF it was resort standards. Did visit the spa and salon to get pedis and massages. The pedis were not that great and cost 3xs I could have paid at the mall for a much better one. The people at the spa were not that welcoming and felt rushed. Again not what you want on vacation and paying a lot for these services. The breakfast was pretty good and had a wide selection however, this was complimentary due to having a diamond status. Otherwise it was $25 a pice. And not worth it in my opinion. Overall I was not happy with this hotel and will be writing the Hilton hotels as well. Very expensive and not worth it. Go stay at the sister hotel in San Juan el San jaun I think...

Second night we called and the hotel sent someone to fix it in less than 5 minutes (great and very impressive!!!!) but still it was just better. Also I have a baby girl with a stroller, wouldn't be nice for the front office person to give us the option of a room where we could get to using an elevator???

We were so frustrated, tired and dying to finally get to the room, that we didn't even complained.

With that in mind...when I walked into this hotel at sunset it actually took my breath away for a second. The hotel is perched on a hillside overlooking the Caribbean sea and it is, well, breathtaking. The hotel was supposedly booked while we were there, yet it felt half-empty. The grounds are so expansive with so many different pools and gardens and balconies and dining options that we had tons of privacy including several hot tub dips just the two of us. The food at La Piccola Fontana was excellent. The other food was overpriced and left a bit to be desired, but I am a foodie and pretty tough to please in these matters (lived in the East and then West Village...very spoiled). The room service, however was excellent. We were in a corner room with a large balcony at the pier right on the water, and whenever we requested anything (toothpaste, razor, water bottles, etc.), it arrived within 3-5 minutes. The two potential drawbacks of this resort: The tram and the boat. So, the Tram was definitely a detractor given that we were staying down by the water and had to make it up to the main resort for the complimentary breakfast every day. If not for that, we would have just eaten at the coffee shop or restaurant at the pier for breakfast and the tram would have been less annoying. But it really was a 12 minute endeavor to get from our room to the front desk. The boat, on the other hand, we loved. We felt so relaxed on the Palomino Island beach (which was also expansive and not the least bit crowded). There was something nice about knowing we were committed to relaxing there and wouldn't be heading up to the room to make work calls/check email/get that extra wrap, etc. We took kayaks out for a small fee to another little island and there were only about 5 people on the whole island. It was a romantic and special beach day. I also got a Swedish massage at the spa--one of the best Massages I've ever had. My quads were pretty tight going in and she loosened everything up. The gym is worth the twenty bucks (we got it free for being Diamond Rewards, but it would be worth it). There are private jacuzzis and a tea room and it is very serene. The gym is weak, none of the latest cardio equiptment, adequate weights and cables. The grounds and the beach and the service are really the sellers here. Just walking around the property made us so happy, and they helped us arrange our visit to the Rainforest and with everything else we needed. Being on such a high cliff over the ocean all alone (and you really can be all alone at this resort) was just what the doctor ordered. On a whole, this was a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend it. We also stayed at the W Viequez which was wholly different, and I will write a review of that as well.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best spots in PR!\u201d", "Author": "axenrodr", "ReviewID": "UR126698675", "Content": "Let me begin this review by way of my background of PR. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been vacationing in PR for over 25 years (as a kid with my family and now as a parent with my wife and kids) and have stayed (at one time or another) at every one of PR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luxury resorts across the island, as well as neighboring Vieques. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at the El Conquistador several times before, but it seems to get better with each stay. First, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on the grounds\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much more unique! Most of the PR (or for that matter, Caribbean) resorts are built around a golf course. The El Con has a spectacular golf course, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the thing that sets it apart. The hotel is built into the side of a cliff overlooking the sea, so views from just about anywhere in the hotel are spectacular (nothing but blue water for as far as you can see). The hotel itself is big and spread out, which generally I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a fan of. But in the case of the El Con, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the usual convention center feel. I attribute this to two main factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the room (or area of the hotel we stayed in) and the staff. On the room or area, we stayed in the Marina area, with an incredible ocean front room. The view was spectacular and we literally found all that we needed down at the Marina \u00e2\u20ac\u201c breakfast for the kids, evening cocktails before dinner. The room itself was incredible. Large, modern, clean, good sized bathroom with closet/dressing area inside, great water pressure in the shower, and an enormous patio area. Oh, almost forgot, and a bed and pillows as comfortable as home\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The room was steps from the Ferry to the beach (El Con has a private beach that is accessed by 10 min boat ride from the Marina) and the Water Park (which my kids are in love with). The couple of things that you are lacking down at the Marina is nightlife (other than one outdoor bar and Sting Ray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant) and regular pool. We preferred the water park pool, which is great for adults too, but if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not your thing, you need to go up to the main hotel pool up top, which we did one day. The second thing that in my opinion sets the El Con apart is the staff. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy for a hotel of this size (capable of hosting conventions of 1000+ attendees), with the amount of staff that they have to train and maintain, to feel a bit impersonal, but we did not find that to be the case at all. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with a warm welcome by Areliz at the Front Desk. As an aside, Areliz was also the person that checked us out at the end of our stay, and without me saying a word when I walked up to the front desk, she recalled the rooms we were staying in and greeted me by name. Mind you, I had not seen her since we checked in 4 days earlier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just one anecdotal example of the personalized feel of the service. Other members of staff that I want to recognize are Jose Gonzalez, the bellman that helped with our luggage and made sure our car was always cooled and ready when we needed; Lisandra and Alexandra checking us in each day at the water park; the housekeeping staff, the room service staff, beach staff, the ferry staff, the bartender at Ballyhoo Bar and the Matre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d at Sting Ray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. All in my opinion went above and beyond to make our stay incredible. But above all, I want to recognize Mr. Melendez the hotel assistant manager, whom I had opportunity to meet during my stay. I am a firm believer that in all organizations, but particularly a service focused, hospitality organization, the tone of the staff and the service that they provide is set by the management, and in my humble opinion he is the source of this incredible guest focused service.

Around 5:30PM we really needed to get ready for dinner so we head back to the desk. Room was ready they just didn't call even though there was no one waiting at the front desk and more than 3 agents. After check in our room view was amazing so I forgot about the wait. We were located at the main building; you can not beat this location same floor as the main pool so no stairs no elevators needed. Also not that close to the \"funicular\"; still you can hear it at night. (nothing to worry) Rooms - T.V. is a joke in this hotel... you have a huge room and a small T.V. I can say was no more than 22\"; After the casino, the pools you want to relax and watch some T.V.; I used my Ipad since the T.V. was really small. (my only complaint about the room) Housekeeping did a great job; extra towels, extra amenities, fridge in room, coffee all the amenities you expect from a Waldorf. I must recognize Juanita from housekeeping since I had a small problem with the bathtub and the bathroom door. She immediately called engineering and when I came back everything was fixed. When I saw her in the hallway she mention to me was fixed already. I was really impressed since she took that extra second to showed me she really cared. Palomino Island was amazing. You must be ready to spent some money in the island since you are going to be hungry and thirsty. Water sports, beach sports, horseback riding... so many things to do and so little time... Water park - is perfect for all ages! However, if you are traveling with small kids go after 1:30PM & if you are traveling without go after 4PM; even though park close at 5:30PM 1 hour for adults jumping around is plenty of time. My two children had a blast including me! Pools - So many to choose from; I love Olas second level... private and secluded if traveling without children! Wi-Fi - \"free\", worked fine; part of the resort tariff tax... almost all hotels in Puerto Rico charged it! Breakfast - Noel from Brisas did an amazing job! We had the buffet the first morning, then we tried the restaurant in front of the casino...service was O.K. not compared to Brisas... Restaurants are expensive; however you are in a resort!.... still I do not understand why people complaint about paying for food. If you want cheap food go outside the hotel so many great options. I worked for the hotel industry and El conquistador had a lot to offer... they have the beautiful grounds, the pools, the spa, the facilities... However, the only department I can recognize going the extra mile, that \"wow\" factor I was looking for is the Bellman Services... every time I walked by the lobby, hallways, funicular they were attentive a simple \"good morning\" can make a difference... a lot of the employees I encounter looked a the floor; kind of \"do not asked me anything\"; that really took me for surprise... Front desk needs a lot to improvement in this aspect; they are submerged in paperwork; they only looked at the computer, no eye contact and barely interacted with you and if you ask a few questions, a few of them looked angry or \"non-approachable\" at times. Check in and check out was kind of difficult... a lot of time (remember people big hotel a lot of rooms)... Recommendation for hotel management... send the copies of the check out folios under the door; have an express check out box somewhere around the lobby or desk... that will help you with the lines. I really did not needed to stop at the desk, but needed to check the charges before going home. If you are planning to leave the resort to explore around rent a car. Almost all hotels in Puerto Rico charge parking so be ready to paid and do not complaint about fee. I highly recommend this hotel.

Having to use the funicular is a little inconveinent. When both are running, there is no problem. Several times during our 5 day stay, only one worked for a while but it still was not a huge problem. Our room was the mid level Las Olas section and was very clean and the veiw of the ocean and Palamino Island was nice. If you go to the beach/island every day, staying down there or at the marina would be a plus as you wouldn't have to wait for the funicular. Even though having to use the funicular is a small inconvience, staying up high gives you a breathtaking view you will not get by staying at ocean level. So I think it is a good compromise. The ferries that take you to Palamino Island seem to run often. The trip runs about 10 minutes each way. The resort is about an hour from San Juan airport by bus. Things to do: El Yunque rain forest.

We were invited to go here, all expenses paid, by my husband's company. So I certainly wasn't going to turn up my nose at the opportunity. Had I been in charge of selecting hotels for a trip to Puerto Rico, I am fairly certain this would not have made the cut based on the reviews. But I was pleasantly surprised. The Good: - Our room looked out over the golf course/tennis courts and, further off in the distance, the ocean. We typically like ocean facing rooms but again, I wasn't in charge of the room selection for this trip. In any case, it was lovely. The view was gorgeous, the rooms were quiet and peaceful, the decor was perfectly comfortable and tasteful, the maid service was prompt and efficient...we never had to call for extra towels or to remind them to clean the room, etc. We were located near the main lobby and far from the elevators. No complaints at all. Falling asleep to the gentle chirping of the coqui frogs was sheer bliss. - Palomino Island was fantastic. I was concerned about this aspect of the hotel since I didn't like the idea of being stuck at a beach all day without the convenience of having the room nearby for rests and what not. If we'd traveled with our kids, likely this would not have been as great a situation. But since it was just my husband and I, we were totally cool with the whole set up. The ferry ride to and from the island was nice and relaxing, the island itself was great for folks who want to explore, swim, snorkel, or just chill on the beach. Someone here said the snorkeling wasn't that great...allow me to differ. You just need to know where and when to go (after 2:00pm on the less calm side of the island, snorkeling was great...go about 100 yards straight out towards the small island and turn left...follow the reefs with the deeper water to the right of you and you will see hundreds of fish, some conches, even a few turtles). The food at Iguanas was perfectly decent, drinks were just ok (pina coladas were basically coconut-pineapple slurpies with rum in them...ick), toilets were well-maintained, the little stores on the island supply all sorts of things from tampons to swim wear, and there were a lot of activities available. It wasn't crowded at all...very peaceful experience and relatively easy to find a spot whether you need shade of full sun. - Water park seemed perfect for kids. We only visited briefly but I liked that it wasn't packed and it was tastefully set up with ample activities for kids and adults. I know my three and five-year old would have had a blast. - Pool was lovely. We didn't spend much time there, preferring the island, but a few folks in our party did and said they had a great time. - Bioluminesence tour. Great experience...but be prepared for a lot of rowing IF you choose the kayak option. It's about three miles of rowing in the dark, there and back. Not appropriate for the very young or the very old. Kayaks seat two folks per boat. The bioluminesence part of the tour was, to me, the least exciting part of the entire trip. It was cool and interesting...but more exciting for me was rowing through the mangroves and the lovely view of the stars at night. Be sure to wear bug repellent or wear a long-sleeve shirt/rash guard, especially if you opt to do the 6:00pm/6:30pm tour. Also, be prepared to get wet. Yes, you are in a boat but you are low in the water and you will have a wet bottom and legs by the end of the trip. Also, allow me to suggest you only do the kayak trip with someone you are close to...I heard a lot of couples/twosomes arguing incessantly about when to row, where to row, how fast to row, etc. : ) - Wireless was always available in the room...no trouble there at all. The Not-So-Good - The food at El Conquistador was sub-par. The drinks were pretty good and most of the higher end restaurants had lovely decor/ambiance. But for the most part, the food just wasn't cutting it for us. And the cost of the food vs. the taste and the service just didn't match up. Having said this, some folks in our group were perfectly find with the food at Stingrays and the steak place, etc...but it just wasn't that exciting for us. Also, when I go on vacation, I like to eat local dishes and locally caught/grown food. I was a bit put off when we went to the Italian place (forgot the name) and I asked which of the fish selections were local and was told by the table captain \"none.\" Here's the thing...I am not remotely interested in Maine lobster and salmon when I am in the Caribbean. Conch, Caribbean lobster, and local fish like snapper? Sure! But keep me away from any fish that had to get here via an airplane. Anyway, we had breakfast at Starbucks most mornings (oatmeal or breakfast sandwiches), lunch on the island (not bad), and dinner out (Pasion and Estacion were yummy...but very, very different styles). - The overall resort does need some updating. While our room was absolutely fine...the lobby and various parts of the hotel seemed dated and a bit run down. Granted, big properties have a tough time staying perfectly maintained, especially in tropical climates where the sun, wind, rain, and sea water can make even the fanciest place look worn after a few months. But I think this place really needs an update and better use of some of the indoor space (bring more light in, for starters, and maybe some live entertainment (guitar duo?) in the evenings). - In one part of the indoor area not far from the lobby, there is a section with three cages that house tropical birds including a rare blue macaw (the kids will immediately say \"Rio!\" when they see it). While the birds don't appear to be mistreated in any way, I felt more could be done with their cages, especially the macaw. I'm not a fan of keeping birds in confinement unless they are in a specialized zoo environment where they have expert care. And I felt these birds were not in the greatest place... - It's virtually impossible to go out for a stroll beyond the hotel grounds (no sidewalks, not very well lit in the evenings, lots of hilly terrain) and the taxis are NOT cheap. Also, non-family groups are charged per individual rather than per ride. At roughly $15 for a five to ten minute cab ride, one way, this can get very expensive.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basking Ridge, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly\u201d", "Author": "traveler10173", "ReviewID": "UR125986141", "Content": "I loved it!! the grounds were gorgeous, the rooms were huge, and the food was good.

On the one hand, I may have been more enamored had I had to pay for this vacation. On the other hand, I went on this trip gratis and so feel a bit more objective as a result. Room: We stayed in one of the suites located at the bottom of the hotel property. While I think these rooms have some very pretty views, are in easy access to the ferry that will take you to the private island across from the hotel, and in range of some overpriced shops, I found them to be sort of inconvenient. The hotel does not have a beach on-site, so if one does not venture to the island, you will be spending most of your time at one of the pools and most every restaurant that is located above this section. Initially, no one cared-it's beautiful and sort of fun taking the funicular. But a couple of days in, and if you ever forgot something in the room, etc., it was sort of annoying to have to go up and down, wait for the funicular to arrive, etc. The room was pretty-very bright, very white, with colorful accents. The internet worked well, the bathroom was modern, and the A/C worked well. We also had a lovely little patio balcony off the room, which was nice because we sometimes left the doors open while we slept. Pools: It seemed like most visitors preferred the first pool, the one closest to the top of the property which had plenty of chairs, nice views as well, and great poolside drink and snack service. Private island: On a few days, we chose to go to the island and I was so glad that we did! If you have them, bring your snorkeling mask and fins, as there are some pretty fish to see (but this was not the best snorkeling I have ever had). There is a restaurant there that serves drinks and ok food, as well as a couple of shops. But what you really headed there to do is layout, and enjoy the sun and warm waters-so pretty. Note that there were a TON of sea urchin in the coral and so, in addition to fins, you may want to bring some snorkel/surf shoes. Food: We ate at the steakhouse which was very good; however, I wish this hotel offered something more authentic. Coming from Chicago, a great steak town, I have no real interest in eating steak when the local culture affords much more interesting and authentic options. So, after a few days of typical Hilton food, we took the advice of a local and walked along the hotel's outskirts to a small fishing village where we ate some delicious, Puerto Rican food. Had we found this area sooner, I would have asked my friend to head there more. Spa: In a word, luxurious. And that is what you should expect from the Golden Door. We both had an hour-long massage which provided us with day-long access to the hot tub, relaxation room, showers, etc. We definitely enjoyed this and tried to take advantage of it! All in all, we had a fun time and enjoyed this property. Had I not just attended my own conference a couple of months before in San Juan, I would have been sort of bummed about staying at this hotel, as it is far enough away from the city center to make it pretty inconvenient to head there. Puerto Rico is beautiful as are its cities and so I would recommend folks take the time to see more of the island. To not do so would make me question why you would bother to travel to Puerto Rico in the first place when you could just stay on the mainland, in another Hilton, etc.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Virginia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay!\u201d", "Author": "PrincetonMom13", "ReviewID": "UR125706179", "Content": "Just returned from El Conquistador for a 3 night stay. I was a little nervous after reading the mixed reviews so I was really unsure of what to expect. My worries were unfounded-we had a great time at El Conquistador! (Full disclosure-this trip was with my husband's company so we were just responsible for our meals. I will try to be as honest as possible with my review given the fact that most people would have a great trip to just about anywhere if the majority of the expensives were covered) The property is breathtakingly beautiful! Expansive and lovely I felt like we were on a stationary cruise ship! Even breakfast at Las Brisas mimmicks a cruise ship with its curved windows looking out onto the Caribbean sea. Palomino Beach (the resort's private island) was absolutely gorgeous! Take the trek around the island for more privacy. Fun things for kids-(among the no additional cost options) life size chess board/pieces, soccer goals, basketball, corn hole, miniature golf. We stayed in the Los Olas section of the resort. Private QUIET pool in this section. A down side was that there isn't bar or food service at this pool. You always have the choice of heading up to the main pool if you're looking for swim up bar or food service. The peacefulness of this pool was worth the sacrifice of bar service to us. We bought alcohol at the deli and packed the ice bucket and brought it down to the pool. (did the same with water bottles to have in the room) With such a large (and I mean LARGE resort) something has to give and in my opinion it was probably the lack of updating, however, the rooms were CLEAN and I felt completely comfortable. I consider myself picky with accommodations and I slept like a rock, no worries of dirty linens or critters. We had a room air conditioning issue and it was resolved immediately. The maintenance department was at our door in 5 minutes flat! Food and beverages were EXPENSIVE but good. Example: Lunch of 2 paninis, 1 beer and 1 frozen mudslide drink $52 (before tip) Another lunch: 1 burger w/fries, 1 cuban sandwich, 2 beers 1 frozen drink $64 (before tip) Breakfast buffet at Las Brisas fantastic but again pricey: $24 per person (ours was included with our room-try that option if possible. We ate heartily at breakfast to try to stretch our food dollars) We didn't have a rental car so we couldn't venture off of the property to try local restaurants. Staff was fantastic! Front desk and Concierge couldn't have been more pleasant and accommodating! Unfortunately we had to utilize the services of the resort Doctor. Fantastic option of phone consult or visit from the Doctor at a very reasonable rate. The resort even offers service to the local CVS to pick up your prescription for you and deliver back to you at the resort. The only touch of rudeness I encountered was the staff at the Deli-convenience store off of the lobby. Guests seemed to be a bit of a nuisance to them, to the point of feeling like you were part of the Seinfeld episode where Elaine was convinced they were talking about her in another language. We would love to bring the kids back with us for the water park and to do more exploring but will look for ways to make the most of every dollar as it can be pricey.

The ocean is dark, light, blue, green and dotted with sailboats and small islands in the distance. Our room was in the Las Olas bldg, which doesn't have an elevator, and was on the 3rd floor. The bldg felt like a Days Inn--run down and cheap. The rooms have been redone and the decor is beach modern with platform beds. The bathroom was renovated, but they left the old tub!!! There are 2 funiculars, but only 1 goes to the Olas bldg. After one night we switched to Brisas, because I woke up feeling horrible--I think there's mold or mildew there. The Brisas bldg was so much better. Felt cleaner, no mold and much better location. The view from the room is indescribable and the room was very bright and sunny. This bldg is right next to the main lobby, has an elevator and is just a short walk to the main pool. Same decor in the room as Olas--very pretty, but they left the old tubs here too. To get to the island, we took the funicular down. The hotel was not full, and we never waited more than 10 minutes to get on. The ride up/down is easy--it's an outdoor elevator, mostly all glass and takes about two minutes. We were awe-struck every time at the experience and the view. Then we waited for a ferry that comes every 45 minutes. The marina area has a few stores and a coffee/snack shop, and is quiet, lovely, and a nice place to just read a book while waiting for the boat. Took a 15 minute boat ride to get to the island, and on a windy day it was bumpy and fun! On the island, there's a basketball court, volleyball court, wave runners, kayaks, snorkel equip. to rent and one restaurant with really good, fresh fish dishes, among others. There's also food/drink service to the beach. There are tons of chairs, but few palapas and a charge for umbrellas.

We had a wonderful meal at the Italian restaurant, and the desserts at the pizza bar were over the top (cuatro leches). Some negatives: The main pool is not heated.

There were a bunch of other people waiting to get on the tram so it was just a pain. Our room was dark and on the musty side, right near the waterpark. We had dinner at Ballyhoo Bar and Grill and the service was REALLY bad. You shouldn't have to ask three times for a glass of water and then they brought our appetizer and entrees at the same time after we had waited 45 minutes. The food was average at best and extremely expensive. We were happy that we had brought Cheerios for breakfast -- it was lots cheaper and hassle-free. The pool was on the chilly side. Finally, this hotel is in a really strange location. You drive through a depressing residential area before coming upon it and it's not easy to find -- more street signs would definitely have come in handy.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location great views\u201d", "Author": "Abbeyny", "ReviewID": "UR125358350", "Content": "This is a fantastic holiday vacation for families.

Situated up on a hill overlooking the ocean and across from Palomino Island, the hotel was near the bioluminescent bay in Fajardo, a quick drive to El Yunque and close to a few good restaurants. The hotel itself needs quite a bit of work. It opened in the 60s and seems like little has been done since. Upon checking in, we were told that we had been given adjoining rooms (we were 4 adults and had booked two rooms) and despite booking two King rooms, we were offered one King and one with two Queens - not what we wanted. So, after convincing the check-in agent that we didn't want what he gave us (he seemed like he couldn't understand why) and waiting several minutes, we were accommodated with rooms near each other, both Kings. Both rooms had nice ocean views, and although I am a Diamond member, we were offered no upgrade (one of three benefits supposedly available to Diamond members at this property). The rooms are what you expect in the Caribbean, but there was a big hairball thing on the floor of ours when we arrived, the refrigerator wasn't really very cold (and had no temperature adjustment on it) and the fan in the room above ours was so loud one night that it woke us from a sound sleep. We saw several more of these \"hairballs\" around the property as well. The service needs improvement across the board though. The breakfast buffet (included for Diamonds, thankfully - it was worth nowhere near the $24 per person they wanted for it) was average, but you had to ask for water constantly, despite the breakfast servers standing around (it was a buffet - drinks were really their only job) and frequently they wouldn't grab your plate if you went up for more. The bar upstairs across from the Italian restaurant was the same - even though there were was barely anyone there, a couple of pretty straightforward cocktails took 10 minutes to make. The Italian restaurant was a bright spot, though - we had a nice meal there on our first night. The ferry to Palomino Island was quick and prompt and the island itself was very nice. We snagged a few lounge chairs in the shade and enjoyed a relaxing afternoon there. One of my biggest beefs was with the parking. At a resort like this, I really don't expect to be nickel-and-dimed for something like parking, especially self parking. The lot was a little ways down a hill (which is fine) and was $15 a day to park there, I believe. Each time you entered you got a ticket which you then had to have validated before you left again. Something we just put on our dash for the duration of our stay would have been much easier. There was also a van lurking in the parking lot operated by a third party (Charlie) who wanted to shuttle you back up to the hotel, surely in exchange for a tip. He also shooed me out of a perfectly good parking spot one time, claiming I was blocking the route he took through the parking lot to scoop up unsuspecting people who might not have been able to walk back up the hill. This is really something the hotel should provide, or not at all. I would not stay here again, certainly not at the rate we paid, without some significant changes to the property. The entire place needs a coat of paint. The service needs to feel more like a Waldorf Astoria resort and less like a gang of people just trying to scoop up the tips on the overpriced and under-liquored drinks. The bottles of water in the room should be complimentary, not $3.50 per bottle. Also, beware that there is a \"water park\" onsite which caters to kids as well as a kids club. There were tons of them during our stay and while most were generally well-behaved, some certainly were not. If this isn't your thing, go elsewhere. I suspect that this is a popular point redemption for business travelers with their families.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cQuick Tips and Tricks On Your Trip\u201d", "Author": "MyaOl", "ReviewID": "UR125198192", "Content": "We arrived early (8am), the hotel let us use their spa to refreshen up and leave our bags with the bell service..

There is a big game room and movies shown at night which the kids loved. We used one of the hotel's babysitters a couple of nights and she was great. The kids really liked her and we had no issues.

Experience unparalleled service that creates unforgettable moments and defines the idea of the luxury hotel.\" This is not even close to the level of service here. We stayed for 5 nights, we were never asked how things were or if any services could be provided. As a matter of fact, we rented a car and paid $15.00 per day to self park. The lot is a good distance away but we don't mind the walk (except when it was raining). They have a shuttle between the lot and the hotel but never offered to provide a ride nor asked if we wanted one. We ate at two property restaurants, both were extremely overpriced and the food was tasteless. At one restaurant, we (50+ year old couple) were seated only to have the table next to us seated with young family of four with screaming and table pounding kids. There were many empty tables in the restaurant as it was later in the evening. So, if your looking for a quiet retreat, be aware. We couldn't wait to pay and get out of there. The free breakfast buffet was more than adequate and the service was fine. If we would have paid the $26.00 per person regular rate for the buffet, we might have felt differently. We did find an excellent restaurant nearby, La Estacion locally owned, fresh food, great service and a very reasonable price. Definitely worth a try or three! Also nearby, Calizo seafood restaurant has good food but with spotty service. Worth a try but La Estacion much fresher and far better service. Both however, were far better than the resort food. We are very active and planned many activities. We organized them all ourselves and they went off without a hitch. We did ask the concierge to book one trip for us only to have the included transportation not being provided and we ended up nearly being stranded in an unfamiliar place. ---Lesson: Make your own plans! The care-less customer service attitude is obviously instilled by resort management. The hotel is located in a beautiful area but the building itself is not up to any luxury standard. Hacked up woodwork in need of paint, weeds growing from cracks in sidewalks, dimly lit walkways to parking area just to name a few. We've seen much better maintained facilities at Hampton Inn. The housekeeping service was excellent. At least someone there took pride in their work. We used the spa ($200.00 per person), the massage was great but again, the facility was small, dated and in need of a good cleaning and modernization. Not at all a luxury facility. As mentioned, the view and the area was breathtaking. If you can get a good deal, this place is worth consideration. Just don't expect luxury or service.

The resort has pros and cons but I agree with the previous reviewer that this property would be better received if it changed it's name to Hilton instead of WA because the expectations of guests are higher than the resort can fulfill. I was teetering between giving the property 3 or 4 stars for a rating because I would say the amenities are 4-5 stars but the quality of the property is no more than 3. The El Con is about 1.5 hours to/from the San Juan airport. There is a shuttle that will take guests directly to the hotel for $74 roundtrip or $37 each way. This charge is directed right on to your incidentals bill for convenience. My first impression of the service was great, the bell staff was very warm, friendly and helpful. Check-in was the same. My first impression of the property was ok, the grounds are beautiful and well-kept but the building itself reminded me of a 3* Mexico all-inclusive rather than an upscale resort. Regardless, it was nice to have a beautiful view of the ocean from the lobby after a long day of travel. I was a little underwhelmed with my room in the Vista. The view was of the driveway to the resort which was disappointing, and the room looked worn and dated. There were little hairs in my shower, in misc areas of the bathroom, in the coffee mug! Yuck! The carpet was faded and tattered and the room just didn't feel very fresh. I stayed for 5 days in this room and asked for an upgrade to an ocean view for my final 5 days which I was actually given. The new room had an incredible view of the ocean (also in vista tower) but the room itself was again very run down and the lock on the door was broken. On the day I was to change rooms, I was asked to check out by 11am which I did. My new room wasn't ready until 6pm (2 hrs after check in time!). This was frustrating for me! Of course I did not spend the entire trip in my room, I utilized the amenities. I was very impressed with the amenities at this property! There are 3 main pools and 2 additional in the Las Olas and Casitas wings. There are a number of jacuzzies, my favorite being the \"infinity jacuzzi\" overlooking the sea. There was a server bringing drinks and food to guests at the pool also. There are a number of shops located throughout the resort for snacks, liquor, souvenirs, toiletries, etc. The property is massive so I definitely would not recommend it for anyone who had difficulty getting around. I liked the size because I didn't feel like I was looking at the same thing day after day. I have read many complaints regarding the funicular and I personally did not have any issues with it. However, my co-worker did get stuck waiting for almost an hour at one point when one of the two was not in service and a large group of people were also trying to get on it. The restaurants were hit or miss, we had terrible service and below-average food at Ballyhoo in the Marina but an excellent meal at La Piccola. I felt that the staff throughout the resort spent most of their time standing around in groups socializing rather than working. At first I was thinking, \"Wow, these people have a lot of meetings!\" Then I realized they were just socialzing because the \"meetings\" never broke up! Palomino island was a very nice little place and the only area that was really laid-back and relaxed on the resort (this is a busy place!). There were a number of water sports and rental equipment, a few bars and a restuarant, beautiful beaches to walk along or relax on as well as mini-golf, bag toss and nets for sports. I really liked the island, it was just a hassle from my room so I actually only made it out there twice. Overall, I can't say I had a bad experience here but I just wasn't impressed with many of the facillities resulting in the average rating i have given the El Con. If there were some updates, and a little more pep from most of the staff, I think the property has incredible potential!", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cchange the name\u201d", "Author": "Justtravels988", "ReviewID": "UR123973017", "Content": "I'm a HH Diamond Member. First trip to PR and wanted to check out the WA El Con. It was over Christmas. Overall, this is a three star property that does not live up to the hype or the luxury that comes with the name \"Waldorf Astoria.\" If this was called the \"Hilton El Conquistador\" i think it would clear up a lot of people's problems (including mine). Here are the issues which are obvious to why this should be classified as a 3 star Hilton Resort: * The place is old and its obvious. Broken elevators (even over Christmas), dingy furniture, stained carpets...even though the rooms were modernized- they are still cheap looking and pretty beat up (and I assume I was upgraded since I'm a diamond member. Nothing luxury about the rooms or facility). * The food is horrific and the restaurants are gathered together like a food court where you take escalators to the \"Restaurant Level\" from the main lobby. Breakfast is probably the worst part. Its in a humid, cafeteria style dining room where its really family oriented. When you think WA- you think of similar luxury resorts- Four Seasons, Ritz...this breakfast is on par with what you'd expect at the Hilton Disney World...not the WA. * The service is poor. Check-in at the Diamond Desk took over 20 minutes and there wasn't even a line! The process takes forever and this resonated everywhere....spa, dining (see above), bellman....everyone works at their own pace...nice and slow. Again, not WA where you expect ppl to be jumping around, always available to help. * Here's my favorite part. Had a dinner reservation at Strip House (yes, a chain at a resort- weird) and looked in the in room directory and it said there was a Cigar Bar. So we went to the Cigar Bar which is now a pool hall (nice work updating the in room directories hotel staff). We sat down upon arrival. Of course the 2 girls behind the bar let us sit there for 10 mintues so I went over and asked if we could order cigars. Yes, we could purchase them and sit on the patio. So I buy 2 cigars and 2 glasses of wine (she sets the wine on the counter for me to take over to the table- no service but a tip line on the reciept) and hands me the cigars in their wrappers. I kind of roll my eyes and ask for a cutter and matches. She says, \"No, sorry.\" I said, 'haha, can i pls have a cutter and matches (thinking she was joking).\" \"I said we don't have them,\" she replies. \"you don't have a cutter or matches at a cigar bar...i mean, a pool hall where you sell cigars\" I asked? \"Yeah, thats what i said.\" UNBELIEVABLE. So off to the gift shop I went to get gauged for a lighter after blowing $50 bucks at the pool hall. Then dinner at Strip...it was typical, fine. We were laughing about the crazy cigar incident/ horrific service and attitude and the overall hotel at dinner and the couple next to us perked up, leaned over and said...\"we couldn't help but laughing at your story...we've been laughing all day at how terrible this place is and the joke WA is......in fact, we're checking into the St Regis tomorrow and are debating leaving right now!!!!'' What else do you need to know about the service as this place? I have to say the setting is really beautiful, but the whole place is a joke as a WA.

That said if a very modern, new, or fancy room is what you're looking for you're likely to be disappointed. - there are two large and beautiful pools, one with a swim up bar, with a view of the ocean and palm trees. We never had a problem finding a lounger by the pool with or without shade. They also have private cabanas for rent although didn't do it so can't comment on the quality or value. - six restaurants for every taste. I ate I'm most and the food quality was either excellent or exceptional at all. They are not cheap as you would expect at a Waldorf. I was a particular fan of the Italian and the casual bar down in the Marina. I didn't eat at the steak house but a colleague said the food was fantastic. - there are a ton of active sports options. A full 18 hole course that is both challenging and beautiful. Approx. a half dozen tennis courts in reasonable condition and we had no problem getting one in the morning, although they got busy after 10am. There are two well equipped gyms but I recommend the one in the spa as its better equipped and more aesthetically appealing. And finally at the island there are any number of water sport options ranging from snorkeling to beach volley ball. Golf and water sports cost extra, the rest are included. - the hotel owns an island which houses the beach, a restaurant, and bar. It also has a compliamentary shuttle every 30 mins or so free for guests. It's a great place to spend a hot afternoon. - the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. - we took a number of excursions and would suggest a late night kayak to the nearby illumine cent bay is a must do. The trip is magical as your paddle, kayak, and even your hands cause the water to emit a bright green light. It's like pixey dust running through your fingers. Sign up at the marina.

While I learned that it had been acquired by Waldorf Astoria I thought before I got there, oh good, its a quality hotel, 5 star service etc. My room was very nice, clean, great view. The Waldorf needs to up date its workers on service. My complaint with house keeping is that they never replaced our coffee cups. Now I know this seems trivial but, we like our afternoon coffee. So they never replace the first cup that was there, and the one that was there was definitely not clean..........its like they wiped it out with a towel because there was coffee residue clearly on the bottom of the mug. GROSS. Only makes me wonder what else they didn't clean. They were also late on cleaning the room. Sorry but by 2:00pm when I come back from the beach, I need the room clean and fresh towels. Especially at those prices. The staff while pleasant always seemed like they didn't know what the heck you were talking about. The wait staff, really had no interest in making any money.

Here were my takeaways: Pros: *Great, spacious and scenic room- We were able to get a huge room in the Las Casitas that came with a full kitchen, 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. It has an extremely large deck and there really isn't a bad view from anywhere in this resort. * Palomino Island- This resort comes with its own private island. They have a ferry that runs consistently throughout the day to take you to an island with hundreds of chairs, a couple of bars, a restaurant and also lots of activities (i.e. jet skis, kayaks, basketball court, horseshoes, corn hole, etc.) The ferry runs until 5:30 and is really the place I wanted to spend most of my time. * Lots to do- There was plenty to do on this resort from golfing, to a casino, to shopping, to dancing, and plenty of eating. Also pools everywhere, a large water park and a fun marina area. Some of the areas do die down at night, so as a 27 year old, it was at times hard to find a good variety in nightlife on week days. *Steak Restaurant: This place had excellent service and tasty food. I had a very nice steak and split a giant peice of chocolate cake with my family. (Yes one piece was more than enough. We didn't even finish it) *Tours- We took a great tour to the Rainforest through the hotel. They were able to run the trip with a minimum of 6 people and they handled accomodations to take us our and provided an excellent tour guide. Cons: *Casitas is tad far from the main hotel: If you stay at the casitas, it is a little far for people to walk, especially in the dark or if it is raining. At the front they do offer either a golf cart/shuttle to the main hotel, and it comes on request. *Asian food restaurant: Overall the food was good, but in terms of quality per price I did not enjoy the asian restaurant. Entree family style dishes ranged from $20-$40 and were very basic and even bland dishes. Service was great though. *Lines for the Funicular: To get down to the ferry or marina area you need to take a funicular. It offers an incredible view and is pretty quick. Unfortunately they are somewhat small so when a ferry lets off, you usually will have to wait in line. Overall I didn't mind, but we did try to plan ahead to avoid lines if we could. *Not much local experience: The second part of our vacation took place in Old San Juan and I must say if you visit the El Conquistador, in order to really get a cultural experience you must take some of the tours or move into the cities.

We ended up driving to a local grocery (5 min) away and stocking up on bottled water, soda, fruit juice and a bottle of rum for less than you would pay in the US.

(Note to travellers, do _not_ use the bathroom in the main park.) The city is otherwise very safe and kid friendly. We recommend a day trip into El Yunque rainforest, but organize it through the hotel not an independent tour company, because many of them leave from San Juan. The Spa is a great experience, remember to bring a bathing suit with you. Palomino island is a nice day at the beach, the selection of beer there is very limited and expensive. Las Brisas restaurant is the best place for breakfast, but the buffet is $24 per person, so you probably won't want to eat there everyday. Try Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Caribe as a cheaper alternative. If you want cheap lunches, grab a sandwich out of the Cozy Market or even out of Starbucks. The shuttle from the airport is booked ahead, returning to the airport has to be booked at the Hotel through the concierge. $74 a person round trip. The free rum on the shuttle heading to the Hotel is a nice touch.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cReasonably priced hotel with added luxuries\u201d", "Author": "DeeP23", "ReviewID": "UR123445797", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for our third visit and absolutely LOVE it.

The views were unbelievable. When we arrived, we were upgraded from a garden view room to an oceanview room in Las Casitas. The room was beautiful, had a full kitchen (fridge stocked with bottled waters) and a balcony overlooking the ocean. There were perks to staying on the Las Casitas part of the resort. First, this is where the infinity pool and hot tub are. Second, the gym on the Casitas side is much nicer than the gym in the main area. We spent most days at the Palomino Island which also had really nice views, lots of water sports, and pretty good food at the Iguana Cafe. The sand on the beach was kinda grainy, however, and there were lots of coral pieces in the water which made it difficult to walk. If you have water shoes, bring them. We also had a good time at the water park which is only $5 after 4pm. Keep your eyes peeled for the 3 foot iguana that lives in the bushes. The restaurants on the resort serve mostly american food, dinner ranges from $20-50 a dish. Nothing exciting. We ventured into Fajardo for 2 dinners and had a great time. I highly recommend Tasca Oleleiolai and Pasion. We attempted to go to La Estacion but when we got there, we were informed that the restaurant was out of food and closing despite the fact that we had called 20 minutes before our arrival. Very poor service at La Estacion. Also, if you don't have a rental car, the resort has a taxi service which is very reliable, but kinda pricey. We paid $10-20 per ride and only went about 5 minutes down the road. We thought it was worth it to try local cuisine which was delicious and far less expensive than the resort. I also highly recommend the biobay tour through Pure Adventures - an amazing, once in a lifetime experience.

But you should temper your expectations. We booked VERY last minute, arrived on New Year's Eve, watched the fireworks from our ocean-view balcony. The good- The grounds are stunning, the beach on the private island is fabulous. The ferry ride over is short and pleasant. You can go to the busy area and do boating, kayaking, jetskis etc, or go the other direction and have a slice of white sand and calm turquoise water to yourself. The water park is really fun, even for grown-ups. The staff is friendly & accommodating. We asked for and got an upgrade to an ocean-view room& woke up to the sunrise and ocean each day. We had an absolute blast all together. Things to do for sure: biofluorescent bay tour (you can walk to the local companies and do it for half the price of booking through the hotel), the lazy river, the beach, the half-day snorkel tour. We tried 3 of the resort's \"fine dining\" restaurants. The steak house was good food and service and nice atmosphere. The fish restaurant at the marina was great service, we sat outside, great view, great atmosphere, but the food was mediocre and VERY expensive. And the italian fine dining place was average food and literally about $35 for a bowl of pasta. The bad- Generally speaking there is nothing \"Waldorf\" about this resort. It doesn't have the modern luxuries you'd expect from a Waldorf. There are no frills to the rooms or the architecture or the public areas at all. The interior of the main building has little shops and a Starbucks, which all came in very handy, but it feels a bit tacky & outdated. There are a LOT of VERY LARGE people and generally speaking it is not a 5- or even 4-star crowd. It seems that the Casitas, which are more expensive and have some private castitas-only areas, are more upscale all around, so if you are looking for any element of luxury, maybe stay there. The design of the resort is such that you HAVE to take the funiculaire between areas at the top and bottom of the cliff. There is NO option to walk, no staircase, nothing. And one or the other funiculaire was ALWAYS BROKEN throughout our whole week-long stay, and, from what the locals tell me, that is usually the case. What that means is that when you take the last ferry back from the beach, you can expect to wait sometimes over an HOUR to get up the hill to the main building. They are very aware that this is an issue. We casually spoke to a manager about it, and just for giving her our feedback, she credited us a free night. As I said, the service if very friendly and accommodating! Overall, this is a beautiful property with lots of activities, proximity to local restaurant options, good service, spectacular weather, nice beach, and a really fun trip all around.

We traveled with the Holcombs (a/k/a \"Holcons\" to the Las Casitas staff....LOL)....please see David's review below. This is a beautiful property with stunning views of the Carribean. I read a good many TripAdvisor reviews before going and was a little apprehensive based on a considerable number of negative reviews. We were offered an \"upgrade\" to a Marina room but, thankfully, declined due to the number of reviews citing broken down funiculars and long wait times to get back up to the main hotel area. This was a good decision as one of the trams was broken down most of the time we were there. On three occassions, we had to take a shuttle bus back up to the main hotel (twice in an old yellow school bus!). This kinda takes away from the whole resort experience. We had two different rooms in the Las Brisas wing of the hotel. The first looked toward the light house and the Atlantic Ocean and it was quite a nice view. We changed to the other side of Las Brisas which overlooks the marina area with nice views out to the private island, Palomino. I highly recommend the rooms on this side of Las Brisas. Particularly, if you are traveling with kids, stay up at the main resort where most of the restaurants and activities are. Otherwise you will spend a great deal of time going back and forth on the funicular (if they are working). The resort management simply must solve this funicular problem or suffer continued negative reviews. Palomino Island is the highlight of this resort with two motorized catamarans going back and forth constantly to the island (about 8-10 minutes). The trip over and back is fun in itself. The island has a nice grassy area for kids and teens to frolic and play: soccer, putt-putt, large chess set, horseshoes. You can rent floats, snorkel gear, sailboats and jets skis. My daughter and I went snorkeling for about an hour off Palomino.....not great snorkeling if you've been to the black rock in Maui or Isles Mujeres, etc......but we saw enough fish to keep us entertained and had a good \"bonding\" experience. I think this resort is great for parents traveling with kids in the 5-15 age range. The waterpark is also quite nice with three good \"rides\" and the extra special treat of heated water, unlike the other pools. Hopefully, the resort will ultimately drop the charge for hotel guests. Special tip: we went to the waterpark after 4:00 and they only charged me and my daughter $5 each to get in. The \"Holcons\" had rented a large SUV so we all went to the El Yunque rain forest one day. A nice 5-6 hour field trip with hikes up to the Briton tower and El Mina waterfall. Really no need to go on a guided tour for El Yunque. The grounds of El Con are beautiful and the staff were all quite friendly and accomodating. The restaurants were good and not particularly overpriced for a resort.....we did not eat at the high end steak house and Italian restaurant since we constantly have to look for places with chicken fingers and grilled cheese sandwichs. Even on Palomino Island the drinks were not over-priced for a resort ($8-$9) I would recommend this resort....particularly with folks traveling with kids in the 5-15 age range.

This place really is divisive and unfortunately I'm on the \"avoid this hotel\" side. Before arriving, we were aware that it is a massive resort and does require a lot of walking - we tried to overcome this by staying in the Las Olas village, which has its own funicular and is close to the marina. Lo and behold, the local service funicular wasn't working, which added at least 15 minutes to every journey in and out of Las Olas. This is especially annoying in the morning, where the lines to get up or down look like Disney World. Our rooms were rundown and tired, the fridge didn't work and I found I was sharing the space with some unpleasant insects. There were two days when the housekeeping service didn't even come to my room. The doors slam, loud and hard, so when people are coming back late at night, you hear them. The walls are so thin that if your neighbor sneezes, you hear them. The best part about this resort is the Palomino Island. We planned our week and tours around visits there. However, we were disappointed (furious?) to find out that on our last day the Island was closed for a private event. We had no notice, save for a few signs they put up on the day. As with a mega-resort experience, there are a lot of different types of people - unfortunately this place has attracted some really bad types. Considering the price you're paying at their average-quality restaurants, you don't want to be sitting next to a man in overalls and a wife beater (you can't make this up!) or families still in their bathing suits and pool clothes at 9pm. The overriding feeling is that this place is ripping you off. Waldorf-Astoria ?! Get out of here.

Overall, our stay was fine but had some issues that put a damper on what otherwise was a fantastic vacation. Our check-in process was smooth... at some point we went to retrieve our luggage from the bell man and realized they never gave us luggage tags -- and our bags were unattended outside on a cart! I noticed a small sign saying that Palomino island would be closed on the second day of our stay -- we were not told about this by front desk staff at our check-in, NOR was this information provided when we booked our rooms (which was less than 2 weeks before our arrival). This was VERY disappointing, because the point of us coming to this resort was to use the private island/beach (and the only beach available is at the island -- as the hotel is on a cliff). The communication regarding this issue was very unprofessional. Our room was clean with a great view of the Ocean -- furniture was a platform bed with comfortable mattresses on top. Unfortunately, the edges of the platform were very sharp, so our daughter kept hitting herself against the edges. Major downside of the room layout was a large closet/bathroom combination with a sliding door. That basically meant you couldn't access your clothes, refrigerator, coffee maker if someone was in the bathroom -- and the bathroom door didn't lock! Our first day we had a wonderful day at Palomino island. I agree with prior posts stating how difficult it is to get started in the morning. Long lines at any restaurant/coffee shop. Lines at the funicular. Lines at the ferry. By the time you get there, you are hot, sweaty, and very frustrated. Honestly I am not staying at a \"Waldorf\" property to feel that much frustration on my winter getaway! Given how (in agreement with previous posters) that you felt like they had their \"hands in your pockets\" -- one does expect a higher level of service and standards. The following day was the day the beaches were closed for a 'private function.\" We had contacted the concierge several times to ask about going to Culebra on this day. We were told that getting there involved the ferry and to get there early to get tickets. We were told not to bother with flying, since it had to be done in advance (again, didn't know about the island being closed when we arranged our trip otherwise could have booked puddle-jumper flight in advance). We woke up very early and got to the ferry more than an hour prior to 9am ferry departure. ALl tickets already sold out. Nothing to do for the day (didn't want to go to the pool -- water chilly and we came to PR for beaches). Googled some airline numbers and found out that they have flights out of nearby airports that are available --went to airport but flight was too far time-wise for us to wait. Wandered around for a while then went to a beach in Luquillo -- not as nice but stayed for an hour or so and headed back to hotel. Pools open 24 hours, but no towels available after 6pm... Later, we found out that there are NUMEROUS snorkel trips, private boat charters, other airlines, water taxis, and multiple other ways to have gotten to this island that the concierge did NOT inform us of. They were basically incorrect about many things they told us about -- and generally wasted our entire day with their lack of information or downright WRONG information. We did address these concerns with management. They tried to find us a water taxi to another island but the weather turned ugly by the time this could be set up and so nothing came of it. They did leave a voicemail stating that, to offset the inconveniences, they were willing to credit us $100. When we checked out, I reviewed the charges to our account and was about to sign it and then decided to ask about our credit. The agent said, there is note on your account that management tried to set up a water taxi for you but you did not go. I stated that the weather conditions did not permit travel, which is why we didn't take them up on that offer. I did ask about the credit, and ONLY AT THIS POINT, did the agent snobbishly acknowledge that yes, this was indeed noted on the account and that she would NOW apply it! It was stunning -- that she had been standing looking at the account the entire time without applying this credit until I brought it up! The hotel was just generally TOO big (akin to a Vegas casino), with too much going on, and therefore had uncaring staff who were not accountable at all. You felt that you were just a number (and this was magnified by the presence of a very large private event that overwhelmed the hotel's resources). Prior to arriving here, we had a lovely stay at a 4.5 star property in San Juan that was very personal, friendly, and warm compared to El Conquistador. The location of the hotel is amazing, but the level of customer service, rooms, and staff are absolutely not up to Waldorf standards (though, if you have stayed at THE Waldorf=Astoria recently, you may realize that this doesn't mean much anymore). If you come here with low expectations and have a long vacation (5-7 days), then you will actually find this property stunning and feel like it is a gem. However, if you are used to staying in true five star properties (Four Seasons, etc) this place will be a real disappointment! If you decide to stay here, make sure you try restaurants outside the hotel (food was mediocre on site -- we tried Pasion down the road and it was excellent). Also, do your own online research about any potential day trips you may want to explore. Additionally, make sure you CALL the hotel and confirm that the amenities you are interested in will be available!", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PITTSBURGH", "Title": "\u201cHad a good time\u201d", "Author": "BERNICE77", "ReviewID": "UR122607960", "Content": "All in all the vacation experience was not all that bad.

The location and amenities at the Conquistador are quite impressive. The hotel is built into the mountain and the views from almost any location are spectacular.

There are tons of activities there to keep everyone happy but the menu doesn't change so we did get tired of the same lunch everyday. The waterpark is also nice for families but we only went once. While our vacation was top notch, there is definitely room for improvements (big and small): 1. The rooms are desperately in need of renovation. Although we LOVED the location and view of our room in the Marina, the carpeting is old, bathrooms a little mildewy, the decor needs to be updated etc. This was the case in all three rooms we saw and our friends who were at the resort felt the same. 2. NOTHING is included! The resort charges extra for everything--entry to the water park, menu sharing charges, water bottles, entry to the disco, etc. None of the bars at the hotel put out snack mix to munch on. They have an all inclusive option (which we didn't take advantage of) but I noticed that most of the restaurants charged a $5 pp fee for meal plan guests.

We (11 people, from 16 to 80, in four rooms) just returned from a six night stay at El Conquistador. My wife and I had visited previously; everyone else was a first-timer. Our entire group enjoyed the resort and thought it was the perfect place for our first \"destination Xmas.\" Is ElCon perfect? Absolutely not. Most complaints, however, can be attributed to its size (large) and to its location (Caribbean, where one must accept that things are just ... different). I find it part of the charm. If you want everything perfect and two minutes ago, go somewhere else. I found the staff extremely friendly and guest-oriented. I had an internet problem, and the hotel's internet guy (thanks Bernie!!!) literally spent hours with me over two days in an effort to fix it. The resort was sold out between Xmas and New Years, and that in turn stressed the on-site restaurants. I saw many restaurant employees literally running in order to provide service. We found ourselves without a reservation one night, approached one casual place, and watched waiters set up a new table for us. The hotel is large and a bit spread out, not only horizontally but vertically. Most of the resort rooms are up on a cliff with the main building, the golf and spa, and all the meeting rooms. Some of the rooms, two restaurants, and the modest water park are down on the water level, where one catches the ferry over to ElCon's private island beach. One rides one of the two funiculars to change levels. Our group never had trouble with either the ferries or the funiculars. The layout of the resort actually can be an advantage: It offers guests several options for how close one wants to be to the main building, the water park, the golf, the spa, the shuttle service to the private beach island, etc. Our room was large enough, nicely if sparsely furnished, and well equipped. The bathroom was fine. the golf course is difficult, well designed (Arthur Hills, for those who know architects), and fairly well maintained. I would discourage you from renting a car on your first visit, because you really do not need to leave the premises for entertainment or recreation. There are a couple of good restaurants nearby, and you can take a taxi there. You also can rent a car at the resort for a day trip to the rain forest (a bit of a tough drive, experience and views worthwhile). I encourage you to try ElCon.

As was the case before our first trip, we were a bit concerned about all the negative reviews but again walked away feeling very pleased with the place. I think that many people may end being disappointed with this hotel because it is branded as a Waldorf hotel and expect a five star type of resort ad service. This is not a 5 star hotel in terms of both quality and service. It is more like a 4 star hotel with service that tends to be on par with what people can find in this part of the world. If you are coming here expecting the Ritz or the Four Seasons you will likely be very disappointed. The hotel is also huge with something like 900 rooms (?), made primarily of concrete and therefore feels very much like an all-inclusive. Having said that it is also considerably less expensive than a 5 star resort and we actually found it to be very good value for the time of year. Many people seem disappointed by the additional fees but we booked the hotel directly on-line at their web site where it was made clear that there was a 14% resort fee and 11% tax on top of the room price. Yes, if you need/want a car the $15 self parking fee is a bit steep but I recently paid $10 to self park my car at a Westin hotel outside Toronto. We even found the food prices to be fair for a resort and were impressed to see that most of the restaurants had reasonably priced kids menus. We also rented a car and had dinner nearby off-site which we would recommend. We enjoyed staying up at the Las Vista building and not having to go up and down the funicular too often. It is also close to the main pools and parking lot. Our room was modern looking with high ceilings and clean. Bathroom was large but the tub/shower had been re-furbished and was fine. We all enjoyed taking the ferry over to their private island but I can see how some people would find this a bit of a drag. We found the beach itself was very nice but a bit of sheels and small coral in ocean so could to have those slip on water shoes (they sell there). My brother in law did not have them and he was fine playing ball with us in the water. They had a basketball court there and we had fun shooting hoops; a free putting green; some kids size soccer nets and balls to shoot around with; volleyball net. Kayaks and jet skis to rent. My sister went on a short hike around to a cove which she said was beautiful. At main pools we had no issues with towels or finding chairs. Pool temps a bit chilly but this is also par for the course in the caribbean where you rarely find a heated pool. We did enjoy the heated jacuzzi. Played ping pong. Tennis was free as was nice gym at Golden Door spa. Free wi-fi. Mini fridge in room and lots of space as no mini bar.

The view from our room was incredible. Awakening to the sunrise each morning at 7:00 started the day. The rooms are clean and large. Food is very expensive at the hotel (think NYC dinner prices) but good. We opted to pay a driver take us to the market to buy snacks and soda to save some $$. (There aren't fridges in the rooms, but there is ice available). Palomino island is beautiful. There is coral just before entering the water, but once you are in the ocean the sand is smooth and the water turquoise crystal clear. We took a ride up the mountain on the horses available.

The day I left it was raining and they were playing a movie for kids and they had games set out everywhere.Pools are great, never a problem finding a chair. I found the food great, the steak house especially. Their island is so peaceful. No it is not brand new but it has lots of charm and class unlike the cookie cutter resorts I have been too.

The private island beach was slightly littered with trash and looked like a hurricane had recently destroyed it (but alas there was no recent hurricane in March 2011!). This hotel is really beautiful. It reminds one of the Greek island of Santorini with a classy resort at the top, and steep cliffs that descend to the sea. The scenery is quite breathtaking, and worth at least a drive-by visit. The hotel itself is a very large. It has two cable cars the connect the upper and lower portions of the resort. The Casitas, at least from the outside, don't appear to be worth the extra cost as most vacationers would come over to the regular hotel. The hotel is really geared for families, not couples or romantics. Positives: + Overall a great property with beautiful seascapes and layout + Really nice lobby + Nice pool area with several options + Resort has a Starbucks on-site in addition to several other stores Negatives: - Beach looked like it had been destroyed by severe weather in certain areas - Water was littered with rocks and very hard to walk into on the private island - Drinks were weak and small - The main breakfast buffet area had quite a spread but the area smelled really disgusting - like the room was cleaned with dirty water because the staff didn't want to use soap - Most rooms are dated and really old - Tried to charge me for parking my rental car, which I had rented on-site - Clientele at the hotel wasn't great - lots of people lacking manners which can be expected at a mega-resort anyway. - Jacuzzi: some people would get in, then turn it off. - Hotel had a leak next to the elevators, and instead of fixing it, used a giant fan to try to dry it up. (you can't make this stuff up!!!) I got the impression that because the Conquistador is now run by a financial company instead of a hotelier, they are specifically running it with minimum cash. When the financial company bought the Conquistador and related hotels, they purchased it on debt. With the state of the economy and financial markets, they are sparing no dime on the upkeep of the property.

There is no shelter, we were tired, wet and still had to climb 2fkights of stairs because las olas has no elevators either.

During our 9 day stay we experienced terrible service (at several of the hotel restaurants, the concierge desk - worst concierge service I've ever seen and all we were trying to do was get a cab to the airport and book one tour, lounge service), the hotel was unequipped to handle the number of guests - it takes anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes to get to their private island from your room (they only have one operating funicular car because their other one is broken, and while their ferry seems large not everyone fits on the weekends), AC problems in our room, the fitness center included with your stay (not the one at the spa available for a daily charge) only has 50% of machines that are operational. If you want to go anywhere, rent a car. While there are cabs in fajardo, it will take you 10 minutes to find someone to ask for a cab, and another 20 minutes for a cab to come there (the hotel does not have cabs waiting nearby). On two occassions, we had waited past 30 minutes so we just gave up and ate at one of the restaurants on site. The icing on the cake was when we went to check out and were told someone would call us to walk through the final bill and email us a copy because their system was down. I've called the hotel and keep getting the run around to get a copy of my bill - but they had no problem charging my credit card 2 days after we left depsite no call and no copy of the bill. We got a decent deal to stay there, but all the inconveniences were not worth the vacation days from work.

Our stay was for 4 days, and booked thru Costco Travel, its our first time dealing with them. I mention them because it's plays a part in our trip. Our trip was to just relax enjoy the beach Our package came with full breakfast buffet each day (the buffet was a wide selection of items to choose from, the only thing that was an add'l cost was omelets) we decided not to pay for any extra items since the buffet was hugh. Our room was booked with a garden view and 2 double beds when we arrived that wasn't available so they did offer to upgrade us to a ocean view (no charge). OMG what a view of the ocean can't say enough about the view, (the rooom was average, clean sheets and towels, the beds slept well, that are platform beds with pillow top mattress, its NOT the Waldorf from N.,Y standards) The property of this hotel is beautiful but massive would takes days to discover every feature of this property, and a little scooter or golf cart wouldn't hurt. If your handicapped you need a wheelchair or scooter to get around on the property a lot of walking to get to the elevators, the trolly train they have that takes you to each level in the property. You certainly couldn't walk to get out of the property and eat the local food its too far to walk. The prices are definitly high for simple items, burgers, chicken sandiwiches, flatbread pizzas. The drinks are over priced but tasty. They have their own personal beach but it's on a private island from the grounds which isn't far and they supple the boat to take you over to it, no fee for this service. The staff was very friendly and helpful, they suggested the local restaurants to eat at in the area, but you definitley need a car to get to them or walk thru the back ally to reach them off the premises, don't try that at night cause there are no lights in the back to see where to go, this is a deterrent from keeping the tourists from leaving the grounds and staying on the premises to eat and drink over priced foods. We were surprised that they didn't offer any native food of PR in the restaurants that was disappointing, we didn't want to eat american food but something different. finally to get back to Costco Travel our package also included a 100.00 tour credit. Nothing in the documents stating that if you don't have at least 4/6 people for a tour you DONT GO ON THE TOUR. The tour company 'Elegant Steering' doesnt tell you this until you call and setup a tour, nor does Costco travel tell you this either. Everyone seems to be in the 'LIGHT' but the customer, nothing is said at time of booking the trip or calling the tour company they continued to put us off saying that would try to find people to go on the tour with us, THAT DIDNT HAPPEN EITHER. Frustrated with the tour company and Costco, we rented a car (expensive) and with map in hands went to Old San Juan !! that was the only really disappointing thing about our visit to San Juan. Having said all this I still would return and do a few things differently. Elegance Steering wouldnt do business with them and Costco Travel not sure I would book any future trips with them.

Again renovations needed. Internet: Currently provided by ATT Wireless but broadband signal could be stronger - some room for improvement needed here. A plus though - no extra charge for internet. I hate that annoying $12-$15 upcharge many hotels in Puerto Rico apply for internet access. Lobby and Area restaurants and bars: Good. Food quality and variety good. Casablanca night club is busy on weekends. Also a two pairs of live parrots both green amazon and blue hyacinth macaws, and a single white cockatoo (who loves to say \"hola\") add life and pleasant moments for bird lovers and families visiting the hotel. Casino: No craps tables or baccarat. Conference facilities: Ample, good lighting and acoustics in meeting rooms. Hotel Airport Bus transportation: Excellent. Best value to go back and forth to the hotel otherwise you are in for a very expensive taxi ride roundtrip. Car rental also a smart bet if you want to move around and not feel limited.

I will give a real review of our experience: We had spend our morning on Isla de Viequez and after a great morning of snorkelying and an afternoon in the southern part of El Yunque, we finally arrived at El conquistador worn out and tired. Parking was the first issue I found. We simply wanted to check in and they make that a pain in the tushie. Once we were issued our room tickets we had to quickly get back to our parked car to avoid a charge ~ yeah, a charge to park your car up front while you check in. To park your car you can either valet or park yourself, I was annoyed by this point and parked myself to avoid giving them anything extra after how I was treated when I first arrived. Parking does cost which I found completely ridiculous. I know resorts have to make their money, but 20 a day for parking? Really? Ok, so finally get up to our room which is nice enough but for a waldorf at this price? Not worth it. Refrigerator is really an ice box with no place to put the ice and our phone didn't work which took them about a day to fix. Bird droppings ALL OVER the little porch we had. Room itself was just ok, nice 20 years ago I bet. I would have been HEATED had we paid the original price and not lucked out on hotwire. Coming from a small villa on Isla de Vieques I was surprised to be dissapointed. I will say, Palamino Island is worth the stay. I would maybe come back simply for that. The pools were also very nice with a great view. The food was pricey and not that great where we ate at (sting rays). But the pizza place by the pool is where we ended up doing almost every meal. Pizza's are reasonable. We also found a place to buy our own alcohol on sight which was nice (it's at the ice cream place on your way down to the 'tram'). One thing I thought they were majorly lacking was anything to do at night. For some reason I expected some sort of night club or bar. All we found was a dance and no bar~ mosly teens there I think.

So if you want to escape from children go during the week.The Golden Door spa was very nice and they have several relaxation rooms and steam,cool,hot tub.Went into the little town area just outside the gates of the marina below and the locals were very friendly and welcoming as we walked to otherside of bay area and had a beer in village close to gates.This is a luxury vacation open for those on a budget who can catch the deal when it comes up !We opted for the ride from the resort and it was sooooo worth it as both ways we had the little limo bus to ourselves and they serve you rum and mix on the trip (takes an hour)!", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWorst place if youre looking for a beach\u201d", "Author": "Mauralevit", "ReviewID": "UR120631513", "Content": "The tram to get down to the marina is broken.

After driving from San Juan, and through a not-that-nice strip mall covered Fajardo, driving up to the El Con through their golf course felt like we had warped into another universe. When you enter the hotel through a large outdoor area, looking out across several pools, palm trees, their harbor, to the open ocean... it's definitely something special. They are in a great spot. Very unique. First, the bad... large swaths of the property were closed to maintenance, making the trip to/from our room a bit of an adventure since some elevators and stairwells were off limits. The funicular, which is cool and fast enough, only had one side running, and even that side broke down one day (I get the feeling this happens often) so we had to take a long bumpy van ride back and forth to the harbor one day. We ate a Blossoms on site, and maybe it's just because we were are from SoCal where there is a ton of good Asian food, but the food there was expensive and really just average (but the service was really amazing.) Also, we had some minor problems with our room (ceiling fan not working, bathroom sink caulk not dried and making a big mess. We had some creeps staying next to us the first night that kept slamming their door and yelling at each other at 1am, as well... but I was too tired to complain. Now, the good... our room was in the v-shaped main building at the top of the cliff to the left as you enter, facing the ocean side (some rooms face the light house in Laguna Grande.) I thought the room was just great. Sparkling white, tasteful art, killer bathroom with walk-in closet, an iHome (which we used extensively), and a bed large enough to fit a little league baseball team. Our deck looked out on the harbor, and I spent a lot of time out there drinking Medalla beers. Bliss. The funicular made a bit of noise, but that tapered down at night as people stopped using it. The pools were also very nice, featuring a swim-up bar and great views. We had some nice drinks, waded in the pool, enjoyed a hot tub at sunset... all very relaxing. Some other pluses are the on-site Starbucks, and the little sandwich shop/grocery store that has lots of reasonably (for a resort) priced snacks, drinks, and food. The sandwiches there were perfect to bring out to the island... which gets us to the BEST part of El Con, Palamino Island. They have a catamaran that leaves every hour, free for guests, and takes you on a 10 minute ride out to their little island getaway. We were lucky enough to be \"off\" season and midweek, so there were only a few people on the boat, and maybe 30 people on the island. There are hundreds of beach chair, lots of palm huts and trees for shade. A restaurant, equestrian activities, mini-golf, great snorkeling (if you get outside of the tourist-battered reefs near the beach.) It was heaven, and maybe the highlight of our trip, to sit out at the end of this island, under our own palm trees, and just relax all day. We decided to extend our stay at El Con just so we could do this a second whole day, and did not regret the decision. Just awesome, even though it was a little windy. We felt like celebrities. In conclusion, when you stay at the El Con you can tell it has gone through a lot of \"lives\" and is in some transition. It's not quite the Ritz Carlton, but it has these little glimmers of awesome here and there, and the island experience is a game-changer. Ask to see your room, bring some snacks with you to the island, check the recommendations here for what restaurants (there are several) and food is good, and you'll enjoy your stay. Unless you are hardcore into golfing or tennis, I don't see why you'd need to be here more than 3 or 4 nights. It's a good base to go see El Yunque, if you wanted to stay an extra day for that. I must mention that Keyla from VIP services there was VERY nice to us, delivering chocolate covered strawberries and wine to our room, that we enjoyed on our balcony ti celebrate our honeymoon.

Another couple of average all day, fast food places that are good for light snacks. The hotel was lacking a good selection of bars.

The hotel is very near to a luminecent bay, you can kayak your way there, tours are usually cheaper if you book them in the hotel , just go to the front desk Food is a real problem as I said, we tried a few local restaurant, but nothing I can recomend. sorry.

We overall had a great time and enjoyed being in Fajardo as it's close to the fairy (went to Culbera for the day) and lots of activities such as kayaking and boating adventures. The resort itself is beautiful and has breathtaking views of the ocean - definitely ask to be upgraded to an ocean view room. It's worth it! The house keeping staff was amazing - stopping by two times a day and providing delicious chocolates left on our pillowcase (I ate both mine & my husbands several times). We stayed in the wing of the hotel that was close to the casino, restaurants, shops, etc. which was nice. There are lots of local restaurants around (not necessarily inexpensive like you might think though). But we also ate at a few restaurants on the resort such as the Strip house, we had the breakfast buffet as las brisas, coffee at Starbucks and pizzas one night at cafe bella vista. All was good delicious and the wait staff was very nice and accommodating. However, there are a few flaws that are worth mentioning (I told the management about it as well). We paid around $15 a night for self-parking. Seems pretty easy, huh? Nope! It was a true pain. It took sometimes close to 15- 20 minutes to get from the parking lot to either wait for the shuttle or even sometimes find a spot. Now, keep in mind that we did find out later that there was a big convention with a lot of locals which caused the jam in parking. But they way that I feel is that the parking for the convention should have been separate - not mixed in with the rest of the guest parking. Then, after dealing with the parking situation we went back to our room and heard a screaming baby. I don't mind a baby hungry for a bottle - I mean a baby screaming like no tomorrow. I understand that this is out of their control but I wanted to mention because I didn't want to deal with a crying baby during the rest of the honeymoon (sorry to say that). We went to the front desk and starting talking to a man named, Paul. We explained about the parking and crying baby. He was very apologetic but mentioned that the resort was to it's full capacity that night but to keep him posted on how the noise was, he would be happy to accommodate in any way possible. Thankfully, all turned out OK. Paul, called and left us a message the next night to see if he could do anything to help. We listened to the message and both thought it was nice of him to follow up. To top it off, Paul reached us later on that evening from home and wanted to mention that he went home sick but wanted to call and check on us. He said he he had to leave early but was concerned about how our stay us and was calling from his cell phone AT HOME. WOW - We were both really impressed of his passion to make sure we felt comfortable and were taken care of. He truly went above & beyond to make sure we liked the resort & everything was to our liking. They even took off the night of parking on the bad night and explained that an outside company runs the parking (an issue they were aware of). End of story - it was a beautiful resort and we would stay again.

Maybe our stay was better because it was the off season (first week of October), as I could see that it would quite busy with a full hotel/resort. There were a few days (ie, Monday-Wednesday) when we felt like we were one of the few people in the hotel, so perhaps it has to do when you book a trip here. Through Hilton Honors points, we got a few extra perks to the spa and the casino (which didn't help me), as well as free breakfast (buffet). We used valet parking ($5 more per day than self parking), and they had our car ready and waiting within 5 minutes of me calling. $20/day is still somewhat expensive though, but we ventured out at least once every day to restaurants, el Yunque rain forest, and old San Juan. We thought the extra $5 was worth it. Other than breakfast (good buffet with lots of fresh fruits and breads), we didn't eat at the hotel. We went out to restaurants close by (Tasca OleLelolai, La Estacion), as well as the kiosks at Luquillo (maybe 10 miles away). So, I can't comment on the resort food. Of course it seemed overpriced, but what resort doesn't overprice their food, right? There are plenty of pools and bars in the main area. My favorite bar was the one you can swim up to and order a pina colada. If you take a tram down to the marina area, there are two more pools there, but they seemed more like they were for families. We only went to the marina to catch the ferry to Palomino Island, the resort's private beach. That was like being in a Corona commerical with a drink in one hand and blue waters staring you in the face as you relax under a shaded hut. I want to go back to there. Our room had an excellent view of the water, overlooking the marina. The room was bright, open, and there was lots of space for our 5-day trip. The king bed was super comfy, and waking up to that incredible view was well worth the extra money we paid for the room. If I had a couple of suggestions for the resort, it would be to provide a copy of the bill, or a way to view the charges, sometime before checkout. It took a good 4-5 minutes to go through the charges just to make sure everything was correct. Also, some of the staff in the casino seemed like they didn't want to be there or were carrying on their own conversations, so we felt like we were interrupting them when we asked for drinks, change, or whatever. Other than those couple of things, I would go back tomorrow. Again, for this resort, I think it has to do when you plan your trip. Since this was early October, there were still some restaurants and stores that hadn't opened yet. Still, we were able to find great places to eat and go. I've only been to Puerto Rico in October and November, so I'm sure the busy season would get...well, busy.

I wanted to come back with nothing but rave reviews, this is after all a part of the Waldorf Astoria line. Our overnight stay began when we arrived around 1pm for our friends wedding that was to begin at 5pm. We decided to opt for self parking for the night and lugged our suitcases up to the lobby. Strangely enough, even though we were planning on keeping our luggage with us until we had figured out the check-in situation, no one offered to take our luggage for us. After hiking up the driveway and dragging our suitcases up the stairs to what we thought was the entrance, our fault not theirs, I would have liked to have at least been asked for a little help as we arrived at the lobby. Admittedly, I hadn't double or triple checked the check-in time which I am typically known for before leaving our previous hotel, so when I was told that the room wouldn't be available until 4pm I started going into panic mode. How on earth would we be ready for the wedding only an hour after being let into the room when the ceremony was taking place on the complete opposite end of the resort? So of course, I then ask if there is a possibility of getting a room earlier or if maybe the staff could make the room a priority on their cleaning rotation. The gentleman at the front desk said that he couldn't promise anything and would call if it was available before 4pm. At 3:50, with still no call we went back to the front desk inquiring about our room status. The same gentlemen who had assisted us earlier said that the room was ready, but that the call had not yet been made and for us to disregard it when the automated message came through. Ok, wait, so the room is ready? How long has it been ready and why the hell have we been left so frazzled with now under an hour to shower and make it back to the wedding? This was a big no-no in my book, but I didn't have time to react negatively, I had just enough time to run clear across the property with my wedding date in tow, key in hand, to get ready for the evening and be out again in less than 45 minutes. It should be noted that the room was worth the wait as it had an absolutely breathtaking view of the resort, ocean, and Palomino Island. The bathroom was huge and had a giant walk-in closet with full length mirror, perfect for more than one person getting themselves pretty-fied. The setting on the hillside lent itself to a solid reverberating sing-song of the coqui as the sun was saying its goodbyes for the day. The wedding took place in a number of locations around the resort which gave us a real first hand look around the property. The ceremony took place in the lush Casitas Gardens overlooking the ocean, the cocktail hour took place also overlooking the ocean on one of their many terraces, and the reception was in the Magnolia Ballroom. Each event space was beautiful, you could tell that a lot of effort went into making this a special day. Now, we went from the bad to the good and now we're going back to the bad. The service at this wedding was unreal, and not in a good way. After the cocktail hour, we were all herded into the ballroom for introductions, dinner, dancing, the usual wedding celebratory stuff. The introductions were performed, first dances were danced, the toasts were made by the best man and matron of honor, the first course was brought out and then the DJ starts playing traditional Jewish wedding celebratory music. The bride and groom are being tossed around on chairs, and by the time the hullabaloo of the party kick-off subsides, but while family and friends are still lingering, we return to the table to find that the first course has already been cleared from the table. Ok weird. So we migrate to the bar to grab a cocktail, sit down to eat our second course, and while the best man and groomsmen are still engaged in conversation, the waitstaff try to take their plates. Like a bunch of vultures, the rest of the table yelled for them not to take it away. Funny enough, for as overly attentive as the waitstaff was, alcoholic cocktails were always left on the table. I understand efficiency and keeping a clean table, but this was just too harried and too much like hawking. As for the resort as a whole, I cannot speak enough praise for the spotless, perfectly manicured, and wonderfully constructed compound set atop the cliffs of Fajardo. It is absolutely breathtaking and given that it is so far removed from everything else in the area, and has everything on site including water park, 20+ restaurants, and golf that customers need not leave the premises. It's not my cup of tea, but I can see how others might enjoy it.

The Strip House, which is a steak restaurant, was excellent! It was expensive, but worth it, this is the only place we received very good customer service. The private island is very nice, the snorkeling was great! the beach is clean and not crowded, however, the ferry that takes you to the island that is supposed to run every 1/2 hour was never on time, we waited almost an hour to board one time and the ferry was right there, they just didn't let anyone on and never explained why or gave an apology. The water park is nice, but be careful, they state in the resort information book that you can do a half day either in the morning or late afternoon, but this is not true, they only offer the late afternoon. We had planned our day around this, only to find out it wasn't available when we were there. We had trouble with our door lock, which kept breaking, they did eventually get it fixed (they had to replace the whole unit) but we were locked out more than once. They did not replace our towels when requested, and when they finally did, they only gave us two towels and we had three people. When we asked for information about things to do outside of the resort they were not at all helpful and actually gave us bad information. When we asked if they had computers that we could use to look up information, we were told they didn't have any. We later when walking around the resort found a computer room with computers for guest use (for a fee, which would have been okay, but they didn't even say they had the room). When we brought this up when checking out, they said we must have misunderstood and that they said they just didn't have it right then because the internet service was down. We asked very specifically about the computer and the answer was a flat no, not it was just that the internet service was down. I could go on with other problems, but I'll stop and just add one last thing and that is that you have to pay to park on the resort ($20/day) and the parking is very far away, so if you have trouble walking you will have to use the vallet parking and you'll be waiting a while for them to bring you your car.

I chose this resort on the great reviews from friends of ours here in NYC. Infact, another friend of ours got married out here about 5yrs ago. Let me start by saying that this is a HUGE MASSIVE GIGANTIC RESORT.....over 320 acres i believe! Having read the history of this hotel, there has been over $150m of total renovations etc that has been put in to this property. So when booking it, a return shuttle for 3 of us was $190. Being that the hotel was 1hr drive from San Juan Airport, and the fact that we didnt want to be stuck on the resort, we hired a car from Thrifty Rentals at the airport, and this was the BEST CHOICE we made! The rental cost if (including car seat for our daughter) $90 for 4 days....so this was cheaper than the shuttle! Then add $15/day parking cost at the hotel....it was still cheaper. NOW...this is where the rental car comes in handy...and the reason we saved ALOT of money overall. The resort itself is very expensive once you get there. There are over 15-20 restaurants etc there, so you dont really have to leave the resort BUT it can get costly....Water bottles were $6, a lunch for us 3 would easily run $70. So, i'd jump in the car, drive down the road to the local Walmart or Walgreens, and picked up a CASE of mineral water, some milk for our daughter etc, and we saved alot!!! The rooms here are nice, modern and clean, the service is AMAZING, and the overall appearance of the resort is great. They have a private island (Palomino island) which is a 15min FREE boat ride across and it's amazing. All in all, this was a great trip, and for $1300 for a 4nt stay.....i would definitely not complain! When we were there, Tropical Storm Maria was going to be hitting BUT we got very lucky and the weather was great. Due to this \"Scare\", the resort was dead....so quiet, like a ghost town....which was actually good as we got the whole place to ourselves!

The room was very nice and clean ( I brought my own air freshner which I always do when staying on the water rooms can smell musty) The rest of the stay was nice no hurricane just occasional rain so the trip wasn't ruined.

We ate down by the bay with the locals, Their food was very good in the 3 different restaurants we ate in, not expensive and plentyful, just go to the marina turn left towards the condominiums and follow the road, that also is where the tours are for Bioluminesence is.( a 5 minute enjoyable walk) The only other problem was on our last day there we were in our room taking a nap when someone knocked at our door and then used his key to get in without even giving time for anyone to answer, he had other people with him and apoligized for bothering us (he must have been looking to show the room for a vacation rental) but what if we weren't in the room at the time would they just have come in and showed the room with all our personal stuff in there? Luckily that was our last day because we didn't feel to safe after that.

The hotel seems to be nice from the outside, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even better from the inside. The staffs at Front Desk were always nice. This is not a brand new hotel, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s showing his age with deteriorate painting and maintenance, but in good condition. Here is a list of PROS and CONS: Pros: 1. Have his own private island (Palomino) where you can do a lot of different stuff from playing basketball, sand volleyball to even jet sky and horse riding. 2. Nice Pools. The main hotel has at least 3 pools, one with Volleyball net. The main pool has his own bar, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service at the other pool where they can take your order. 3. Nice and clean rooms. I got an Ocean View room hotel. I heard that the rooms with Golf/Garden View were bigger, but I prefer my ocean view room. I was right up the pools. The rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 services ladies were nice and kind with me. The only thing they need to do the make a better service is to go early to the rooms to make them. Mine they went about 3:00pm. 4. The Terrace Balcony (were dinner and after dinner party was held) was so nice with a Nice View. Also the Room that with use for our meeting was big and beautiful. 5. The food at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Brisas and the other rest. Were good, but a little bit expensive. I pay $30 for a Churrasco with Tostones\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was good, but if you have a car, just drive 5 or 10 min. along the coastline going to the BioBay or the Fajardo Port, and you will find same food for $15 or less. 6. The GOLF course. On Friday I went with some of my friend to play some golf. The staff there was really friendly with us. The golf course is a PGA certified one. It was a nice experience! 7. They got their own rent-a-car at the lobby (enterprise), so if you need a ride to visit Puerto Rico, they can help you with that. 8. The Coqui Water Park. Is not Wet-n-Wild or Aquatica, but it was fun! Got 3 water slides and it was nice for kids as well adult people. Got a lazy river and an endless pool with ocean view. 9. Palomino Island: Good for snorkeling, horse riding, beach volleyball, basketball, jet sky, enjoying the beach, rum and medellas! Cons: 1. The Parking. The parking it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a really bad shape and over that is pretty far from the hotel. So you need to wait for a bus to pick you up and drove you to the Hotel and vice-versa. They need to update their parking lot ASAP. The bus that pick us up, was doing some really strange noises that I thought it could be the front wheel. 2. The Casino closed at midnight, and the bars too! (Only left one bar till 2am, but it was packed!). How are you going to close a full packed casino at midnight? Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the casino supposed to be open until you left with no money? At least they save me a few bucks! 3. The Disco was so laud that nobody was there. I counted 5 people in total at 12:15midnight. 4. The hotel need urgent a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old hotel, and need more attention from the Maintenance people. The painting and the roofs need help urgent! My overall rating for the hotel in a scale from 1 to 10, I gave them an 8.5, and I would likely return back again and stay in the Conquistador.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradford, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation - Expectations Met\u201d", "Author": "David M", "ReviewID": "UR118288473", "Content": "My wife and I just came back from celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary at the El Conquistador. After reading some of the negative reviews, we had some concerns, but were looking forward to our vacation. Here is my take on the resort: - The overall review ratings is about 4 to 4.5 which we think is accurate. Is the resort perfect? No, but it is pretty great. It could use some cosmetic touchups, but that should not be a negating factor. The overall hotel is beautiful to look at, and the views and the grounds are spectacular. - Everyone that we dealt with at the hotel was very friendly and professional. From the valet, to check-in, to the service people at the bars and restaurants. If you get a car, use the valet. For the extra 5 dollars a day, it is worth it. The drinks are pricey, but you are at a resort. What do you expect? - For dinner, we ate off the resort all except for 1 night. La Estacion is about .5 miles from the main entrance. It is worth the trip. The food was great, the service was excellent, and the prices were good (NOTE: Closed on Tues & Wed during off season). At the resort, we ate at Blossoms which is a Chinese/Japanese cuisine. We had the Chinese menu, and it was very good, and the price was a little high, but not bad. - You have to take the ferry to get to Palomino island. You can see the ferry coming back from the island, so time it right, and you do not need to wait long. The ferry ride was nice, and the beaches at the island were very clean. Plenty of lounge chairs to choose from, and many activities on the island. We rented a Wave Runner for 30 minutes, and had a great time. There is sea weed around the shore, but you are in the ocean, what would you expect. I would suggest the water shoes though. - On Friday afternoon, we went back to the pool, and thought we landed at Spring break. The pools were packed with a younger crowd. The music was loud, and everyone was having a good time. Everything was under control, and my wife and I enjoyed watching the different people, having flashbacks to our younger days. If you want quiet, stay on the island. Overall, I recommend the hotel, and I would go back. I am sure some people had a bad experience, but don't let that stop you from going. Some people are always looking for the negatives.

The architecture of the hotel is so nice, and the pools were awesome! The private island is a little piece of Heaven. We have zero complaints about the staff - They were all courteous and helpful. Here's my advice for a wonderful trip. Get plenty of gas before you leave San Juan to head to Fajardo - You won't pass a ton of gas stations. Stop at the kiosks and eat at Luquillo Beach. Authentic and really good. I think we ate at #23. Try to get a deal where breakfast is included. The breakfast restaurant is amazing! Very expensive if it's not included so work it out in your room price. Spend lots of time on the private island. Eat the pizza by the pool. It's excellent. Take the ferry out to Culebra Island. It is like Gilligans Island - so undeveloped and natural. You will be so glad you saw it! Kayak the bioluminescent bay.

We had done our homework before booking, but figured we would see what they were giving us. On the way to the room, my husband (who is Puerto Rican) was chatting with the bellman, and he told us Las Olas was closed for construction. The next day my husband went to the front desk and spoke with Arlene. He relayed our disappointment with our \"upgraded\" room. She appologized, and moved us to a gorgeous suite about 50ft from the ocean in La Marina village. We were very pleased with the upgrade, but unfortunately, our problems did not end there. Our room's A/C unit was leaking, and the carpet in the closet area was saturated. It took 3 calls to the front desk over 2 days, and finally the cleaning lady got someone to fix it! We checked with the front desk before taking the catamaran to their beautiful private Palomino island... and we were told we didn't need any cash... but when we tried to rent a jet ski, the guy told us it was $110 cash. The last day we were there, we returned from the island only to find our room keys wouldn't open the front door to the building. We called 5 times to the front desk, who kept telling us \"security is on the way\"... but after 45minutes of standing in the hot sun, only a call to the general manager got us any results ! Once we discussed our issues with the GM, security was there in minutes. The managers Dermott Connolly and Jesus Roman were more than appologetic for our inconveniences. They personally brought us new room keys, sent us champagne and strawberries, and offered a dinner at the restaurant of our choice. We were very pleased with their great customer service and willingness to remedy the situation. El Con is definately a beautiful resort, but for the price, I would expect more. The room was gorgeous, the view and Palomino Island was spectacular! Booking during hurricane season is risky, but the resort was empty most of our stay... and it was awsome! For the price of a room, we felt the parking and the water park should be complimentary for guests. In all the hotels we have ever been to, we've never paid $25/day to park!

At first we had a reservation for 3 rooms and when we arrived, we inquired into a Casita. We had stayed at a Casita as a couple once before, however, not with our family. We had ages 14 through 82 and everyone found something they loved. We especially liked having a pool by our room in the evenings for a final dip after excursions or the beach. And, when we would get to our room, our butler had fulfilled any requests that we made during the day, such as bringing bottled water getting fresh fruit or a few extra towels/sundries. If you wanted it, they got it. El conquistador sits on the side of an elevated hill/mountain and though the terrain is steep, the Casita drivers would come by with a limo golf cart to take us to the main lobby or to the golf course. And of course, would pick us up after dinner at one of the restaurants or Casino and take us to the room. While you could walk, sometimes it was just as well to take the cart. We dined at the Asian restaurant on Sushi and Japanese styled grill, and were constantly watched by our host, no water glass left unfilled. Pricing for the restaurants was typical of any resort.

After about 3 hours (no joke), we went to a room at the Marina part of the resort. The room was nice, but the pool nearby has no services - just a towel stand - and you literally had to take a couple of elevators, a tram and walk quite a long way to get to the main hotel. This is not feasible when you are traveling with small children. We went back to the Las Casitas and finally got checked into a room there about 4 after initially arriving at the hotel around 11. Service - The service at the Las Casitas is quite good. The have folks who come around to see if you need drinks/food at the Infinity Pool. (At the main pool at the hotel, there is no service, but there are a couple of bars/cafes nearby where you can get what you need.) In addition, the restaurant service was very good. The ladies who work at the reception in the Las Casitas were exceptional and helped us in many ways. Rooms - our initial room in the Marina part of the hotel was nicely decorated and had an ocean view. Except for the location, it would have been suitable. The room at the Las Casitas was a studio with a small kitchen, ocean view and a hot tub on the back deck. The small kitchen was great to have for our 19 month old. The only gripe I had about the room, was the shower, which was broken. The shower head had a leak where the head attached to the wall and a lot of water leaked all over and onto the floor. Most importantly, the rooms were clean and nicely appointed. Food - The food is pretty good, but boy did I feel gouged. In addition, do not come here thinking you or your kids will have a lot of healthy options. It was hard to locate a vegatable. We ate breakfast at the restaurant at the Las Casitas. It is your standard breakfast buffet, which in my opinion is overpriced for what you get. Also, it was the same everyday that we were there. $19 for fruit (pineapple, watermelon, canteloup, orange, grapefuit, honeydew), bacon, sausage, potatoes, pancakes or french toast, pastries, oatmeal, dry cereal, yogurt, scrambled eggs. No omlet station or waffle station. We had two nice dinners (with our daughter) at the Italian place and at Strip House. Again, good food but high prices and the wine was extremely expensive.

We stayed for 2 nights several years ago and had a nice stay, although the time was so limited that we really did not have time to enjoy most of the amenities. This August I had a conference in San Juan and we decided to spend three nights at Conquistador prior to the conference. We were quite apprehensive given the reviews on this site, but decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we did. Following advice on this site we booked one of the Las Brisas rooms (third floor) and had fabulous views of the ocean and Palomino Island, as well as the hillside below the room which. If you look carefully in the morning, the hillside is full of large iguanas sunning at the tops of the trees. We went to Palomino Island both full days of the trip and had a fabulous time. We did not expect much from the snorkeling given the reviews here and elsewhere, and there is little coral to be found. But we saw schools of various fish, two species of butterfly fish, trunkfish, puffers, a barracuda, and best of all on our last snorkeling bout just as we were about to leave the water we saw an eel! The snorkeling definitely exceeded our (limited) expectations. Oh, and the frozen mudslides were awesome. Our room was clean and the furnishings were bright and modern, didn't care for the vinyl couch but it looked nice. Best part of the room was the balcony and that awesome view; hanging out on the balcony in the evenings listening to the coqui and feeling the gentle breezes was really magical. And watching the morning curtains of rain come through was really something. Breakfast as Las Brisas was included in our package and while there was always what looked like a long line to get in, it moved very quickly and never took us more than 10-15 minutes to be seated. Breakfast was plentiful enough that we skipped lunch each day. We found service to be helpful and friendly, it didn't seem to us that the staff were unhappy in general. Negatives - the air conditioning unit in the room created condensation on the floor; no big deal we wiped it up. Food is expensive, but that's to be expected. I agree that the food is very hit and miss. The first night we ate at the pizza and pasta restaurant - my pizza was delicious and my husband enjoyed his sandwich but was still hungry after. The next two nights we ate at the Bally hoo Grill next to the water - great view and ambiance but food, again, was highly variable. I had one of the best Cuban sandwiches I have ever had (and remember, I live in Florida) - OMG the roasted pork in that sandwich was phenomenal. On the other hand the previous night I ordered churrasco, something that the cook should be able to make in his sleep - ugh, very odd texture and not a lot of flavor. Although the food could have been better, that did not significantly impact our enjoyment. We loved our time at El Conquistador.

The reviews were all over the place. Needless to say after reading some of the reviews I was very worried. But for every bad review there seemed to be at least two good ones. When we arrived at the resort we opted for self parking instead of valet parking (always looking to save a few bucks). Signs could have been clearer. The resort is on the top of a hill. The parking is about 1/3 of the way down the hill. There was an attendant there who sat in his car, and there was a make shift tent for shade. We had to wait for the van, which was very dirty on the inside and packed with people who where just there to use the water park. We threw our luggage in the back and anxiously awaited whatever came next. Had we known, or had the attendant told us, we could have just driven up to the resort, dropped off our luggage and I could have just waited for my husband to go park and return either on fit or in said dirty van. Once we were up to the resort, my fears allayed a little. It looked gorgeous from the outside. Open and airy. We went inside and waited awkwardly for a few moments for reception to address us. From there on out it was all smiles, pleasantries and helpfulness from the staff. We had been upgraded to a full ocean view room (Hilton Honors member, plus low season). We were directed to our room and walked through the incredbly spacious and well-enough appointed lobby areas complete with caged tropical birds. We walked past the rum bar, starbucks, casino, cafe and shops. OK. Good. I am liking this. I mean anything with Starbucks gets kudos in my mind. We reached a carpeted area which was worn and in need of a good vacuuming. Worried again. We took the elevator \"down\" to the fourth level. Remember, it is on a cliff. There was a walkway past the rooms that opened up to a gorgeous courtyard. It smelled wonderful, and later I would learn that it sounded wonderful too. Resident lizards and iguana were everywhere. We opened the door to our room. It clearly needed a little updating, but it was spacious and very very clean. The bathroom was huge. We walked out onto the balcony, and I was hooked. The view of the ocean and surrounding hills and cliffs was beyond spectacular. The breeze came right off the ocean. This place surprised me on every turn. It is a very large property with a lot to do or absolutely nothing to do. The pools were clean, warm like bathwater, bouyant. The jacuzzis were too hot to use, however. There was a swim up bar in the main pool, which was fun. However, we soon learned to stick to wine and beer - and this is probably my biggest complaint about the place. Everything is expensive, that is true, but it is resort - you are a captive audience and you kind of have to expect that - so I was OK with that, but, every bar where we ordered a rum or other liquor drink served very, very watered down versions. My husband and I were trying to figure it out because usually we saw them pour the drinks and they seemed to be generous enough with the liquor. We could only assume the bottles must be watered down. Now we are not lushes by any stretch, but if I am paying $12-$14 for a fru-fru drink, or $9 for a rum and coke, I want some rum in it. Otherwise, I will just order a $3.50 coke. I am not making any accusations, that was just our observation. Certainly, melting ice could be a factor. After day 2, we were happy to order Coronas at the bar and wine with dinner. nbd. While there we did a tour of the El Yunque Rain Forest. That was amazing, especially since we were there only a couple of days after the re-opened it following the clean up after the hurricane. It really is a site to see and I will always remember the way it smells. We went over to Palamino Island twice. It is really the perfect beach spot. Again, we were off season and we took the first boat over and we had the island almost to ourselves for a while. There had a lot to do there, plenty of chaise lounges and tiki umbrellas. The water was warm. The first time we saw some jellyfish so we stayed out of the water most of that day. The next day we didn't see any, so we spent a good deal of time in the water. My husband and I decided it probably wouldn't be much fun in the high season. It was obvious some of the areas of theproperty needed some work and I wasn't sure how much of it was normal upkeep or issues from the recent hurricane, but they had people working on the property non-stop - painting, mowing, trimming, cleaning, serving. I was amazed by how many employees they have. And everyone was pleasant and helpful. That having been said, for the most part, is was an awesome, awesome property. I loved hearing the Coqui at night, but it might anoy the heck out of some people. For the first couple of days my husband and I had an ongoing \"argument\" about whether the sounds were natural or piped in. I thought they were too perfect and rhythmic to be natural and I kept telling him they were piped in in \"Disney-esque fashion.\" I soon realized I was wrong. Also, our room was too close to the Funicular and we started hearing that go at about 6:00 a.m. All in all, we would go back in a heartbeat. It was a marvelous place for some serious downtime. M.

Gorgeous ocean views throughout property, amazing white-sand, turquoise water at Palomino Island. The service was far better than we have had at other Puerto Rican beach resorts. Staff was efficient, timely, and helpful. The forecast said it was going to be raining all three days, but each day was sunny (partly cloudy) and the nights were damp and warm. The pools were practically empty, so we felt like we had the resort to ourselves. We also looked into staying at the St. Regis, Bahia Beach, but that was $500 a night including taxes. One night we ate at Blossoms, which was delicious. Service was quick! First night we just drove down to the local Sizzler which was also clean. The only negative thing about the resort is that it needs some more upkeep (and TLC) because it gets pummeled during hurricane season. Our room was clean, but not squeaky clean. There was a stale urine smell throughout room, not sure if this was due to moisture accumulation overtime when door is open or cleaning with a dirty mop bucket. Everything was decorated white, so you do see stains from past guests which is kind of gross, hallway carpet needs to be replaced. Coqui water park was a blast, and a half day was about 12 dollars. Worth it because those pools are idyllic as well and the slides are a blast. Mostly adults on the slides! Saw a small nurse shark in shallow water on Palomino, but considering there's not a ton of fish to see while snorkeling, this was exciting.

We came for an event that was held here over the weekend. We were pleased to see that the resort was on the AMEX fine hotels and resorts program-- we have never been disappointed with any hotels on that list... Until now. We will be complaining to Amex and asking them to remove this dump from their list. I cannot believe this is one of the waldorf Astoria collection hotels-- I wouldn't even rank it as being as nice as your average Hilton. We were in two different rooms/ areas-- the views are beautiful- best part about the resort. Both rooms reeked HORRIBLY of mold/mildew- awful, overwhelming sour smell, yuck! Hard to sleep comfortably when your sheets and the entire room smell this way. Also-- the sheets-- the maids make the beds up and leave the bottom quarter of the mattress uncovered- what the heck?! The sheets are not of nice quality to begin with and I certainly don't want to sleep on the bare mattress. I thought maybe it was an error that would be corrected the next day... Nope, they just straighten your sheets, dont remake the bed. The grounds were nice, buildings in MUCH need of repair! This hotel is just not maintained. Furniture, doors, hallways, paint etc are all dingy, dirty... Just gross. Also- you can expect to see 95% of the people here are locals. The way the property is marketed makes the \"private island\" sound enticing... Just a pain in the you know what really. To get to said private island you have to hike across the resort, take the elevator down, then take the funicular, then get on the ferry... I knew this ahead of time and didn't think it would be a big deal, but I would MUCH rather be at a place that just had it's own beach right on the hotel property without so much hassle. This resort is equivalent of an all inclusive tropical hotel, which we have decided is not the way for us, and were very disappointed that this is what we got when we expected so much from a waldorf Astoria property that is NOT an all inclusive. The food on the resort is no good and very expensive to boot! The breakfast buffet was edible, but barely! Strip House was average at best with terrible service-- took more than an hour for us to get our food when we were one of three tables in the entire restaurant. As a whole, the service at this resort is sub-par. We are diamond Hilton Honors members AND booked with an AMEX bock card for the fine hotels and resorts program-- instead of getting better service I feel we got worse service. The private island was alright, but not the relaxing upscale environment i expected-- overcrowded, no privacy karaokee blasting... Local yokals with their coolers full of medell, and no servers to be found. The beach is not ever combed or raked and is badly in need of it. Most resorts with beaches pick up the chairs and rake the sand each day, not this one! The waterpark was alright- pretty small and kind of a ripoff- this should be included i your stay. Spa is nothing special, but that is one of the nicer things of the resort-- very small though and extremely overpriced. We are not cheP people, and we are used to paying alot of money for good food and spa services etc, but just dont waste your time and money.

The hotel has its own power plant - so whereas most of the island was without power, it barely affected the hotel - we even had cable and internet. I think the family villas were without power. Food and Drink at the hotel was expensive - i.e. $22 for two small plastic cups of wine at the Rum bar and $100+ dollar dinners without alcohol - but considering the situation, we were glad the restaurants were open. My wife and I ventured out of the hotel to a local area that was interesting. If you exit through the Employee Parking Only exit (opposite from the water park) - through a big white gate on the ground (beach) level, and walk 5 minutes along the road, you come to a small area with about 10 little shops and restaurants. Only 1 was open at the time, and had its own power generator. Food was local and very cheap - about $20 for 3 beers, 2 wines, and meals for 2 of us. It was open air and chickens were walking under the tables. I'd be a little nervous about traveling that route at night, but daytime was fun, and a couple of stray dogs accompanied us.

The Golden door spa was to die for - make sure you ask for daily discount if you go there. I got 15% off service just by asking. The hotel has ferry that takes you to their private island; which was really nice. Then for our children, they have the water park. It's more worth it if you choose the half-day option. The restaurants were mostly overpriced, so we can't really comment on them. We did try their restaurant by the ferry dock. They have $9 daily special (pulled pork wrap & hotdog, both were delicious). Then we ate at the fastfood restaurant by the water park. Nothing special, just another fast food joint but convenient due to the location. They also have golf course and little shops scattered around the ground. There was walmart, local grocery & Walgreen 5 minutes away from the hotel - really really useful information from Tripadvisor reviewers. We stocked our breakfast items, water, even waterproof camera from Walmart. If you have a rental car, I suggest you to try out restaurants around the hotel. One of our favorites was El Calvadero, very close to the marina. On a rainy day (which happened to us one day during our stay), you can drive to the outlet mall which was about 20 min away. On your way there, you can stop at one of the restaurants at Luquillo for lunch or dinner. It may not be budget friendly, but they have really good food (Ceviche hut, etc).

The moment we first walked into our room, my heart dropped. We had seen pictures online from the resort page and it looks very clean and up-to-date. However, this is far from the case. I expected a 4 star resort room and this room reminded me of a Days Inn at best. The \"white\" couch was filthy with hairs and stray marks all over it. The carpet was extremely dated. Actually everything about the room was dated. If you are expecting modern, this is not it. Trust me on this, if you care at all about cleanliness, you will be VERY disappointed and uncomfortable in these rooms. We experienced several issues with housekeeping. I'll list a day by day: Day 2: We returned from a day at the beach and of course, had some sand carried back with us to the room. Some actually got in the sheets (housekeeping had not been to our room at this time). This was around 4:00. We showered and went out for dinner hoping that when we returned housekeeping would have been there. We stopped by the front desk to ask for a toothbrush and they said they'd send it right down. I also asked if housekeeping automatically comes to the room or not because no one had come before we left. We were informed \"they tidy up after 7\" so we took this to mean that it was 7 in the evening...however, when we returned to our room, still no sign of housekeeping service. I had to call again and request the toothbrush and they insisted it was left on the sink. We searched and never found a toothbrush and called once again. They finally brought it. Day 3: We decided to put the Housekeeping Please sign in our door to make sure they came this day. We returned from the beach, only to find that the only service provided by housekeeping was they made our beds (with the same dirty sheets) and dropped off towels. No vacuuming, no cleaning the bathroom, etc. I called and was transferred to housekeeping and requested they provide us with clean sheets. They did send two women down who changed our sheets. Day 4: I raised the sheets up because I noticed my feet were touching the mattress. We investigated further, only to find that they had put the sheet on sideways. The bottom 1/4 of the bed was not covered by a sheet. So we turned it the right way and realized they had not placed a king size sheet on our bed, and turned it sideways in hopes that we wouldn't notice that we were actually lying on the bare mattress. I called and requested sheets to actually fit our bed. They sent one male down that barely spoke English and he handed me the sheets and walked away. We had to make our own bed that night. But luckily the sheets actually covered the entire bed. The rest of our stay they never once cleaned the toilet, shower, wiped the sinks, vacuumed, etc. You only get clean sheets if you request them. The rooms were filthy in every corner there is dirt and filth that has accumulated for who knows how long. For the majority of our stay, only one of the two boat taxis were in-service, so if you missed the boat to the island, you really were going to wait an hour before you could be transported over or to return to the resort. If you are wanting a RELAXING vacation, this is not the place for you. You have to rush in everything you do if you are going to the beach. We had to catch the tram up to breakfast each morning, fight the massive crowds at Las Brisas, hurry and ride the tram back down the hill and time it just right so you can catch the one boat that is actually in service to head to the beach. You then must fight the crowds in line to make sure you get a seat on the boat and not get left behind. Then once you make it to the island, you have to race to get one of the limited umbrellas. It just seemed like we were constantly in a hurry to \"relax.\" Also, we weren't there to play golf and it's a good thing we weren't because they were doing maintenance on the golf course. We were not notified ahead of time and the remedy was to offer a 50% discount on golfing. Besides our issues with the room itself and the uncleanliness, the service is not what you would expect. Several other people we talked to complained of this as well. You would have to wait 20 minutes or longer for a drink refill at dinner. They see your glass is empty and walk right past you as if they don't even notice you. We would almost have to knock somebody down to get a refill or to even place and order once we were seated. Last, as I'm sure others have mentioned, you will pay tremendously for food. Expect $50 per person at least if you are going to one of the nicer restaurants. Expect $25 per person for a small lunch meal. We recommend the Strip House. It was our favorite and the service was actually up to par. Sorry I don't have many positives to mention. Every other vacation we have been on I have been extremely pleased and had many positive things to mention. I really just can't think of any with this resort other than that the views are amazing with the mountains and the ocean. Overall, I do not recommend this resort.

Fernando was a hilarious bartender as well as others that accompanied him at the small restaurant/bar up top. We definitely enjoyed our stay at El Conquistador Resort.

The views are amazing...perched on a cliff with views of the ocean that go on for days. The lobby is has an open and welcoming feeling and all of the staff (at least that I came across) is extremely helpful. With all of that being said there were a few things that concerned me. Considering this is a 4 star resort there was quite a bit of maintenance that needed to be done on the grounds. The pools at night weren't illuminated (which i noticed a few lights but i could tell some of them were out) The elevators to take us down to the marina weren't working. The funicular was leaking inside. Some of the decorative pillars they have look like they haven't been painted in years. Now, my room was more than spacious but it wasn't as clean as i would expect. Our couch had stains and so did our curtains. The bathroom ceiling had black spots on it (couldn't tell if it was bugs or something else) and our drains had a funny smell coming out. Also, I was there during hurricane Irene and I was surprised at how well the resort took care of everyone. The night of the hurricane they kept all of the staff there. It was too unsafe for them to leave. They tried to keep everyones mind off the storm. The had a dj, lots of board games for the kids, played movies, had the bars open. The next morning all of the staff was hard at work cleaning up the mess the storm had made. The resort fed everyone for free for breakfast and lunch which was a nice surprise. I felt that the resort really tried to keep everyone comfortable and that counts for something.

The sad part is it was the highlight of the vacation. I do not even know where to start. This resort is in the final stages of its life cycle. There should be a sequel to the movie the \"Shining\" at this place. It is evident that it once was a magnifient resort but many areas of the resort are simply abandoned. We stayed in the Las Olas section which could not even compare to a Best Western. The restaurant and outside bar on this level was abandoned many years ago. The only somewhat nice thing was the semi clean pool and jacuzzi. The rooms are outdated from the 1980's. The drains where clogged from the debris from the hurricane and flooded the entire upper level. We had 4 inches of water in our room. This of course was not anyones fault. The water made its way down the steps and flooded both lobbys and made its way through some of the ceilings on the lower levels. This section should be condemed after the hurricane but they have no intention of doing so. The rugs should of been changed 10 years ago never mind the destruction from the hurricane. They are simply sucking the water up and spraying chemicals to try to mask the unbearable mold smell. They moved us to the lower section of this building to one of the few rooms that did not get flooded. The smell of mildew and mold from the hallway started to penetrate the rooms. The trams to take you up and down the hill to your room are always breaking and should be retired long ago. They are on the verge of being unsafe. Listen to the other reviews. This resort gives you nothing. I mean nothing. The water park is cute but they have the audacity to charge you. The water park cost me $53. for 2 children and one adult. I am from New York and nothing surprises me concerning prices until I came here. I read the reviews and was very prepared. The first day we went VIA taxi($30) to the food store and stocked up on water wine beer and snacks for the kids. If you go down to the marina and walk to the left you can take a 7 minute walk to the local little town where you can get delicious food very cheap. I recommend the freshly made Tacos! As I said before the resort is in the fimall stages of its life. They fill the place up by doing extensive advertising to get the locals to go there for 70-80 bucks a night. If your airfare is paid already, do yourself a favor and book any other hotel. You cannot get anymore easy to please people than my family and I have to say this was the #1 worst vacation I ever had and it was not due to the hurricane. The hurricane only allowed us to momentarily make some excuses for the place. There is no where to run and hide from the ridiculous prices on premise. There is 17-18 dollar hamburgers. 30-50 dollar al la carte dinner entres, 10-11 dollar ice creams, 10-15 dollar drinks. This is not a place to bring the family. It can financially ruin you!

Literally EVERYTHING has gone wrong since we've been here. It took the front desk almost 2 hours to check us in, and we were not informed that you had to pay upfront. We were told you paid at the end of your vacation by our travel agent, and she clearly lied. The resort also neglects to tell you that you have to pay $100 a night security deposit UP FRONT, so there's an addition $700 fee they just decided not to tell you about before hand.The staff that checked us in we're EXTREMELY RUDE and we're literally laughing at us for being frustrated that THEY were taking so long. They \"upgraded\" our room.....dirty rug, stained walls, NO microwave, TV wasn't working....keep in mind we paid about $3000 for this room for a week. No god damn microwave....I've stayed in dump hotels that at least have a microwave, but here at this so called \"resort\", you have the pay to rent a microwave. You have to pay for laundry services, can't just do it yourself. We were told breakfast was free, and they charged us $70 for 3 people to eat breakfast. We've been experiencing bad weather, and they have shut down all the pools, no boats are going out to Palomino island, the elevators are all shut off, the salon is closed....so basically we're paying ridiculous amounts of money to sit in our rooms. We went to the resorts \"nicest\" Italian restaurant last night, it took them 30 minutes to even ask us what we wanted for drinks, then another 30 to bring them to us. ALL AROUND AWFUL SERVICE. Every person we have dealt with so far has been extremely rude. Everything is very expensive, and don't believe anything is \"all-inclusive\" for two seconds because I can assure you its not. Basically, we have been extremely unsatisfied thus far, and my optimism for the remainder of our vacation is diminishing with every experience we have. I would not recommend this place to anyone, I would rather stay in a one room shack on the beach. Awful service all around.

We were there 8 nights, 7 days. I found the El Con staff very accomodating and helpful in all aspects. I read the reviews and can confirm the pricing for meals and drinks are very expensive and recommend getting a deal for breakfast included in your stay (as we did.) Other than that, the resort was all it shows and more! We did all the activities kid oriented -- including going to Palomino, Little Palomino, Coqui waterpark, horseback riding, jet skiing, snorkeling, Bio Bay, El Yunque, riding in a horse drawn carriage in downtown San Juan, ziplining, scuba diving and especially playing in the pool. The resort staff were courteous and very responsive. We had two issues with the room (hair dryer didn't work and kid-locked safe), and both were addressed within 3 hours of our call. The kids loved the waterpark and I loved that it wasn't crowded. The funicular was quick and we did not have to wait often for a car. The views were FANTASTIC and the island is very beautiful. We had dinner one night at Blossoms and the kids loved the hibachi. To save a bit of money, rent a car and do El Yunque, ziplining, and San Juan on your own. El Yunque was a big hit -- do the La Mina trail and play in the pool at the bottom of the waterfall. Go early -- we got there about 10:30 AM and it was already getting crowded. San Juan is great and we were lucky to be there during a Culinary Festival in the old town. On the way back, we also hit McD's and Wal-Mart for cold cuts, etc. to save a few $ at lunch/dinner. You don't need a GPS if you have one on your cell phone, plus the directions Enterprise gives are easy to follow. Also, for the Bio Bay tours, walk to the nearby public marina -- go to the Dive Shop at the bottom of the hill, head out the gate to walk (15 minutes, maybe?) through the parking lot and out of the resort. The kids loved it and we had a really good time paddling in the mangroves. My 7 year old turns out to be an excellent kayaker! Be sure to check the moon cycle to pick the best night and either call or get there early to get a spot. We almost didn't get to go as everyone was busy that night. I TOTALLY recommend this resort and Puerto Rico as a family vacation destination. Luckily, we hit the weather timing right and had sun with just a few rain showers during our stay (we got out before hurricane Irene made landfall.) We did see a lot of jellyfish in the water, which is apparently common in August, so I'd recommend going earlier in the summer when the water is cooler. My oldest got stung, but she got an ice pack on it very quickly, and by evening the welts were gone. Pack your own snorkel gear (mask and snorkel) to save the daily rental -- you don't need fins as the coral is in knee to chest-deep water off the east coast of Palomino's beach. When I went diving with Casa Del Mar (great experience and fantastic sea life), I saw a bunch of jellies, but managed to avoid them during the dive. Do the morning 2 tank dive set -- we saw lobster, 2 sea turtles, huge sea fans that are in pristine condition, flounder, stingray, eel, tons of fish, and a whole field of conch. You can rent all of your dive gear at the shop which was nice and easy. Robert is an excellent divemaster! The island is lush and beautiful and everyone is very friendly.

At check-in we were upgraded to an Ocean View room, which was a very nice touch. The resort itself is massive with three different levels overlooking the Ocean. Our room was at the top, and afforded some incredibly picturesque views. Here's what you need to know about El Conquistador (in order of importance): 1. The restaurant prices are borderline exorbitant, so be prepared for sticker shock if you don't have a meal plan. Example - Lunch on the private island (2 sandwiches and drinks) was $58. I highly recommend getting off the resort at least once for a dinner in Fajardo or Las Croabas (try La Estaction right outside the resort - EXCELLENT). 2. The beach - which is lovely - is accessible only by the resort's catamarans. You have to plan ahead because it can take a good 10 minutes to get from your room all the way down to the marina (via the cable car-like Funicular), and the boats leave on the hour (7-10 minute trip). They return from the island at the bottom of the hour. The boats run from 9 AM - 5:30 PM. 3. Breakfast at Las Brisas ($20/pp) was a pretty good value and since it's a buffet, you get your money's worth and can skip an expensive lunch. 4. As stated in #1, try to get off the resort for at least one day. The resort has an Enterprise Car Rental at the front desk, but ***DON'T BOOK YOUR RENTAL AT THE DESK***. Make sure you book online, where you will literally save 50% off the quote they give you at the desk. Also, cars rented from Enterprise on-site park free on the resort (it's $16/day if you bring in an outside car) 5. It's about a one-hour drive to and from SJU Airport, so it's a good idea to pre-book roundtrip transfers from El Conquistador (~$70 pp), but make sure you leave plenty of time for your departure...leave at least 3 hours prior to your flight time! 6. If you have booked a Bioluminescent Bay kayaking expedition, you can walk there from the Marina level along an access road (sounds creepy, but it's well lit). Highly recommend doing this excursion...it's fascinating. 7. This wasn't an issue for us, but I would say that if you or someone you're traveling with has a disability or is in a wheelchair, this is not a great place to go. Far too many hills and inconveniences (like getting on and off a boat, etc...) that would really detract from your enjoyment of this place. Overall, we really enjoyed our time there and found it to be an unbeatable location with very friendly hotel and restaurant staff, all of whom are bilingual.

I would not recommend this hotel. There is nothing about it that makes you believe you are staying at a Waldorf Astoria (even hotel book in the room with information on services doesn't mention that they are part of the Hilton chain). We were thinking maybe Hilton recently acquired the El Conquistador but haven't yet renovated it to make it the caliber to call it a Waldorf Astoria. Arrival/Check-in We arrived by rental car around 6pm, there were a group of bell hops standing around talking and after we unloaded our car and brought the bags to the curb, then one decided to ask if we needed help. At that point, we just needed to roll them up the ramp to the lobby. The front desk help was mediocre when checking in. And they have all guests wear paper/plastic bracelets so that you can use resort facilities. But if you lose the wristband (which is the kind that will fall off in a day with a lot of swimming), the hotel charges you $25 for a replacement. Imagine having an 8, 6 and 3 year old wear them and having to worry that they got lost. If the bracelet breaks off and you bring it to the front desk, they will give you a replacement at no cost, but if it is lost, you have to pay the $25. It seemed like a ridiculous policy, particularly since no one checked our wrists to make sure we could take the funicular (which is only for hotel guests). Pool/Facilities The pools at the resort are open 24 hours which sounds great until one evening at 6pm we decided to go for a swim with the kids. There were no towels, so I asked the staff and was told that the towel service closed at 6pm and they left whatever towels were available on the stand. If there were no more towels, then we were supposed to go to our rooms and get the towels from there. So I went to the front desk to ask for pool towels, it took 20 minutes for them to go to the laundry and get fresh towels. Besides the towels, it was much nicer using the pools in the evening than during the day because it was less visible how dirty the pools were (the water was cloudy and the tiles on the edges needed to be scrubbed down to kill the green bacteria growing). I know I had read on the website that there was a waterslide in the pool, but there wasn't one in the upper pools (although the hotel book in the room said there was a slide and a lap lane pool...). Of course there is the Coqui Waterpark that has 3 waterslides. You need to pay extra to go, but the pools are so much cleaner and the park is much better maintained! You really can't spend a day at the park, so I suggest getting a 1/2 day ticket. If you go at 1:30pm, the rates is reduced by about 40%, so we went to Palomino Island in the morning, then to the park in the afternoon. Restaurants/Food If you are traveling with kids and are concerned about the costs, it is best to eat outside of the hotel whenever possible. The food is overpriced and just mediocre. Even the kids meals are expensive. And unlike other Hilton's and Waldorf Astoria's that are offering free kids meals with an adult meal purchase, the El Conquistador offers no deals for families. In fact, it felt like they needed to make a buck where ever they could (in the room they offer 12 oz water bottles for $3.50 each and the Marriott we stayed in later in the week in San Juan gives 2 bottles free each day). Your best option for a reasonable lunch with the kids at the resort is at the Starbucks at the resort. There are a selection of fresh, warm sandwiches for about $6, which is a steal. We ate 2 dinners at the hotel. One at the cafe outside by the pool which was an Italian style pizzeria. The other at the cafe by the marina. Both meals were average. We had a fabulous meal at a restaurant down the street from the hotel which was far superior to anything we had a the hotel. Room Quality We had a garden view room with 2 queen beds. Our room looked right over the tennis courts and we could see the ocean to the right in the far distance. The room was like the rest of the hotel, run down. I don't believe they vacuumed the room daily because there were some nasty dust balls on the rug for 2 days that I just ended up picking up with a tissue. When we arrived we had an ant infestation on our balcony (we believe the previous guest had spilled a sticky drink out there). They came to clean it (by first spraying some unhealthy bug spray), when we returned after dinner, there were still some ants, but it was better than before. The tub in the bathroom did not look very clean, and luckily there was no stopper for the kids to take a bath, so they all took showers. We were disappointed in the hotel and think if they didn't advertise as a Waldorf Astoria, we may not have had such high expectations.

Although our last visit was about 6 years ago it seems that the hotel has not been maintained since. The hotel provides its own private transportation from airport. We had to wait close to an hour to get the bus, standing and waiting outside the airport in over 90 degree weather. We began to worry immediately that we were going to be disappointed and we were. We initially had garden rooms and upgraded to ocean view. However, the rooms were run down and one couple noticed black mold on the ceiling of their room. We complained and were moved to another building. Although the rooms were somewhat nicer than the previous ones, they were not really all that nice. However it seemed they had been recently painted since you could smell fresh paint. There is no turn down service at night and the cleanliness was questionable at times. The grounds could be beautiful as the hotel sits upon a mountain overlooking the Caribbean sea. The view is spectacular. However, the grounds are in need of major repairs. Much of the brick and cement work is broken and cracked. The beautiful foliage is overtaken by weeds in many spots. The canopies are torn and dirty. The tile around the pool is loaded with black and green mold. You have to take a boat shuttle to the beach which was nice but unfortunately jelly fish arrived at the same time as us. This, of course, is not the fault of the hotels but it left us with only the moldy pools to frequent. You need water shoes at the beach because the bottom is loaded with rocks and coral. There is no waitress or waiter service by the pools or at the beach. Additionally there is only one person manning the bar at the pool so the wait was long at times for a badly needed refreshment as weather was blistering hot and pool water was warm and not refreshing at all. The casino of our memory was much better. Apparently the economy forced them to lay off many dealers and therefore, they no longer have a craps table. The only card tables are blackjack and Caribbean stud. There are also slots but all in all a big disappointment. It also was only open from 4pm to 2 am. There are a variety of little shops right on the grounds if you like to shop. The restaurants for dinner were nice and the food was good. We ate at the steakhouse which had the best food. The Italian restaurant was also very nice. The Japanese restaurant, although provided good food, rushed us and we were done in less than an hour. Breakfast lacked variety. There is a buffet or you can have eggs your way or an omelet for an extra $6. There is a water park with a few slides, a lazy river, and an infinity pool. The infinity pool however is the same pool that the kiddie slide is in so it loses some of its appeal. The water park is extra money and unless you have children probably not worth going to. All in all we were very disappointed and will not return again.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed - hotel in decline!\u201d", "Author": "NYTom007", "ReviewID": "UR116782741", "Content": "Had stayed at the El Conquistador about 15 years ago and had always wanted to return as we both had been very impressed by the quality of the hotel and service. Unfortunately, the less than flattering reviews we read were accurate. There is no doubt that the hotel needs some TLC or the entire structure will fall into disrepair. For example, you have to use the \"furnicular\" to get to the marina/ boat to the beach. These gondolas have bottoms that are rusted through in some places. Due to the proximity to the Ocean and the salt, some of the buildings show signs of concrete deterioration which will require expensive repairs at some point. Rooms are ok, but Housekeeping had left items from the previous guest in our room (an air-matress) and did not remove it for more than 2 hours (we decided to put it into the hallway ourselves, where it stayed another few hours). Bed-sheets had a hole and the maid did not even change them for the second night. The concierge sent menus for their \"fine dining\" restaurants before we arrived. Unfortunately, the actual menu was different when we got to the restaurant. Food in their casual restaurants is poor and the choices on Palomino Island are very limited. Food at the Stingray Restaurant was excellent though. Concierge also did not book the shuttle from the airport - good thing we called the day before arrival to reconfirm. It probably is cheaper to rent a car or get a cab from the airport, with 2 people sharing. Overall, a disappointing experience based on the first visit and expectations from a Waldorf-Astoria hotel.

I expected just a regulary suite but got the governors suite! My husband said they were \"million dollar views\" of the ocean and private island.

But I think even if you are not a hilton honnors member you might be able to get an upgrade to at least a superior room if you just ask! The breakfasts at the Las Brisas restaurant were amazing. my stepson enjoyed the bacon every single day. It is pricey! but it kept us pretty full until lunch. We didn't get the meal plan but we ended up spliting sandwhichs or a pizza. I would recommend the bella vista as it had very good flat bread pizza. The cozy market had a more limited choice but was cheaper than Caribe cafe. But the Caribe cafe was a bit pricier but had more choices. Their ice cream was prettty good. We had a rental car and found that off the property was definately cheaper for dinner. Loved the Luquillo kiosks as recommended in TA forums. Also there is a really good sushi restaurant near the movie theater and metropol I would have liked to try some of the more authentic puerto rican restaurants but my stepson wasn't that adventerous. He was a good sport about eating. We definately also liked salsaritas near the CVS.. We loved the private island it is definately something out of a post card or one of those corona commercials The water was so clear and turquoise as you would expect! Rented a wave runner and had a blast. The boats are supposed to leave every half hour but they ended up being an hour. The beach is nice but a bit rocky so bring water shoes! The water park was pretty fun only 3 slides but we went on them a few times, there is also an infinity pool. If you go after 1 it is half price and after 4 it is $5 a person. The 3 main pools were beautiful! you felt like you were floating in paradise! The main pool has a ping pong table near it which my stepson was always playing. There were always some kids around for him to have fun with. I would definitely come back!! I would recommend it for families more than couples without kids as sometimes the pools got noisy.

Our room was above avg, good ocean view and nice balcony, in an older bldg, overlooking marina and pool. Large bathroom and nice walkin closet. Trop Storm Emily blew thru during our 3-night stay, but didn't slow us down much. It did disrupt the free resort ferry to the private island for 1 day. Go there - great snorkling, coral reefs right offshore in 3-5 ft of water, plenty of shells to find. Bring water shoes, as coral and shell pieces line the ocean bottom. Watch for the iguanas that walk around the property. Find the hiking trail and take it - see if you can find the 2 secluded beaches. If you don't, at least take some panoramic pictures and enjoy the view from the building at the top. Note - NO BEACH at the resort, you must go to their private island for the beach, under 15 minute boat ferry ride. As for food, it's pricey, but eat at the Strip House - great food, great svs, one of our 2 best meals on the trip (the other being at Perla at La Concha Hotel). Some restaurants nearby, but you'll need a car to get to them. If you have a rental car, the lot is a hike from the front lobby and the hotel areas and you'll pay $15 a day for that. If you have an Enterprise rental, ask at their desk counter how you can park in their spaces for free. Or, if you are staying at one of the bldgs near marina, see if you can find the back road that goes to it, and park by the guard house down there for free.

This hotel was not of quality seen at Waldorf or Conrad level. This should be rebranded to another Hilton brand more representative of El Conquistador service level and current property condition. We visited the resort previously 10 years ago under a different branding name. We were greatly impressed in our initial visit and greatly let down on our recent stay. Our overview - Pros - Private island getaway - Palomino Island. Plenty of activities, food and drinks on the island. Hilton Honors - checkin good Food - Blossoms good food - no typical hibachi style show Bella Vistas - reasonable price and variety that is kid friendly Ballyhoo - reasonable price, variety of choices, kid friendly and service very good Las Brisa's - great selection of morning fare, kid friendly, one of the best restaurant service teams Iguanas - reasonable price, variety of choices, kid friendly and service very good Casino - great action - not large scale betting though. BEST service team at resort (dealers - Samuel, Eric, Wilson, Joseph, Pablo, few others as well forgot the names) Kids treats - Cafe Caribe Ice cream counter - Veronica and few ladies that work 4pm to close great bunch with always postive attitude. Drinks - Twenty One has mostly straight pours Palmino Island - Iguana's bartenders best mixologists at resort NOT the other bar on the island. Bella Vistas - Very good mixologists - Fernado was the best - others okay. Golden Gate Spa - quality service. though needs better view and location at the resort. Perhaps the 2nd floor area of main hotel can better and provide great vistas while receiving massage or other treatments. Negatives- Property Not up to Waldorf standard, seems like prior and current owners do not have enough cashflow to provide the extra level of attention to detail. Items around the outside of building broken, in deseparate need of repair. Other residents complained for dirty rooms, carpets, moldy bathrooms. We saw carpets extremely dirty in common areas, landscaping needing refreshing, general items in room did not work Service - Lacked in many departments. There were great staff members - though they were out numbered 1 to 10. Power outages common in tropical storms - though main hotel power stayed on. The higher priced units at Callistas Village area were without power for couple days. One family with child under one years old, could not receive even a cooler for formula - just plain ice in ice bucket offered. Transportation - bus transportation in poor condition and costs more than private driver. One would think the private driver would be more expensive for airport trips. Rooms - beds were fair condition. Not Waldorf quality Food and beverage Sting Rays - service was ok, food selection poor, over priced and no local flavors -seemed like food came from Sysco or another like provider La Piccola Fontana - not fresh to order that would be expected at Waldorf property, service was below standard, menu not kid friendly italian or variety. Drakes - poor service and drinks ok Cafe Caribe - extremely poor service and kitchen can do better in food preparation (Strongly suggest coverting to Spanish Hacienda style spot with \"true\" puerto rican flavors. Pool - dirty and several times in early AM hours the morning staff lacked interest in clean up. One would expect a Waldorf property would be ready at sunrise and clean. underwear from prior night's activities where clearly visible in common pool area at 10am. Coqui Park - service poor, staff seemed overworked and underpaid attitudes. One occassion child or adult left out a \"baby ruth - think caddy shack\" during our visit and area was only shut for few hours. One would expect 24 hours min. shut down. Next visit someone went down slide after eating or drinking and splewed on the slide and in the water. Slide was shut for mere couple of hours. No orderly process of sharing tubes for lazy river - you need to be aggressive in order to get your kids a floaty to ride. Kids Video Game area- service machines broke and token machines not refilled regularly. Seems like an after thought. Teens lounge is dirty and generally could offer more. Great spot to put a small juice/smoothy bar for kids with foosball or other table games. Overall, if you are on special local rate ($89 package) or using Hilton points it is survivable if you come with open mind. Come with expectations of Waldorf quality stay - you will be disappointed big time. If owner is interested in making this quality spot - I challenge them to give me a call.

He was really surprised and the cake kicked off a great, long weekend in Puerto Rico. Ana also arranged for our airport transportation and was very helpful in recommending restaurants. I highly recommend Las Casitas which are villa like apartments with full kitchens with granite countertops, multiple bathrooms and offer much more space and privacy than the rooms at the main El Conquistador hotel. However, although it's a Waldorf Astoria Resort, its more like a four star property, not a five star hotel. Very nice, but not luxurious. We went to the main hotel every night though for great food at El Conquistador's many restaurants. We really liked the Hibachi grill at the Asian restaurant and loved having cocktails at the steak restaurant. El Conquistador is much more geared towards families and is very large! It has multiple pools, a water park and even a casino. I was surprised at how many local Puerto Rican families stay at El Conquistador and at times felt like we were some of the only Americans there. The customer service and villas are great at Las Casitas, but personally I prefer smaller, more intimate boutique type hotels and when we go back to Puerto Rico will likely stay at The W Hotel which is better for couples seeking romance.

It is not super lux but it fits the bill for a family trip that won't break our bank. Though there are definitely rooms in need of refurbishment, we still enjoy the amazing views from our balcony, no matter which room we have had. Do get an ocean view room- it will make a big difference. There are many restaurants to choose from- you won't get bored of eating out at night. During the day, there is lunch available on the island and near the pool. The best place to eat lunch during the day was at the little poolside restaurant at the villas. Nighttime leaves many more options, and they are quite good. We never left the resort, so I can't tell you about day trips. The spa and fitness center are nice- not the nicest I have ever seen, but they are very nice. I have no complaints, except they grilled me each and every day to show my fitness center receipt. It was kind of annoying how they watched me like hawks every day. You have to pay to use the fitness center, but I didn't really mind. This is a large resort and there is much to do. Take a trip to the island to go to the beach. There are kayaks there and other water sports. I took the Kayak to the little island and it was fun. The water park is a nice distraction if you have children with you, and many do. There are lots of quiet spots at the resort, so not to worry. We ordered breakfast on our balcony every single day and it is lovely to have breakfast by the ocean. If you need a golf cart (we did) reserve it in advance. They book up. Also, make dinner reservations in advance. My daughter broke out in a horrible rash on Thanksgiving, and we had no reservations because we were pre-occupied with having to see a doctor. The staff arranged a nice dinner on our balcony and it was perfect. Thanks! The doctor was really nice, although he mis-diagnosed our daughter, it was nothing serious and no big deal. It is never fun to have a health problem on vacation and luckily, it ended up fine. Anyhow, I do like it here for the price and the direct flight from Philadelphia, even though it needs some renovation, in the rooms/ villas I stayed in.

There were several things I liked about the property, but overall found it disappointing as a Waldorf property. I'll start with the good. The pools are large and plentiful and clean, though the chairs weren't the comfiest I've ever sat in. The room (we stayed in Las Brisas) was beautifully/tastefully decorated. The bathrooms were gorgeous! I loved the multiple levels of the property itself. The golf course is beautiful (though I did not play it). The marina is lovely to walk around, albeit a little small and isolated. Palomino Island is truly gorgeous and worth the trip. I like the varied dining options and we ate at every place they offered. We liked StripHouse and Stingrays the best. Good food, good offerings. We also liked the casino, though if you are looking for something large and extravagant, this isn't it. Now the not-so-good. The service at the front desk is really bad. It's not that they were rude or unhelpful, they were just terribly slow and probably understaffed. When I checked in, I waited 40 minutes in line. My room wasn't even ready even though it was 5:00pm. The representative offered me a drink ticket, but DIDN'T offer me a different room. I found this ridiculous. She did explain that there was a maintenance problem with the room and they would call me when it was ready. I wandered off to the bar and the bartender could tell I was annoyed. She was very nice and actually called the front desk for me to check on the room after about 45 minutes. It was from the BARTENDER I found out my room was ready, as the front desk never called me. But, I had to go stand in that ridiculous line again to get my room key. When I finally got to my room, it was right next to the elevator (boo) and there was condensation leaking from the roof directly outside the front of the door to our room. On top of that, at night, condensation built up (presumably from something underneath our room's foyer) on the tile floor leading into the bathroom. It was so bad that we had to put a towel down so that we didn't slip walking to the bathroom. in addition to these problems, the iPod player in our room didn't work, we couldn't reset the clock on it either. Admittedly, these are minor issues, but they detract from a stay when you expect more from a Waldorf property. Two other minor irritations: I went into two different bathrooms in different parts of the property on different days and there was no toilet paper in them. Finally, we got stuck in a torrential downpour while on Palomino. We wanted to drink our cares away, but the bar out there doesn't start serving until 11:00am. *sigh* I will reiterate that the property is quite beautiful, but the overall experience was disappointing.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWanted to love it but...\u201d", "Author": "Kbivid", "ReviewID": "UR116181932", "Content": "Five girlfriends and I went to Puerto Rico to celebrate 2 of us turning 40. We spent 4 nights at El Conquistador and I left wanting to love the hotel and property but feeling very ambivalent about it. First, the property is immense, the grounds are lovely and the rooms are contemporary and clean. Checking in is a long, painful process. We decided it was because the property is so big that there are a lot of instructions to review. You also have to wear an armband to get anywhere at the hotel; to get to your room, to get on the boat, to get towels, etc. It was very distracting, uncomfortable and a little insulting to have to wear a plastic band for 4 days. Even Disney World doesn't make you do that. We stayed down by the marina. Our 1st room, however, was near the water park (read: lots of kids and noise) so we requested and received a move to a quieter area near the marina. The benefit of staying at the marina is proximity to the water though there is no usable beach at the resort. The resort has a private island that is about a 15 minute ferry ride and has a very nice beach and simple restaurant and bar. The breakfast bar had a nice variety of foods and there is also a Starbucks in the main building. Twice during our stay the coffee cream was sour but everything else seemed fresh. From our room you get to breakfast via a funicular, long walk, elevator and a short walk. It's takes about 10 minutes with planes, trains and automobiles to get from point a to point b at this resort. The staff stuck to the basics and didn't do anything above and beyond to make any form of impression. Nobody (guests or staff) was overly friendly or helpful, they were just doing their thing. One night we had dinner at the casual restaurant at the marina. The drinks were OK but the food was not. Several of us ordered the salmon salad and none of us finished it. It was fishy and dry.

You can buy squid or even use chicken tenders or any meat for bait. He caught some really cool fish! The staff was amazing...your wish is their command.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Striphouse for my birthday dinner and the breakfast buffet offered several options for all of us. Our server on 3 of the mornings, Yahaira, was very pleasant and even remembered our individual drink orders every time! We visited Palamino Island and rode horses, the el Yunque rain forest and old San Juan the day of our departure. The kids also had a blast at the water park!! We visited off site eateries like Tasca Ole Lelolai and were very pleased with both the food and service. To end my review, the kids stated they want to come back and we agreed...we'll definitely be back!!", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cCould be better\u201d", "Author": "travelingforfuninNE", "ReviewID": "UR115633105", "Content": "To start of in a positive light...

The strip house restaurant was decent. I would not recommend the Italian restaurant. The service was strange and the food was not good. Our favorite bar was the bar near the pool. The bartender Tanya made great, strong drinks. We went to that bar every night. The breakfast buffet was included with our vacation package, so we ate there every morning. We would not recommend it if you have to pay for it. We would recommend renting a car at this resort, so that you can explore the area without having to pay enormous cab fare prices. The island beach was beautiful, however we did not like that we had to take a 10 minute ferry to get to the beach. We like to just walk out of our hotel and go to the beach.

It'sbuilt on top of a mountain and down the mountainside--sloping hundreds of feet down to a marina. Sounds like a dream vacation, but don't be fooled. Looks can be deceiving. Once inside this hotel, I wouldn't give it more than 2 1/2 stars. Be prepared to pay 5 star hotel prices, however! Inside it's a run down, dirty, mold infested, humid, bed-bug ridden, expensive hotel with nothing to do. There is no beach unless you travel down the mountain to the marina to catch a ferry to a small island and there is nothing on the island but expensive drinks and lots of scary seaweed in the water. The beach is not your typical white sandy paradise in the caribbean. The pool is small and overcrowded. The water park is a joke--very tiny and expensive! Entertainment in the lobby is Thursday through Saturday, but the guests hang out in the lobby with their young children through the night and the nightclub is very dark and full of teenagers who obviously don't want to be there with the adults or each other, but there is nothing else for them to do. The casino is a real joke with all the 1 cent slot machines. The hotel restaurants are way over-priced, but the food is not quality. We had bad Chinese food at their \"gourmet\" Blossoms restaurant which was horrific. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. I asked for a room change because my mattress was moldy and my room smelled, but I was only offered to move to the same kind of run-down room after having been there 2 days. I passed on the opportunity, only to be bitten by bed bugs the following day. They finally moved me to another building just the night before I left after I was up all night the night before asking for a room change which was denied. I had called because I had woken up with bed bug bites in the middle of the night. Fajardo is far away from everything. Very far from San Juan. Everything is 1 hour or 2 hours away at least. Don't waste your time. Don't spend your money. The only decent food I had was at the Cafe Caribe, which was their most casual dining restaurant, although I paid $20 for a simple rice and beans meal. The only thing in the area to do is to visit the rain forest and that's what my family did and they liked it. I will give credit to the staff which overall is friendly and they really do the best they can with what there is to offer. I had paid in advance through a package called \"Cheapcaribbean.com\" . It was very expensive which is why the nightmare I experienced was unexpected. I could not get a refund or move to another hotel because my money was locked in. I should have known walking in that the hotel was bad because the lobby looks like a zoo. It's very busy and the line is long like the lines at the rollercoaster rides at Great Adventure.

Get in your car and go to local eateries. If you want an AMZING meal go to TIERRA DE FUEGO in PLAZAS LAS AMERICAS in San Juan.

What a beautiful Hotel. Located on the east end of Puerto Rico about 1 hour from San Juan is truly a vacation gem. After driving the hour towards the hotel, you follow the signs and travel through a pretty simple part of town. You follow the long roadway up through their golf course and then there it is. Walking through the lobby you look out towards the ocean and you are just so happy to be there! We were checked in by Margheriita who was friendly, helpful and welcoming. Told us our room wouldnt be ready until 4 but gave us what we needed to take the ferry to their private island, told us we could change and use the pool or have one of the free complimentary welcoming cocktails we had. She said she would call my cell when our room was ready. We decided to take the ferry and check our Palomino Island and have lunch. The boat ride is about 15 minutes, can be a little bumpy but the island is very nice with plenty of chairs, towels given as you walk off the boat, shade if you want and things to rent (kayaks, floats, snorkel gear etc) We had lunch and less than an hour later my phone rang and Margheritta told us our rooms were ready. We had two oceanview rooms in the Las Brisa's wing, the room was beautiful..loved sitting out on my balcony. the rooms were large with a very large bathroom, changing room, and main bedroom. Very clean. We also had the package that included the buffet breakfast every morning. (at Las Brisas Restaurant). Every morning our waiter or waitress were very attentive. Our first morning, we had Noel, when I asked him about one of the items on the buffet, he asked me if I want the chef to come out and tell me how it was made..and she did!! The second morning we had William, and every morning after that he made a point of saying \"hello family\" to us every morning, even though we never had him again as our waiter. Maria and Yarimar were equally friendly and helpful, one checking the weather radar for us and the other telling us the best place to eat in Old San Juan (Raices-very good). The breakfast package was worth every penny..Paul at the front desk assisted us in gettting a late check out, as well as pointing us in the driection of Pinones for some fried Puerto Rican food (along with exactly what we should order) before we left to catch our late flight. Can not complain about the staff at all. The restaurants are pricey, we ate dinner mostly off site exploring. We did have lunch at Iguana's on Palomino Island, and dinner at Cafe Bella Vista, which were both moderately priced and decent quality. The pool area is also very nice...nice size, not too crowded, no problem getting a chair..although the hot tub's water was very hot! We liked the pool at the Las Olas Village, we went there after the beach and had the whole pool to ourselves with cabanas. The resort is near the rain forest, but you need a car if you want to go there, to San Juan or to the Caves which is a good 2 hour ride (See Camuy Caves). The hotel offers tours of San Juan and the rain forest, which is at least $55 a person, if you have a car its free..glad we had a car..there were 5 of us!)

We had requested a room with a king bed. The room they put us in the first night had a musty smell as soon as we walked in. The bellman quickly called down to the front desk and spoke with someone about the smell and the bed mix up. He said they were booked up for that night but to call the front desk at noon the next day to get a transfer to a different room. After awhile you don't smell the smell in the room. We were on the bottom floor of the wing and overlooked a service road for the resort but beyond that was the bay and the town below. We could hear music and festivities coming up the from the valley below and it was fine. The next day my husband played two rounds of golf. He LOVED the course and took his camera the second round of the day after lunch to take photos. We were moved to a different room and it was right down the hall but much much better! I went to the private island and loved it. Very peaceful and I talked to every iguana I saw. Food at the resort was higher than you might find in your hometown, but if you budget for it, it's fine. We ended up eating two nights in a row at the outside bar overlooking the boats in the marina and really enjoyed it. We just ordered some appetizers (tapas) and shared. We wandered into the little town two nights in a row as well. Walking out the side gate of the marina and along the water is safe and easy to do. We ate at Tommy's restaurant and Tommy came and sat with us. He was a hoot. The food was good and we loved people watching. Felt very safe and enjoyed talking with the locals. Saw some free roaming dogs (and cats and chickens) and the dogs had red collars on. They are part of a country wide program called Island Dogs www.islanddogs.org where they get vet care and are fed regularly. I also pet and talked to the dogs and cats I could get close to. We didn't have our young daughter with us (she's 7) but she would have totally enjoyed the water park. We walked up to the gate to look in and the staff said we could go in free of charge if we wanted to walk around on the sidewalk and take a look. All of the staff we met were very very friendly and accomodating. My husband was in a golf tournament the last day we were there. It started late because of a rain show (and half of the golfers having hangovers!!) so I went to the front desk and asked if we could get a late checkout so my husband could shower. Not a problem. When it was apparent he wasn't going to be done golfing in time to have a shower and be out of our room at noon I asked again at the front desk and they had no problem again bumping our checkout time until 1pm!!

They grounds are lovely and we took long strolls each evening after dinner to enjoy the views. The pools were very nice but we spent most of our time at Palomino Island.

We took water shoes because we knew the island beach area was rough in some areas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lots of old coral). The boat ride to the island was about 10 minutes and an added treat. The most important thing to note about this hotel are the Views! The hotel sits on a bluff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Vieques Sound. Several lush islands are scattered throughout the sea and offer different views as the sun rises and sets each day. Food choices were typical of a 4 star resort and we were very pleased with everything we ate.

The Italian place was very good (La Piccola Fontana) and the Steak place (Strip House) was excellent (our favorite in fact). We ate light fair at the pizza/grill place overlooking the pools and that was good (the drinks were delicious).

Other areas are dated, but the resort has remodeled them. For us, this is not a major negative, but it should be noted. The overall Spanish architecture of the resort was charming and sophisticated. Our rooms was an ocean view with a walk out balcony and a direct view of Palomino Island \u00e2\u20ac\u201c True Paradise to wake up to every morning! We did venture off site and chartered a yacht for a day of snorkeling. This is a must! You can choose the loud party boats with 50+ people (Not our style) or contact Dr. Ingrid & Captain Dan from the Erin go Bragh for a more private and personal experience (awesome!).

We had a fabulous time and I definitely want to return and spend more time in Puerto Rico. It was a fantastic vacation. Getting there: The El Conquistador is a little over an hour from the San Juan Airport. We were supposed to be picked up by the El Conquistador van, but it had a flat tire. The representative at the airport lost no time putting us in a cab and paying for it. This setback had little to no effect on our arrival time. Check-in was uneventful, but pleasant. Our bellman was full of useful information about the resort, restaurant recommendations and what we could find where. This was essential as the property is very large and has a lot of different public areas, shops and restaurants. Rooms: We paid $199 for oceanview rooms and, boy did those views deliver! We were in the Las Brisas portion of the resort. The rooms are white with colorful accents. The bedroom area had a desk, bureau, television and an upholstered chair . Sliding doors opened to the balcony and the beautiful view. Everything was in very good condition.Wifi is free which is a nice benefit. I left my computer on the desk throughout our stay, though it would have fit in the safe if necessary. (The electrical outlet for the computer is on the base of the desk lamp.) The bathroom was enormous and had a big closet area attached which easily absorbed the contents of our two large suitcases.NB: The refrigerator is in the bathroom, so it took me a little while to find. Public spaces: They are plentiful and since it rained our first day there, we were happy to spend time chatting in the large and comfortable lobby. In the evening, there is live music in the lobby. This area was the only part of the property where I saw some peeling paint, but, in their defense, this resort is so enormous and must require such tremendous upkeep that there is probably always a little bit of peeling paint somewhere. Overall though, the El Conquistador is in excellent condition. Adjacent to the lobby are a mini-mart with everything you could possibly need, a Starbuck's, a shop with resort wear, a bathing suit store and a souvenir store. There's also a casino and a kids' game room and a room where guests watched movies on rainy days. These shops are just the tip of the iceberg; other areas of the resort have more souvenir shops, David's Cookies, Sunglass Hut and a whole bunch of other retailers. Pools: There are multiple pools at El Conquistador. We spent our time at the main pool which has the nearby Oasis bar and grill. The service at both was excellent. The pool was clean and not too crowded most of the time. Poolside beverage service was unfailingly courteous and prompt. Spa: We had quite a few spa treatments during our vacation and there were no complaints. Spa staff were very gracious and professional. The massages were excellent. If you enjoy body treatments, the pineapple body bliss lives up to its name. My skin was unbelievably soft afterwards. After our first visit to the spa, we received phone calls daily offering us different discounts on services. I was kind of sorry that I had had all my treatments on the first day, so if I were to visit again, I would plan one or two treatments for my first day and then see what deals were offered. The savings were pretty significant. Restaurants: We only ate in a few of the restaurants. La Caribe is a diner-like place with a good breakfast. The waitress, like most of the El Conquistador's staff, was very helpful and sweet. The Las Brisas restaurant has a very generous breakfast buffet. The Chinese restaurant, Blossoms, serves a dish called Full Steam Ahead Fish which was a steamed fish with sauce and vegetables. It was outrageously fabulous. Stingray, the seafood restaurant, is by the resort's marina. We had to take the funicular to get there. The meal was delicious and the service was excellent. The tuna was perfectly cooked. Palomino Island: Taking the quick ferry to Palomino Island is a delightful way to spend a day. It is similar to the private islands one encounters on cruises. There are lounges along the beach and a casual restaurant and bar.In addition to swimming and sunbathing, activities such as horseback riding are also available. We chose to spend our time just swimming and sunbathing. We bought lunch and drinks at the restaurant. Fish and chips literally means a whole fish! The bartender was very nice to us. The beach is a little rocky and corally, so be cautious when walking. Staff: Every single person we encountered at the El Conquistador was very helpful and very friendly from the desk clerk who checked us in to the bellman who brought our suitcases to the server who took our lunch order to the kind spa staff who literally held onto us as they walked us to and from our spa treatments. This wasn't the kind of niceness that seems to be looking for a gratuity and it wasn't the kind of niceness that becomes routine because one's boss is watching closely. We really felt that the staff at the El Conquistador were just the sort of workers who have pride in the job they do and want every guest to feel special.

Never again.\u201d", "Author": "CTFeil", "ReviewID": "UR115104709", "Content": "My family and I stayed here in late May on the advice of our travel agent. We booked a room at Las Casitas, which was supposed to be the more secluded and nicer side of the resort, which was definitely NOT worth the extra money. Despite the fact that our villa had a beautiful view of the recreation island, the resort did a terrible job of maintaining these villas, as we had rainwater coming in through our windows the entire time we were there. What was the resort's solution for this? More towels. I'm not even kidding. Aside from the leaky windows, we also seemed to have an AC unit that was possessed. Even when you tried to turn it off, it would still go full-blast at 60 degrees. As a result of this, the room felt soaking wet as soon as you walked in, and not from the humidity outside. No wonder the drywall looked like it would fall off if you touched it. My next beef with this resort was the food. I was blown away with the tremendous lack of options! I was really hoping that I would be able to enjoy some local food while on the resort, without having to get myself a taxi and going into town to get something. Sadly, if you really want to taste Puerto Rico, or at least have halfway decent food while you're there, that's your only option. At one of the cafes on resort, my mother, sister, and myself had dinner, which included two salads and a cheeseburger, at the cost of $96, NOT including a tip. The $25 cheeseburger (I didn't realize putting plantains on a burger could jack up the price that much) was so overcooked I couldn't eat it, and because it was so late, I couldn't send it back to the kitchen for a new one. The last night we were there, we went to the Hibachi restaurant (meant to resemble Benihana), and I've never been treated more poorly in my life. The three of us were seated at a table meant to seat around 15-20 people with our backs to the rest of the restaurant. After roughly 20 minutes, a waiter finally came over to take our wine orders. Roughly 15 minutes after that, our wine is delivered and our orders are taken. Seeing as the other tables (which were both full of people), were getting a full show from the chefs, I expected the same for our dinner. Sadly, we didn't get a single thing that could resemble entertainment. Our chef quietly came to our table, cooked our food, served it to us, and disappeared. That meal wound up costing us about $250, and the quality of the food should have made it worth about $30. Given the way we were treated, I expected the meal to be on the house. When the best thing on the resort is your room service's chicken tenders (even at $21 a plate), your kitchen has a very serious issue. My next issue is activities on the resort. When my family and I visited the resort, it was amidst one of the worst storms PR had seen in a while. Because of this storm, all the outdoor activities were shut down. Instead of planning ahead for something like this, the resort had no indoor activities, short of going to the casino which opened late in the afternoon. So, aside from the fact that being stuck inside for a few days might give one cabin fever, there's no options whatsoever! The last day we were there, the resort tried to open up one of its clubs to host a kids game room of sorts. They were showing movies on a small TV, had a Wii set up to play, and a ping pong table. While this was a valiant effort, I walked in to see half-full glasses filled with booze from the night before! Needless to say, not the best place to try to host a kids entertainment area. I could go on and on about the many things I took issue with, but I'll refrain. Bottom line, save yourself a LOT of money and pick another resort to go to. Despite the fact that the service was satisfactory, the facilities and overall quality of this resort leaves a lot to be desired.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAbsolute paradise and wonderful for families--my husband wants to go every year\u201d", "Author": "McTravelers4", "ReviewID": "UR115046141", "Content": "We have done our share of traveling, are from Boston, and have pretty high expectations when it comes to resorts. My husband has already eliminated several prior locations from our 'list' that he will not return to. He is already saying that we will most definitely return to El Conquistador. The property is gorgeous and the services are five star. The staff is more than helpful once you arrive. It was a bit difficult ascertaining the lay-of-the-land over the phone when we were booking, so we offer a few tips. You CAN buy breakfast other places besides the Full Breakfast Buffet offered at Las Brisas. There is a Starbucks on site, and Cafe Caribe also has breakfasts that are smaller and less expensive than the daily buffet. We found the daily buffet was making everyone overeat and we didn't need it EVERY day. Since it was included in our plan for our kids, we made use of it and did not have lunch, but an early dinner. If you DO go to Las Brisas, it is best to go for the $20 buffet, as if you order cereal, coffee and juice like I did one morning, it cost $14.00, which is outrageous for cereal. There is also a little market (Cozy Market) on the property where you can buy cereal and Pop Tarts and other essentials. There is a markup for this, however. We packed a lot of things in our suitcases, like Pop Tarts, cereal, Crystal Light to mix in with waters, water bottles, juice bags (double Ziploc them) etc. Just make sure your bag is not over 50lbs. or you will pay at the airport. We rented a car one day ($85 bucks for a mid-size; compact would be less expensive) to take to the rainforest in Luqillo (which we highly recommend). On the way back, we stopped at CVS and Walmart in Fajardo (which is very close to El Conquistador) and bought Gatorades, water, Medalla Light beer (which is $7.00 a beer at the resort, but my husband bought a 12 pack at the gas station for $11.00!) and other essentials. If you do this early in your trip, you will save on all of this which adds up. The resort charges you $3.50 a water bottle, and on Palomino Island, it is $5.00 for a can of Arizona Ice Tea. Just be forewarned...if you have a big family, this adds up each time the kids want to drink! As other reviews state, the 9 AM ferry to Palomino Island is the way to go, as you will find plenty of chairs in the shade. My sons had a blast snorkeling on their own with their own masks, etc. They found a small, live, coral reef with blue and yellow fish, not too far out, and also small black tip reef sharks swam by them in a shallow beach section further around the island. (They are not harmful) Buy masks at CVS and Toys R Us before you go, as they charge $35. on the island to purchase) Also, pack plenty of drinks, as again, water on the island is $3.50 each. Buy underwater cameras before you go as well, as they sell them on the island and they are also pricey, but our 12 year old insisted upon getting one! 8) On the way back, with the rental car, we did eat at La Estacion, which is very close to the main gate of El Conquistador. It looks like a dive, but it is a nifty, authentic Puerto Rican restaurant with DELICIOUS food.....the barbeque is amazing (the boneless chicken BBQ is terrific) BUT...the flies descend upon you immediately once your food arrives. We were eating with one hand and waving flies away with another. I think the restaurant could put fly paper up (which is gross, but works) or do something to get rid of the flies. They are attracted to the sweet BBQ sauce. You could spray your table ahead of time with repellant, I suppose, but we didn't have any. Try the tostones (fried plaintains) which are yummy and authentic. My husband got the NY steak and rice and beans and ate every bit of it. Steve the waiter is from Cleveland, OH....ask for him, he's great! The Golden Door Spa is a must for the ladies. Grace at the front desk is wonderful and ask for Mary to give you the 80 minute Golden Door massage. She will blend in some deep tissue or therapeutic if she sees fit. This was the BEST massage I have ever had, and again...we've traveled quite a bit. I was in complete \"la la land\" once she finished. The resort is great about letting you shower and store your bags if you have a later flight on day of checkout. We stayed at the pool all day, showered and picked up our bags from the bellman. The only desire we have is that their shuttles run every hour instead of two hours, as we could have spent a little more time at the pool and less time at the airport. (We had to grab the 3pm shuttle instead of the 5pm for a 6:50 flight out of San Juan) Coqui Water park is so fun and the half-day price is a bargain. It is also fairly inexpensive to feed the kids dinner there, with a decent menu, before closing. The pools are open 24/7...imagine that!....and there are NO BUGS to compete with, which is such a delight! No gnats, flies, mosquitoes....it was pure joy! We sat out most nights until very late, watching the kids swim and enjoying cocktails by the pool. How fun! The only disappointment we had, was that we scheduled the Bio Bay tour on the night before we left, and it was canceled due to weather. My sons were disappointed. You should know that if you want to go by Electric Boat, they will ONLY take six people at a time. Book EARLY....we didn't, and the only option was the 10pm departure, which ended up being canceled anyway. We will book early when we go back next year, perhaps. Overall, we had the time of our lives. We traveled with another family who had all boys, as we do, and there were no complaints. We will be back and are telling all our friends. One additional note: the beds and pillows ARE EXCEPTIONALLY COMFORTABLE for a hotel! I usually hate hotel mattresses and pillows, but these were so incredibly comfortable.....I hope you they never change their vendor!

Take care to avoid the rooms near the tram that goes to the beach, as it can be very noisy ALL NIGHT 2) Book a package that includes complimentary breakfast. 3) Rent an Enterprise car - so you can do day trips (definitely the Rain Forest). Enterprise has a parking area, so you avoid the $20 day parking charge 4) Definitely take meals (especially dinner) off-site. There are several very good restaurants close by. Reservations are usually necessary. The food is better than at EC 5) Sign up for Hilton Honors before you arrive. Then at the desk ask for the Spa package that is complimentary.

The staff tries hard to please and the accomodations at La Marina where we stayed very nice, Staying over the 4th of July weekend, however, the resort is much too crowded for my taste. I prefer the quiet, more laid back feel that was prevalent the week preceeding the weekend. Having read other reviews prior to coming, we stopped at Walmart on our way here to stock up on snacks and drinks. When we valet parked and the bellman gathered our luggage, he informed us that it will cost us $2 for each Walmart bag. This was not the way one should first be greeted at the resort; we felt nickeled and dimed especially because they didn't bother putting a box of juice pouches back into the bag that had fallen out of, but rather charged us an additional $2 for it. Advice: go to Walmart after your first arrival or put your purchased items into a suitcase. Robert was not our bellman but we spoke to him at the resort---very knowledgeable and friendly! Also followed the advice of other visitors and went to outside restaurants some times. Paison por el Fogon was indeed excellent, but we don't need so fancy when we are in the islands and much prefered the funky tropical atmosphere of La Estacion, which also has excellent food. Do NOT go to the Trip Advisor #3 rated Tasca Olelelola---the food was horrible including what tasted like frozen fish and shrimp (which we ate some of anyway because we were starving); my stomach wasn't right for days. Metropol out on Route 3 was wonderful. Though a chain restaurant, the food we had all seemed fresh and homemade, not mass-produced in any way. The service there was the best! Ask for Jay---he is the best waiter/server we've had in ages. He goes above and beyond---we told him what we wanted that wasn't exactly on the menu and he came out with specially prepared dishes that were perfect! He is warm, friendly and caring and it is obvious that that is truly his personality.

You will get plenty of exercise walking from one area of the hotel to another. Seriously, it was nearly 2,000 steps from our room to the front desk. But while the facility is grand, we encountered some small problem each day during our week long stay. In all fairness, most were minor and all were corrected when we complained. However some issues should not have occurred and reflect a lack of training. The minipfridge was not plugged in. The liner for the shower curtain was removed but not replaced during our stay. Trash can liners were missing one day, as were towels or washcloths on other days. The views are spectacular, the facility and room clean, there was always adequate hot water and, despite other reviewers problems, we found the wait for the funicular to be reasonable. Be prepared for top dollar prices for all services and food. $100-150 per couple for dinner, for example. Breakfast was good, but the staff misinformed us the first day regarding our cost. We were told that we would pay the taxes and tip at checkout. We were not charged for the taxes. Further, my wife drinks tea. It was not until the third day that she was offered a choice of teas (they have more than a dozen). If you walk along the waterfront and leave the hotel grounds, you will find a series of cheap places with local cuisine. This is also where trips to the luminescent bay depart from so you can save some money. If you are renting a car on the island, it is about $75/day from the hotel. But you get free parking. While you can rent cheaper at the airport, you have to pay $20 a day to park at the hotel. Again, a long walk from either parking lot. As others have said, the beach is a private island and is pristine. Water was clear but not very deep. Hard to swim if that is your thing. But good wading. Wear beach shoes because of the coral/rock surface and sea urchins. The water park is $20 per day, but 1/2 price if you go after 1 PM. Pools are open 24 hours. Towels are only available until late evening. We did use the Golden Door Spa. It was lovely, but again pricey.

We stayed 4 nights at the El Conquistador. In general, we are happy with our stay except for a long delay upon checking in. We were early so we expected to have to wait for our room. The problem is that when the room became available, we were not told because someone forgot to enter the data in the computer. After waiting for over 4 hours, I went to see the room for myself and realised it was ready and probably was ready for a long while (no cleaning lady in site). I obviuosly was not too happy and I let them know it. A part from that, the service was great. Food: Everything is over priced and unless you have a car, you are obliged to eat at the resort. I personally would not go back without renting a car. Most of the cost is paid off by not having to take the over-priced shuttle or an over-priced taxi and it allows you to visit and to eat on the outside. By the way, taxis are a rip-off and this is santionned by government regulations (they have tourist taxis which in other words means that since you are a tourist, we will charge you much more than if it were a standard taxi). Be sure to enquire as to the price of the taxi before taking it - they tend to make-up prices as they go. The food was ok but not worth the amount charged. We ate at the Stingray. Food was very good, but was served way too fast. We were out of there in less than an hour. Beach: The beach is located on an island that belongs to the resort. The beach is very nice, plenty of chairs, not over-crowded (although, we were there in June so it may be more crowded at other times of the year). The views from the island (take the trails) are fantastic. The down side is that there are a lot of rocks (or coral) at the bottom of the water. Also, it is a bit of a pain to have to take the ferry everytime you want to get to the beach. Hotel: The lobby is beautiful. The rooms could use a bit of work but they are very clean. All of the rooms seem to face the sea so views are great. Rooms have a balcony. Some sections of the hallways are semi-openned so you hear the frogs all night (believe me, it is very noisy).

The food options are high end and the drinks are pricey ie medalla is about a $1 everywhere else in PR and $5 at El Con. The water park is fun but mostly for kids and the lower deck rooms require the use of a funicular to get to the main part of the hotel. Do not rely on the concierge for reliable information.

My room has a beautiful view of the sea and Palomino Island. The rooms is clean, comfortable and stylishly furnished. The bathroom is clean, well appointed and has a large walk-in closet in which I was able to place 3 weeks' worth of business clothes. Other reviewers complained that they disappointed by the hotel. They have to bear in mind that this is a resort hotel. Frankly, Louis XV furniture and Ormolu are lovely in Versailles but would be very out of place at a Puerto Rican resort. I think that the hotel and the decor are perfect for the location and function. I do agree that at the weekend a hoard of loud barabarians descends on the hotel but staff do their best to maintain the ambiance and lets face it, although we might wish they could, they can't background check everyone who makes a reservation. A resort will always attract it's fair share of \"undesirables\". I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member and I have stayed at many Hilton properties including the Waldorf in London and the Waldorf Towers in New York.

I just wanted to give a very honest opinion of the property -- we were here on business and most all expenses were paid by our sponsor. I was actually out very little (other than the few days of my life I can't get back...), so I'm certainly not writing this review from a \"getting even\" standpoint. I would just want to warn those considering spending their hard-earned money to come here. First, I will wholeheartedly confirm the rooms are entirely too run down for the star rating, Waldorf Astoria name, and price point. It reminded me of the little dingy beach motels we would stay in back in college. Incredibly stale, musty odors penetrated every fiber of every item in the room -- including the beds. Due to the fact that the A/C had not been running (they are on motion sensors and apparently cut off when you leave) the room was wet -- not humid -- wet. Ceilings, floors, walls -- all wet from the incredible humidity. I realize running the A/C costs money, but certainly the dehumidifying effects would save on wear and tear in the room. The condition of the rooms was depressing. The walls were stark white (as was all the decor in the room), but in bad need of a coat of paint. Gouges and holes in the walls were halfheartedly patched, but nobody seemed to think how much nicer the room would look if it was done even semi-professionally, and painted to match. The safety latch on the door had been broken off more than once, and simply relocated to another spot on the door frame. The prior holes weren't covered or painted over. The tiles in the bathroom were originally nice porcelain ones, but now cracked and chipped (and \"repaired\" with caulk!). Plumbing was exposed, mismatched PVC and chrome pipe -- it was just cheap, cheap, cheap. It was like your destitute uncle/handyman kept the place up. Customer service was lacking -- but I found this to be a theme throughout the \"resort.\" The only time anyone really came to life was when there might be a dollar to be had. Upon arrival I was forcibly separated from my luggage, then after check-in had to walk by the bellman's desk to get to my room. I asked for my lone suitcase, and was told I would have to call from my room to have it \"delivered.\" I attempted to explain that it was unnecessary, as I could just as easily take it with me, and was informed sternly this was their \"policy.\" So I had to wait 20 minutes (in my wet, sweltering room) to get a clean change of clothes prior to venturing out. The front desk clerks had the most peculiar habit of going back into the office (behind closed doors) after attending to a guest. So if you approached the line and there were two clerks -- each attending to a guest -- you would be assured they would both leave for a 5-7 minute \"break\" after they finished. Once they left the desk completely unattended while I was the only person waiting to be assisted. And you will spend a lot of time in that line -- there were countless guests looking to switch rooms, get their card keys re-programmed (a particularly nasty little problem -- mine stopped working 4-5 times in two days), or generally vent about the poor condition of the rooms. I met lots of interesting people -- and learned of lots of interesting issues with the property -- while waiting in this line. I didn't get to dine in the \"nice\" restaurants on site; the first night I believe they all closed at 9pm (it was a Monday night, mind you). By the second night I was on to the place, and chose to make a go of it out in Fajardo. What a decision -- I had a wonderful, fresh, local barbecue meal for $30 -- including drinks. For lunch I made the mistake of eating out on the patio on the property, where I had a lifeless (?chicken) sandwich and fries, a Presidente beer, and poor service for a total of $42 (less tip). A grilled chicken sandwich and a beer for $42? I don't mind spending someone else's money for a good meal, but this is starting to test the limits of reason... So the east end of the island is beautiful, the private island very nice, and the golf course apparently well above average (I did not actually see the course myself). But there is little else to do other than take tours off property, and I could never, never recommend anyone actually staying at El Conquistador. I won't even go into the ridiculous hidden fees they extort off of guests at checkout (which total upwards of 30-40% of the quoted room rate) -- I wouldn't recommend this place for $169 all-inclusive. They need to bulldoze the property and start over. I don't have an ax to grind with anyone -- El Conquistador, Hilton, etc -- this place is just a squalid, run-down money trap.

But, seriously, never more than 5 minutes for the funicular, and the ferry to Palomino ran every thirty minutes.

La Estacion is one in particular that was outstanding. It is less than 5 min from the resort gate to the right. We stopped at Walgreens, and bought water, soda, beer and snacks.

They tried to put us in a room with one bed upon arrival and we had booked a double room on our voucher. He told us they were sold out and they offered to send us a blow up mattress! We had to go back to the front desk to demand what we paid for and that supervisor Noel did not even come out...what a slime ball! He sent the bellman back out with new room keys to a room with two beds but smelled musty like shack at the shore, the towel rack in the shower was ripped off, the hall light when you walk into the room was burnt out, no blow dryer, mosquitoes were abundant in the bathroom, and the water backed up when we took showers. It was gross and musty and we were bitten up that first night! I would not even put a stray dog in this room no less people! Next day I went to front desk and complained to another supervisor who was appaled and provided us with another room a few floors up....but that was missing a lamp..no big deal, as they gave us one right away. Day 3 was fine but on day 4 our last evening, we're getting ready to go out to dinner and allof a sudden our bathroom was infested with Termites!!! Maintenance sprayed our bathroom with bug spray and we were told we had to move to another room as they had to fumigate the room! FYI - the closet where all our clothes were is in the bathroom! It was our last night and this was the forth time we changed rooms! We are demanding a full refund and they have the nerve to say that they accommodate us! Most of the staff were pleasant (bellman &bar and restaurant service was great) but the supervisor and guest services are horrible. I had to toss all my toiletries out as it stunk of bug spray. We demanded dinner on our last night as it was late and our plans were ruined due to termite situation and having to pack and move once again. We also demanded new tooth brushed.

This was an outstanding resort. We were a little concerned as the drive from San Juan airport to the resort (which took about 40 minutes) took us through some areas of Puerto Rico where the standard of living was obviously lower than in some parts of the US. We were unsure what to expect, but upon arrival we were more than excited to be there. The resort itself is on a gated property with 24 hour security guard. The main resort sits on the top of the hill. Upon our arrival to the resort, we were immediately greeted by a bellboy who helped with our suitcases. Check in was quick and the reception clerks were very polite and genuinely happy. We were escorted to our room by the bellboy who greeted us, and during the trip to the room he pointed out the highlights of the resort and gave suggestions on how to fully maximize our stay. The resort grounds are beautiful. Our room was located in the Marina which is at the bottom of the main resort. Our room was in a building situated close to the water. The room itself had a beachy feel, very clean, and the pillows were dreamy! Must put those on my Christmas list as I never wanted to get out of bed! We had a patio that had seating for four and we would drink our tea out there in the morning and evening in a idyllic setting watching the sunsets. There are at least three different levels that house the resort but for the purpose of the review, I will simply divide it as upstairs (the main resort area) and downstairs (the marina area). Upstairs has the majority of the restaurants, stores, shops, pool, gyms, game rooms, clubs, and the casino etc. We ate at several of the restaurants and they were outstanding. If you go into town, I highly recommend Lolitas Mexican restaurant. Great family atmosphere and the food is delicious! The breakfast buffet at the on-site restaurant was good, with many hot and cold choices, and some healthy food options. Service was great and the servers interacted with the kids and were friendly. Restaurant was clean and food was replenished quickly. To reach the Marina you take the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funicular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, similar to a trolley style car that takes minutes to transit from the main resort down to the Marina. This area is where the water park is located, and the ferry that takes you to the resorts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 private island where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find the beach. There is no beach at the Marina, but the ferry is a relaxing 7 minute boat ride to the island which the kids loved. The beach is clean and has many sun loungers. We spent most mornings at the beach and then back to the Marina to finish the afternoon at the water park. As it was a vacation we were never up early but never seemed to have a problem finding sun loungers at either location! The ferry departs roughly every 30 minutes. There is a caf\u00c3\u00a9 restaurant on the private island which surprisingly was very reasonably priced for lunch and drinks. The snorkeling near the private island is great. The kids loved the on-site water park located in the Marina area. Height restrictions were 36 inches I think, so smaller kids can go on every ride, including the 50ft drop water slide which kept our kids aged 7, 8 and 11 entertained for hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c literally! There were several water slides, some using tubes. Each area has a lifeguard on duty. There were a couple restaurants and shops located in the Marina area. As our room was located in the Marina it was a short walk to the water park or jump on the ferry to the private island. The only time we visited the main resort area was for breakfast and dinner. The outdoor grill style restaurant at the top of the resort has a balcony that overlooks the main pool and the pizzas are amazing! Be sure to ask for an events schedule when you arrive. We found this on our 2nd day there and they had some great activities to keep the kids entertained. Not sure if that was special with it being Spring Break week or whether that is an all-year- round program. One of those special events was a large TV screen poolside so the kids can swim and watch the movie. The one we went to was free and the kids enjoyed swimming in the pool at dark watching the movie on a big screen. The only other thing I would have added would have been a nostalgic popcorn machine where you could buy popcorn! Overall, it was a great experience and we cannot wait to go back again. It was one of those places were my husband and I felt like we had taken a vacation sans kids. We left feeling relaxed and the kids were kept entertained the whole stay.

This part of the island is beautiful. The tropical mountains here slope right down to the beach. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing like it in the mainland. But if you do decide to travel to this part of the island, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care what others say about this hotel. The El Conquistadore I saw was dated, inconvenient, poorly maintained, staffed by unhappy people, and unfair in billing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extras\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that most reasonable people would assume to be included in a room charge. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begin with the facility. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s common areas are nice, but a little old. By contrast, the private areas are not what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from a hotel that trades on being top-flight and exclusive. Our top floor ocean-view room was one of the most expensive. But it was small, uncomfortable, dirty, and old. A few examples: The hotel failed to change the air filters in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a/c system. Every time the system came on, the room filled with musty air. The bathroom featured an industrial-style mega-flush toilet. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect to see one at a gas station, not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four-star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel. They tried to update the bathroom. They installed some new glass tile mosaic over the wash basis. But the workmanship was poor. Tiles were crooked and dirt accumulated between cracks. One of two small, grungy, and un-renovated elevators needed to access our building was out of service. They blocked it off with a used janitorial mop. But here is the worst part about this place: they nickel and dime everything. We pre-paid our room in full. I like to do that when I travel to distant places so there are no surprises later on. Well, there were surprises a-plenty at El Conquistador. The extras (which should have been included) were 80% of the price of the room per night! This place doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss an opportunity to hit your credit card. Here are examples: Parking: Although El Conquistador is on a 100-acre spread in a rural part of the island, they charge for parking. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unreasonable. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worse: they charge New York City rates. Parking is $20 a night at the good lot (which is valet whether you like it or not) and $15 at the main lot. Trying to save $5.00, I picked the main lot. What a mistake. It is so far away from the hotel, they send a golf cart to pick up guests. The carts run on an irregular schedule. I waited 20 minutes. It was as if they were punishing me for saving the $5.00. Resort fee: 12.00% of your room charge. Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the facilities, get ready to pay up. Sure, they have a pool and some nice grounds. But they better, since they are marketing themselves as a destination, not a business traveller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, hotel. But get this: even after you pay the resort fee, it does not include access to the resort, including their off-site beach and other amenities. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an extra fee. Check out fee: $65.00. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little more to this. We called and checked out by phone long before the check-out time. We asked their permission to stay on property and use the pool. The front desk said sure. My wife went to the pool. I did some errands off site. But on the way out, they handed us another bill. It was for $65.00. Apparently, their policy is that guest must not only vacate their rooms, but the property, or be charged a late check-out fee. What a crock. More parking fees: I paid the parking fee of $15.00 in cash earlier in the day when I ran my errands. But when I picked up my wife, the attendant didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe me and tried to add another $15.00 to my bill. I explained that I had paid it and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe me. The attendant called over his colleagues and I was suddenly explaining it again to five (yes FIVE) parking attendants, including what I assume was their supervisor. I felt like a defendant in a federal criminal proceeding. They finally excused me without further payment, but warned me that the hotel does not permit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in-and-out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd parking. For the record, I never re-parked. I merely drove up to the pick-up area to wait for my wife. Look, I am all about making money. Profit is what keeps any good hotel operating. But the owners and management of this hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see human beings when guest walk into the Conquistador. They see dollars.

For the most part it worked but I think one issue with this hotel may be the staff. The parking lot is very far away and when we pulled up, nobody came up to try to take our car for valet or assist us with luggage. There were several staff members standing around, so I got out and asked them if we could leave the car here while we checked in. They said no, we need to go park and we can leave the luggage with the bellhop while we park. I had to then wait in a line at the bellhop desk and after a few minutes, I told my husband to go park while I waited with the luggage. He came back 30 minutes later, dripping with sweat. The lot is very far and the lot was very full so he had to drive around a lot and then walk back up the hill in the heat to the hotel. There is a parking shuttle but nobody told us when we talked to the valet and he never saw it. I understand we could have valet parked (and if I had known about the parking difficulty, we would have) but the least they could do when you pull up is acknowledge you, give you the parking shuttle information and take your bags instead of making you get out of the car and go up to them and then wait in a separate line for bellhops. There were other times during the stay where staff were just standing around and they didn't offer to take bags, bring you drinks at the pool, etc. I am really not a 5 star hotel person and normally stay at budget hotels so it is not like I am expecting to be spritzed with Evian as I pull up my car to the hotel but it would be nice if they gave you information and didn't ignore you when you pull up. The pools are not too exicting and I am not sure why they didn't do anything with the great view. You see a wall or bushes instead of the ocean view while in the pool.

In my mind, the only minor drawback was that you have to take a ferry to palomino island (hotels private island) if you want to go to the beach, but the ferry ride is only 10 minutes and it runs every half hour. I would recommend not going on weekends in the summer as a lot of residents from the island go than and it gets pretty crowded.

The carpet to start is very old striped, moldy odored, and stained. The cleaning crew I guess does what they can with the non updated rooms. However, I found some pre-existing hair on the shower wall when we checked into our room. We stayed in Las Casita. The Ocean view was nice as we were upgraded since we arrived on a Tuesday and the Hotel had not reached its full capacity. We went to Palomino Island twice via the boat/ferry ride which was free of charge. Palomino Island is small but nice. Be prepared to pay around 17-18 for a sandwich/burger-lunch while on the island as there is only one restaurant and El Conquistador wants you spend fund on their beach cafe. So don't think that El Conquistador will allow you to pack a lunch via cooler and take over to the island. We had our 2 year old son thus we had to take our snacks and water out of the cooler and store in our beach bag unless it wouldn't have been allowed. We went to the El Junque rainforest which was a hike, but the waterfalls are gorgeous. We rented a car, thus we paid for the $21/Day valet parking. We went to La Parilla restaurant in Kiosks (short 15-20min ride from the resort) and the food was very good. We also went to Las Estacion (2min from resort) and Raices (in San Juan) and the food was also good, but not as tasty as La Parilla. Also the resort concierge suggested that we go to Passion restaurant and once we arrived the what appeared to be owner/manager said that they could not take us and had a wedding rehearsal, this was after we stood waiting there for about 10min. I didn't really care for poor cust service here. Also resore suggested Calizo which is very pricy/supposed to be fine dining. We ate at Las Brisas for breakfast which was decent the charge was $19.99 and if you wanted an omelet from scratch, you had to pay an extra $6 We went to Baru' restaurant in San Juan which was overpriced garbage so please don't waste your time or money. The Fort was nice. On our way back to the airport we explored San Juan a little more and there were a lot of souveneir shops and very crowded. Also, it rained everyday for about 15-20min. The sun was out everyday until around 1pm.

We stayed in room 4316 of La Vista, which needs some repair work, but the view of the pool area and Palamino island is amazing. No balcony, but we didn't miss it because you can open the sliding doors and enjoy the view. Wi-Fi was on and off all week, which made it difficult for everyone to work from resort. We tried our dial up thumb drive and it was extremely slow. Some days we couldn't get on wi-fi at all, others it ran flawlessly. The corporate events (600 people) were very well executed, food was all very good, with the exception of the buffet breakfast on our last day, which was served outside overlooking the pool area, and it was spectacular!! Funicular is a PAIN, so be prepared. Strip House is exceptional. Marina bar/restaurant serves great sandwiches and staff is great. Stingray was ok, portions were very small. Starbucks is a Godsend and great option for breakfast. Water park was better than I expected and everyone really enjoyed it, from children to adults. Lazy river was great. Palomino Island wasn't what I expected, only one restroom on the island, so if you want to sit at end of the island, near bar and have cocktails, you have to walk the length of the island to use the facilities. Take water shoes you will need them. Seaweed close to shore, so you can't really wade out very far. We didn't spend much time here because the pools are amazing and I didn't mind not having a beach. Shuttle was only running once an hour, so if it was full, you were stuck on the island until next boat. Overall the resort staff was wonderful. Prices are extremely high, so be prepared. Can of Banana Boat Aloe $20. Cocktails $12. Can of soda $2.50. Bottle of water $3.50. Travel size of Listerine mouth wash $4.99 Pizza at pool bar is really good for $12, nice mid-afternoon snack to share between 2 people.

Shuttle service from airport was great, though. Staff was very helpful and helped with our bags the entire way to our rooms. Bell staff was exceptional. Nice exercise facilities at the hotel.

I mean drop dead GORGEOUS! Nestled on the cliffs of Fajardo & the views are spectacular. The room was absolutely gorgeous as well...I loved the bright inviting colors, the furnishings were new & modern, & it was quite spacious. It had a walk-in closet in the bathroom which was a nice surprise. The king bed was so comfy. Nice big balcony with a view of the ocean & a view of the Biobay as well in the distance. At night you can hear the comforting sounds of the Coqui frogs...so relaxing. Palamino Island (the resort's private island): We spent most of our time here. I didn't mind the 10 minute ride over there on the ferry...we actually thought it was quite nice. The food & drinks on the island were a bit overpriced & they will not let you bring a cooler (but we did hide a couple snacks & bottles of water in our beach bag) Palamino Island is AWESOME! I really felt like we did something different every day we went there. The island itself has many different features & a changing coast line so if you walked a little ways you could relax on several different types of beaches. When you first get off the ferry there is a beach with very very soft white sand. The water at this beach is very great for swimming. It is like bathwater & went out as deep as my shoulders. If you walked a little farther was a beach that was great for exploring & finding shells. The sand was still soft here but the water here only went up to my knees. It actually went out for miles like that. I highly suggest SWIM SHOES for this beach and especially for the beaches farther down. The farther down you walk the more interesting it gets as far as finding shells & stuff but it also gets more treacherous. One day we got very adventurous & decided to walk to the hidden beaches on the other side of the island. This walk was exciting & you will see iguanas & other creatures on the way there. You have to be in fairly good physical shape for this because you will hike up a small mountain to get there. Make sure to bring lots of water & wear sneakers because I only had my swim shoes on & a thorn went right through the bottom of them & it hurt so bad. You have to be careful to not hike the horse trail because that will take you in one big circle (we found out the hard way) The secluded beach was peaceful & surprisingly even had a couple lounge chairs there. We were there for about 3 hours & didn't see another person the whole time! I heard this was an unofficial \"nude beach\" but I wasn't brave enough to do it! ha ha. This beach has lots of great exploring but you have to wear SWIM SHOES because it had LOTS & LOTS of coral & a TON of sea urchins. We even hiked through a bunch of rocks to the left along the coast & found the \"hidden\" beach. Very rocky but it was really cool. My boyfriend even found a small octopus in between the rocks by the shore. Food: Food at the resort was really good but ridiculously expensive. We already knew it would be because of other reviews so we did this only once just to try it. The best food we had came from 2 local spots that you can walk to if you're feeling adventurous. They are right by the water & in the same spot as the Biobay tours launch spot. You have to walk along the water to the left of the resort. We tried Mofongo (best hangover food ever. haha) at OceanView restaurant & delicious Lobster Tails at Tommys Place. I highly recommend eating at either place. They are small family owned places and the food is authentic, tasty, & reasonably priced. Transportation: You should really rent a car when staying at El Con if you want to explore the rest of the island. We rented one from the airport because Fajardo is about a 45 drive from San Juan plus the resort is really not within walking distance of very many things. I highly recommend going to the El Yunque Rainforest! It was AMAZING! Many beautiful waterfalls & luscious vegetation. It's actually only about a 15-20 minute drive from the resort. My tips for this resort #1 Housekeeping staff is a little \"sketchy\" so lock up your valuables & make sure you do not leave anything in the room when checking out because you will never see your stuff again. I made the mistake of accidentally leaving some items in the nightstand. When I called to let them know I was coming back for them, the housekeeping staff said they \"didn't find anything\" which was a bold-faced lie because I know for a fact I left those items & I knew exactly where I had left them too. Of course they didn't \"find\" the items because one of them was a pre-paid $100 gift card. So someone got a nice little \"tip\" that day. #2 bring swim shoes because parts of the beach have lots of coral #3 Rent a car #4 Be prepared to spend ALOT of money on food if you're planning on eating at the resort or do what we did- we stopped to get groceries on the way there (drinks, snacks, stuff to make sandwiches) All in all, we had a fabulous vacation & would definitely go back to the El Conquistador!", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Old Bridge, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "AnnieBlueyz", "ReviewID": "UR107420926", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for a week.

There is a casino and a club, neither of which I was much impressed with. The store on the property was rather expensive but expected. There is a Wal Mart about 5 -10 minutes from the hotel. Beer and liquor can be urchased here. Make sure to buy some of the fresh donuts at the entrance. Those things were AMAZING! There is a decent restaurant about 5 minutes from the hotel. I can't recall the name but if you ask you can find it. Great food and service. There is a little bit of walking involved when going from your room to the lobby or to the spa area. But its vacation, so you should have some time on your hands. Only reason I gave a low review for the location is that there isn't much going on around the hotel.

We just returned from our honeymoon at this resort and we LOVED IT! We rented a car from the airport (already planning to leave the resort for some local fare/activities) and the drive to the resort was about 45 minutes. It was a straight shot, so no problems with getting lost. When we arrived at the resort main gate, the views are just awesome. The road up the hill through the golf course was a sight to see. We did self-parking (which was reasonable $15/day) and took the shuttle up the hill to the resort. Right from the start the service we received was friendly, warm and helpful. Jesus and Camila at the front desk went above and beyond with answering questions and getting us settled in. The two of them couldn't have been more friendly (as were all the other front desk clerks we interacted with during our stay). Our room was in the Las Brisas building with an oceanview that was spectacular. The rooms are very spacious and have mostly everything you need other than a microwave. The restaurants and bars at the hotel can be a bit pricey, but again we anticipated that going in. We're from the New York tri-state area, so pricey is NORMAL for us. We spent a lot of time at Cafe Bella Visa. The flat bread pizzas were terrific and our favorite bartender Tanya makes the best drinks on the island. We made it a point to stop by there daily for drinks and multiple trips on the days that she was working. Palamino Island was a treat, however I wish that we had packed swim shoes, as the coral in the water was a little rough on the feet, but either way we absolutely enjoyed the water and all the activities offered on Palamino. We did make dinner reservations for some of the more upscale restaurants on the property and I must say the food was very good. Not necessarily, 4-Star quality but very good. We did venture out and did some sightseeing on our own. The hiking in El Yuque Rainforest was very nice (pack water). We had dinner at La Estacion one night and the food was TOP NOTCH! I would definately recommend it. If you don't have a car the $10 cab ride is worth every penny. We also ate at Metropol one night and again the food and service was right on point. Overall, I have to say the trip was GREAT. We have already started playing a large group family trip for this resort next year.

The concierge/front desk associates are helpful somewhat only when you are paying them a great deal of your money! When you question any strange fees you have incurred things get interesting. I spent a lot of time chin wagging with these people looking for answers to the array of fees that would pop up on my hotel bill. My room was spacious, and adequate for my personal needs. There was nothing special. I seriously don't understand the hype of this resort! If you like to golf, sure it's a nice course. If you enjoy entertaining guest/business clients again maybe.. Please explain to me why it's twice the price of a extended stay motel? Oh, it's the view, and it's located in Puerto Rico.... At this hotel you WILL spend a lot of money on anything you do inside it. You will be paying $20 per day for valet parking, which may be safer than self-parking which I was told can be a disaster. You will certainly have to make laundry arrangements since the only on sight laundry option is to pay the hotel $5 - $10 per item to be laundered. You will be paying a lot of money for small portions of food, and drink. Rooms have a small refrigerator. You will be charged insane prices for using the bottled water and toiletries in your room. Don't purchase anything in the convenience store in the lobby unless you enjoy throwing your money away. A conclusive breakfast can be made a part of your package, which I highly recommend but restrictions may apply...

Check-in took over a half hour (peak time appears to be Thursday afternoon?). Ugh! This particular area of the hotel needs work - more staffing? Checkout was same. And why couldn't I check my bill in my room via my tv??? Frustrating. Staff extremely courteous and gracious overall (and acted ethically in one particular incident). Restaurants: decent, but as has been posted here, $$$ (and you expect more at these prices). However, candidly - we could find no restaurant in the general area (off the property) that was decent. Avoid the little places right off Luquillo beach (unless you want to vomit!) Breakfast was included in our package. Ample, fresh buffet, but nothing spectacular (mango was about as exotic as the cuisine got). After the 3rd day, we got a little tired of the same cuisine and just started hitting the Starbucks. We were \"upgraded\" to a big suite that had one king bed in one area, and a pullout sofa in the next room. Views were spectacular!!! Big bathroom was awesome. However, setup is weird - the 1st room has awful sofabed, no closet, and kitchen doesn't have microwave or fridge. The fridge in 2nd room is way too small. Everything worked well in the room, however (oh, except the tv in one room - no reception, perhaps satellite issue, and AT&T Wifi was sketchy). The kids were never bored, even when it rained. Parrots were great and we loved the cats all over the property :) Pool was clean and well maintained and not overly crowded. The beach: private, so no riff-raff. Loved it! Sand very clean and water was cool and clear. However, agreed you need shoes and many layers of sunblock. Best beach ever! Getting to the beach: yes, it's a hike getting there, but we thought it was fun (at least the kids did... the elderly people in our party hated it). The funicular ride is a ton of fun. Waiting an hour for the ferry - not fun! Why can't they run it every half hour?? The ferry ride itself is fantastic fun. Parking - Self-parking is quite the hike, but sometimes the carts pass by and pick you up for the ride back to the hotel. Valet parking was a waste - had to wait up to 20 minutes! Overall, we had a great time and we'd go back. It's unfortunate it's so $$$ though - the extras really start to add up and there are miscellaneous little problems.

The best location is to walk around the point to find a private cove away from the crowds. We pulled our lounge chairs to the water edge and were in absolute heaven. The ferries leave every 30 minutes so make sure to check timing. The funicular can have a long wait... at one point the line was backed up along the walkway towards the pool. It seems to be the only easy way to get up and down the hillside. There are no pathways to walk down. It can also be loud at night (it runs all night long). We booked 80 minute massages at the Golden Door spa on our second day. The spa is well run and it is worth arriving early to enjoy the full facilities. We rented a car in San Juan and had no trouble finding our way around using the GPS on our cell phones. This made exploring El Yunque, the beaches in Luquillo with the great street food kiosks, and through Ceiba and Farjardo more enjoyable. The parking below was $15 per day. Valet was $20 without having to take the long walk/shuttle bus. Wish we had known this in advance. We booked a standard room in the old section overlooking the pools and were very pleased. The bathroom in our hotel room was huge... with a separate toilet room, closet, plenty of counter and storage space.

When we first arrived we were put in a garden view/ocean view room in Las Olas. Our room was disgusting. There was a hole in the ceiling, mold stains on the headboard and stains all over the room. We called to complain and were moved to La Marina. This was a \"deluxe ocean view room\". I wouldn't say deluxe. The view was nice, however, the room wasn't much better than the first room we had. We had dinner at Ballyhoo for convenience on our first night. We paid $8 for a disgusting baked potato - really? The other food was not much better. An okay salad for $12 (no meat).

(We were on a girls weekend trip, not that we don't love kids, but we were just hoping for something more relaxing). We left there quickly and hung out at the pool for a little while, which was fine. We left the resort for dinner this night, which was great. We went to Pasion por el Fogon, which I would suggest. This was MUCH better than the food at the hotel. We went to Culebra on our third day and were exhausted when we arrived back home. So, we ate at the Caribe Cafe. This was DISGUSTING. I wouldn't ever eat at a place like this.

Here are some of the lowlights; Upon visiting the restrooms with my three year daughter for a potty break it took three tries to find a clean stall. The first two were too poor to describe. My wife heard from another guest that someone was cleaning the rest room floor with a lounge towel. A maintenance worker empties a trash receptacle and carries a leaking bag across the entire pool deck with a trail of something i can't describe. We were besieged by local residents celebrating the holiday weekend and could not locate lounge chairs or a place to sunbath. When we informed management we were told that the resort was on \"lockdown\" and that security was on red alert for unregistered guests. Appaently, local residents are given a special package for the holiday weekend at roughly 50 % of what I paid. Service at the Italian restauranct Piccolla can only be described as insulting. No mention of any specials, no requests for drinks or refills, we needed to ask to have our empty dishes removed and never encountered our server after our order was taken. We rented an Ocean Front Suite with one bedroom and a living area hoping to put the kids in one room and my wife and I in the other. We were given two queen beds in our room and an air mattress for the kids in the other room. To make matters worse, the first three air mattresses had leaks and the hotel had to spring for a new one on the fourth try. After payiing $1,000 per night for my room i was told that there would be $3 charge per person to watch the children's movie at the pool. Having purchased the tickets during the day to avoid a line at night my wife took the kids to catch the beginning of the show. When I caught up I explained to the gate keeper that my wife had my wrist band. I was forced to present two forms of ID prior to being admitted to the water park. Quite degrading.

My family of 5 (three children aged 15, 10 and 8) travels fairly often, and are particular about where we stay. Because of the numerous negative reviews, we nearly cancelled our reservations to stay elsewhere. I am certainly glad that we didn't. We chose to rent a car as we were splitting the week between El Conquistador and Old San Juan. We found the drive from the airport to the hotel to be remarkably easy with a GPS (It should be noted however, that we are from Boston, where the drivers are rumored to be some of the most aggressive anywhere). We stayed in the La Brisas wing of the hotel. We had 2 adjoining ocean front rooms, both of which were freshly remodeled, spacious and spotlessly clean. We were located close to the main hotel and pools, however, we were also located above the funicular. I couldn't hear it with our balcony door closed, but it was certainly audible from the balcony. The views were spectacular. Our beds were comfortable, and all of the mechanicals in our rooms were in good working order. We found it helpful to arrive on Palomino Island early in the day (the first boat leaves the Marina at 9) in order to secure seats that would accommodate both the sun and shade lovers in our family. The beach was raked each morning and there were plenty of chairs. We brought some inflatable floats and our own snorkeling equipment, although these items could have been rented on site. We found the snorkeling to be just ok. The restaurant on the island was efficient, and the food was on par with any beach type restaurant. Bathrooms even on the island, were quite clean. Our favorite restaurant was Stingray Cafe. The food/service was outstanding. We also ate at the Strip House...very well prepared dishes and impeccable service. We ate at the hibachi tables at Blossoms, which was probably our least favorite, but the food was still quite good. The staff at Drake's Martini Bar were fun and the Mojitos were fantastic there. We went to Starbucks and brought stuff back to the rooms for breakfast to save time. Again, it would be advised to get there early, as the line can be extremely long. We used the water park twice. If you go after 1:00 it is 1/2 price. If you go during the last hour of the day, I was told the price was $5 per person. All three of my children enjoyed it there, although only the 10 and 8 year old chose to go back for the second day. The pools were warm and inviting. We enjoyed a few of the movies that they offered during the evenings as well. We felt that our interactions with all of the staff members, including the front desk, maids, waitstaff, funicular operators were pleasant, and they certainly went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating. One of the managers at the Strip House noticed that I had to give my sweater to my daughter (it's really cold in there) and she was thoughtful enough to lend me hers while I ate dinner. I would agree with the other reviewers who mentioned the lack of activity/entertainment in the hotel during the evening hours, although I'll admit, we were pretty wiped out from the beach/pool activities during the day, so heading back to the room by 10 was not an issue for our family. I typically don't like to visit the same place twice (so much to see...so little time), but I would make an exception with this property. We were quite sad to leave.

This room was also renovated and had a great view. This resort is quite large and built on the side of a mountain. The water park and ferry to Palomino Island are at the bottom of the mountain. The restaurants, most shopping, casino are at the top of the mountain. You are frequently on the funicular up and down. It is a big resort to navigate. You got to Palomino Island via the ferry.

Rather from platforms built in the trees. My husband and 10 year old also did the bio bay tour. They kayaked and had a great time. The water park was perfect for our kids. There are 3 slides and a lazy river. The area is small so the kids can run around. They have an outdoor restaurant where you can also get lunch. Since it was spring break most nights they showed movies at the main pool and had night swimming. Other than the casino there wasn't any night life. There was no live music and most of the stores closed at 7 pm. Since the resort is far from San Juan you don't have much to do at night. It gave me the feeling of an all inclusive but they forgot the night time entertainment. Also since this hotel was at capacity I have no idea why they closed the few stores they had.

I think the staff and maintenance crew does a fair job of keeping the place up given the size of it. -Sheets were changed everyday, not every 3 days as stated. There were bathrobes in our closet within the bathroom. There were some stains on the tub, but not a vacation breaker. Bathroom and room was always kept nice. They came in twice per day; once in the morning and in the early evening to turn down the beds with chocolates! Towels were even changed out 2 times per day! Our maid was just fantastic. She did not touch our clothing or throw it in a bag. -Service was simply AWESOME. I have no complaints as everyone from Maids to Bellboys were courteous and polite. One minor complaint I do have is that the concierge seemed a bit clueless on some things and gave false information. Room service from \"Armando\" was top notch and friendly. Food was delivered within 30 minutes, not two hours. -Didn't watch any TV or DVD's. I mean, you are in Paradise for a week! You don't come here to watch television! -The ferry ride is not a big deal. It's a nice, smooth ride. The beach area is very clean and not dirty as another author claimed. Plenty of places to sit, but you must get there early if you want a shady spot; they seem to fill up fast and the Puerto Rican sun is STRONG! I highly recommend SPF 30 or higher if you burn easily. Also, reapply sunscreen every HOUR and AFTER you get out of the water. Wear flip-flips in the water; there is a lot of dead coral and it is very sharp. There are some areas you can step in bare footed without worry, but I highly recommend the use of flip-flips or water shoes. -About the food and prices. Yes, it is a bit steep, but you are at a resort and not Denny's. To complain about a $14 margarita served in a plastic cup is a bit ridiculous. There is a major safety reason for this. At the pool areas, you wouldn't want someone to drop a glass and have the shards end up in someone's foot! As it was, someone dropped a beer bottle in one pool and that pool had to be evacuated and cleaned. -I strongly urge everyone to make use of the IN ROOM SAFES! There was an instance of a camera theft in one person's room and the resort takes no responsibility for theft of valuables. The bottom line is, lock it up if you would mind it disappearing! There is dishonesty everywhere you go. -Our room was on the La Marina end and the view was spectacular!

The reviews I read about the staff being unfriendly and the rooms being dirty could not have been farther from the truth. Honestly, everyone always greeted me and had a smile. The most friendliest of all was Mr. Ortiz...he made sure everyone was greeted and safely on the fennicular. He always recognized my boys. My kids absolutely enjoyed the water park (60 feet slide was the favorite...for them, not me). The beds were very cozy and comfortable, sheets always clean, always had fresh towels. Yes, the food was expensive but isn't that what you expect at a resort? Research and financial planning is the key to enjoying yourself here at El Conquistador. The only things I would like to see added to this resort is nightly entertainment (shows, a real nightclub). I wish they also had a Spanish restaurant on the premise with authentic Puerto Rican dishes. I will definitely return, probably in a year or two...I want to give them time to fulfull all my wishes!

I would recommend paying the premium for an oceanfront or oceanview room as they are fantastic. We spent lots of time in the morning and evenings having coffee or a cocktail and really enjoyed the view and ocean breeze. While this was a romantic trip for us, this resort is very family-friendly with lots of kids activiites, pools, evening movies pool-side, and the water park. Kids (and adults!) will also enjoy the funicular ride to the marina and the catamarn ride to the beach on the private Palomino Island. The beach on the island is fantastic. Gorgeous water and plenty of space on the beach to relax. I would recommend you skip the pools and spend your entire time on the island which feels like a slice of paradise. The food on the resort was good but not great for the prices charged. The best bargain for the price on the property is the burger at the steakhouse. If you are cost conscious I would definitely recommend stocking up on snacks, sodas and water off the resort. There are a few local places for food that are a short walk from the marina which were very good and reasonably priced for very fresh fish. This resort's setting can't be beat - but a rental car is a must for at least one day to explore the rain forest or Old San Juan. Carla at the Enterprise desk on the property was amazing and extremely helpful - offering us rides to the ferry (to Culebra - which is also a must-do) and back. Diana and the rest of the guys at the beach bar were fantastic and lots of fun. Generally speaking the service was excellent on the resort - we were constantly greeted and warmly welcomed. The one exception was at the check-in desk which actually tried to convince us that we would not be allowed to carry anything on to the island that we couldn't carry in our hands and that we should apply sunscreen before we left - and of course anything we needed during the day could be bought at the island shop. Complete nonsense of course, you can bring anything you like with you on the catamaran to the island, but definitely left a bad taste in our mouth. The rooms were recently renovated and very clean, with low-profile furniture to not obstruct the views. The only odd aspect of the rooms were that the closets are in the bathroom. Overall this was a wonderful resort with such a unique location! If you prefer early morning or late night strolls on the beach - you won't have access as the catamarans don't run all day - but this was not a problem for us and the island is well worth the inconvenience.

Let me first say that as an avid business traveler I was able to get the room for free, so maybe that does help with my review, but this resort was awesome. This place has it all in my eyes. 4 different pools to choose from, and 4 hot tubs as well. During our stay they said they were busy, but at no point did we think it was even crowded. The private beach was sensational. Sure you have to take a boat over there, but once you get their you won't want to leave. It is great. So many activities to do. They have all of your basic beach things, jet ski's, kayaks, wind surfing. They can all be rented. But what I was impressed with was the other things on this island. you get beach chairs for no charge, and they have hiking, soccer, baskeball, croquet, mini-golf, pretty much everything you would want to keep your kids entertained. And the water was just perfect. Very small waves, meaning you can keep your children out there without the worry of the current or undertoe. It was like a huge infinity pool. We didn't use the water park, but it looked really cool. The food onsite was good. I have read a lot about high prices, but the prices were slightly less than what we paid in St. Thomas and was just as good if not better. I understand people complaining about the prices, but I am not sure what people expect. Remember, you are going to one of the top luxury resorts in the caribbean, you have to pay a premium for some things. To get away from the resort food, you can take a short 5-10 minute walk down a side road to a little area where they start the bio-bay tours. Take the kayak tour if possible. And their are quite a few restaurants down there as well. We went with just myself and my wife, but are already making plans to take our 3 children, ages 5, 3, and 11 months. This place has everything you need at a resort. I found it absolutely perfect for a trip with just my wife, but think it will be the perfect vacation with my children.

The tile around the tub was quite old and poorly cleaned (the grout between the tiles was mostly black). The tub itself was old and you could see where work had been done to fix the tub (poor job fixing the fiberglass).

Upon pulling back the blanket for the bed, the sheets were stained (could not tell if they were old or if the sheets simply had not been changed). I requested the staff change the sheets (I could tolerate the other aspects of the room; especially since it was primarily just that the building was old -- e.g. the other rooms were probably the same quality).

I had read previous reviews about EC and thought I was prepared for the negatives I had read. First off, according to previous reviews, staying away from the older section (Las Olas) was on my mind. At check-in, guess where we were given a room? Yes, Las Olas. When I expressed my doubts about staying there I was told \"if it isn't up to your expectations, we will move you.\" So, off we went. The first room we were given had just been painted, and I mean just. The smell of paint was so incredibly strong I could smell it from the hallway. I have asthma and cannot be around paint fumes. We were immediately given another room, ocean view, which was absolutely beautiful. The only drawback to this room was it was right next to the funicular, which runs ALL NIGHT LONG. SO, if you go, ask for an ocean view room FAR AWAY from the funicular. Other than that, Las Olas was great. We were right above the pool and hot tub which were practically deserted most of the time. Now for the food. The breakfast buffet is expensive, $19, but it's ALL you can eat, which includes beverages, so it's cheaper than the al a carte menu. We had anticipated the expense, so we brought our own breakfast food. We ate dinner there once, incredibly OVERPRICED. It was over $80 just for 2 very blah meals. I really wanted a pina colada but they charge $10 for one. Didn't want one that badly! (Had one locally the next night for $4.) So, go local for your meals.....and rent a car. Every single tour is twice what you can pay on your own. We went to the island once and we thought it was very nice. shops overpriced, too, but that is typical for resort shops. Wait until you go to San Juan and buy your souveniers. They charge $15 a day for \"self-parking.\" There is no choice in this other than valet which I think was $25 a day. Would we go back? Yes. My son said \"this is not a hotel, it's a park!\" The views are beautiful.

The one major complaint and probably the only reason I wouldn't go back is there was no nite life or entertainment. I mean none.... Don't get me wrong we golfed, we did lots of swimming and went over to relax on the island and had great meals in the restaurants (very pricey but we did get the meal plan and it's a good thing because we probably would have ended up eating pizza's a lot... ) but it would have been a real vacation to see a guy playing a guitar by one of the pool bars or a DJ to play some dancing music or even a Karaoke nite or talent show, some kind of show after you ate there was nothing to do...

I have seen many changes, some for the better, and some for the worse. In late February of this year I went with my family for our sixth time. Overall we had a fantastic trip, however I was a little worried after reading some pretty bad reviews, but it was amazing, as I still knew it would be. The resort is huge - so expect a lot of walking. The grounds are absolutely breathtaking. It is located on top of a 300-ft cliff on the NE corner of Puerto Rico - which is a truly amazing location. The resort offers so much to do, such as jet-skiing, kayaking, scuba diving, snorkeling, the Coqui water park, sunset cruizes, and so much more. I was here for 6 full days, however this time I did not do very many activities, except for relaxing on the shores of the beautiful and secluded Palomino island which is a short 10-15 minute ride from the resort. My job is so stressful at times, and I often imagine myself sitting on a beach much like this one. My family and I needed to get away, and what an amazing place to go. The rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean and all have breathtaking views. Like others have said, yes, the food is ridiculusly expensive and not of amazing quality, but you are at a world-class Waldorf-Astoria resort in a very remote location. What do you expect? Service is great as long as you show a little respect to the employees...but remember: you are on vacation. Relax. Try to be more patient if it takes a few minutes (or hours, depending on what you are waiting for) longer than expected. Also, although it may seem annoying to have to walk, take elevators, or the Funiculars, the views make the walks worth it as they are spectacular. The Golden Door Spa on location is a great deal for five days if you like to work out, like me. They have a huge workout center, fitness classes you can take, and a great shower/steam room/hot tub floor. Well worth $100 for five days. Overall the resort is beautiful, the rooms fantastic, service great, food and prices average, island breathtaking, activities well worth it, and so much more. The resort is starting to get older, and although very well kept you can still see signs of aging. Five tips: 1. Try not to stay in Las Olas village- this is where the most signs of aging are (ex. mold, algae, severely peeling paint, and at one part the concrete was actually crumbling). Also only one Funicular stops here which is very invonvenient. I would recommend either Las Brisas or La Vista wings, as Las Brisas being my number one choice. 2. No matter what you do, DO NOT ask for an air bed. Long story short, we had a total of 4 different ones in 3 days- 2 had holes, one was absolutely disgusting and moldy, and the fourth was decent. When we had asked housekeeping to come back and blow up the first 2 air mattresses, they would take the old ones and bring another. The moldy bed was green and crusty, and I am not exaggerating. After having 2 beds that clearly didnt work, I had asked the front desk for a \"brand new bed out of the box,\" and by looking at this \"pile of mold,\" it was clearly in a very, very old box. Someone could get really sick from mold. Please save yourself the hassle and don't even bother. If you are that desperate, sleep on the floor. It is probably cleaner. Despite the moldy bed, I did receive a compensation. 3. Make sure to make your own transportation reservations to and from the resort before arriving. A resort shuttle is provided, however I have used it before and would stay away from it. Also, double-check the night before your flight that your driver will be READY TO LEAVE, as ours wasn't for 50 minutes. The lady in charge of private transportation to and from the resort kept telling me that our driver would be there in 10 minutes, but we waited there for 50. She also called me \"muy impaciente,\" which in spanish means, \"very impatient.\" I guess she didn't realize that I speak pretty fluent spanish. I also recieved compensation for this, due to her complete rued personality and the fact that our driver was on his iPhone the whole time, so he stopped short more than twice. 4. If you made dinner reservations, make sure to call and re-confirm them. One night we called and the person who ansewered the phone wrote down the wrong day. Very frustrating when they say you don't have a reservation but you made one. 5. Finally, RELAX. You are at one of the most beautiful and breathtaking places in the United States and possibly even the world. Be patient, because you have no worries. With these five tips, you will hopefully have an amazing and very relaxing stay at the El Conquistador Resort, like I have had 6 times in the past 10 years.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverdale, New York", "Title": "\u201cVery relaxing!\u201d", "Author": "Rebgel10", "ReviewID": "UR102169988", "Content": "We just returned from 6 days at the El Conquistador.

There are casual dining spots but we only had lunch there 2 times because we are so full from the late breakfast We loved going to Palamino Island. The beach is picture perfect. My daughter & husband went snorkling & had a great time. There are many things to do during the day. We did not leave the resort as we just wanted to relax. I would say that this resort is great for families with young kids & also for large groups. We loved the water park but found going one afternoon is enough although young kddies would love it everyday! After dinner there is not much to do. The casino is small but ok. There is a disco but no one is ever in there so I call it the ghost disco! At 7pm they show a movie at the pool for kids, which I thought was really nice. But if you have teenagers, then there is very little to do.

Checking in at the desk always sets the tone for my stay, and Patricia was a wonderful ambassador for this resort. Found the staff on the whole to be very well trained and professional. We had a beautiful cliff top- ocean view room in the Las Brisas wing. An extremely critical person who carries a supply of cleaning products, I found this room well appointed, clean and comfortable. The balcony with a view overlooking the sunrise in the morning was gorgeous. It was exactly where I was picturing myself the entire stormy New England winter long. I could not find much to complain about. Room was cleaned well every day, and all requests for things they might have missed, responded to immediately. The location is perfect for a couples retreat, or a family getaway- but I would not recommend if you are looking for any kind of nightlife! Nothing to do here at night. Casino opens at 4pm- we are not casino people. Some cute little shops- loved the Conversation Piece for souveniers. I was so grateful to have rented a car (rent from Enterprise to save yourself the parking fee-) as I would have felt somewhat isolated otherwise. Driving was easy, (bring your navigation device for sure) and afforded us trips to the local shopping areas, and most importantly to dining choices off the property. The food here is just average- this is an area where they could really improve. Most notably the Strip House was a huge dissapointment. After waiting ten minutes just to be greeted by a hostess for an 8pm reservation, we found the meal boring and the service extremely rude. Go elsewhere- much better options for dinner a short drive away. Palomino island is a beautiful concept- the privacy factor here easy to find if you choose- or take part in the many activities they offer. All the grounds are gorgeous and very well maintained. This was our first time in PR and would certainly stay here again. As others have mentioned there is nothing economical about this property. You will pay well for everything. Having spent the first weekend of our trip at the busy Conrad in San Juan, this just better suited our desire for a few lazy, picure perfect days of pure relaxation!", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cMy 6 night stay in a hotel not meant for individual guests...groups are preferred\u201d", "Author": "ronrica", "ReviewID": "UR101768820", "Content": "I have been to PR about 5 times and have mainly stayed in San Juan. This time I thought I would try something different. This resort is a good hour from San Juan airport. It has presence when you first arrive, but as I found during my stay, it is over rated. The focus is not on the individual but rather on groups (conferences, weddings, meetings. etc.) During our 7 day stay there was absolutely no entertainment or activities for us (unless you count the pathetic \"clown\" dog and bird show for $5...NO Thanks!). No cocktail hour, no tea/coffee break, no water bottles, nothing. They charge you for everything (water bottles are over $4, a 14% fee is added to your room rate, room tax + + ,...for Internet and fitness room even if you don't use them.) Why charge an extra 14% for something that I may use once or twice? I am a frequent business and leisure traveler and this hotel really knows how to rack up your bill with extra charges, very unwelcoming. Service: The only thing that makes this resort worth coming back to is the incredible staff that work there. Mostly local hires (which is great) the latin love is truly felt by guests. Our breakfast was something we looked forward to just to interact with our servers - to name a few of our favorites: Pirun (your smile is pure sunshine and you always made us feel happy), Emmanuel (what a gentleman), Israel (such a hard worker with precision), Yarimar (a sweetheart), Celines (you made my Mom feel special), Bryan (thanks for your help with the eggs), Stacey (our cheerful hostess), ...and the young men in the back kitchen who were always smiling and courteous. The Beach: There is no beach on the island - you have to take a shuttle boat to Palomino Island and you have to take a tram to get to the marina to hop on the boat. The island is nice but after a few days it gets old. There are no waves on the beach so it probably suits families with kids so they feel safe they won't get lost in the waves. Drinks are pricey ($10 for small pina colada) and a bit watered down. You have to pay extra for a real drink. The women at the bar are not very friendly (esp the skinny long haired \"blonde\" bar maid behind the counter - no personality) but the men were always helpful. Ivan and Michael opened a coconut for my Mom and made her day! Thanks guys!! Restaurants: The buffet breakfast was very good and reasonable. On site restaurants are all over priced. The chinese restaurant was just ok. The Cafe didn't look exciting. The best place surprisingly was the Seafood resto, Stingray, down by the marina. They had a very good seafood soup and salmon dish which I was told was wild caught. If you go past the gates by the marina and walk about 10 mins into town you will find a few local places to eat. We ate at Ocean View and Blue Bahia. Both were not bad and reasonable. The yuca mofogo at Ocean View was terrific. Tommy's Place was always deserted and a 'mans' hangout, so we never ate there. The hotel will discourage you from going into town (of course they want you to eat at their restos) but is certainly worth the walk if you want real puerto rican food. We went for walks as late as 10PM with no problem. Activities: None that were available. I inquired about yoga classes and was told the spa manages that but they charge ($10) a class and only have one if they fill their quota. I nixed that idea right away - wasn't worth my wait or time. Ambiance: I felt like an outsider since most guests were with groups. Sitting at a dinner table for 2 seemed odd when the majority of the tables were with 8-10 people or more and very, very noisy. They should have a section for guests that are not part of groups to avoid the loud inebriated groups. Bars: We only tried the bar outside on the lobby level. Fernando and Maricel were very friendly and funny to chat with. Great pair for a bar! I had a very good pina colada there. Pools: Looked nice - didn't bother to go in them, I am totally a beach person. Again, it seemed they were surrounded by the groups that were there. Spa: I went for the Back/neck therapy massage which was very good. The jacuzzi was great with the powerful jets and the steam room was not bad. My mom had a facial and enjoyed it. I didn't appreciate the automatic 20% service fee on top of the rate which is paid as soon as you step foot in the front door. So you pay for your spa treatment and gratuity before you even get started. Strange..... What if I want to give a really nice tip - then they are out of luck. Bad move. The spa hostess (Sonia?) was very, very personable, gracious and friendly Room: Our double bed partial-view room was ok - nothing special. Many ants in the room so I tried to keep it on the cool side but that didn't seem to do much. There is a two cup coffee pot - no tea kettle as I was told by phone. I had to ask 3 times in 3 days to give us a coffe pot maker (instead of the two cup one) so I could boil water for tea. There is an ironing board and iron in the closet with a hair dryer. Two bottles of water are on the counter but they are not gratis. You will pay for them if you choose to drink from them. The mini fridge is barely chilled. It doesn't really serve a purpose. The beds were comfortable and the alarm clock w/iPod connection is neat. There is also a DVD player. The view was somewhat golf/road/barely beach...nothing to stare at for more than a minute. We didn't rent a car but if you do, the parking is $15 a day. If you take a cab it is at least $15-20 to go 1 or 5 mins. It's a racket they have going in Fajardo with the hotels. Really a shame that they charge this amount for a 2 min ride to a restaurant. With a tip it can be $40-45 round trip. We did it once and that was the end of that. This is more expensive than a cab ride in NYC! Reservation: This is the most disappointing part, Hilton Honors will not grant you any points unless you make the reservation with Hilton directly. This \"clause\" is on their website in miniscule print and very hard to find. Very sneaky of HH to do that. They will probably loose my business if that's how they work. I made mine with American Express travel and they would not honor my Hilton Honors card for the room rate charged, although a HH rep told me that AMEX reservations would earn points.. Contrary to what I was told by a Hilton Honors rep - amex reservations are not ok when you check in. So I got screwed. The part that really gets me is that the front desk has a sign promoting the AMEX Platinum card for reservations. I used my Platinum card to make the reservation (which they clearly love since they advertise it at the check-in desk!) but they won't give me points for my room rate charged. It has been over two weeks since my visit and I have yet to hear from Mr. Dermot Connolly, Managing Director of the resort, who the check-out lady (Stephanie) left a note for regarding my concern and dissatisfaction (we actually bumped into him while walking through the courtyard to the Spa and he took a picture of us next to the beautiful unique tree). As I mentioned earlier, guests that are not in groups are just a number and I suppose this just proves my point. My experience with other major hotels, Marriott being one, is that I have always received points for my stay on all charges regardless how the reservation was made. I guess I will stick with Marriott. March is an exccellent time to go to Puerto Rico weather wise. It rained once for about 10 mins during our stay. Not a spectacular stay at this hotel but I would probably return to Isla Verde (San Juan) when I come back to Puerto Rico. I feel more welcomed there.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Altenburg, mo", "Title": "\u201cWorked out great for us\u201d", "Author": "hzlwd", "ReviewID": "UR101547579", "Content": "My wife and I took two college age and one high school age sons here for spring break. The resort is not brand new but still very well kept. The most breathtaking view I've ever seen looking out to sea from the hotel on the ridge. The view of the resort itself at night is stunning looking across the grounds around the pools and marina. A very relaxing place. We paid attention to past reviews and found one very helpful so we followed their advice on many things and had a great trip. Here are our tips. 1. Arrange a rental car by internet to pick up once you disembark at the San Juan airport. We arrived about 9:30 pm and the shuttle to the rental hub was waiting for us. We got a mini van for less than $200 for a whole 7 days, unlimited mileage. IF YOU RENT FROM ENTERPRISE, PARKING IT AT EL CONQUISTADOR IS FREE!!! THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LOT ON SITE AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TELL THE BELLMEN IT'S AN ENTERPRISE CAR AND THEY'LL DIRECT YOU TO THE LOT. BIG PERK!!! The return of the car was quick and hassle free with a 5 minute van trip directly to my departure gate. Buy a $100 Garmin and take it with you. They are perfectly accurate all over Puerto Rico. (side note: The San Juan Airport is easy to use. TSA at other American Airports could learn a few things from these people. They were thorough, serious, efficient, but pleasant to those taking departing flights-actually smiled) 2. We had a partial ocean view room (free upgrade from a garden view room given by the hotel without asking because we're HHonors members in good standing). The view from our room in the lower (older) part of the hotel down by the marina was absolutely beautiful. The adjoining rooms were very nicely kept, clean (excellent housekeeping), and spacious. Very contemporary. Don't be afraid to stay in the older part of the hotel. The trips back and forth on the cable car was a minor inconvenience and kind of nostalgic. 3. Bring water shoes and snorkel gear with you for Palomino Island. The ferry ride over took less than 30 minutes each way (including standing in line). Minor inconvenience. A very beautiful beach with ample beach lounges, a nice burger and sandwich place and bars for drinks. Prices were not cheap but reasonable. If you rent snorkel gear, it's cheap but has to be turned in around 3:30 (too early for my sons). Sea urchins along the coral reef so water shoes are necessary even though you don't want to step down unless absolutely necessary to try to prevent damage to the reef. There is a smaller island off Palomino with the reef between. Pretty nice snorkeling trip to and from but not for novice swimmers. We saw turtles, rays, beautiful corals, and all kinds of tropical fish. 2. There is a casual dress code but no sneakers or uncollared shirts in the evening. 3. El Yunque National Forest is the only rain forest in the U.S. Park system. It is within 20 minutes by car and is free unless you drive into the visitor center which is nice but unnecessary. The trails will take you to waterfalls and the summit of a couple pretty tall peaks. This was one of my son's favorite parts of the entire week. There is a burger shack about halfway up the forest road (between KM 10 and 11) that had good food and was a nice place to stop and get out. You can spend the better part of a day here if you want to hike. Take bottled water and a camera. 4. Resort food is good but relatively expensive unless you eat down by the marina. There are very good restaurants around Fajardo. We liked the Metropol. This is a Puerto Rican chain similar to Ruby Tuesdays but with Puerto Rican and Cuban food in large quantities. The fried plantains were excellent as was everything else we got there. (We recommend the Sangria and Metropol Punch) 5. We took in a movie at the Cinema in Fajardo (next to the Metropol.) If you're not bilingual, make sure you go to a show in English (can be checked on the internet). The commercials before the movie in Spanish were fun to watch. The seats were very nice. 6. If you can schedule your trip when the moon phases are dark (not during full moon), the trip to the bioluminescent bay is worth it but not if it's too light out. 7. We stayed at a hotel in Isla Verde near the airport the last night. It was decent but the area is like the run down parts of Panama City. We went to a huge mall at the recommendation of the concierge at this hotel and were astonished. It was the nicest mall with the largest array of nice stores I've ever been in. The patrons were dressed to the nines and were having a great time shopping. Apparently going to the mall in Puerto Rico is a special occasion. 8. The forts in Old San Juan are very interesting. Walking around Old San Juan will only take about three hours before you think you've probably seen enough. 9. We took a day trip by ferry to Vieques. The ferry ride is an hour each way and cost $4 round trip. The Red Beach was beautiful but no bathrooms, or concessions. The parking area was run down. Skip going to Vieques and stay on the big island. We didn't go to Culebra but were told by others that it was about the same. 10. You can stop at a store along the way and stock up on snacks and beverages to keep in your hotel room. Refrigerators but no microwaves in the rooms. Conclusion: This resort is very beautiful and has enough to keep a group like ours happy. The staff is professional/career level and were excellent to all guests. Treat them nice and they'll go out of their way for you. Don't be afraid to get a car and drive around. We wish we'd taken a road trip on Puerto Rico instead of Vieques.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laurel, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel -- But Huge, and You Hardly Know You're In Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "RedSabre", "ReviewID": "UR101512965", "Content": "This was my second visit to the El Con, and the first since the property had changed hands and undergone a much-needed refurbishing.

I would recommend getting the breakfast plan as it can be expensive for families, however, the choices and quality of food were excellent. So what are the negatives? We found the restaurants to be expensive even though the food was very good... so we also ventured off the premises and went to a local place called Passion which is a five minute drive from the hotel. The food at this restaurant was incredible and the price was great...highly recommended. I would advise the hotel to the upgrade the bathrooms....our bathtub had a lot of rust stains around the tiles...a little steam cleaning would fix that and a more expensive shower head should be included for a resort of this caliber.

Last year we went to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Hilton Waikoloa Village and had an amazing time (highly recommend). This year we chose the El Conquistador in Fajardo, PR. BIG mistake! Since it is a Waldorf resort we were expecting it to have expensive restaurants but were prepared to deal with it since the room was covered on points. Well, right when you think price doesn't matter they make you rethink that philosophy. Ok, we decided to just deal with the high prices. Since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Waldorf the food and service should be excellent, right? Wrong! The customer service was nearly non-existent. The food selection and quality were both poor at best. If you order a soft drink with your dinner, be prepared to walk to the bar to get your own refill (and get dirty looks from the staff as you bypass them). Sometimes you'll wait 15 minutes before the wait staff will even make eye contact. Then, when you get their attention, it becomes obvious they have no skill or experience in the service industry. When the food comes out they always drop it at the table and seem to run away; I suppose hoping you don't tell them something is wrong. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost humorous. That may be the last you see of your wait staff until you hunt them down and ask for the check. If you decide to valet park, call 1 hour before you need your car. We typically waited 20-30 minutes for our car. The valets are the most unmotivated group I have seen in my travels. They just don't care and expect to be tipped for their attitude. The rooms are also of poor quality. Being on the water can wear out a hotel quicker than elsewhere, but basic housekeeping is overlooked. Our room had a moldy shower, peeling paint, and outlets that didn't work. If this is typical of Waldorf then I'll take a Hampton Inn any day. Even the basic construction is poor. Watch your bill very closely. I needed to check out very early so I had the front desk provide an itemized bill the evening before we checked out.

While the \"resort scene\" isn't our usual style, we were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere (more casual and friendly than you might gather from their literature). We stayed in the Las Brisas wing - our room was lovely, clean, very comfortable with a spectacular view of the ocean. Parts of the main infrastructure are showing their age and wear, but on the whole the resort was clean and well-maintained. Everyone we interacted with, from the front desk to wait staff to house keeping, was friendly and attentive, and delighted to give us advice about sightseeing and activities off-property. The dining was standard over-priced resort food - not bad but not great, either, with the notable exception of dinner in the (bizarrely decorated and overly air-conditioned) Strip House, which was excellent steakhouse fare by any standard. Our server, Ly, was a delightful font of information about Puerto Rico. We ate at the Stingray Cafe on our last night, which was also good, and with a lovely ambiance more fitting an island vacation, but expensive and oddly lacking in local seafood offerings. Other than breakfasts, and an overpriced hamburger on Palomino Island on the first day, we dined off-property the rest of the time, for much better value and local flavor. We had a car, but the taxi service around Fajardo seems to be pretty reliable, and some of the nearby spots are well worth checking out, particularly El Veradero inside the Puerto Chico marina off the 987 - great drinks and beautifully fresh fish. We also found that, consistent with our experience elsewhere in Puerto Rico, the best meals are often found in the most unlikely-looking places: trucks on the side of the road serving outstanding home-cooking; dive-y looking spots crowded with locals; places you'd swear weren't big enough to have kitchens. A little bravery reaps big rewards, and as always, you do better branching out and eating what the locals are eating... if you want a cheeseburger or chicken fingers, you'll do far better on resort property. We are generally pretty active vacationers, and were looking forward to some of the activities advertised at El Con, and were pretty disappointed to discover that most of them exist in name only; Palomino Island is a beautiful spot for sunbathing, decent for snorkeling, and from what we could tell, absolutely awesome if you have little ones. But for activities, there was only one shaky-looking wave-runner, a few very (VERY) leaky kayaks - most without drain plugs - and some inflatables. We had been excited to play around with windsurf or sailing equipment, which we were told was temporarily unavailable due to maintenance issues, but other people working there said they had never seen any of it actually in use. Nevertheless, we had a very nice afternoon snorkeling, filling a kayak full of water and capsizing, and snoozing on a beach chair, but other than that one day we ventured off-property for activities. The resort would do well to update their kayak fleet, and maybe give some attention to the rest of their advertised activities (or at least stop advertising that they are available). On the whole, we had a lovely time, and would definitely go back under similar circumstances (needed a short getaway with a direct flight from home).", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bend, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cDisapointment at it's best\u201d", "Author": "Oregonvegetarian", "ReviewID": "UR99912597", "Content": "If it wasn't for the warm, tropical location this resort would have nothing else going for it.

The resort really needs to have constant maintenance given the size of it. That being said, our stay was pleasant. Customer service was good and it was a very relaxing atmosphere. The location was wonderful. Palomino Island was beautiful and there were never lines for the ferry to go over or come back. We ate at Stingray, Blossoms, and the Strip House. The food was just ok and by no means gourmet or five star for the prices you pay. La Brisas for the breakfast buffet was the same food every day - it would be nice if they changed it up a bit. Prices were very expensive for the quality received. The spa was nice but not spectacular compared to some others we have been to. Our treatments were good but way overpriced. We enjoyed venturing off the resort. The resort seems to discourage you from doing so, but take a left out of the marina and walk past the security gate and walk about 10 minutes and there are several local restaurants and the local marina which were fun to experience. We booked the Bioluminscent Bay tour with Captain Charlie in the electric boat and it was fantastic. We also ate at Le Estacion and loved it. We were glad we left the resort to experience these things. We would return to the resort, not for another couples get away as there were tons of kids and families.

Overall we enjoy our stay, but there are always issues with customer service that make us wonder if it's worth coming back. The first time we stayed here was in April 2010. We were given a very noisy handicapped accesible room in front of the tennis courts on a second floor. Also the room smelled like humidity and I think someone smoked in the room, even though the hotel has a non smoking policy. After waiting for more than three hours we were changed into a different room which was in a quieter area and had a much better view of the ocean, which is what we had booked initially. The rest of the stay was uneventful and we were able to finally enjoy our time. Now on our second stay in January 2011 we had problems with the service at their \"very higly rated\" restaurant Stingray. We were very happy to finally be able to have a quiet dinner just the two of us since our first daughter was born 6 mo ago. We got all dressed up and got a nice table at this restaurant, which was very empty. We were surprised that even with so little customers there were a lot of servers just talking and joking around gathered at the very entrance of the restaurant. We were greeted with very little enthusiasm and were directed to our table. We ordered wine and appetizers. When the server came to get our order my husband asked about this special seafood paella made with orechietti pasta, The server Jessica explained what kind of pasta it was and how it looked. My husband was very interested in the dish because of the pasta and ordered. When the dish was brought out to the table we noticed that the pasta didn't look at all like it was described to us it was actually just rottini pasta. So we called the server Jessica and she very rude and defensive said that they had run out of orichietti and that was a substitute pasta. My husband told her that it would have been nice she notified him of the change before bringing the item because he would have changed it for something else since what made him decide for it was specifically that pasta. We asked if we could get some adjustment on the price since it was not what we ordered. Then she came to us very rude and said that what we were paying for was the seafood not the pasta. We paid our bill and left the restaurant very upset. Stopped by the front desk area and complained to one of the employees there. She was very diligent and understood our complaint. She immediately went to the hotel manager and the hotel manager in a matter of 30 min had contacted us to our room and apologized for the inconvenience. He also proceeded to refund the full price of that particular item from our final bill, and told us that he had scheduled a meeting with Jessica (the waiter from the restaurant) to discuss the incident next day.

Let's start with the bad, if you're from \"out-of-state\" it's a bit of a trip from the airport to Fajardo so make sure to grab a snack at the airport before boarding the bus (it's a 45 - 50 minute ride), checking in takes a really long time and staff members are usually not fully oriented with guest services, there is only on-site parking for hotel guests (which if you're going for a business affair is quite a pain having to park across from the hotel and wait for a shuttle) and parking starts at $15 per day if I'm not mistaken. Rooms are small but recently renovated. There is NO night life in the hotel with the exception of karaoke a few nights in the hotel and every time I've been there (around 8 times) the night club is always closed, food is RIDICULOUSLY overpriced and a very minimal selection (if you rent a car go out of the hotel for dinner!!!), the charge for towels, the pool was dirty the second time I visited (leaves, bandages, plastic cups in the bottom), some staff members talk in Spanish in front of American visitors thinking they don't understand and that is just rude, if it rains there isn't much to do and Puerto Rico weather is very unpredictable, ferry to Palomino/Palominito can take a while and Coqui Water Park has 2 slides, a big pool, a kiddie pool and a slow current stream...and is an extra charge on top of what you're already paying. Up side: great location once there, the views from the rooms are spectacular, you get to enjoy a resort reserved area of Palomino which is great and once there you can rent jet skis or hop on the banana boat, there's a little caf\u00c3\u00a9 in the beach that offers regular beach-side food and drinks, I believe there's scuba available but I've never done it, and there's plenty of chairs with umbrellas available only to hotel guests. There is lots of shopping, of course over priced, but quite a few boutiques, souvenir shop, ice cream shoppes, etc... There are around 3 pools, spa (overpriced, but no surprise there), golf, and the Coqui water park is mostly good for little kids, big kids will get bored after riding everything twice. There are a few restaurant options (one american style informal restaurant near the casino, a formal Italian, Japanese and Steakhouse restaurants all good but beyond overpriced...a plate of food wont cost less than $23 in the formal restaurants and $15 in the informal), there's a Starbucks inside, the hotel is huge so you WILL get a lot of walking done and rooms are pretty cozy. Overpriced? Yes Good food? Not really but if you're stuck there make sure to take extra cash. Good for kids? Yes but not for too many days. I do recommend this hotel for it's sight, Palomino island, good shops and great location/rooms but if you're going for a family vacation and you're limiting your stay to just the hotel then don't go form more than 4 days, after that you will get bored and the price of food will begin to burn a hole in your pocket.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellesley, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Family Vacation\u201d", "Author": "mbm1964", "ReviewID": "UR99257427", "Content": "We had a wonderful time here.

First I want to say that I read some of the previous reviews that ripped this hotel and almost changed my plans based on them. I am glad I didnt because although some things were on target most of the bad things I read did not exist in some cases quite the opposite. The Hotel itself is huge and beautiful nestled atop a cliff overlooking the ocean. It was never too hot and the breezes kept the weather perfect for the 9 days I was there. Check in was smooth and efficent. I met both Sharise and Bianca. They were friendly and a pleasure to deal with. When I got to my room on the first floor of the main building I noticed I had a partial ocean view which was not what I reserved. After going back to the desk Sharise and Bianca both worked to correct this. The told me to go to dinner and they would have my bags brought to my new room and to get the keys after we ate. The new room was as promised. It was on the 5th floor with a view of the ocean. It was clean. No peeling paint or musty smeel in the bathroom as some had said. The only problem with the room was the terrace doors as they didnt line up right and the winds howled through them. They tried to repair the doors but it did not help but that was the only problem with the room which I learned to deal with.Veronica was our housekeeper and she kept the room clean daily and got us what ever we needed. One other note. Bianca turned out to be like a gift from heaven. As my stay progressed she continued to be attentive to us and made us feel warm and welcome each time we saw her. I knew that if I had any problems she would help. She is an example of what a staff member should be. The food was expensive but the stingray cafe was by far the best as we ate there twice. The other resturants were just ok but for the price these resturants should not be just ok. There were several resturants off property which we found like Clazio, and Pasion which we ate at twice which were excellent and the prices were great also. I wrote seporate reviews for both. The Breakfast Buffet at Las Brisas was another story however. This was the sore spot for me. I had a package where it was included but for the 19.95 price charged it was far from worth it. Eggs scrambled and watery. bacon which was hard and brittle. No omlette station included. 6.00 additional for an omlette on top of a already high price. There was cereal and fruits but this was not a buffet that I expected here. The pool area was clean and chairs were plentyful. Aaron who served us drinks and lunch at the pool was attentive. He was always busy serving but managed to make eye contact to make sure we were ok. The private island was a short ride away and was beautiful. There were plenty of chairs on the beach and again the service was great for food and drinks. The golden door spa was a relaxing place where i felt great. I was greeted at the front desk by karen who was a pleasent young woman who made me feel welcome. I had my massage with Cindy who was the best. She knew what to do and seemed to really enjoy her job and I could sense that. I would up booking a second massage with her and my daughter had one as well.The 2 convience store stocked anything we needed but the prices were quite high. If you are into gambleing then this hotel is not for u. Only 4 blackjack tables with a long wait to sit at some points. Also for some reason this casino closes at 12 from Sunday to thursday at 2 Friday and Saturday. No one seems to know why and believe me I asked. One last little tip. I like to have a car where ever I go though you can get away without one here. I rented at enterprise at the airport and since they are at the hotel as well I was able to park in thier lot behind the hotel (a very very short walk) and did not pay the 20.00 per day fee.

Private beach on an island near coral reef makes it truly a unique experience. Funicular and vista elevators present a great opportunity to see true nature wonder of a landscape that organically embraces the ocean views with smaller islands, picturesque beaches with marinas and yachts and green hills boasting tropical plants. We got a complimentary upgrade from a garden view to full ocean view and this literally made all the difference. The balcony overlooking the ocean with the evening breeze was essentially the best part of the room. All that, unfortunately, is complemented with a service that is almost obtrusive in some areas (like bellmen/porters that would almost yell at you if you try to move your luggage yourself) to non-existent in others (like a really sloppy room cleaning). To make a long story short: if there is an opportunity for a tip, they'll make sure not to miss it, yet when they have a reason to suspect that no tip will be given, they wouldn't bother doing anything for you at all. One notable exception is the waiting staff in the breakfast restaurant where they'd remember not just your name, but even the type of tea you asked for last morning. The restaurants in the resort are overpriced and do not carry a single local item. Not even a coconut or local ice cream. To put it straight, you do not need to go to Puerto Rico to get a mid-to-low-level Brooklyn fare at high Manhattan price. The worst part came at checkout, when the parking charges were \"mistakenly\" omitted from the bill. The trick here is obvious: we had enough of resort credit (included with the package) to cover the parking, yet since the parking was not on the bill, the credit got \"automatically forfeited\", yet when we came to claim the car, we were told that we have to pay the parking fees extra. After 45 minutes of going back and forth between the registration, the valet parking stand and a manager, the issue was resolved, but it left a really bad aftertaste. It was not really a great amount, yet the way it was done made me wonder if this is a standard practice there rather than a singular event. So, if you choose to stay there, do check your receipts and claim your car before you check out. Over-all it's a great place that unfortunately suffers from a sub-standard management.

The bathrooms are missing an essential, a fan to vent shower steam. the beach is a private island that you reach by catamaran, which is also a drawback because the last boat leaves the island at 5.

Fixture and fittings not quite so impressive and the lack of robes and coffee maker (although provided on request) was slighlty dissapointing. 2 things make this place stand out: Firstly, the beach on Palomino Island. The 10 minute catamaran shuttle ride is an experience in itself but the beach is wonderful - not too crowded with a couple of bars and a restaurant whene you need them. Secondly the staff at Elcon were wihtout exception friendly and accomodating. All in all a lovely place and one we would love to go back to.

We booked two rooms in the Las Brisas wing and when we checked in, I had a terrible headache and forgot a fellow trip advisor suggestion to make certain we weren't near the tram. Big mistake. So, I remind you, please don't book a room near the tram unless you have lived near the el in Chicago. Fortunately, I came across an assistant manager named Manny M. Manny is a stud! He's worked there a long time and takes great pride in his work. I didn't seek him out but just started a simple conversation with him. From there, he took care of everything. On our way to process a room change, he bent down more than once to pick up garbage. It was obvious he was vested in the place and that he wanted us to enjoy our stay in HIS hotel. My preference when spending over $450 a night would be that I wouldn't have to find a manager in order to get things done right but the rest of the staff at El Con was pretty quick to admit that they couldn't help me or weren't authorized to do so. For example, the rooms we moved to were cheaper than my initially reserved rooms. You'd think they would have just adjusted the charge accordingly. But no, instead I get some crazy speech from someone at the front desk about how the hotel room charges change like airline tickets and were dependent on when I had made the reservation. It was like talking to the village idiot. (At that moment AND when I booked by initial rooms, the new rooms were $50 less per night). In the end, Manny made it right and we ended up enjoying our stay. He should probably give classes to their other employees on customer service because he gets it. The breakfast buffet is, well, to put it nicely, nothing special. We dined at two local restaurants, la estacion and pasions. Both were very good. la estacion only takes cash so be prepared. the biobay tour was fun. you can walk to the bay from the marina at El con if you want. we went on a rain forest \"tour\" but there wasn't much of a tour. It was more of a \"I'm dropping you off here and will pick you up in an hour and a half at such and such a place. Our guide was nice but didn't teach us anything. We had a rental car and could have easily just done that ourselves. Spent one day in old San Juan and El Morro. Doubt you'd go to San Juan and skip those. Coqui water park was small but fine. not sure I'd do it again since Palamino island is more fun and its free. The waterpark is an extra $20 a head. In summary, if you want to stay in Puerto Rico, I'd have no reservations about staying at El Con. I don't think there is a better place on the island.

You could get lost in the resort hotel itself- lots of shops, restaurants, visual entertainment. The pool was amazing... many levels, waterfalls, swim up bar. Easy to relax there. Sure, the food was expensive. We saved a few bucks by choosing Starbucks for breakfast. We took the cinnamon rolls and coffee out past the pool, and enjoyed a very private veranda for less than $10!

Very nice room. It was recently updated, and the furniture and bed looked brand new. Had a bit of trouble getting the TV in the bedroom to work, but my husband figured it out.

We only ran into one staff member that didnt speak English well enough to help us with our questions and she brought someone else over to help us right away. Special thanks to Marisol at check in and Guillermo at Ballyhoos Bar and Grill. Speaking of food, that was our only disappointment. It was expensive for what you get. We ate 2 times at Ballyhoos (burgers were ok) and once at Cafe Caribe ( much better burger and about the same price $13). It took awhile to get service at Ballyhoos, but once we ordered, the food was timely and hot. Our other meals were provided for by our hosting business. Those meals were presented well, but tasted just ok. The staff serving the meals did a great job. It reminded me of the quality and price you would see at any resort/theme park where you are a captive guest. The resort is so large that it didnt seem like there were alot of people there, although there were. The only lines we waited in were for the funicular (tram) when everyone was going to the same place, i.e. Water taxi, or back from Palamino Island. The pool in the mid level was shallow, and therefore very quiet. We went twice and less than a dozen people were there both times. At night, in our part of the resort, the Coqui frogs were VERY loud. I had read about those here and brought ear plugs- thank goodness. Some may find them very annoying. I didnt have any experience with resort fees as those were paid by our company.

The trip to Fajardo was effortless, and when we arrived at the hotel (earlier than checkin time) the valet told us the wait to check in might take awhile, because of the line of people checking out.

It was WONDERFUL for a conference hotel. WHICH BUILDING? A couple of the people I was travelling with have mobility issues/trouble walking long distances. I had mentioned that to the hotel during the reservation process. We also paid the $19 for a potential upgrade to Las Brisas--but when we arrived, they had applied the upgrade for free and had put us on the 3rd level (rooms began 33xx)--I highly recommend this area to anyone with issues walking long distances. These were the closest rooms to the main hotel out of anyone in our group, and the third level was nice, as you could walk right out to the pool or the elevator to the funicular. ROOMS: We had adjoining king and 2 queen rooms. They were the same size and absolutely lovely. If you don't like modern decor, it may not be your thing, but we found them extremely comfortable. Yes, there wasn't much sound insulation, but we were not over-bothered. We were HUGE fans of the large bathrooms and HUGE walk-in closets. This was wonderful when packing business, travel, evening, and beach clothes. The beds were RIDICULOUSLY comfortable. I truly didn't want to get out of them. Had a lovely view of the water. WONDERFUL water pressure in the shower. SERVICE: While evening turndown service was a bit spotty, we found the employees of this resort otherwise fantastic. They truly went out of their way to accomodate every need, and did so with a smile. WONDERFUL staff. CONVENTION SPACE: All areas (I checked out some rooms that were in use by other groups) were in great shape, and all of the equipment worked (phew). Hotel employees managing A/V equipment were top notch. RESTAURANTS: Las Brisas: By the pool, good flat bread pizza. Pool Bar: Great Mojitos. (Don't get the mango mojito though--not good) Cafe Caribe: Decent--what you'd expect from a cafeteria. The arroz con pollo was quite good, hot dog and fries ok. Room Service: Cheeseburger and Fries, arrived hot and when they said. THough that was longer than I'd expected. Blossoms: Did the Hibachi table; was remarkably good. (I forget the name, but:) The Italian: The homemade ricotta ravioli was superb, and I also heard rave reviews about the lobster risotto. Neither the osso bucco nor the veal chop were very good. The semi-freddo was the best dessert. Stingray: Everyone went hog-wild for the chilean sea bass, though I'm not sure if that's a sustainable fish! I had the filet mignon--pass on that. Not many non-seafood choices here. Luckily, they had a DELICIOUS chocolate soufflee--yum. Banquet Food: Dinners were extemely blah, though desserts were good. Lunches were like an catered sandwich lunch. Continental breakfast's were pitiful, though the buffet breakfasts were passing decent. NIGHTCLUB: This was pitiful. They actually would have more guests dancing if they turned it down a little bit. I love night clubs, but...No. It was painful. POOLS: Las Olas pool was dead all the time--go down there if you'd like quiet. Of the three main pools, I visited the center lap pool and the pool with the swim up bar. For lap-swimmers: beware. They need to put up lane dividers, because people do NOT respect your lane. My particular favorites were the two large men who launched their rafts perpindicular across the lanes as another lady and I were swimming. They were concerned that we might splash water in their beer. Did I mention there were THREE pools on that level? And that we were only using two of 6 lanes? Yeah. Moving on, the swim up bar-pool was great. shade and sunlight available at the bar. Outside of the pool, there were plenty of places for both sun and shade. Golden Door Spa: Got an amazing 80-minute therapeutic fusion massage from Kathy--ask for her! She is fantastic! The amenities were very nice but limited to a \"o-furo\" bath and a steam room. The O-furo Bath is not a traditional ofuro bath. It's more of a hot tub with two waterfalls. The water was not hot enough for me. The steam room was nice. The plumbing facilities (shower, toilets) were in a bit of disrepair--fixtures pulling away from the wall, etc. That was a bit shocking, but otherwise it was very clean. Like I said though EXCELLENT massage. Someone else had a thai massage by Richard? Former wrestler? That they very much enjoyed. Palomino Island: sorry folks, never made it here, but i got rave reviews from the rest of the group. Ferry was fun and quick. Beach had plenty of room/chairs, and plenty of shade was available. Any CONS? These are all nit-picky: -The bus ride to/from was dreadful. If you get in at rush hour, anticipate 1.5 hours. There was a bottle of rum, but not enough to go around. Truly wretched. But it's like paradise when you arrive! -I would expect some more free amenities from a hotel of this caliber (Waldorf Astoria) such as free bottled water in the rooms, robes, etc. I was shocked they didn't have robes, actually. OVERALL: Beautiful, beautiful resort. Love the mountain/hillside vistas, the sea views, the tropical landscape, the spanish colonial decor...even the parrots when they weren't sqawking ;) Would DEFINITELY love to attend another conference here. Not sure if I would book it for a private vacation unless I could get a better deal on room price... The restaurants are really pricey, and it's not super convenient to go off resort. For my $$$ I would probably prefer to go to a Mexican Riviera All Inclusive. -It would be nice if the chinese restaurant were open during the day as well.

I have been to the El Con many times and have always liked it. You can find out all the other stuff on other reviews. 1. Rent a car from Enterprise at the Airport. It is an easy drive and all parking at the hotel will be free. ( I am going to pay for that one) If you have any other rental it will cost you $20/day/ 2. Drive out of the resort to the right. There are about 5 restaurants or more within 5 minutes that are very good and local in flavor. Some do take-out further down the road and are very busy on weekends. Totally O.K. to go to the more rustic ones near the baseball field. Ask at the hotel. 3, Drive out of the hotel to the left about 1 mile to Passion (make reservation). Relatively upscale..some groups brought in by \"I don't know what hotel\"...but very good food. The wait staff is very helpful. Tablecloths on the table. Not hip but cool enough. 4. Drive out of the hotel take a quick left and a quick right down the hill on the big road towards Fajardo. You will get lost unless you brought you GPS from the states- they work here!! You can ask anyone if you do. Most people speak English. At Route 3 and El Conquistador Avenue you will see a multiplex movie theater (enjoy as many as you want -mostly in English with Spanish subtitles) and all the most middle of the road films you can think of with an emphasis on ACTION!!! and the always good Metropole Restaurant. This place doesn't have the atmosphere of it's Isla Verde sister (that is a part of San Juan near the airport) but the food is just as good. Great alternative if you've got a rainy day. Popcorn is cheap. 5. Take your breakfast at Starbucks in the hotel if you haven't scored a free breakfast plan at the hotel. Usual Starbucks stuff, strong free wireless signal, and NY Times either for sale ore laying around. A tad more expensive than your local Starbucks. Remember the refill policy. Don't know it? Ask at your local Starbucks before you go. 6. The El Con food has been universally panned for years. But the outside grill near the pools serves good pizza and decent hamburgers. The wait staff there has great attitude. Some of them have been there forever. 7. There's a fridge in some (all?) rooms. Stop at one of the local markets and grab a bunch of stuff to bring with you. We always get fruit, wine, cheese, crackers, O.J. The hotel will supply you with an opener and glasses if you ask nicely. Saves a bundle. 8. At certain times of year there are outstanding packages with free nights and free breakfasts. Ask before you leave or look on the website. 9. Get your Hilton Honors card, if you don't have one, get it before you leave. Not worth much here but it may get you some perks. 10. Check out the Yoga instructor (Rita)at the spa . The classes tend to be very small and she is top notch, first class and very very smart and experienced. You will be impressed. 11. Ignore the pushy spa desk person, if she happens to be there. She not purposely unpleasant, she doesn't seem to know any better (in English or Spanish). Free apples on the desk, but not very tasty most of the time. 12, Ask for an upgrade for your room. 13. Do not pay extra for a room with a view. That's a five minute thrill for the view and a lot to pay for it.. 14. Be super nice to everyone. This is a monster resort with workers who are almost universally regular folk like you and me. They will go out of their way for you if you are kind to them. I can't tell you what they did for us because I know management reads these things and they will get into trouble. Suffice it to say I mentioned that I liked a certain food I could not find either at the hotel or locally, That mention did not go unnoticed and the dish arrived in a plastic bag the next day. I hope I haven't gotten someone fired. 15. El Palomino Island is far nicer in concept than execution. You will likely want to go for a day and the food there is perfectly adequate. You could bring a picnic if you wanted to do so. You can decide if you want to go for the extras they provide. I think there is horseback riding and the usual water sport stuff. you can pay for if that is your sort of thing. Remember, there is no beach at the hotel. You must take the (free) launch out to the island. 16. Make sure you ask for complementary vouchers when you check in. At different times and depending how seriously the desk people take you, you can get free spa vouchers and casino vouchers which will get you some discounts or a free game or two. 17. Find the short-cut to your room. There may be one you are not aware of. Ask the housekeeping staff or any employee you may see. This place is big and I've seen people repeatedly walking out of their way to get to their room. 18. There is no real night life at this hotel if you do not gamble or do not like loud Latin music played in spaces with lousy acoustics. HBO became my friend.. I think the rooms have DVD players (not sure) so bring some if would like.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Wylie, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cFantastic family vacation\u201d", "Author": "TravelinMom23", "ReviewID": "UR93661644", "Content": "We just returned from a wonderful 4 night stay in the Las Casitas section of this resort.

Figuring that even if weather was not great, there would be plenty for kids to do, then if weather was good, we could see about a room. Upon arrival, weather was overcast, but we decided to see about a room. The Front Desk staff, and in particular the management staff could not have been more accomodating. Mind you this was a couple of days before NYE, the hotel was near capacity, and we did NOT have a reservation. We were promptly checked in, escorted to our room and quite literally pampered from that point forward. The room was an incredible oceanview room (down at the marina), which the front desk manager had to talk me in to (I was told by friends that staying at the upper hotel was more central, which it is, but also more crowded). The notion of the boat to the private beach seemed a little hokey at first (I had been there before kids and before the ferries were upgraded to hi speed boats), but it actually was great. Being off the coast, the water was much calmer and clearer, and frankly you have everything that you could possibly need at the private island. The kids loved it. The other thing that the kids loved was the water park. By far the best (clean, not too big, safe, incredibly well maintained) water park that we've ever been to. I generally try to avoid them because I'mnot a fan of crowds, but this was actually a pleasure, particularly because I didn't feel like we had to be on top of our kids. The restaurants were generally good. Some better than others, although lunch was pretty good everywhere. I really liked the fact that there were a lot of little places to get a quick breakfast (coffee, muffin, bagels, etc). We did the big buffet one day, but that's too much food for us. The staff around the entire hotel was really great. I had the oppoortunity to meet many of the managers, and it is evident that the attention to customer satisfaction eminates from them.

We showed up at the El Conquistador about 11 am and were greeted with warm welcomes and an available guestroom. The rooms were spacious, clean, and recently renovated. We had a beautiful ocean view. We spent the afternoon at the pool where the kids made many friends from all over the US. My husband and I each learned how to make mojitos, poolside and we received a complimentary cocktail from our waiter. The kids played ping pong too. I asked the concierge about kayaking in the local biobay, as we were all devastated to have missed our Vieques biobay swim. She told me that all the groups were full, but recommended we just show up and see if there were any cancellations. What a great idea! We were able to secure spots for the 6:30 pm adventure with Fajardo Tours Eco Adventures ([--]). That was amazing and well worth the $45 a person fee. After the kayak we were wet, sandy, and cold and returned to the resort for dinner. The oven fire pizza was great and the kids loved the movies by the pool. We all slept great in the queen sized beds. The next day we took the free ferry to their private Palomino Island. It was beautiful! (Not as beautiful as Culebra...) The kids snorkeled, played putt putt golf, built sand castles, played soccer, gathered sea shells, and marveled at the iguanas. We had lunch and cocktails too. It was a very nice day.

With regard to the allergies, we were very happy with how the wait-staff and kitchen staff responded to our concerns and we felt that the food was perfectly safe. Overall, all of the staff at any position in the hotel were friendly and efficient. Check in was efficient without any hickups. Our room was perfectly clean, the beds were ok, certainly not high end, which is how I'd describe the room overall. There were feather pillows which happen to be a no-no for my wife and son. We called the front desk and then went out to the pool. When we came back, the new pillows were there and there was a call a little while later to check that we had received them. There are 2 different pool areas in the main hotel and the kids liked them both. Lots of nice facilities in the hotel and they did movies by the pool at night which the kids loved, my son watched an entire movie while standing and swimming in the waterpark pool one night. We took the catamaran to the island beach one afternoon and the kids enjoyed the mini golf and playing some volleyball. However, something they don't warn you about until you are there is that water shoes are recommended if you go in the water because it is reef like in terms of wildlife and you might step on a sea urchin and that wouldn't be fun. So that was quite annoying because we always travel with watershoes but had not realised we HAD to bring them. Overall the beach was nice and I wish we could have gone into the water which was quite warm (I did walk into it just a bit). The kids enjoyed the pools and the waterpark more then the beach so we didn't go back. We booked using a special package that included tickets to the waterpark and the buffet breakfast. This aspect was a really good deal, the buffet was excellent and the kids really enjoyed the water park. Paying the normal cost for the breakfast and admission to the waterpark each day would have had me seeing red, but packaged together I was smiling ear to ear. That being said, aside from the breakfast, the only restaurant that we actually enjoyed was the water side bar/grill in the harbour (excellent burgers and chicken fingers). Overall the food is way too expensive and more galling given that it isn't good. We were thinking that maybe it was us, or that we were going to the lower end restaurants, but talking to people by the pool everyone was unimpressed even with the high end restaurants. What was scary, was that one person said that he hasn't been to a single hotel in Puerto Rico that has good food and recommended going to local restaurants only. We signed the kids up for the tennis clinic 3 times (not cheap either), and the instructor was excellent and the kids got a good lesson and improved their shots (they've had three weeks of tennis camp over the previous 2 years). One afternoon we came back and our room lock had malfunctioned and could just be opened by turning the handle. Nothing was missing (although our valuables were in the free room safe). We called the front desk and a security person was over within 5 minutes to check the lock and called their locksmith. When it became apparent the locksmith would be delayed and would likely require some time to fix the problem, the security person assured us that he would protect the room and we could go to dinner in complete confidence. When we returned the lock was fixed. Overall, I would consider returning if we were going to be in that part of the island, but with the understanding that we should have a car and try to get out for dinners and have breakfast and lunch at the hotel. I was dissapointed that the casino didn't have poker, but did end up playing in a tournament at the Ritz in San Juan. I almost forgot, the coqui frogs are freaking loud at night, the kids loved hearing them and you can actually hear them in the rooms even with the sliding balcony door closed. That being said, they didn't keep us awake.

I liked staying in the La Marina village because it was more secluded than staying in the main hotel, and it was very convenient to have the water taxi very close to our room. I also loved the architecture of the village because it had a very Spanish authentic look to it. I spent most of my trip in Puerto Rico lounging in my room just relaxing or lounging on the beach at Palomino Island. I think that this resort overall was great. The only issue I had with this hotel was how every single restaurant was good, but way to overpriced for what they were offering. The only restaurants I thought were worth the price were Blossoms (Hibachi Section) and the Strip House. You can't get an entree for under $20, which was pretty ridiculous. The appetizers (price wise) were even worse. For example at the Chinese section of the resort you only get one spring roll for $10. That is outrageous.

This place has great bones and needs some good investment to bring it up a notch. Our children, 8 and 10, had the time of their lives, and therefore we had a great time, too. The kids loved the funicular down to our rooms (we were on the Marina level, which I would recommend with children). They loved the water park (3 slides and a nice pool, costs extra). They loved the private island (iguanas! beach! kayaking! hiking!). They enjoyed the \"dive-in movies\" at the pools. The location on the side of a cliff is spectacular, and the private island (a 10-minute catamaran ride away) was truly beautiful and special. Our room was comfortable, and the maid service was very good. The resort is very spread out, so there is a fair amount of walking-funicular-elevator... we certainly did not want to forget anything in our room when we went \"upstairs,\" because it would be a 20-minute trip to get back to the room. The staff was helpful, although not outstanding. We had very dicey weather, but the hotel had some indoor activities and game rooms, and also opened the water park for free on a rainy afternoon. The concierge service was a bit vague about some things, and it was hard to tell what programs were hotel-sponsored and which ones were just available if you cared to take care of it. The lobby was very large and spread out, with tropical birds in cages and the all-important Starbucks. The negatives were the food (although I have come to expect this at most resorts)--costly, not very good, and often lines--and the lack of good evening activities and/or shows for adults. Since we were there as a family, the evening programs did not matter, but I would not come here without the kids. With the lines for breakfast (and for us, a hike up to the restaurants that served breakfast only to head back down to the water park and/or island), I would seriously consider getting room-service breakfast. (Our room had a refrigerator and a coffee maker.) There is an Enterprise car rental in the lobby, and we rented a car one afternoon to go to El Yunque, the rainforest (a must-see, 30 minutes away). There was a bus tour through the resort, but it was considerably cheaper to drive ourselves and see the same thing. I think that would depend on your comfort level. The same goes for transportation to and from the airport. It was much cheaper to take a taxi than the hotel shuttle. We regretted not booking some things earlier, especially the kayaking tours of the bioluminescent bay--they were full when we tried to go. FYI, the hotel wi-fi was ATT, which seemed to work well for ATT devices but not very well for other devices, even though you could technically link into the system. Our Verizon phones did not receive or send calls very well, either, which made them virtually useless as communication devices within the resort. The only other tropical resort I have been to is the Atlantis in the Bahamas. In comparison, El Conquistador seems a bit tired. On the other hand, I loved being able to go off-property and enjoy the culture of Puerto Rico itself. All in all, we had a great time and would go back again.

I had to wait 15 minutes for a shuttle to the parking area and then when i am taking my car out the validated ticket did not work because it is only valid for 15 minutes..

The Palomino Beach is nice. There is one lunch place on Palomino Island and it isn't very good. Fried foods or burgers for the most part. And you'll end up with a bill of around $50 per couple to eat there. The resort property itself is very nice and there is a golf course on site. There are two large pool areas. The pools are very plain looking. This is a place that seems to cater to families. Every night you go to dinner you will have children nearby.

The first day we toured the grounds ended up eating at the Japanese steakhouse onsite for $120/couple. Great food. The next day we hit the El Yunque rainforest and hiked to La Mina waterfalls. Great drive and beautiful hike. Before returning to the resort, I hiked the west shoreline of the Nature Reserve de las Cabezas de San Juan peninsula close to the resort entrance (5 min. north from the municipal park). Both these hikes were fantastic. That night we ate at La Estacion which is less than two minutes north of the resort entrance and offers very tasty food and quaint atmosphere ($15-25/plate).

We expeciallhy enjoyed the teppan-style dining where the chef entertained us all with his knife skills!

This is a resort and in resorts you will pay costly for food....bottom line. The most frustrating thing is that the resort is very secluded and there are no taxis.....anywhere. You are completely stranded unless you rent a car. Not to mention if you want to walk, there are points where there are no side walks. It's not very safe. The only real option to get out of the hotel is the side road near the ferry. It has a gate but it wasn't locked when we went through it. Even if it is locked all you need is your hotel key. You can walk down to some restaurants/bars. Almost all restaurants were closed during the week (not sure if this is just a low season thing or not). We took the Bio tour from Kayak Puerto Rico there...which was amazing. We reserved a spot for the mini boat tours (which is located in Puerto Chico...also near by but not walking distance). We took the hotel van (which charged us $15 for a 3 min. trip) not exactly knowing how we would get back but prepared to walk. Unfortunately we could not take the boats out that day due to weather conditions. We ended up eating at a restaurant at the dock and having a great time (Charlie the owner is awesome!). Palomino Island is so great! It really makes this hotel worth visiting. We went horseback riding on the island (up to the highest point and then down to the beach which was fun). I looked forward to this trip every day because it felt as if we were leaving the hotel (there is no charge for the ferry). Overall It is definitely not the most beautiful hotel I've ever been in. The food was ok. The only problem with the bill was we were over charged $12 which was quickly corrected (we saved our receipts). Some places take credit cards, some take cash... so have both (there is a couple of ATM's in the hotel)...you can charge everthing to the room if you wish. Our room was in Las Brisas and we had an amazing view. To sum it up....there was nothing bad about the hotel...and the good was so good that it made it worthwhile....if you get a good deal on the room!", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cSo much to do, with a hypnotic view!\u201d", "Author": "WanderingMichigander", "ReviewID": "UR82746240", "Content": "My friends and I (forty-year old women) went to El Conquistador in July for a 5 day stay. We had a blast -- though the hotel doesn't have a beach, it has a ferry to a beautiful private island. The pool was large, the spa treatments were wonderful, and we got a free buffet breakfast every day. We were also within walking distance of town, where we were able to go on a bio-bay kayaking tour and had a great meal (WAY cheaper than the restaurants at the hotel - wish we would have discovered how close it was sooner!). The hotel's food was good, and we tried several of the restaurants, but we didn't get to try typical Puerto Rican dishes until we ventured off site. Cons: We didn't get the two double beds we requested, and because the hotel was full, we ended up with a king and an air mattress (my friend snores very loudly and we didn't want to share a bed). The hotel was packed (not their fault) so breakfast was really crazy. The last ferry leaves the island too early -- it would have been nice to be there until dinner/sunset. The drinks were very expensive, like on a cruise (to be expected, but still, a big added expense). Some of the common areas, like the elevators and lights, were sometimes less than clean or in disrepair. Pros: Beautiful view, pool, friendly staff, facilities were in good shape, everything on site you might need. The airport shuttle was prompt, and the hotel's island was incredible. The spa was surprisingly empty for such a crowded weekend, but the services were top notch. The gardens and grounds were lovely. I would definitely go back, and knowing how close the town is, would venture out sooner and have some great Puerto Rican food for a lot less money.

We requested a room in the main area of the resort \"Closest to the casino.\" I know this request was in their system because they read it back to us exactly upon check in. I told them our friends were in Las Brisas, and requested a room in the same building. I did not ask for a view, upgrade, etc. They informed us that there was nothing available in that building. I asked for something close by, and they offered us an \"upgrade\" to a full ocean view. Can you imagine our suprise when we are lead ten minutes away, down the funicular, to the building furthest away from where we wanted to be? And when we opened the curtains our \"full ocean view\" was blocked by the tops of 2 giant palm trees and the roof of the building in front of us! We were tired, and didn't argue. After all, we weren't actually paying any more for the room. We cleaned up, met our friends at a restaurant off campus called Passion Something (excuse my limited Spanish skills and spelling). It was quite good and close by, and advertisements can be found in the hotel literature. Although for the price conscious, it is not inexpensive if you include an appitizer and cocktails, plus the tip for valet if you rented a car. The portions are very generous there...it seems if you went with a group you could order a few things, share and be satisfied. The next morning (Friday) we went to Palomino Island on the ferry. This is a real downer if you want a convenient beach, but there are restrooms (ladies was very clean between 10:00am and 1:00pm when we left), a little cafe offering cocktails and a limited lunch menu (simple, decent) and the beach itself was very clean when we arrived, looks like they rake the sand every morning. Our friend requested that our room be changed (he is a diamond hilton member) and they graciously accomodated us for the rest of the stay with a room in the same building as our friends. The gentlemen at the Hilton desk was very nice, said he would call us when the room was ready, and did so. He even sent the new keys down with a bellman. A word about the rooms: slightly dingy would be the best way to describe them, although we encountered no actual filth in either room. The sheets were clean, smelled clean, if not perfectly pristine white (few light marks but it's a hotel), and the bed was made nicely. The wear is obvious on the vinyl white upholstery and the throw pillows. Bathrooms: Not exactly modern. They are cleaned up and decorated to look modern, but the actual bathtubs (in both Marina and Las Brisas) and the toilet (in the Marina) were old. The bathroom set-up in the Marina room was better with a private toilet closet, because both rooms have the main clothes closet in the bathroom...tough for more than one person to get ready, use facilities at a time. In addition, the refrigerator and \"bar\" area was in the bathroom of the Las Brisas room, making it a large but strangely multi-purpose space. The Pools: Saturday was something. I know it is the busiest day in the resort, as lots of local / weekend vacationers are there. But I don't think all of the people using the facilities were actual guests. Not too sure what the story is there. The later it got in the afternoon, the more chaotic it got. Sunday was calmer, although there was trash in the pool (like plastic fork wrappers, plastic cups, etc) that multiple employees walked by. I picked it out of the pool myself because I couldn't stand looking at it anymore. Unacceptable. Pool Towels: Thin, faded and dirty looking. Dotted with gray marks and dirt stains everywhere. Time to invest in some new towels. Sunday we discovered that the hotel had checked us out of our room without our knowledge. We had a reservation for 4 nights (3 booked on points, the last paid for) and we let them know this upon check in, and were assured it would not be a problem. So, when my boyfriend went up to the room that afternoon, he had to go to the desk, where they told him he had to check out and check in again. So he signed the bill (after telling them to take parking charges off...we had no car), signed the imprinted copy of the credit card, and then asked to be checked back in. The desk receptionist then informed him he needed a credit card to check back in. Which, even though he had signed the imprinted copy of his own card in her presence, was a big problem, because our credit cards were locked in the safe in our room which we no longer had a working key for. Really. I can't make this up. A word on your bill: If you must go, read it closely! They tried to hit us with parking charges again the next day when we checked out for real. Other notes: The jacuzzi was filthy. It looked okay from where you enter, but the handrail was attached only to the top of the stairs. It had completely broken off the bottom of the whirlpool. Anyone for a tetnus shot? Not to mention there was mold (not a little...dark green and A LOT OF IT) all over as well as a good deal of trash left over in the bushes by some previous occupants. This is not only unpleasant, but that handrail was absolutely unsafe. Sitting at the pool bar: The wood finish is chipping and unmaintained and a real turn off--especially because it's an easy fix, and you are staring right at it while eating or drinking. Also noticed that every cocktail napkin that I got, at every public area bar, without exception said \"Lexis Nexis\" on it. I am sure they had a convention there, but they weren't there when we were there. For a name like the Waldorf Astoria, I saw nothing that even reminded guests where they were staying. Way to brand, Hilton Group. I actually asked the bartender when the Lexis Nexis convention was in town and he said, \"I can't even remember.\" Whether they were there the day before we showed up or three months ago, it's not a good sign. The website: The pictures actually look nice, but when you arrive you will see that everything, everything needs a fresh coat of paint. Also, looks like there were at one time lots of retail stores that have gone out of business in the main lobby area. Kind of desolate. Bottom Line: This place is a big waste of time. It is a two star resort at best. If you are travelling from far away, skip it, spend a little more at a better hotel, and save yourself the extra money and inconvenience of having to rent a car and park or take a cab or shuttle an hour or more to this hotel (did I mention the traffic? Lots of road construction going on now.) You can do much better for your time and money than this place, even if you think the hotel rate is a \"deal\". I know it stinks to give a place a bad review, especially since I really wanted to enjoy this. And I travel a good deal. Not everything is going to be great, all the time. I understand the toll humidy and weather in the Caribbean takes on a property. I understand and welcome the concept of \"Island Time\". But there were so many incidents (even more than I wrote, and I've been writing a long time) that I felt like I was vacationing in a hostile environment. Outside of a few stand-out employees, a beautiful view from our second hotel room balcony (unexpected but a nice treat) this is not a place I would recommend to my worst enemy. Well...maybe my WORST enemy.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cPleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "KIDSMD", "ReviewID": "UR80886729", "Content": "Just back from 4 wonderful nights at El Con.Nowhere to be found any of the Horror stories that I being reading at this site before the trip.After reading some of the reviews I was kind of concern & was ready to lower my expectations,to my surprise everything went really well.

Go during the off season and you can get a great price on your stay (we used cheap caribbean.com and got airfare from detroit, a room upgrade and free breakfasts for $449 per person for 5 days plus tax and tips). Rent a car at the airport and manage your own excursions. If you walk 10 mins. out the back gate from the hotel's marina, there are a couple of good restaurants and food stands and you can book a tour of the bio-luminescent bay there. Music in the bars there at night. Stock your mini fridge with snacks and drinks. We loved eating at some of the 60 kioskas (mini restaurants) at Luquillo Beach--local cheap tasty and fattening! The not too distant El Yunque National rainforest has waterfalls and no admission fee. There is a big outlet mall if you like that sort of thing. We used valet parking for $20 + tip rather than self parking for $15 each in-and-out because it was where we chose to have our little luxury. The hotel restaurant menus looked expensive but no more so than the fine dining places we went to in San Juan. Food is more expensive on islands. Catamarans to the private island and beach activities are free and run every hour from 9 to 3, last one returning by 5 --not sure if those are just the off season times. It was dark out by 7pm--but the beach property was great! Lots of activities there too. Several swimming pools including one with a swim-up bar-- drinks are a bit pricey but it was part of the experience. There is a free DVD player in the room (remember to plug in the connectors in the back) so we brought a few DVD's for nights when we were too tired to do much more. Our room and bathroom were very clean. We always tip room cleaners generously and in advance and seem to get great service. We also said Buenos Dias and Gracias a lot. September is hurricane season but we had beautiful weather. Historically, a big one hits PR once in 20 years--We took the risk. It rains every afternoon for about 10 minutes and then it stops. There weren't that many families with kids when we went, perhaps because of the time of year. We never bothered with the spa or waterpark so can't comment on those.

We are usually very happy with these hotels which usually offer excellent service in a wonderful location. The location of El Conquistador is great for water views from most locations. The resort is not located on a sandy beach. They own Palameno Island which is lovely and offer a boat to get you over to the island. Once there they offer everything you need. The boat ride takes about 10-15 minutes. The beach and pool towels need to be replaced, they are very thin, stained and many have holes. The customer service was average. The staff and bellmen were friendly at check-in, but we had 2 issues during our stay which were not addressed at all. First, there was no shower liner just a fabric curtain so during every shower the bathroom flooded with water. This got no response. Secondly, there was a very hard, long rain storm. We were in a La Marina room on the top floor. Water was pouring down from the ceiling and walls in the toilet room and we had to put many towels on the floor which couldn't even contain the water. Again I called with NO response. They should have at least come to mop up the water and remove all the wet towels.

However, they did not have a room available and gave lot of silly reasons such as the room is being 'inspected' etc. and delayed us till 5pm. we were so exhausted by then we skipped all other activities for the day. Like several reviewers said, we discovered just how terrible tasteless the food was - especially if you don't like sharing dinner with cats, birds and flying insects. The saving grace was the included morning breakfast buffet where we could find something or other to fill us up. Like a lot of others, we rented a car rather than use the shuttle. Rental was a hustle and parking was a BIG hassle, but it allowed us to stock up on water (most Caribbean places skimp on water and charge so much for it?!) - a 20oz bottle costs $3.50 in the room. We also ate dinner outside on all days after the first day fiasco. El Estacion and Metro were good. We drove to El Yunque rain forest, which was quite nice. Beware of a very very long trek to the LaMina falls. We also went to the bioluminescent tour on Kayak. BEWARE of this trip if you are not an expert kayaker. Imagine kayaking in pitch darkness in the narrow pathways in mangrove forest with oncoming kayaks who cant see you either. However, I was impressed with the bioluminescent spectacle. On our last day we were nearly engulfed by hurricane Earl and they shut off the resort Funicular service, a cable trolley service to lower levels and moved several people to upper level. We had to use the room service to retrieve bags from the room. The resort beach was terrible, with sharp stones in sand and dead corral reefs very close to surface making it unpleasant to be in the water. A word of warning if you are thinking of renting from Enterprise car rental at San Juan airport. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a classic bait and switch service. We got advertised quote of $10 per day. Our total bill for 4 days after all the hidden fees etc? $281 !.. go figure. After identifying a billing errors such as billing us GPS they did not provide and billing for 5 days instead of 4 for being an hour late over the 12pm deadline etc, we still paid over $200. The car had severe wheel balancing problem so we had to restrict driving to minimum distances. The rental agency would not provide a replacement claiming nothing else was available.

There is no doubt that the location of this hotel is outstanding, simply a beautiful setting; but from there everything else is terrible. I grew up in Puerto Rico and I am used to the lay back attitude but the attitude of the service personnel at most of the facilities at this hotel was simply rude to say the least. With the exeception of Anna at the Hilton Honors Desk, giving the greeting of the day by the rest of the service personnel was not something they are acustomed to doing...that was clear.

But wait, the next day when we went to retrieve the vehicles to go to the airport, they could not find the 15 passenger van and after one hour my wife drove to the lot where the valet parking vehicles were parked and had to point to the vehcile....never mind that we had described the van as a \"15 Passenger White Van with big blue letters on each side that read THRIFTY.COM\" When I approached the hotel management for help since we were going to miss our flight, the management told me that the Valet Parking Attendants did not work for the hotel, that there services were subcontracted to another company.

We stayed there from August 25th through Sept 1st. Before leaving, I was a little worried due to all of the bad reviews I had read. We figured what the heck, there were also good ones, so we hoped our experience would turn out to be good as well. We're both very easy going. So I figured we'd be akay. I will start with all of the good things about the hotel before ending with my one big complaint. The ride to the hotel wasn't as bad as I had read in recent reviews. We did rent a car from Entrerprise and that saved us alot of money. We rented it for 8 days and it came out to $150.00 total. We did opt for the insurance which I recomend, because people in Puerto Rico do not follow the law when it comes to driving!! It took us no more than 45 minutes to get to the hotel. On the way to the hotel, we stopped at Wallmart and stocked up on beer, water and snacks. Everything at the hotel was expensive. Even thier Starbucks was double the price we pay. Everyone at the hotel was very nice and the grounds are beuatiful. We never encountered anyone rude. We stayed in a room in the Las Vistas area. which is right next to the main hotel. It was perfect. We didn't have a view of the ocean or the pools but we had a view of the golf course and since my boyfriend is a big golfer, he was happy. The hotel is very big and spread out. We were really close to the entrance of the hotel and because of that, we were close to starbucks, shops, restaurants, casino and pools. The Marina area would have been nice too, but if you're staying there, you have to take the funicular and walk just to get to those areas. We visited Palomino island and it was gorgeous! We never waited more than 5 minutes for the funicular and maybe 10 for the ferry. The ride to the island was very enjoyable. The water at the island was clear and the weather was great. We did have lunch there which was about $40.00 for two of us. The food was prertty good. This was the first of only two meals we had at the resort. Our second was at the bar and grill which is located at the marina right by the ferry entrance. The food was okay. Not great and a bit expensive. Right outside of the resort, turn right and about 5 minutes away, you\"ll find La Estacion. Very nice atmosphere and great food. probably the best we had the whole time we were there. They are open from 5pm until midnight everyday with the exception of Thursday. they are closed completely on Thursdays. It's not a ten dollar meal but for the price, the food is great and the portions are pretty big. I believe we spent around $80.00 total for dinner and drinks. Highly recomended. As far as parking goes, they do charge which we think is a total rip off. I would think that if you're already paying for the room, parking should be included. We parked illegally in the Enterprise parking lot and walked a little ways to our room. We didn't mind it at all. You're not supposed to park there unless you rent the car from the hotel which is alot more expensive than doing so by the airport. Park there. They will never know. There isn't much to do at the hotel after hours. The casino closes early and the night club was no night club at all. It was empty everytime we walked by. My biggest complaint of all, like so many others have mentioned before, is the housekeeping service. Housekeeping is in desperate need of new managment or new employees. I have to say, the bed was very comfortable. Our room was a little moldy, but that was ecpected after reading recent reviews. The bathroom needed a good cleaning. Especially the tub. Not once did anyone vaccumn, sweep or mop our room in the 8 days we were there. And our sheets although clean, were not changed until I requested them to be a few days later. I understand that sheets aren't changed daily, but they should be changed at least once in 8 days without being requested. I purposely, left pieces of lint and string that had fallen on the carpet and bathroom floors, on the floor, hoping it would be picked up. It never was. Housekeeping is BAD!! All in all, our vacation was great. Hurricane Earl hit close to the end of our vacation. The day that the hurricane hit the island, we stayed at the hotel all day and I have to give it them, they set up a game room where people could hang out and play games.

However my wife and I both agree that we knew what to expect coming into the resort, which is why we enjoyed ourselves more than most people here. Here are a few things to know: Rooms - The rooms are nothing incredibly special, save for the view. The rooms are decorated in early 2000s Miami Chic white and neutral tones. The resort is old, so you can hear noise outside your room. However we pretty much only enter our room to shower and sleep, so this was not a problem for us. The bed was comfortable and the down pillows were ok, not great and not terrible. But the view... WOW. We had an amazing ocean view from our bed. 4* out of 5* Bathrooms - This was the largest downside for us. The bathrooms are very large and the sink/vanity area is modern and nicely appointed. However the tub was terrible. The shower had very little pressure (even though the spiggot had plenty) and the grout needs a severe bleaching. The tub could probably be replaced as well. The bathroom gets a 2* out of 5* from me. Beach - A complaint about this resort is that there is no beach at the resort, and that you have to take a ferry to get to Palomino Island. It's amusing to me that this is a complaint, as this was one of our favorite parts of staying at El Conquistador! we loved the ferry ride over (about 15 minutes each way) and we thought the beach was splendid. We walked to the far side of the island past the bar in the middle and found plenty of sandy areas to wade around in, as well as lots of natural shade under seagrapes trees. We also took out our Dacor masks/fins/snorkels and went about halfway between Palomino and Palominito and found lots of great reef habitats including a VERY large coral collection. We saw plenty of french grunts, as well as three small lemon sharks in addition to beautiful coral formations. I still think that locations like Magens Bay or Castaway Cay are better, but I really enjoyed Palomino Island. Beach gets a 4* out of 5* from me. Service - We travel 3-4 times a year to mostly caribbean destinations (as we work in Orlando for a very large tourist destination) for the relaxation factor. We truly appreciate the slower pace of life. I feel many people have issues getting into that particular state of mind. Service in most non-americanized caribbean locations will be slow, and I dont mind it one bit. That being said, I felt service was decent, up until the day of the hurricane. That's when the staff truly wowed me. We were allowed to extend our stay as long as possible at over 75% off the rack rate. They provided indoor activities, updates on the storm and opened multiple food and beverage locations, all on a limited staff (many staff members could not leave their homes due to the storm). Service gets a 4* out of 5* from me. Food and Beverage - This is a resort, and I certainly expected to pay resort prices. After reviewing our folio, I think that a fair price was paid for meals, and most meals were of a decent quality. Two standouts were the Bella Vista bar/grill and Iguanas at Palomino Island. The fish n chips meal at Iguanas was superb. I did notice the first day that most portions are large and my wife and I began to split meals. This made things quite economical to be honest. My wife tends to be a little picky on food quality, being a restaurant guest service manager, and she approved of most meals. One downer was Blossoms (tempanyaki). I strongly do NOT recommend eating there. Horribly slow service (we waited 50 minutes after we finished to get a bill), scallops were sub-par and the rest of the meal was just ok. There are multiple bars at resort-prices as well. Cuba Libres ran us about 7.00 each, which I'm used to being from Orlando. Restaurants 3 1/2* out of 5* Other notes - we never waited more than 5 minutes for the funicular and never more than 15-20 minutes for the ferry. When we waited for the ferry, we would stop by the shops in the marina. I highly recommend the nutella gelato. - i didn't find a single cast-member that did NOT speak english. nosotros hablamos espanol, but we really spoke a mixture, and found that there were even some cast members that spoke mostly english with just a little spanish - i'm not sure about activities for children, it was just my wife and I - the drive from San Juan (Luis Munoz) airport was about an hour. We rented a car through enterprise and are glad we did. You do have to pay for parking, but we were glad we had a car Good luck with your upcoming trip and I hope you pick a great resort.

Rountrip shuttle for 2 is $148, car rental for 5 days with GPS was $180. Second with your rental car schedule your own tours. The tours through the hotel are expensive for example a tour of old san juan & the bacardi factory was about $50pp. You can drive to old san juan find parking for $4 an hour plus the bacardi tour is free. Taking the tour through the hotel is a rip off another example el yunque is free as well. The tour desk charges about $90pp. Don't take bio bay tour, they don't let you swim in the water anymore. We ate once at the hotel and that was enough. The quality of the food does not match the price. Food at the hotel is very expensive and does not taste good.

After finally having our room changed, we were kindly escorted by our bellman, who was very nice and informative. Throughout the rest of our stay, the staff was friendly, and we never walked by a staff member without them saying hello, or good morning or good afternoon. All in all, the service was good. Coqui water park- The water park did not cost any money for us because we got a package deal (which i highly recommend). The slides were loads of fun, especially the straight down slide, which I did over and over again. The lazy river was relaxing and long, and the pool was large with great views. Overall the water park was fantastic and lots of fun. Food- The food was slightly over-priced but it was not outrageous, and the food itself wasn't bad. Blossoms was fantastic, along with stingray cafe. Iguanas on Palomino had great burgers, and the breakfast place (Las Brisas) had a nice selection of good tasting food. Overall, the food was good, a B+, but the prices were slightly high. Location- The views were absolutely incredible, and worth the one -hour drive from the airport. The tram was never an issue for us, and they were air-conditioned. So i give the location an A because of the resorts magnificent view. Room- We were in room 1405 in the La Marina village on the top floor. Our ceilings were very, very hgh, which was actually interesting, and kept the room cold because hot air rises. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room itself was huge. The bathroom was modern and the shower was nice, except it took a while for the water to drain out. There is definitely a renovation needed in the rooms though, but we didn't care because we were never in the room anyways. So i give the room B in all. Palomino Island- I saved the best for last. Palomino was absolutely incredible! The water was extremely warm (almost too hot actually), and it was crystal clear. Snorkeling was fantastic, and so was horse back riding. Palominito was a very cool small island with lots of shells and corals, and again, extremely clear water. There was a basketball hoop, 2 bars, coconuts that had fallen from trees (that were very yummy), a volleyball court, and lots of different kinds of water sports. Snorkeling from Palomino to Palominito was fun, and you get a work out. Overall, Palomino gets an A+++++++. Recommendations- drink lots of water...a man actually fainted from heat stroke at iguanas one day while we were having lunch. So drink lots and lots of water. Right in between Palomino and Palominito, there is an area of snorkeling that is to die for, and there is another area about 1/4 of the way to palominito, more towards the east side of the island that was also amazing.

We are HHonors members and reserved a partial ocean view. Instead, we were upgraded four levels to a Las Brisas Full Ocean View. First off, the natural beauty surrounding the resort is too stunning to put into words. The pictures on their website do not do it justice. The cliff top location of El con is in my opinion it's biggest draw and is what defines this resort. With that said, the cliff top location does present some logistical challenges but certainly not as severe as many other reviewers have said. There is no beach. So guess what, you have to take a 15 minute Ferry ride (and you'll be forced to look at the stunning Mountain views of Puerto Rico) in order to get to Palomino where you can swim and snorkel in the super warm Caribbean Sea. Is waiting for the ferry a pain? Maybe on weekends it can be bothersome but otherwise the ferry rides just added a unique experience to this vacation. To get to the marina yes you will have to take the funicular (where you will be forced to see even more stunning views). Don't let the other reviewers paint these as the end all be all. The funicular and the ferry are not that bad and can actually be fun! The pools at the resort were always super warm. You know how cold you get when you go from a hot tub to a pool? Well that won't happen here! The coqui water park was just the perfect size and we loved the \"El Gigante\" slide. Lots of folks complain that food prices are too high. Being from NY, it wasnt much of a stretch and I think most resorts are expensive when it comes to on site dining. My only complaint about the food was that there is no Puerto Rican food to be found on the resort. I shouldn't have to drive 4 miles to get to an Alcapurria! So we ended up at Metropol a lot. Some other gripes include: the path to the self parking lot is not lighted, Room service did not Vaccuum everyday and Palomino did attract alot of locals on the weekend.

The room looked exactly as it does in the pictures online. It was a nice bright room, could have used a larger TV screen but that's my preference. I had a view of the pool and in the distance you could see the ocean. It rained the entire 3 nights. We made the most of it. We used the casino, I sat in the club/lounge room to listen to music. The DJ was clueless, he blasted the music and played this tacky strobe light. I go to clubs in NYC so I guess I'm a snob, lol. But families danced, babies to older adults. That was cute but dead as far as the club scene goes. During the day they showed family movies and had a few table games. They could have done more to entertain people who were stuck inside because of the heavy rain. They should have had a cabaret show or a band. The resort has a game room, snack store and shops, restaurants. I enjoyed our expensive Japanese/Chinese food experience at Blossoms. To get to the beach you have to go on a free ferry to Palomino Island from their marina. The first time is charming but when its pouring raining, not so charming. Everyone is waiting on line hoping they will get on the boat. The Island was just ok in my book. One restaurant and a bar and an office to do water sports and such, beach was just ok. It is a shame they don't have the beach by the property. They had three pools where our room was located, and more throughout the property. The marina area was pleasant to be around. What was not cool was that you had to pay extra for their water park Coqui. Resort guests should have at least gotten a free pass or a discount. What I did enjoy was walking throughout the property at night and listening to the coqui, Puerto Rico's tree frog. All the rooms in my building was situated around a garden, and you could hear the sounds of nature, when indoors it was quiet. We went off property to eat and went to the movies, Caribbean Cinemas. Overall the hotel is close to the El Yunqui and Luquillo beach, so for a short stay I may recommend it, only if you get a great rate. You can look forward to the daily resort fee of $13+ a day along with taxes. I recommend you eat off property. We asked a staff member where they ate. If you want real Puerto Rican food, off property is your best bet. They had a mini mall which had fast food but we liked the Puerto Rican place, locals ate there. You ordered your dish wait for your name and carry to your table, it was upscale take out! lol It had a some Chinese food choices but popular for their mofongo (a mashed plantains dish) sorry I can't remember the name of the place.

The grounds remain beautifully kept and scenery is great. The main attraction this time was the new water park which kept our boys interest for our time there.....that is a plus! We stayed in one of the villas which provided nice space and a good view, but was also accompanied by a non-functioning dishwasher despite requests for repair....the housekeeping people were very nice though! The real complaint about a so-called 5 star place is that during our stay they elected to host a Heineken promotional party. This turned out to be the equivalent of a low brow frat party with similarly aged patrons, most of whom were drunk and poorly clad, walking the grounds with open alcoholic beverages. Two of the pools were closed for the 2 day event and quite frankly, we did not want our kids entering those pools for days afterwards....the cloudy appearance was not appealing. What were they thinking? The other issue, true before and unchanged currently, is that the prices are generally high and border on outrageous for what is offered in terms of dining options. I suppose that is what one can expect at any resort. The problem with Fajardo is that outside of the El Conquistador, the dining options are limited. You would think with a captive audience held hostage at the hotel, there would be a capitalistic spirit.....even a pizzeria, a trattoria on the outside- NO!. Someone willing to work with a simple restaurant nearby is going to have a great business! There a couple of restaurants that are ok-to good....but the pickens are slim!

The room was beautifully decorated with a great view overlooking the Marina and looking out toward Paolimno island. No Complaints with the hotel. Jesus helped us at the front desk during checking and Check out and he did an excellent job. Here is my biggest issue and this has to be addressed with the GM Dermot Connolly along with Ross Klein from Hilton Hotels Luxury Brands. We received via a letter that was dropped (two days earlier) off on the room that the hotel was having a fantasy island fesitval sponsored by Heinken Beers on Saturday 14th. I understand that the hotel is trying to generate extra revenue maybe due to the slow season or overall economic impcat on carribean travel. In the meantime this festival was pay one price and get access to all of the beer and alcohol you want and hanging out by the pool listening to live bands from 11 AM to 11PM - This was a major inconvenience for all of the guests that were staying at the hotel and couldn't enjoy the amenities unless you paid to particpate in the fesitival. this only gave you one option which was to leave the hotel and go out to the private island to stay away from all of the noise incovenience and the behavior that occurs when you open up the bars and have an all you can drink fest at a 5 star resort. The results was a disaster. Many of the guests that i spoke to either checked out or complained that they received some compensenation for the MAJOR inconvenience. I was given a $100 credit by Jesus as i was leaving but honestly $100 is nothing compared to what we had to see and endure. The night before the people that checked in on friday night roamed the hotel hallways and knocked on my door a number of times in the middle of the night which woke my family up. Another family we met also endured watching these 20 year old kids drunk in the elevators and exposing themselves to the other guests. I knew that it was going to be a long day as I walked into the lobby the day of the event to see over 100 to 150 security guards dressed in a bright yellow tshirt to be deployed thrlough out the hotel. Why would the Waldorf Astoria collection Hotel offer such an event at their hotel. I stay at Hilton Properties on all of my business travels and I have never witnessed anything like this. I think that this was extremely poor judgement by the El Conquistador and their managament team to allowed this to happen. I think the hotel was great but the experience was a disaster.

My son (19 months) and I joined my husband on Thursday. On Friday afternoon we found out that the main pool area would be closed all day saturday and part of Sunday. If we had known that ahead of time, I don't think we would have stayed the weekend as outside of not being able to use the pools, we also had to deal with really loud music, spilt beer, and people walking everywhere in their swim wear acting like they were at spring break. (while also navigating hoards of people) But, assumably most people reading this hopefully wouldn't be dealing with such a circus so I'll share the relevant parts of my experience. Check-in.- My husband mentioned it took more than 45 minutes after arriving in line at 3:30 pm. with only a couple people in front of him to get through check in and too his room. I asked him \"why' and he said it seemed like they were trying to find rooms for everyone. El Conquistador handled the transfer from San Juan-surely they could have in the 1.5 hours it took to get to the resort work on finding rooms to expedite this process? Room- We were fortunate and unfortunate to be in the Marina area in a corner room overlooking coqui water park. On the plus side, this was a pretty quiet area of the park-particularly a corner unit. This was especially helpful for the chaos of the spring break Heineken party on the upper part of the resort. It was also close to the boat to Palomino island which was good for us. Finally, the room had been recently renovated so that was nice. Bathroom was huge, deck was huge, and room was a decent size. View was also nice. The negatives: Lighting was pretty bad at night. It only had 3 lights. This was okay for us as we put our son to sleep and hung out in the bathroom but would be irritating otherwise. Also, the location was far from most restaurants and basically the whole resort. It was kind of a pain to have to trek in for breakfast. In retrospect, I wish I just ordered room service on the days we were heading to the beach. Beach- This is a huge drawback and is actually why i had booked another hotel (caribe hilton) for our last night in Puerto Rico. In order to go to the beach, you need to take a ferry. I was told it was an 8 minute ferry leaving every 1/2 hour. The reality? A 20 minute ferry leaving whenever. The day we went to the beach, we treked up the funicular for breakfast then made it down for the 9:30 am ferry (arriving at 9:25 am) That ferry left at 10:15 am. Try waiting in line with a toddler for 45 minutes in the hot sun. fun. Ferries also have limited times- you can only go over to Palomino island between 9 and 3. Not very convenient to coordinate around naps. Once we got to the beach, it was nice, with many shallow areas for young kids. But, no showers that I could find. We had to rinse the sand off in our hotel room. Very odd. How can a beach not have any showere nearby? Pools- Well, they were closed for much of our stay. In 500 acres though, there didn't appear to be a toddler pool. I asked the bellman and he didn't know of one. He said my son could play on steps. Coqui water park (additional charge) had an area that was like a beach (with a low gradual increase in depth) We received complimentary passes with our group. If I were a regular guest, I'd be irritated that I had to pay separately for my toddler to go in a pool. (oh no fee for under 3, but I'd have to pay). Food- I actually was pleasantly surprised to have some affordable food options (ie. breakfast for $10/entree) No kids menu though. Most of our meals were included with the conference so I basically only went to breakfast. Thought the lunch on palmomino was good. Spa: A real trek t get here from the Marina. I did this the festival day and it was a bit of a headache. I did the caribbean escape session. I thought the spa was poorly marketed. If you are interested in attending, I'd look online to get the menu of things as none was really included in the room. The spa store closed before I got out of the lockerrom (before 6 pm). I was told to come back if I wanted any of the products used in my facial. Um, not happening. Toddler gripes- I wish they would have clear information on their sites for toddlers -ie. where can they swim, etc. Service- I thought it was fine. Everyone was very friendly etc and responsive to requests. HOwever, my husband thought service was terrible largley based on his huge wait to check in. I think the hotel might be doable for older kids. Not the best choice for the under 5 set. Much prefer the caribe hilton for that. We stayed in 3 hotels in Puerto Rico-El Convento (mom and dad's favorite), El Conquistador (a required hotel) and Caribe hilton (our son's favorite. If we were to go back to puerto rico its a toss up of where we'd stay-but not this place. Oh-and for the spring break thing- colleagues of my husband called security 6 times overnight do to a loud party. Nothing was done. There should be a limit to noise complaints then the guests are kicked out. Ridiculous. Others also complained about room conditions so I think it really depends on the luck of the draw as our room was renovated.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cExpensive but great. if you have the money to spend. this is your stay.\u201d", "Author": "Roxanalovestotravel", "ReviewID": "UR75844299", "Content": "The resort is wonderful. When your coming from the taxi or airport shuttle you see such a beautiful golf course. I am not really a golfer but its really big and spacious. Our flight arrival was about 12:40 so we were really early when we arrived at the resort. Check in time is at 4:00pm. So we checked in and they gave us a room number and told us they would call when it was ready. We went to eat at the restaurant next to the lobby which is called Bella Vista Restaurant. The restaurant food was good. I ordered Chicken Tenders with french fries from the kids menu but they \"adult\" sized it and made the order bigger. It tasted really great. The price for the food was pricey though. That order I believe was about $20. The service there is really good. The waiter was really friendly, always appeared magically when I had little soda to refill and asked if we were fine. She also then came with the dessert menu. The waiter was very attentive. We then waited in the lobby where there is a lot of seating areas. There's a lot of couches and there are 3 parrots. The parrots like talking. They kept screaming loudly which then got pretty annoying. I'm not complaining though because they were really pretty. We waited for the room until 5:00pm. Which was like a four hour wait to get a room. 2 hrs went by really fast when we went to eat. We then asked if out room was ready and it wasn't so we went to check it out anyway. (We had no room key but we had a room number). We had reserved a partial ocean view room. The resort is in a cliff. So all the ocean view rooms are at the bottom of the cliff. To get down there you have to take a funicular. We took the funicular and went to our room. We noticed that the door was open so we went in. You could tell that the room wasn't clean so we clearly got out of there and went back to the lobby. By the way walking is a big factor in the hotel if you have a room with partial ocean view or complete ocean view rooms. As well to a lot of walking you need to take the funicular. The funicular is like a little train, it's really cool with great views. I recommend Coqui Park. That is cool. though there are only three slides and the whole park it's just awesome. There's floates, and the slides aren't scary at allt. There's also a pool that has the view of the ocean. I also recommend the Yunque Rainforest trail walk. It cost $52 per person. I was wearing sandals though they recommend flip flops. We rode on the bus and the tour guide was really funny and amusing. His name was Edwin. He made really funny jokes and explained the whole thing really entertaining. I do recommend to bring an umbrealla because it is a rainforest and it did rain when we were there and the tour can't stop because it's a rain forest and it will stop raining whenever nature wants it too. And we did get wet. I touched a baby lizard and saw the coqui frogs. As well we hiked into a beautiful waterfall. I was lucky i wore sandals because I actually got in the rocks and was able to take pictures in the water near the waterfall. The others had to take off their shoes and most of them didn't so they didn't get a picture in the water. Though the sandals were hard to walk in when we were hiking back down since they were wet and I was getting my feet muddy. After the tour the tour guide Edwin brought us to this little restaurant were the food was really good and very economic. This was the real Puerto Rico. I ate a huge plate full of good food for $5 dollars and the souvenirs and key chains were so cheap. I was like YES!!!!! And the sodas were $0.93. I will never forget the tour guide Edwin with his funny phrases. He woudl say \"CHECK IT OUT\" in his heavy Puerto Rican accent it was so funny.

Reason being, Puerto Rico seemed like a wonderful island with fewer lodging choices than many other Caribbean areas (and therefore potentially more confusing to vacationers), and while El Con looks just as it does on its Web site FROM AFAR, please do not be lured by the aerial views! Last week I stayed at the El Conquistador resort and departed on August 15, thanks be to fate. Had I not planned to depart 8/15, I wouldn't have been able to tolerate one more day. From the ridiculously low quality food (ex: a $40 entree of small, tough shrimp that tasted like freeze-dried La Choy, served in a seriously 70s Asian-themed restaurant) to the dangerously under-secured Fantasy Island event, to the dilapidated rooms, it was dreadful. It's a shame, because the geographical surroundings are gorgeous. Upon arrival, I absolutely loved it. That love affair lasted all of three minutes. ROOMS The rooms are in dire need of updating and repair: moldy tubs, chipped tile, stained bedding and carpeting, etc. An overall look of an housing ad that would read \"Rehabbers delight!\" But worse. Previous TA reviewers' photos show this, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to take additional snapshots of things like insects (beyond typical for the region), missing grout, dated items galore, broken phones, and stains. White headboards + white furniture in a poorly managed hotel near water and hiking = nasty appearance in no time at all. The promo in the room actually read \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Coming in 2006!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with pics of the present furniture! So, you can imagine how awful this d\u00c3\u00a9cor has turned in 4-5 years. LOCATION Terrible, because of all the other factors. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind being 1-2 hours from town, IF I had good food options, a nice resort, etc., but with awful food, a less-than-comfy room, and sought-after resort amenities closed for private events, you are truly trapped there\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat a high price for incidentals. BEACH The resort is not on the beach; you must take the ferry to get there. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run at any set time, and I lost time by workers telling me incorrect times. I saw it leaving one morning at 10:35 just as I'd walked up. A pleasant worker told me the next one leaves at 11. Nope. We left at 11:25, and that was during the daily 1-2 hour window of more frequent departures. If you miss it, you might have to wait an hour+ for the next one! Huge pain to spend more than an hour to get to the beach of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach resort,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to poor ferry scheduling, and especially when pools were closed or undesirable. I must say the beach was my favorite feature. While small, it was very clean and all-around wonderful. The servers were lovely and the food and drink from the little bar and grill were the best I had at El Con. However, it all closes up around 5 pm and you must board the ferry to go back to El Con. For me, this was like a ferry back to Alcatraz. SERVICE Some people great, most indifferent, some bad. Compared to Mexico, as some TA users might be wondering, English is spoken more fluently and unfortunately, many El Con staffers have excellent command of sarcasm. Housekeeping was not good. Maid would remove items (washcloths, old soap, etc.) but not replenish. Frustrating to come back to not even a single washcloth after a day at the beach. SPA A beautiful and relaxing environment, but at >$200 for one treatment, the service was not acceptable. Tech seemed inexperienced, the whole process was clunky, and the products used were a letdown. Felt/smelled like any old Walgreens items. My appointment was running behind and two different people volunteered three totally different excuses. It made me wonder if my technician was hurtin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from attending the party the night before! GENERAL MANAGEMENT Back to Fantasy Island. Under the guise of a 12-hour live music event, this raucous fest held about 80% of the common areas captive for two days. Little advance warning from the resort--just a note (with an inadequate description of the magnitude of this circus) slipped under our door the late afternoon prior. Main pool area(s) closed to guests with no recourse and thousands of loud, shirtless/swimsuit-clad attendees flooded the lobby, corridors, Starbucks, parking lot--you name it. Basically any place they weren't supposed to be dressed as they were (according to dozens of El Con signs warning against lack of clothing in common areas), that's where they were. These are the kind of people, who while barely upright, can manage to don sunglasses at night, pop the top on a Red Bull, and break beer bottles outside your door for fun well into dawn. The noise/fighting throughout the night and entry attempts to our room from overserved guests are what sealed the deal for me to make the time to write this review. Note: I can appreciate a good time, but this disaster was completely disrespectful to resort guests. It was NOT the typical lively, youthful festival with expected loudness and indiscretion; the property became one humongous swim-up dive bar for two days. I believe my spouse and I are far more tolerant of noise and \"extreme partying\" than the average resort guest and we found it just plain gross. In elevators and walkways, the offended and outraged bonded, offering each other their horror stories, directly and unsolicited. Ex: One couple received threatening calls from the offenders after reporting them to security for fighting at 4 a.m. The day of and day after this event, the elevators were smelly and sticky from spilled drinks and who knows what else. It was the responsibility of El Con to keep it under control. El Con should not have served these guests as they did, and they should have done a better job of patrolling the antics throughout the night. It seems fairly easy to hire one security guard at each end of each floor. I am certain the profit from this carelessly planned mega-event could cover additional overnight security. Interestingly enough, here is a laugh-out-loud gem. When I went to the Waldorf Astoria Web site in effort to find corporate contact info, I saw a terribly glaring typo on the home page, made worse in its reverse type and large font with glitzy Flash photos as a backdrop: Book your summer holiday now to recieve one complimentary night's stay Haven't we all mastered the \"except after c\" memorization? It summarizes the lack of attention WA/El Con gives its guests, and the attention to the bottom line--let delinquents have free reign, others can hole up in their moldy barracks. Perhaps someone from the Fantasy Island party bartered to be a webmaster and copywriter in exchange for a night's lodging to the Fantasy Island f\u00c3\u00aate. SUMMARY All these less than appealing points aside, I would like to return to Puerto Rico, for I was enamored with many aspects of the area and its people, and especially the charm of Old San Juan. I am confused/mildly entertained by reviewers who write things like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a vacation is what you make it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Um, yes. If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m camping. Or paying $49 a night. This place is such a hassle and an expense just to get there, and I cannot imagine having to rally to enjoy a self-proclaimed luxury resort. Although my particular stay earned one star, I am giving it two stars since I feel it would deserve a solid two had it not been for the sloppy Fantasy fest. I don't wish to dwell on that specific incident, but I feel how poorly that event was managed and how guests' validated complaints were ignored speaks volumes about the property itself.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cStunning place with extraordinary staff gone mad while resort plays\u201d", "Author": "rebeccacramirez", "ReviewID": "UR75534559", "Content": "host to a local Heineken Festival: Starting Friday evening, most of the resort facilities were closed or restricted to regular guests while our cards were still charged the daily resort fees.

We were carded at every door, even when exiting the hotel lobby. My girlfriend's handbag was searched before she entered Las Brisas restaurant for breakfast.

I have read the reviews about the El Conquistador and I have to admit I was a little apprehensive about staying there. When we arrived we had no problem checking in, we got a beautiful ocean view room, and only paid for a Garden View. The bellman Gary was great and the customer service the entire time that we were there was above all expectations. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the pools are amazing. The private island was also beautiful. We did the horseback riding but my suggestion is to wear jeans! No one did and it is quite a rough ride, with thorns in bushes cutting your legs so come prepared. The views are wonderful on the ride though.

I do believe your vacation is what you make of it. My mom and I have a positive attitude going into it and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the little things bother us. If I had to say anything negative about El Conquistador it would be the elevators got flooded when it rained and the walk back from Fajardo for the Biolumincent tour seems a bit dangerous so I would be careful. Also, the Bioluminescent tour was very disappointing because no one told us when it rains it limits the ability to see the water light up, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anything.

Aug 4 - 11th. I am very glad I read the reviews of the hotel and surrounding areas, as it made our trip so much more enjoyable! The walking around the resort - no big deal unless you are just lazy or handicapped. It is a BIG resort. Rooms - clean and no 5 star for sure - in the States would be 3 easily. Water shoes are a must for Palomino Island. If you are prepared with that, then the snorkelling is very nice - lots of pretty fish at a very shallow depth! The horse ride - bring long pants - there are thorns along the path that will scratch your legs - or be prepared to ride with your legs up around the horses neck up the hill of the island. The staff was more than accomodating - bellmen very nice - front desk always busy and not always knowedgeable. If check in 4 pm be sure to make sure your room is ready on time or be prepared to complain. They will keep you waiting if you play that game! The food at the Strip House if wonderful but be prepared to wait for at least 1 to 2 hours for the entree - we paid $200 for 3 of us and one was a child. We bought a cooler and brought liquor from Walmart; ate at Loquillo Beach (the best food for the dollor - even tho it was not air conditioned at Aye Bonita). El Yunque Rain Forest was really beautiful - be sure to bring a swimsuit if you go on a hike, as the waterfall seems to be the place to cool off after the hike there - we didn't know, so were unprepared. It was paved the whole way, but make sure you are in good physical condition to hike because it's not an easy hike. Say \"Hi\" to Efrain the bellman - he's a great addition to the resort. Suggestions to the resort - update your carpet - it's terribly worn in the hallways! We stayed on the top floor and had only tile, but my nephew stayed 2 levels down and it really was worn and not vacuumed at all. Have more people at the water park snack bar - it took us 45 min to get a couple beers and gatorade - they are missing out on a lot of income. Clean the poolside areas nightly! We found trash from the day before still lingering along the poolside. All it would take is one person to go around and pick this up!! What the deal? Management could make this resort a really wonderful resort, even with some downfalls... the little things DO count and sometimes overrule the big things. Replace burnt out light bulbs in the main area and lobby - it can't cost that much!!

I will address some of the aspets of the negative review and interject my experiences -The Chek in process: we arrived early to the hotel and asked if we could get in early. No problem we were in our rooms in 20 minutes. We checked in on Thursday, if you check in on a Friday expect to wait longer. The hotel is huge and with 60 to 100 people descending on the check in counter things tend to slow down at any resort you go to. -The prices: The biggest problem I had with this hotel. The food is overpriced and not very good. For 2 entrees and 3 cocktails cost my wife and family 75 dollars. Do yourself a favor and spend the money on a rental car. We rented a mini-van and ate all our meals outside the resort. Yes the area is run down but the restraunts are great and the people are very,very friendly. Don't judge a book by it's cover. -The rooms: My wife and I got a partial oceanview upgrade at check in. The room decor is ok nothing great but it was clean and everyday was cleaned by the staff unless my wife and I deemed it unneccesary. Pillows were kinda soft but we were resupplied with fresh towels and soap when we needed it. The mini fridges did not work in mine or my in laws rooms however but a 2 dollar cooler took care of that situation. -Waiting: The hotel is really big so it does take time to get from place to place. I didn't mind so much because the point of vacation was to slow down so it didn't bother me. -Customer Service: Everyone I met was friendly and helpfull. The bartenders recommended restraunts while the concierge told me of a few secret surf spots. the locals deal with tourists everyday. If you politely ask a question or request a service they will do everything they can to help. However if you are rude or demanding they will drag their feet and take their time and I honestly don't blame them. Yes things are a little slower on the island. They are on island time which means order another drink and relax. Some Helpful Hints: -Try to learn at least a few spanish words especially greetings. The locals will usually respond better and will generally treat you better if you make an attempt at their local language. However at least learn the proper pronunciation or they will laugh at you. - Rent a car: It will save you money on food as well as attractions. The bio bay kayaking that the resort charges $90 for can be purchased for $45 by driving down to the harbor at the bottom of the cliff. The El Yunqe rainforest is 25 minutes away by car. It is free and and there are trails and a waterfall you can swim in. Plus there are so many great secluded beaches and attractions around the property. - Buy a cooler: Stock it with beer water wine food and whatever else that you don't want to over pay for in the resort. -Try the Mofongo its delicious. Anywhere on the island. -Look online for cheap caribbean deals: We got our 4th night free plus free continental breakfast everyday. It came out to $8 a day for two people to eat breakfast everyday. the food is not great but a cheap and easy way to fuel up for the day. -make sure your hotel doors are closed securely: While we were there we had 2 wild iguanas sneak into our hallway.

Fast forward two days into our stay and my sister-in-law's family arrives to pick us up for a day trip into Fajardo. We're going to get some lunch, poke around bit, have a few drinks and close the day at the local beach with the kids. Well, no such luck.

My husband and I, along with our two children (11 and 13) stayed here from Father's Day Sunday to Friday of that week. During those 5 days, we spent about $3000 on just FOOD. The resort is so secluded, that the only way to go somewhere else for a meal is if you have rented a car, and drive there. The resort obviously knows that and tripled the price of EVERYTHING in each of there restaurants. The breakfast buffet was $25/person, and the food was totally not worth it. (runny eggs, cold potatoes, burnt bacon, etc) A burger at the poolside bar is $15. For a family of four, expect to pay $100 for breakfast, $150 for lunch, and if you want a real dinner $300/night WITHOUT cocktails. Aside from the crazy food bill, the resort is pretty, but starting to show it's age a little. The waterpark is small, but fun for a few hours. There really is not enough to do to make a day of it. I highly recommend taking the boat trip to Palomino Island. It is secluded, and not too crowded. Remeber to bring water shoes, because there is a TON of coral in the water. There is a rum bar on the island to buy drinks and get lunch and you can rent snorkel equipment at the sport shop on the island. Also, if you are a gambler, the casino is only open from 4PM to midnight.

I've stayed on islands like Turks and Caicos, Four season in Nevis, Ritz Carlton's all over and I've also roughed it in the mountains of Utah and Colorado on horseback and in tents ---- I say all of this just to say that I've been to a couple of places and I really enjoyed my stay at El Con. Of course all places have good and bad things about them, but PR was awesome. Attended a wedding in the middle of June in PR and we had to find a hotel b/c the wedding hotels, Rio Mar and Grand Melia were booked in mid June. So we stayed at El Conquistador as a result of our taking a risk on one of the hotwire/priceline/hotels.com type of sites. After we discovered that we got El Con, we read the reviews and were concerned initially (b/c of the negative reviews and b/c we didn't know how far the wedding would be) until we remembered that we always have great vacations. We arrived in PR and got a rental car. The garmin gps device I brought with me worked perfectly in PR. The garmin led us right to El Con. As we drove up the winding hill past the golf course we couldn't believe how beautiful the golf course and grounds were. It took a few minutes to get to the main hotel - its located on cliffs of a mountain. The distance from the entrance to the main hotel requires a drive unless you don't mind walking golf course length distances. We dropped off our luggage with the bell man and parked our own car. The outdoor part of the lobby was gorgeous and the inside was very nice also. I'm an outdoor and plant person. They have luscious plants throughout the hotel and beautiful birds in the lobby that say \"hola\" - hello in spanish. We waited to check in and our bell man took us to our room. The bell man was fabulous. He made sure that we were pleased with our accomodations and went over and beyond to ensure that we were happy. I have forgotten your name Mr. Bellman, sir, but Thank you. I will look for you when I return in August. During the walk to the room we saw the casino and all of the shops. The views are truly truly breathtaking. The hotel is sprawled over a mountain and cliffs. You navigate the cliffs using the elevators, stairs, and funiculars (like a cable car). The outer funicular (closest to the water) is express from marina level to the top - The inner funicular is local (bellman explained it). so we knew to stay away from the local funicular since our room was not located on a local floor. Since this property is so large there is lots of walking - which is good b/c walking is good exercise :) It may be an inconvenience for a person with some disabilities - there are ramps everywhere. Our room was located at the marina level with a wonderful view of the ocean, and a view of the ferry coming in and right next to coqui water park (for my nephew) and right in front of the EXPRESS FUNICULAR. I loved listening to the birds perched outside of my room. I had breakfast at Cafe Caribe. It was a nice breakfast that I was pleased with. Most people ate at the wonderful las brisas buffet, but I don't need that much food in the morning, I just need food for my energy - so I skipped it and stuck to Cafe Caribe or oatmeal in my room (water was boiled in coffee maker). Each day, my Mom, my brother, nephew and I hopped on the hotels' catamaran to Palamino island, the private beach. I love to be on the ocean so this daily ride to me was a fun part of my trip. It wasn't an inconvenience at all. Especially since I knew that the hotel was not located directly on the beach and required the catamaran ferry. I do hope that people check the hotels they book to know what they are getting into. I mean if the hotel is across a mountain and cliffs and part of the journey is a boat to your private island beach, then you should know that going into it. I would see the ferry coming and run out of my room, and down the steps ready to board. I loved the sand and the warm warm warm water. Water visibility was terrific. Yes there is alot of seaweed and rocks, but other reviews tell you to bring some water shoes. Its the ocean. I was barefoot most of the time except for when I would attempt to walk out to palamonito, the smaller island in front of palamino. I never actually made it (too afraid). Wear shoes if you explore and shoes aren't always needed on the side of the island where the ferry comes in. The ferry shuttled people to the island, just about every half hour or so. Every time looked up, it was coming or going. The island is really fabulous. I ordered a greek salad and chicken fingers while on the island each day. I enjoyed my lunch. Yes its pricey but we were at a hotel and we budgeted for the fact that we may have a few meals there. We actually never ate dinner at El Con after reading that the restaurants were expensive. We used our car and we explored. La Estacion - 3 times - loved it , loved it, loved it. The passion fruit salad (or whatever it was) was awesome. One day I wasn't pleased with it and they replaced it without question. Great customer service. Another restaurant \"Pasion....\" - we will not eat there again. We ate at a mexican restaurant that had a fabulous brownie desert with icecream and whipped cream and fudge in the middle of the brownie. It was heaven. I do not remember the name. We purchased our room alcohol from the \"cash and carry\" in the neighborhood (yes we went to the cash and carry) and we also shopped at the supermarket and walmart. My nephew and brother loved the water park. They no longer joined us at the beach b/c they preferred the water park each day until the day before we left. The only time I spent in the room was to change afer a day at the beach, to get ready for dinner, to wash and to sleep. I spent very little time in the room. I'm a golfer but decided to look at the golf course rather than play it. Very very hot weather in PR. The sunrise and set and the dew over the lush greenery was beautiful everyday. All of the people we met at the hotel and in PR were friendly and nice. When our balcony door wouldn't open, they sent someone up to fix it. The walk to the car to go to dinner was never bothersome. After dinner we would take our walk to the room and realized it was just the walk we needed after filling ourselves up at dinner (we would laugh at how tired we were but we encouraged each other on until we got to the room). Just looking at the paradise we were in really made it difficult to get mad. Of course the 6 year old would fall asleep at night and this sometimes required his father to carry him on a few occasions which added weight to our room walks. we worked it out. Nightlife for me was looking at the view, or reading a book. There was salsa dancing Friday and Saturday night in the lobby. There is also the casino. But with our day activities, nighttime for us meant, SLEEP. I slept comfortably everynight. On the last day while checking out, we inspected the bill carefully and everything was correct based on our package. While checking out we discovered the pools and the views on the main lobby side of the hotel and wondered how we missed this (we spent time going from palamino to coqui park to room to shops to car for dinner, to wedding activities back to room). The views by the pools are so spectacular we decided on the spot to return. We will be back at the end of August. Your vacation is what you make it. I knew from reading the reviews that I should rent a car, I knew that the restaurants would be expensive, so either plan for it or eat locally as we did. I knew there would be rocks and some seaweed and the reviews said you will be ok with shoes. And we were just fine. The staff was wonderful, helpful and friendly. If there are problems, address the issues and continue to have fun. Do NOT be afraid to explore. Have an open mind - you are in paradise for a short period of time. As I stated, I was just there in June 2010. I'm returning this month, August 2010. In August I plan to do the other things I missed - swim at the pools while watching the views (at night-while sipping drinks from the bar ), El Yunque, one of the luminescent bay tours, I will tour rincon beach on the westside, I will visit culebra and maybe vieques, party in San Juan at Club Bravo (maybe), visit the town of Loiza and old san juan, eat at La Parilla, Pasta y Pueblo, Calizo, Of course La Estacion and Metropol. I will only be there 8 days. If palamino island doesn't grab me again the way it did before I will accomplish all of this - with mom and this time auntie.

First of all I had to stand in line for 2 hours!!(yes 2 hours I am not kidding) to check in. Finally when I got up the counter they were so rude to me. They placed a $600 dollar hold on my account and that's only because I fought with the manager to lower it. She wanted to make $900.00 to cover room costs. This on top of the 14% resort fee that they charge!! Management is terrible.Period.

I liked it so much that my new wife and I stayed here for three nights as part of our honeymoon to Puerto Rico. I'm not sure what happened in the time between my visits, but this property is in desperate need of a makeover. To begin with, we waited in line for about half an hour (not an exaggeration, I promise) just to check in -- and we were waiting in the HHonors line! We were told our room was ready; it wasn't. The bed was stripped, bathroom still hadn't been cleaned, and the carpet was absolutely soaked. (To be fair about the carpet: the island had seen a few days of non-stop rain prior to our arrival, which is nobody's fault...but still, it's not an excuse) We were quickly moved to a room four or five down from our original. The room was clean, but the carpet was still very wet. (Again: I'm aware that on an island, humidity is always a problem.) Anyway, I don't want to turn this review into a blow-by-blow account of our 3 nights there, so I'll move on. All staff encountered -- front desk, restaurants, housecleaning, etc. -- were superb. The onsite restaurants at which we dined were outstanding! The Stingray Cafe and the Strip House both serve terrific food and the service was great. This was where the El Conquistador got it right. Don't be fooled by the official website's description of the casino. It is SMALL, and has two -- yes, TWO -- tables for blackjack. It's only open from 4pm-midnight, so if you're picking this hotel because it has a casino, don't bother. The pools are nice; the hotel's private island isn't. The water is nice, but there was an incredible amount of seaweed in the water. As cool as it might sound to take a ferry to the island, it's actually somewhat of an inconvenience. (The hotel claims it's an 8-minute ride; it's actually more like 15, and the ferry only runs once every half hour in each direction) The Golden Door Spa is also a huge plus. The services are totally worth the price. You MUST get a massage! And, finally -- the rooms themselves get a D+. We had a terrific view of the ocean and our bathroom was huge, but that's about all that was redeeming. The comforter on the bed felt like it had been washed 1,000 times, the paint was peeling everywhere, the bathroom had rust on the sink, etc. Based upon the room itself, it's hard to believe that this is a Waldorf-Astoria property. The location of the hotel is so remote from anything (it's about 45 miles from San Juan) that, unless you're going to rent a car, you can't leave the resort. A feeling of seclusion is not uncommon...which is actually what my wife and I were going for, so it is a plus for us. Just be aware of this, because the location might not be a plus for others.

Online it had everything we were looking for from a 5 yr. old to adults plus we only wanted to hop one plane ride and not deal with passports. The resort grounds and buildings are gorgeous, breathtaking! We stayed in a 3 bedroom Las Casitas villa, NOT the main hotel. Check in was private, only 10 minutes, free water unlimited everyday, private breakfasts with (at most) 12 other people. Very nice and worth the price. The villas are gorgeous. Roomy and having a full kitchen was a huge plus. Went to the local WalMart and grocery store to stock up on drinks and snacks. No problem. We rented our own car at the airport because parking was free at the villas. FYI: when we were there we heard a lot of folks staying in the main hotel complaining about everything but not in the villas. You never saw anyone, it was quiet and very calm in that part of the resort. Food was great. Full breakfast, Stingray Cafe was awesome, Ballyhoo was our favorite & the restaurant on the island was great. Awesome drinks! We also ventured off the property 2 nights; to the Fajardo Inn to the Blue Iguana (excellent) and to Pasions (fantastic!) Maid service was excellent. They did our dishes everyday, turndown service and when our 1 hairdryer broke they brought us a brand new one right away. Now, the downsides: we were there when Trop Storm Bonnie was born. Not fun. It rained but we can't control that anyways. Still didn't stop us. Also, one thing the website and the sales reps DO NOT talk about is the logistics in getting around the resort. It is a HUGE place.

The funicular situation was the worst. They were doing maitenance on one of them around 9:30am on Saturday, and the other one would not make a stop at our middle building. After looking at it pass in front of us for like 15 minutes, we had to walk down the stairs to the Marina level and catch it there. As we were standing in line we noticed it started making stops again at the building in the middle. Total wait to go upstairs to the lobby, almost an hour.

I know live in South Carolina and I went 2 weeks ago with my husband and kids so we could have some fun (and see my parents who still live there) and I for one loved it. Yes there's no island music near the pool but I find that a plus, I mean seriously, it's quite quiet and relaxing and if you're looking to just loose your mind with a pina colada by the pool who needs all that extra music that makes you feel like you're in Barbados? -- Palomino and Palominito beach were great as always and I believe that the food in Palomino is a better bet that the one in the hotel. Be sure to get there early for the ferry as it takes I believe 20 minutes for the boat to make each trip. -- Coqui Water Park was great, our kids loved it (2 boys, 11 and 9 and a girl, 8) obviously it doesn't compare to Wet-N-Wild but the slides are great and the current pool is awesome (although it's only 3 ft. so adults be careful)..*TIP*: Get there early !! [oh and adults can ride all of the slides as well]. Now the \"bad\", now of course it's an expensive hotel, have you seen the size? facilities? views? ok then lets stop expecting to get rooms there for $40 a night. My worst complaint was (and always has been)..the food!!! Ridiculous prizes for not so great food, the pizza at Buena Vista [near the pool next to the lobby] is thinner than a cracker and I believe was almost $20. If you can..go out of the hotel to eat [the restaurants upstairs are good but well..really expensive. We ate at the hotel one night at Piccola Fontana and it ran us $300 for good but not amazing food!. Do some research before you come and if you rent a car go OUT of the perimeters to eat [My recommendation: El Metropol, it's 10 minutes out of the hotel and the food is great and reasonably priced]. Also, if you drive to the hotel stop by a supermarket (there's on in the same Avenue as the hotel) and stock up on fruits and snacks for the kids, it'll save you quite a lot !!!!!. Above all it's a great place, we love it and will go back without a doubt. The rooms are great, the beds are super comfy, quiet pool, great beach, yes drinks are expensive but hello it's a hotel !!. No it's not the same as the Waldorf Astoria hotels in the US but Puerto Rico is not the same as the US sooo...I like it and if you have the money go for it.

If you have your own snorkel equipment, you can go snorkeling in the blue, clear waters. There's a little bit of coral, but if you want to find the more interesting wildlife, you have to swim further out. The waters are shallow, so it's not awful. I'd recommend wearing water shoes or flippers to avoid stepping on sea urchins. There's one huge crown of coral with lots of colorful inside. I don't think most people discovered it since they were snorkeling over the sea grass. Not sure why. The sea grass is not really that interesting. Maybe they don't have lawns at home. The reviews criticizing the food are pretty accurate. It's all American or Americanized food (did not try the Chinese/Japanese place).

A Waldorf Astoria brand bespeaks a commitment of excellence, an extremely high level of service, the highest level of quality in it's cuisine; a supremely upkept appearance and maintenance. None of this is displayed at the El Con. They should seriously either upgrade the service delivery or downgrade the branding. This is my biggest gripe. One has a certain image and expectation when staying at a luxury resort or even a mid-tier like a Hampton Inn. If my expectation was set properly, I wouldn't mind standing in the HHONORS line for 45 minutes only to be told my room wasn't ready...and then waiting another 2 hours for it to be ready.

She didn't mention the Golden Door spa at all nor the fact I could use the exercise facilities at no charge given I have Diamond status. Nor the fact that I was given an upgraded room and then charged for it but didn't know until I checked out - I thought that was the room category I booked! The staff is indifferent at best and poorly trained. I guess I'm disappointed that a high-end resort makes you wait for hours, then hands you keys, ID cards and a map and then shoos you away without even telling you about the property. I'm at fault for having high expectations :) The food is less than mediocre and very pricey. Eat off property. Many good restaurants in Fajardo. Seriously, if they marketed this as an average resort, ok, great property. It just doesn't live up to its brand. The good news: great location. great views.

On the positive first, this is probably one of the prettiest, most scenic resorts we've been to. The views are stunning, the grounds were gorgeous and with our Caribbean Escape package, we really enjoyed the free buffet breakfasts each day. When we first arrived we waited over an hour in the Hilton Honors line to get checked in. I learned later that there is a Express Checkin/out kiosk on the other side of the lobby and we need not have waited so long. The Express Check out also allowed us to sign in for our flights and print our boarding pass. I recommend you use it and avoid the lines at the desk which were constant and long the whole week we were there. It is extremely expensive to get to the resort so we rented our own rental car. It's an hour drive. I think in the end it paid for itself because we were able to go into town and buy water, sodas, snacks, and go out to eat dinner off the resort, go shopping at the outlets. This saved us alot and probably paid for the car. Be aware there is a $16/day parking fee. We kept the car the whole week so it was pricey but you rent one and return it. I was told you could pick up at the airport and return to a Fajardo location for a fee but since we kept the car the whole week I don't know how that would have worked out price wise. There is no beach on the resort, you ride the tram down and take a ferry over. It is very beautiful and scenic but be ware that there is a lot of coral in the sand (use beach shoes) and there was a lot of sea weed in the water. Overall, I was not impressed bc I don't like to swim in seaweed but my husband enjoyed it. The water is not very deep which I guess is good for those with kids. The resort is very child friendly with the water park, 4 foot swimming pools, and plenty of beach/lounge chairs. We were shocked that we never had a problem finding chairs. This was a first for us in the Caribbean and was great though it would have been nicer is the swimming pool was deeper for the adults. There 3 pools were all 4 foot deep, max. Finally I would say I was not impressed with the rooms or the food. The rooms were adequate and quite spacey but the furnishing was not what I expected for a Waldorf. If you want a coffee maker you will have to ask for one. They are not in the room. I guess they want you to spend your money at the Starbucks but if you ask they will provide one for free. Finally on the food be warned that it is expensive. $10+ for all drinks, and my husband and I easily dropped $100 for our dinner and drinks each night and we shared meals. Overall we didn't come out too bad spending wise but we are very light eaters and drinkers. If your family eats a lot be prepared to spend some big bucks ... or do what we did and load up on the buffet and use your car to go into town to keep the cost down. Overall the food was the worst part about it for me as I don't mind paying for good quality food and I thought the food was so so....so don't get me wrong, we enjoyed our trip and had a wonderful time but after it was all said and done we probably will not go back. The El San Juan in Isle Verde was more our speed and it is also a Waldorf Astoria...closer to the airport and other restaurants and has a beautiful beach but to each his own and this resort does have a lot going for it for the kids so I would recommend it with all the above caveats. PS. If you like tennis bring your raquets or it's $15 to rent and if you like to golf, call to find out how it works. The golf coarse was huge and looked extremely nice! Oh, and I almost forgot, if you don't like walking this resort is not for you. We actually liked it a lot and that was not a problem for us. It's a huge resort and to get to different parts of it you have to walk and take various elevators and the tram.

Breakfast can be upwards of 20 dollars a person. The resort is very large so be ready to travel. Getting to the beach is a job in itself. You must travel down about 3 levels and take a 15 minute ferry ride to the island. The beach itself is pretty nice and relaxing although the water is pretty dirty in most parts. The island is large so there are tons of things to do but you are basically stuck there and until a ferry returns. The pools are nice but get very crowded and are not peaceful in any way. The waterpark is neat but there is a charge to get in and the staff is beyond rude at the park. The casino now closes at midnight versus 4am the previous year and is very small. They only have a few tables and they will not have all of them open which causes huge problems. I even spoke with the manager about opening tables because so many people were waiting and they refuesed even though they had staff standing around. The spa is incredible and one of the best I have been too so that is a huge positive. The rooms are very nice and spacious with a great bathroom. There are tons of things to do at the resort such as watersports, golf, excurcisons, etc but be prepared to pay dearly and I mean dearly to do anything including to eat! Outside the resort is extremely dangerous so do not wander off. One year, a tourist was murdered right outside the resort when she was on a jog. There is a club at night that opens for dancing and etc but they have 1 bartender and you can never get a drink.

The hotel grounds and views are absolutely beautiful. The main hotel lobby and mall area were great too. Our room was adequate and the bathroom with dressing area was large enough for our youngest sons crib during afternoon naps and early evenings. The overall hotel staff and especially the front desk staff were very helpful. Every time we asked for towels or anything else they called back in 10 minutes to make sure they were delivered. Once we returned home the hotel emailed me a link to an online survey and shortly after I completed it the hotel manager sent me an email and responded to my comments personally. That says a lot. High speed internet is FREE in the main hotel lobby area, Casino, Starbucks, etc. Palomino island is beautiful and great for snorkeling right off shore. The boat ride is FREE and less than 10 min. My son and I explored the area and found thousands of fish of every color. They charge rental for gear so I'm glad we brought our own. You can get by without the fins for most of the shallow area but to see some of the best views you will need fins. Also with so much coral on the beach you will want water shoes. The views from the top of the island are awesome and well worth the hike to the top. I had read a lot of information about high food prices and extra charges so we were prepared for the worst. Yes, the food on the island was a little expensive but okay. Burgers are good and the drinks are cold. We ate once at the cheap place in the hotel and although the food was okay it was overpriced and the service was pretty bad. Our waitress disappeared after she took our order and we had to beg for more water. We ate all of our dinners out. I highly recommend LA ESTACION (which is a right turn from the gate at the hotel) and METROPOL (which is near the main highway). To save money we got lots of bottled water and snacks at the ECONO food store. To pacify the kids we also ate at Pizza Hut, Sizzler (has a good buffet), Chilli's at the Mall and McDonalds. My kids begged to go back to Sizzler but I made them eat local the last few days. The main pools on the weekend are packed. I think they must let locals in or something because they had suits under their clothes. I would explore or do a day trip on Saturday to avoid. The Coqui Water Park was nice but should be cheaper as it only has three large slides, one kiddie slide and a lazy river. We enjoyed it for one day. We spent more time on the beach. The pool at the hotel halfway down the hill was never full. If you want to get away from the crowds check it out. There is also a sun deck overlooking the ocean. The Funicular to the lower hotels and marina was always working and never an issue. We wanted to ride when the last boat arrived from the island and did not have to wait long. It is really a cool experience, especially the kids. We rented a Enterprise car and parked it in the customer lot at the hotel for free. It can fill up on the weekends. Drive carefully on the island. They don't follow basic driving rules. They will make a left turn in the right lane. They will do U turns anywhere. Motorcycles travel in the center lane\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.cops too. You get used to the driving, just be defensive. When you see how many cars, new cars, have damaged front bumpers you will be cautious. We toured and recommend El Yunque and Old San Juan. Plaza Las Americas Mall was nice and very packed during the week. We did a lot of exploring but it takes time to get places.

We had a fairly large group occupying two rooms in the Las Olas section of the hotel and one room in the Marina. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but I have some comments and observations: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll start by saying that the grounds and views are breathtaking. I have a photo that I took from the balcony of our Las Olas room set as the wallpaper on my pc. Our view was of the pool, the ocean, and palm trees. It was postcard worthy. The number of activities available at the hotel was also amazing. They have a private island, their own water park, water sports, horse-back riding, pools open 24 hours (no life guards), and just about anything you can imagine at a resort. Even though every amenity is available at the resort, the cost of those amenities tends to be outrageous. I recommend renting a car for your time at this resort. We tried a couple restaurants in the hotel and found them to be mediocre given the price. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to drive 10-15 minutes, there are numerous dining options in the area. Most of the businesses in the surrounding area are used to english-speaking tourists. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count on the concierge to help plan much, though. I found most of the concierge staff to be somewhat uninformed and not very eager to help. You may even want to go outside of the resort for your excursions. Just outside of the hotel you can usually find reputable guides for often MORE THAN HALF the price. You do have to be careful selecting a guide, though. Some of the people advertising various excursions did not seem reputable. We did a scuba excursion from the hotel and were very pleased with the experience. We also did a kayak trip using a tour group just outside of the resort and were also pleased (especially with the price). Our Las Olas room was huge, although laid out a bit oddly. There was a large bathroom which included a large walk-in closet and vanity. The fridge (or \"cooler\", as was the case) was located inside the vanity. There was a sliding door to the bathroom which did not lock and had large openings on each side when closed. I would have preferred a door with a lock on it. A final note about the bathroom: Considering that the bathroom and closet were the size of some smaller hotel rooms, the only ventilation was a very small return vent above the toilet. I found the ventilation to be inadequate and it was usually quite stuffy in the bathroom, especially after a shower. The beds were in a large room with a desk, LCD TV, and chair. Double sliding doors opened to a large balcony overlooking the pool and ocean. The sliding doors were effective at muting the noise coming from people in the pool around the clock. Electrical outlets were often occupied and not as plentiful as I would have liked. The furniture was older and definitely not as grand as you might expect from a Waldorf Resort. However, most pieces appeared to be in satisfactory condition. Air conditioning worked very well in the bedroom area. Our room was clean overall, although the bathroom floor could have used a good scrubbing. Upon seeing the other 2 rooms occupied by friends, I would say that the same comments apply. The Marina room was slightly smaller, but had a much more logical layout (fridge, counter, and sink in the hall, vanity in the bathroom). I did notice a slight mildew odor in the Marina room. Customer service at the hotel was not up to standard for a Waldorf resort. For example, when we arrived at the hotel we were promptly greeted by the bell staff at the car; however, unloading of the car seemed a bit disorganized and irritating. We had some drinks and snacks in a cooler, but were told that only the contents of the cooler would be allowed. So we had to empty the cooler and put our items in bags before we could continue unloading. We then watched the bell staff load a cart with our items along with the items for other guests. After finally getting all of our bags loaded on the cart, the entire group had to walk together from room-to-room while bags were delivered. It was like an involuntary group tour. Check-in and check-out were also a bit of a hassle. Because of room charge cards that are issued, every guest must be present at check-in time. Each person has to sign the room agreement and each charge card. The process took at least 30 minutes. At the time we checked out, the check-out kiosks were disabled. We had to wait in line for about 45 minutes to checkout. Turns out we would have had to wait even if the kiosks were available because there were incorrect charges on one of the room bills. No copy of the bill was provided the night before check-out, as is the standard at most hotels. The hotel is spralled out over a mountain with essentially 3 levels (Main, Las Olas, and Marina). You travel from one level to another using a series of walkways, elevators, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funiculars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The funiculars, while unusual and kind of neat at first, were not much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fun\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at all. There were only 2 funiculars in use and getting around often involved waiting extended amounts of time, as if waiting for a train. Sometimes when the funicular arrived it would be full or the operator would pass your floor because they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like stopping at that time. We found one operator in particular to be quite rude and inconsiderate. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s necessary to hold on to a railing while riding the funicular, and if you release at any time you will be scolded by the operator. While the mountainous arrangement of the resort is a large part of its appeal, it makes it unusually difficult to get around. Overall, I do recommend this hotel for those without physical disabilities. We had an awesome time. I suggest renting a car to avoid astonishingly-high-priced amenities at the resort. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the same level of service that you would from other hotels in this class.

However, I'm writing this review only about the horseback riding activity offered on the resorts partially owned island Palomino Island. My horseback riding experience is around 20 rides and my for my eight year old daugher it was her second ride. No reservations for this activity are accepted. It's first come first serve up to approximately 10-12 riders. My eight year old daughter and I stayed in San Juan for 4 days prior to the Fajardo visit and I had taken her horseback riding with PR4less in Corozal in which a 1 1/2 hour horseback ride through mountaneous trails and a river cost $55 per person. Palomino stables which is independently operated charged $147.66 for two people (no discounts for children) for 30 minutes of horseback riding time. We had myself, my 8 year old daughter and another rider and the orientation took around 10 minutes. I'm sure it would take much longer with more people. Off we go and 3 minutes into the ride on the trail and my horse goes slightly off the main path and I'm into a very thorny bush which cut my right arm in numerous places from my hand to my shoulder. I let out a shattering scream to which the guide did not stop, turn around to see if I was okay and did and said absolutely NOTHING! Since many of the scratches were bleeding I again reiterated I was injured and he did.... NOTHING! He just kept on riding. So, my scratches are swelling and some are bleeding and I start paying more attention to the foliage and I see these thorny bushes EVERYWHERE. Of course, while my wounds are swelling and bleeding I pay extra attention and am now worried about my daughter's safety. While we're riding I'm thinking how come he did not warn us in advance to stay in the center (if you can always control your horse that is). We get to the top in about 10 minutes and see some spectacular views and the guide says \"welcome to my office\" and I say my arm hurts. NO COMMENT. He completely ignored me. Then, he tells the other rider and my daughter it's okay to let the horses eat for a minute and she winds up tangled in some of these bushes, but he extricates her unharmed. Less than 10 minutes more and we are back at the stable. He asks me if \"I had a good time\"!!! To which I replied \"no I did not, my arm is cut, bleeding and I need medical attention\"! He looked like OKAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. ... I will get you a bandaid. The stable has no first aid kit at all, so he brings over some people from the island's facilities with a seriously undersupplied medical kit. They didn't even have antiseptic. I got the stable manager's phone number from The Conquistador's concierge. Basically, he told me this has happened before and it's the hotel's fault because they won't trim the shrubs back. I have to agree that if it's their responsibilty they are doing a very poor job. These shrubs are impossible to avoid if your horse goes a little off the center of the path. However, in response the guide's behavior, I asserted that he should have warned us which he did not and the manager agreed with me. The manager said I should have said I wanted to stop the ride when I was ignored multiple times. I asked him if I should have gone back alone with my daughter to the stables? He didn't have a response other than he would talk to his guide and make sure people are warned. He also asked me to write a letter to the Conquistador complaining about the shrubs (which i did). His offer to soften the horrible experience? A thirty five dollar credit to my account. When I checked my account at the hotel I asked if he had posted the credit which he promptly did and mentioned a small briefing of my experience. Looking at the cuts on my arm the front desk staff person said that $35 dollars doesn't seem reasonable and she would call him on my behalf. No change in the credit. The bottom line....find an off premise way to go horseback riding. For much less you can go for a much longer and probably safer ride.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful property however the staff is completely useless and rude.\u201d", "Author": "kmarti", "ReviewID": "UR69885392", "Content": "I needed to take a moment to write my review of my experience at the El Conquistador Resort. There are many reviews here that all express similar experiences at the hotel. I was hoping since it is a reputable Waldorf Astoria they were wrong. Unfortunately, I was. My newly wedded husband and I stayed on property May 20-24 2010 for our honeymoon which is low season for this hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 1pm. Our reservations were for an ocean view room. When we arrived, there were 5 men standing around the bell hop desk and the valet. No one came over to welcome us to the hotel, take our bags or even our car. Our room was not ready and we were assured that it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be long until the housekeeping staff had addressed our room and we would be able to check in. We provided both our cell phone numbers for the check in desk to ring us when the room was complete. My husband and I decided to go to the restaurant Las Brisas to have a nice lunch while we waited. We ordered our food and the service was slow. Then we noticed we had not seen our waitress in quite some time. After patiently waiting for our food to arrive and finally the check we went up to another server and asked for assistance. It turned out that she changed shifts and either didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alert the new server or the new server didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to attend to our table. We later saw our waitress in the on property Starbucks sipping an iced coffee. An hour and a half had gone by while we were eating lunch. I went back to see if our room was available. The hotel staff asked me if I was called which I replied no, no one called me but I figured I would check in. They made it seem as though I was bothering them to check in again. I then asked if it was possible for us to leave our luggage at the front desk and if we could sit by the pool while we waited. I was told no, the pool is for registered guests and I needed to be checked in before I could use the facilities. Is there no hospitality room? They then offered me a room to check into but it was a double bed garden view. I mentioned it was our honeymoon and we booked the ocean view king bed and the woman not only didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say congratulations but actually suggested that my husband and I take turns sleeping in one double bed for two days and the other double bed for the other two days. For real?!?!? I then explained to her that we had been traveling since 3am so if there was anything that they could do to expedite the room it would be greatly appreciated. The manager said she has already asked the cleaning staff to attend to another room and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to upset them. We then proceeded to take our seats again on the wooden chairs directly across from the check in desk. Another hour and a half go by and now husband decided to see if we could check in since it is after check in time. The front desk agent said our room was available. He then questioned her why she gave me a hard time about not following up with the front desk until we were called to alert us that our room was available to which she said we must have forgotten. We were sitting on the wooden chairs in the lobby. They could see us just sitting there. How does a Waldorf Astoria Hotel that operates in the hospitality industry forget to check in their customers? We check in to our room and obviously had to carry our own bags. Our room itself was nice. Very open and clean. The ocean view was a broad statement. The view was of a giant grassy hill that lead down to the town. Then in the distance you could see the bay and a lighthouse and even further out was finally the ocean. So, technically, yes, you could see the ocean but only if you avoided looking at the town, the sweeping lawn and hills. My husband and I finally made it to the pool. We got our towels, a cocktail at the swim up bar, and took a dip. Our seats were at the lower pool and I accidentally dropped my towel into the water. I walked back up to the towel stand and the man there would not exchange my towel. We had just obtained the towels about an hour before. He said if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have my card I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a new towel. The ID cards are not laminate. They are not plastic. They are paper that dissolves when wet. Great idea for a pool ID. I explained that I was psychically holding one of the towels and I simply wanted a dry one. He wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it unless I walked back down to the lower pool and got my ID. That was a summary of our first day at the Waldorf Astoria El Conquistador Hotel. This hotel had terrible customer service. Every day there was aggravating. The staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attitude is something for the record books. The only person that was hospitable was the gardener that was pruning the shrubs outside my room every morning. The concierge was unwilling to help. She was completely worthless and unmotivated. She directs me to another staff member who is the trips coordinator who was also completely useless. The property is amazing. The hotel is beautiful.

Not normally within our price range, we were able to find a great deal through Priceline, making the room $75 per night (not including parking, resort fees, etc.). We stayed at the Resort the last two nights of our trip. Here are our pros and cons: Pros: Great staff/Good service Beautiful grounds and setting Rooms were spacious, bright and cherry Palomino Island Sprawling, beautiful golf course Cons: Bed bugs (Garden room 4034) Overpriced, average-quality food Parking/Resort Fees are ridiculous Casino, Coqui Water-Park, Horse-back Riding all lack-luster Expensive activities (nearly everything has an extra fee) Priceline guests not treated equally The staff were all friendly and helpful during our stay. We were pleased the quality of service we received in that aspect. The grounds and views were also gorgeous. We loved the view we had from our room. If you enjoy golfing this would be a great place to do it; the grounds looked terrific. We also really enjoyed Palomino Island and the beautiful views there. Guests can take a 10-15 min. catamaran ride out to the resort's private island to enjoy the beach. I would encourage guests to take sandals or flip-flops that they can wear into the water, as the coral can be painful to walk on. The water was very clear (we saw fish and small, sand sharks) and refreshing; there were plenty of lounge chairs available in the sun or the shade; and there were lots of activities available to guests (miniature golf, snorkeling, kayaking, jet skis, horse-back riding - all at substantial fees however). I would encourage guests to visit the Cozy gourmet market (small convenience shop) inside the main resort to purchase a sandwich or a wrap before heading out to the island. There is a restaurant on the island but all of the meal options start at $17 and up. Our small, non-alcoholic drinks cost $4 and $6. Remember to pack the sunscreen too! While at the resort we ate at Bella Vista one evening and Blossoms the next. To be more cost effective we split a pizza at Bella Vista and found that it was plenty of food for the two of us. Some of the restaurants charge a steep splitting fee though, so beware. We ordered the take out at Blossoms since we were tired but didn't want to pay the room-service fee. Again, the food portions were large enough to split, just beware of splitting fees when you dine in. Although there were good-sized portions, we found that the food quality was just average. We weren't too impressed. Be sure to check the meal prices posted in the hotel portfolio as well. We were surprised that the amounts had changed at the restaurant since they had updated the prices in the book, so we had to pay more than we expected. We let the front desk know at check-out that this information was incorrect and needed to be updated. The most disappointing part of the trip was waking up to find that we had bed-bugs in our room. My husband's back was covered in small red bites. We were really surprised for how great this resort was supposed to be that they would have bed bugs. We told the front desk and they said they would have it looked at. I think an issue like that should receive more than an apology, such as a free meal, a free night's stay, a discount, something... anything. Other things to be mindful of... If you book on Priceline be prepared to be treated like a second-class guest. Our resort cards said Priceline Guests only, as if that were supposed to communicate our status every time we paid. Even though we prepaid they also placed a hold on our credit card (which I believe they do for all guests, not just Priceline customers). They didn't however tell us they were going to do this. I found out when I tried to use my card and it was refused and I called my credit card company. When we checked out they refused our card and we had to remind them to remove the hold on the card (which was much greater in value than what we actually spent). Be prepared to pay for everything... and at ridiculous rates... Horse-back riding - $70 per hour Two person Kayak - $40 per hour Coqui Water-Park - $20 per person (adults) Then all the extra fees: Resort fees (per night), Parking fees ($16 per night), extra service fees, etc. We would not recommend this hotel to friends and family after the experience we had.

The restaurants were mostly fine dining prices. Caribe restaurant on second floor was cool, had some typical Puerto Rican cuisine... but also your slamming cheeseburger when u had the urge = Lunch for two expect to pay about $40 bucks. Las Brisas restaurant wich offered the free breakfast was crowded better to be there by 9 a.m. This hotel does offer a meal plan that was not offered to me thru my travel agency may have opted to do so. The Restaurant I would recommend is Blossoms. I traveled with three 18 yr olds and found the dining experience to be great. The food was good and they bring a tiny charcoal grill pot to your table where u can put your meat to cook longer if desired. Really cute. That was fun. The water park was very small and catered more to small children. There is no BEACH!!! you have to take a 20 minute boat ride on a Catamaran over to the private Island where the beach is filled with coral and it's kinda scary actually. But, if you prefer to have an UNFORGETTABLE experience stay at the sister hotel El San Juan @ Isla Verde. We took a cab ride to this hotel about 1 1/2 hrs away closer to the airport and that hotel had a live band in lobby, big casino, great bars, walking distance to everything 4 pools and the beach.... Love it. When I visit Puerto Rico again would stay there for the same price or less. :( Mad my travel agent did not suggest this. El conquistador is mostly for Golfers because the grounds are beautiful and made for a 3 day stay. Hope this helps.

After reading the many alarmist reviews at Trip Advisor, we were a bit apprehensive about our stay. Although we have not stayed at too many resorts in our travels, the El Conquistador Resort turned out to be the nicest resort we have ever stayed at. It was raining upon our arrival and we pulled into the self parking lot and broke out our umbrellas for the 1 block walk to the resort entrance. To our surprise, a courtesy car immediately pulled up to take us to the entrance. The staff at the front desk were very polite and due to room availability we were upgraded from garden view to partial ocean view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even request this! The resort was expansive and beautiful. Our room was fine. I did not play golf but being an avid golfer the course seemed to be PGA-quality. The resort is excellent for both couples and families. We loved Palmetto Island! The ferries leave for Palmetto Island every half hour. The water was beautiful although the snorkeling we did right off the beach was just OK (not too many fish). The restaurant on Palmetto had the best pina coloda mix I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had. The resort had many restaurant alternatives, although no Puerto Rican fare which was odd.

We booked through the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts (FHR) program, which was a fantastic deal. Upon arriving, we were upgraded to what we determined was among the nicer rooms (4th floor of the Las Brisas Ocean View Wing), received free breakfast each day, and received a $100 credit. The credit didn't go far, but we weren't exactly sticking to a budget. Food: We really enjoyed all of the food. I certainly wouldn't call any of it a value, but we certainly never felt ripped off. We had 2 lunches and 2 dinners on the property. At Iguana's on Palimino we split a sandwich (they even brought it on two plates with tons of fries), got waters, left a generous tip and it was $20. That's not bad for lunch! The other day we just shared a Quesadilla at the marina bar. For dinners we ate at Stingrays and Blossoms. Each was under $180 with drinks, apps, and a tip. The lobster at Stingrays was amazing. The waitstaff at the nicer restaurants was wonderful. Room: Our room was very nice, the bathroom was huge, and the view was fantastic. It was often moist despite the A/C working well, but I don't know how that could possibly fixed - it's very humid in PR. I did see one bug, but it was small and on the bathroom floor - not in my bed. I killed it and it was no big deal. Cleaning staff was friendly and came by twice a day. Palomino Island This very cool little islandhouses the hotel's only beach, as well as lots of lizards and neat birds. However, the water taxi schedule is awful. We watched an afternoon world cup match at the marina bar (since there are no TVs on Palamino) and when it was over after 4 we had missed the last shuttle at 3pm and couldn't go to the island despite having at least 5 hours of sunlight left in the day. As a result, the pool at this hour was packed. It was also unfortunate to not have the beach to walk on at night or at sunrise. Aside from the schedule, all the good points people have noted are true - it's very pretty and great to bring chairs in the water, which is very shallow. While there's tons of sea grass, rocks, and dead coral (equivalent to rocks if you step on it), this creates a very cool eco system for young sea life. We saw multiple juvenile sharks, sand crabs, and while sailing on a hobie cat we saw a small sea turtle surface. Very cool! Water Sports We did a snorkel trip with Casa del Mar and sailed on the hobie cats on Palamino. Both were expensive, but it seemed worth it for the convenience. However, neither proved to be particularly convenient. We were told we had to be at the water sports desk at 1:40 for the snorkel trip. We delayed sailing to make sure we were there on time, but when we got there all they did was hand us flippers and tell us to wait by the dock at 2:15. We headed over early, but the boat didn't show up until 2:30. Snorkeling itself was so-so. They brought us to what was probably a good location for PR, but we've been to much better snorkeling locations, so it wasn't phenomenal. We did see a spotted eel and a lot of grunts and tangs. At the end of the trip (around 4:30) they brought us back to the hotel, and of course we could not return to Palomino. The morning we wanted to take out the hobie-cat we headed over first thing and had to wait a while for the shop to open, which was a bit frustrating since we'd rushed over. However, actually sailing on the hobie cat was fun, and the staff was super nice, even coming out on a waverunner to tell us how much time we had since I'd voiced concern about not having a watch. I also think they were very generous on the time - perhaps to make up for keeping us waiting a bit. Nightlife Everything people have said regarding nightlife is also true. We played in the casino a bit, but not much else to do. Parking We did valet, and it was fully worth the few extra dollars. The parking lot seemed far away and the valet staff was very prompt. Funicular There is a trolley system that takes you from the marina level of the resort to the main level. We never had to wait long, but it was one more thing to wait for. Checkout We waited 15 minutes to check out, as for some reason the self checkout doesn't work at certain hours in the afternoon and there was a long line. We at first didn't notice the express line we could have used through our program, but even so there was a line for that. Those in the regular line waited about 20 minutes. More waiting. Overall, we liked the property, but found it a bit difficult to fully enjoy a three day trip. We were trying to do and see a lot (in addition to the above we spent one morning at El Yunque) and all the waiting and worrying about schedules detracted from our ability to spend much time actually enjoying our activities. I think this hotel would be really fun with a group of friends, or perhaps once we have kids to bring.

The hotel grounds are fabulous, and Palomino Island is incredible, but the workers are surely, or indifferent. This is not unusual in Puerto Rico, but is is surprising at what bills itself as a resort. Clearly, the Walforf people should do some major firing/training and continual retraining of the staff. It's not like you are not given what you ask for, but the workers act like it's an imposition, or they are talking on the cell phone.

If you want to have fun in the sun, drink a few drinks in blue water, you can move away from the noise. Oh--the Starbucks is a godsend; the on-site eateries are overpriced and boring. Try Le Estacion, just a quick right outside the gate. We will go back, but make sure NOT to get a room near the all-night, all-day lift that ferries folks up and down to the beach (who thought this would not disturb guests when they designed this place?). It sound like someone is on a skateboard outside your window the whole time. The room was big and clean, but the beds were awful; my actually titled back, and the pillows were like mashed potatoes. I pressed two together, but it did no good. Finally, the towels were really ratty; dingy orange-tea colored, worn, old, and moist.

It is not a young couples or singles scene at all. Room - We had an ocean view room overlooking the pool in Las Ventanas. It is a relatively modern wing. However, they played loud music in the afternoons so if you are trying to catch some sleep it could be difficult. Also, there was a corporate event one night where they played loud music from 8pm to 10pm. We had to walk down a very dark hallway to get to our rooms which could definitely use a light bulb. The room itself was clean an comfortable - no issues there at all. * Food - mediocre and a bit overpriced (especially at the hotel) * Food - I would say the food in PR is very mediocre and homogenous at best. If you like plantains, bread and butter you'll love it. Sure the food at El Con is overpriced and mediocre but what do you expect - its a resort in a foreign country in a satellite town to San Juan. Actually a lot of the food on the island seems to be imported and expensive. Even at Chilis the menu prices were as high or higher than they'd be in the US. There is some good seafood as you would expect. That said we did have a few good meals while we were there: Estaction - this is located less than a half mile from the hotel, just go out the drive and take a right - it will be on your left. The staff is very friendly and they have alfresco dining. Everything is prepared on a grill. Try the grilled red snapper or the BBQ chicken mofongo. It is very casual - shorts ok. Passion Por el Fogon - This is a bit more fine dining. The chef is a woman named Murta who has won many awards and takes great pride in her cooking. We had the whole fried fish which was nice. The staff is very professional. You can't just drive around town and hope to find a Chilis or Cheesecake Factory by sight. All you will find around the hotel is Burger King. Locate a few restaurants on a map before you go like Chilis - we went to one which was pretty good. For some reason they are not visible from the main roads in town - and there is no chain restaurant near the Wal mart other than the burger joints. The breakfast buffet was $25 but the omlette was good. All the other items were so-so. Nothing memorable. We ordered room service and the staff was extremely friendly. They add on $4 delivery charge and 20% tip. * Kiosks - what are kiosks? They are basically individual stores in a strip mall. One is located at a beach near the hotel (on the way to San Juan). They sell traditional PR street food (think fried, plantains, breads, meats, fish, rice). One mexican restaurant had very high prices. We liked one on the far eastern side, it looked a lot like the others but we got a meat dish with rice, and a couple plantain dishes and drinks for $12.80. It is like a beach bar. The beach behind it seemed like mostly locals. No reef or anything to see but the water was clear. Enterprise - we rented one at the airport except they don't tell you that if you get a nonsmoking car the cigarette lighter will be disabled so you won't be able to use your GPS charger. Getting back to Enterprise to drop off the car is a bit convoluted and not available on our GPS. Make sure you get directions during pick up. Other than that The car was fine. * Bioluminescent Bay Tour - the kayak trip is not for beginners and physically draining. You paddle for about 20-25 minutes to the lagoon through a mangrove-lined canal, in the dark, whilst separate tours are coming back from the other direction. All the while you're paddling against a current. If you'd like to go and you are not 2 strapping young men go on the motorboat tour. When you stick your hand in the water it lights up like strobe lights. Kind of cool. * Enterprise Parking Lot - located past the self-park lot on the left look for a sign that says \"Authorized Personnel Only\". No gate. You can walk back to the hotel from the Enterprise lot but the general self-park is more of a hike. General self park is $16.06/day for guests. You need to wait for a golf cart to take you to and fro the self-park lot. * Palomino Island - It is a very nice island. The boat ride is short. Don't bother renting snorkel gear as there's nothing to see. They have a basketball and volleyball court as well as jetskis for rent ($70 half hour / $120 for the hour). We did have water shoes which I would recommend. * San Juan - it is a bit of a drive from the hotel (45 min with no traffic). We had made reservations for a restaurant in town but there was a lot of traffic and our GPS stopped working (explained above) about half an hour in. I think it would have taken us about an hour and a half to get there - so keep that in mind if you book a dinner in San Juan.

The resort is very big and when you first arrive you are bound to get lost a few times but it is beautiful the ocean view is great and the pools are amazing. A water taxi is available to get to Palomino Island without extra charge its a 8-10 minute ferry ride but its worth it the beach is great and there are many activities like jet skiing and horse riding but id recommend to bring some beach shoes because its pretty rocky and the sand gets really hot. The food at the resort is quite expensive so bring extra money especially if you arent able to get a car rental because there isnt anything nearby. My favorite places to eat at the casino were Cafe Bella Vista because you can view the ocean while you eat and Cafe Caribe because its more restaurant type there are other restaurants but the prices are too much like 60 dollars per plate. The resort has a casino which is very entertaining if you go id recommend going to the far right 5 cent machines, me and my fiancee played and won about three hundred dollars.If you are unable to get a car rental expect to pay alot of money for taxi especially if you dont want to be in the resort the whole time you're there. . we had a tour of El Yunque rainforest and we had to pay 80 dollars each way, we also visited Belz Outlets and paid 85 each way. Our taxi driver was friendly and helped us a lot in finding what we were looking for his name is Javier. You get a charge card which allows you to charge food and other items from store within the resort to your room if i were you i wouldnt charge anything to that card unless you want to pay extra money most of the restaurants and store only accept cash. i also read some reviews that state bedbugs i had an ocean view room and it was clean and with no sign of any bugs.

DEFINITLEY rent a car when coming here and DEFINTILEY check out what Fajardo has to offer outside of the resort - go to the Pasion de la fuga(?) restaurant and make sure you check out the El Yunque rainforest that is a 20-30 minute drive.

This place is breathtaking - whether you have a view of the garden or the ocean, is absolutely beautiful. - Lots of pools all around - Ferry to the Palomino island - its like your own private island (when going early in the morning) - Its a resort that has plenty to offer, but it is also relaxing. I did not have any problems with loud noises or kids, etc. - You have to understand that life in Puerto Rico goes at a slower pace than the rest of the US.

They are not affraid to make recommendations on places where you can get products/services for cheaper than the resort has to offer. - The beds were very comfortable with plenty of pillows. They did a great job cleaning. - Rooms were very clean and modern. Cons: - Casino isnt for the savvy gamblers. IT gets the job done but it isnt the most professional or modern. - The drinks are not as good as you would expect, and the prices are a bit much.

It was a beautiful setting on a cliff overlooking the Caribbean Ocean and the landscape is superb with a beautiful array of flowering plants and trees. We were greeted at the airport in San Juan with a shuttle for a fee of $37 each way provided by the resort which was most helpful since the resort is about an hour's drive from San Juan and requires several turns with minimum direction signs. Our luggage was unloaded and held until we checked into our room. There was a little glitch from the communication between AARP Expedia where I made reservations to the El Conquistador but we were courteously taken to our room. All staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was a Garden view as reserved and contained two queen beds that proved to be very comfortable with a large bathroom, refrigerator and balcony with a beautiful view of the Atlantic Ocean and Tennis courts. We did have difficulty with the air conditioner not cooling our room adequately and were promptly moved to an upgrade room ocean front. The resort offers several types of restaurants to meet many tastes but are not opened for all meals. We did not dine at one of the fine dining restaurants during our stay but did dine at the cafe at the marina, Cafe Bella Vista near the pool, Cafe Iguana on Palomino Island and Cafe Caribe inside the main hotel. All were good and fairly reasonable to be in a resort. There are several pools to enjoy but the one we really enjoyed was the beach on Palomino Island which is an 8 minute ride on a catamaran provided as part of the resort fee which is 14 % added to your room rate whether or not you use any of the facilities. You ride down the funicular to catch the catamaran and we had no problem as I had read in earlier reviews. There are plenty of beach chairs, towels, and rental of snorkeling equipment on the island with tiki huts to block the sun. I would suggest wearing beach shoes to swim as the coral is very sharp and comes up to the shore. The snorkeling is great since the reef is right at the shore and the water not very deep but be careful to not bump the sharp coral. We saw several fairly large iguanas on the island and enjoyed the coconut and palm trees on the beach. Everything is very convenient on the resort including golf, tennis, casino, shopping, and dining. The wedding was held on a cliff overlooking the ocean with a classical guitar player and local minister. The welcome/rehersal reception was held at the golf grill patio and the food was super including a roasted pig. The wedding reception was held in a covered room with a patio and the food, cake, band, and flowers were wonderful. We arranged for a tour of the El Yunque Rain Forest which is the only tropical rain forest in the U.S. National Forest system. A minimum of 6 persons was required for this private guided tour which was easy to fulfill since there were other family members with us. We reserved with Manny Mulero recommended by a staff person and we were not disappointed with his comfortable van, water, and his knowledge of the island and the rain forest. We would have missed interesting information had we not been with him. He also, after a 4 hour tour, took us to a local restaurant, La Parrilla, located on Laquillo Beach and completely explained the menu of authentic and delicious Puerto Rican food . His phone is 787-863-7312/cell-787-315-8716 and I would highly recommend him courteously accommodating us and especially being sensitive to my 82 year old Mother. The grounds are just like paradise with a multitude of beautiful flowers and I even got pictures at night of the tiny Coqui frogs by using a flashlight and following the loud sound that they make, (co-key).", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe bad reviews..the hotel is one of a kind beautiful and staff are very nice\u201d", "Author": "barbaleman", "ReviewID": "UR66987673", "Content": "I was afraid to go to the hotel after reading the horrible reviews posted on trip advisor, but since we already had reservations we had to make the best of it.

We did not have near the problems that most travelers have had with the hotel. First off, we didn't have bed bugs (our room was nice and spacious with a beautiful ocean view room which the guy who checked us in upgraded us to for free when I asked), we were not charged for the bell service, and booking through priceline really saved us on the 13% resort fee because it was based on your rate (our fee was only $13/day and we weren't even charged one day which I can only assume was because we didn't end up charging anything to our room that day because we were out and about in the rain forest and kayaking). Yes, I'll admit, there were parts about the room that could have been upgraded (new paint, etc) but nothing so disgusting that I was bothered. The furniture is cute and inviting. And Palomino Island is just fantastic. Worth the trip on the boat because it has some of the best views and you feel very secluded. We rented our car from Enterprise at the airport....was only $20/day which saved us on the airport shuttle and gave us the luxury of driving to the rain forest, off-site for dinner one night (La Estacion....yum and close to the hotel!), and a trip to Wal Mart for snacks and liquor. And parking in the Enterprise lot was a cinch and close walk to the hotel, and most importantly, FREE. However the lot can get filled so if you plan on driving and arriving back at the hotel late at night prepare to have to squeeze yourself in to a not so legal spot in the lot). The staff at the hotel were always pleasant and we didn't have to wait for service or anything like that during our stay. I know I'm jumping around here but the drive from the airport alone rt. 3 is a little seedy but once you reach the resort it really is magnificent. My boyfriend admired the golf course all weekend and when we finally made a tee time it sadly got rained out :( And one last note, the food is a little expensive but the portions are large and the food is delicious. I had no problem with the prices on the food....but where they get you is the alcohol. If you're able to make the trip to Wal Mart it really will save you some money.

Im glad to report that it wasn't that bad. The hotel and its grounds are beautiful and it has spectacular views of the ocean. Its literally located on top of a hill and far from the town of Fajardo. Transportation was waiting for us at the airport and we were lucky to be the only ones being picked up. The driver was friendly and gave us a little tour on our ride to the hotel. Alcohol was waiting on the bus, always a positive!! The check in and out went smooth. When checking in we got a free upgrade to a room with a view of the Marina. The room was spacious and clean and we had no problems with our bathroom. Our only problem was that the walls were pencil thin and could hear the guests next door who had a very rambunctious child. Every where we went in the resort service was great and the staff was friendly. We spoke Spanish to everyone (although everyone speaks perfect English) and that made the staff even warmer. One thing I was not prepared for was the exorbitant prices of the restaurants in the resort. I had read about it in the reviews but thought it was exaggerated... it wasn't! It was very very over priced. Out of all the restaurants Ballyhoo, in the Marina area, is the more reasonable (still pricey but not as much as the others). I over heard an American tourist say he had bought snacks and alcohol outside the hotel in order not to spend so much money at the restaurants. The last 2 days we were there we rented a car and ate outside which was a smart thing to do since outside the resort things are cheaper. We weren't charged for anything extra on our bill as I had read so many reviews claiming they were charged for some thing or another. The resort is very family oriented. There were plenty of kids running around.

Not to discredit others, but I did not experience some of what others did. As for the fees (I booked airfare and hotel as package through Expedia): Resort Fee was roughly $15/day, parking was $15/day. With taxes, my fees totaled roughly $100 for a 3 days. I did not have a bellman fee (rolled my own bag to my room at Los Olas) or housekeeping fee. I did not experience rude or unfriendly staff at check-in or check-out (did not have long waits at either). The island, Palomino, is a must - a great beach. While the main beach area was crowded (holiday weekend for Americans), you could walk to other beachers that were completely empty. As for drinks, did not drink alcholic beverages, but had frozen drinks that were around $10/each (pretty much what I would expect to pay at a beach resort). Went to the casino each night - was decent - but small (small compared to Vegas casinos, but normal compared to San Juan casinos). Did not eat on property at all. There were plenty of dining options (fast food and nice sit-down). Went out each morning to eat breakfast and grabbed Subway sandwich to bring back for lunch. Others have stated this property is not up to Waldorf Astoria standards. I felt it was a nicer property than the El San Juan - Waldorf Astoria Collection (located in San Juan). I felt the property was worth about the amount I paid. My room was very spacious and pretty quiet. I did not see any bed bugs. My one complaint had to do with one of the funiculars being broken from roughly Saturday evening through Sunday mid-day. Since only one funicular was working, the lines got backed up on Sunday morning into the afternoon (you have to ride funicular to get to marina area - which is where the waterpark is and where you catch the ferry to go to Palomino).

Check-in was great, in fact they upgraded us for free to an ocean view room, what a great start! The views from the room were gorgeous although it was cloudy and rained EVERY DAY we were there, the views were beautiful. Bed was very comfortable, decently clean room but not immaculate, bedsheets smelled like mildew. The room was designed a little awkwardly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no full length mirror, closet was in the bathroom, door to bathroom didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close, only one towel hook, there was no coffee machine or mini-bar / refrigerator (one was provided at our request and it took 10 hours to cool down slightly and kept beverages at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drinkable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd temperature). That being said the hallway to our floor was outdoors and was dirty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dead bugs, bird feathers, dust, and because of the rain it also flooded. Instead of mopping up the water the staff left towels in the hallway to soak up the excess water. The lights in the corridor were only lit one night - not sure if they were broken or the hotel was trying to conserve on energy costs but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little sketchy when you exit the stairwell. Yes, stairwell, because the entire time we were there (4 nights) the elevators in our building were BROKEN and we had to take the stairs. The pool grounds were gorgeous, if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look too closely. Chairs and tables were dirty. Pool was filled with bugs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I never saw anyone clean the pool. Poolside service was practically non-existent. During my stay I was asked once if I wanted a drink and then charged $10 for a frozen drink, which was actually pretty good but besides the point. As for the beach, I was a little mislead from their website. I was under the impression that you take the funicular down the mountain to the beach but in reality the funicular is taken to a ferry that brings you to Palomino Island, their private island. When we checked in we were told that it takes 7 minutes to get to Palomino Island. The first day it took us about 30 minutes, by the time we waited for the funicular and ferry. It was fine because the island was beautiful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c filled with iguanas, roosters and horseback riding, very peaceful. The water was warm but had lots of seaweed and the sand was super rocky from all the coral, to the point where it hurt to walk in the ocean. The restaurant on Palomino Island, Iguana Cafe, was absurdly overpriced ($9 for plantain chips and canned salsa served with plastic utensils, really?). The second day we attempted to go to Palomino Island one of the funiculars was broken. We were told they were repairing it and had to wait in line for 30 minutes with screaming children to board the funicular, and then another 20 minutes to board the ferry. Definitely not my idea of a vacation. They should make alternative arrangements in the event that the funicular is broken, like a shuttle service. Can't forget about the business center. What a joke. My husband had some work to do and wanted to log-on to check his email but for 2 days they had no internet service because they ran out of internet cards. Oh, and we passed by the gym and it was smaller than our room with equipment from the 80's. As for the casino, this casino is not for you if you like to gamble. The casino was tiny, almost laughable, and closed at midnight. Waiters were nowhere to be found at the blackjack table (once again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c poor level of service and understaffed) so I ventured to the bar to buy myself a $12 glass of sauvignon blanc. Finally, the waiter came around about 45 minutes later and I was able to get a free drink \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the cheapest Chardonnay I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever tasted that gave me an instant headache. The prices in general were a total rip-off. For the condition of the hotel - rundown, paint chipping, lack of staff and management, they have some nerve to charge 5 star hotel prices. This hotel is a 3.0 star at BEST. We ordered in room service one night - 2 plates of pasta - was $65. We only ate at one of the restaurants, Piccola Fontana, which was actually quite good but also extremely pricey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cheapest bottle of wine was $48. I have no problem spending the money but when a rundown hotel charges 5 star prices, that is just wrong. Especially since there is no where else to go to buy things other than their resort unless you have a rental car or take a cab, they shouldn't be ripping off their customers or who will want to come back? I would recommend that you rent a car as you will want to visit the rain forest, maybe drive into San Juan since the nightlife is totally non-existent in Fajardo and to avoid paying $5 for a bottle of water, drive to Walmart and buy a case. Maybe it will get slightly cooler than luke warm in the rinky-dink refrigerator they provide. If you are looking for nightlife, this hotel is not for you. If you are looking for a quiet, romantic getaway, this hotel is not for you. It was filled with kids and families and I must say I was disappointed to see how classles / trashy many of the guests were.

We had some initial difficulty in that we e-mailed the hotel in advance to confirm that our ocean-view room had 2 beds; however, the check-in staff could not find any e-mail and gave us a room with a king bed despite us telling him we needed 2 beds. There also seemed to be a bit of a language problem. Lovely room, but it did not work for us because of the single bed. We then were moved into room #2 with double beds; however, after returning from dinner that evening our floor was sopping wet due to an air conditioning leak. The service from the maintenance staff was incredible (much better than the front desk service!), their visit to our room was timely, and the staff actually asked the front desk to move us to a different room as they would be unable to fix the problem until the next day. Room 3 was a winner (although the front desk forget to give us an updated hotel card, which required a return trip). I certainly would not classify it as a 5 star room, but its location perched high on the cliff and looking down at Palomino Island and the marina could not be beat. What made the property special for us, however, was Palomino Island and the tree frog (coquis) at night. Having previously stayed in San Juan, Condado and the Isla Verde area, Palomino Island & its powdery white sands was just wonderful and the highlight of the trip. A ferry (with no additional fee, imagine that--just show your hotel card) whisked one to the island at specified times during the day. The island provided towels and beach loungers. Water activities, food and drinks and horseback riding were available for a fee. The hotel property is lovely; however, other than a stroll pass the Marina apartments to neaby Las Croabas, the grounds are not really condusive to strolling. I so wished I could walk the golf course paths!!! For those who dislike walking, be forewarned that it is a long walk to a very poorly marked parking lot for hotel guests and visitors. While there was golf car shuttle transporation between the lobby and the parking lot, it was unscheduled and was not offered by the person manning the ticket booth when we arrived. In retrospect, it would have been better to drive to the lobby first, if for no other reason to know where the hotel lobby was located. Our breakfast buffet was included (excellent made-to-order omelets and eggs, good selection of cereals & cold cuts, and mediocre selection fo fresh fruits) and while the food and service were good the experience of checking in & showing your hotel card, waiting to be seated (despite an uncrowded restaurant), showing your card (again!!!) when the bill came and having a 15% gratuity automatically added for the $25 buffet was very off-putting. The later in the morning the more apparent the problems became...there has to be a better way. Were the breakfast not included in the room rate, I probably would have dined elsehwere. I highly recommend a car, despite the $15 self-parking fee and the aggravation of having to stop at a parking desk in the lobby to show your hotel card and have your parking ticket validated each and every time you leave. While the hotel is somewhat difficult to find because of poorly marked streets and several required turns, it was a godsend in terms of off-site dinners at some of the best local restaurants I've ever found. Having a car also allowed us to drive into San Juan once or twice during the trip and to drive to El Yunque. We booked our room at a very favorable rate, so overall our experience (for the price we paid) was great. However, if I had paid the \"rack rate\" of $500+ for our room I would have been very disappointed. The rooms had been recently redecorated, but there was peeling paint, discolored grout, worn carpeting, etc. in our room and in the public areas. There also was no coffee maker in the room, although one was provided when we requested it. I also could see where one could be very unhappy if their room was not in the main building up-top and requireda funicular up and down. While the funicular itself was fun to ride, I would not have enjoyed it as the only way of getting to my hotel room. It also runs 24 hours a day and it somewhat noisy. On the other hand, the rooms at the marina and at Las Olas appeared to be much quieter than those in the main building. If there was one major deficit to this property, however, is that there needs to be a better way to identify guests other than a paper hotel card...perhaps a wrist bracelet, etc. Cards for the towels also would be a welcome addition. Since there is no accountability for towels, towels were everywhere. Guests on their way to the ferry back to the hotel would leave their towels strewn on their beach chairs! Pool guests would leave their towels at one pool and then wander to another pool and collect a fresh set of towels. Also, having stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village shortly after our stay at El Conquistador, I would say there is no comparison in the level of service and friendliness (the HHV wins hand-down).", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely outstanding....but expensive\u201d", "Author": "SallyWillickers", "ReviewID": "UR66096847", "Content": "Our experience at El Conquistador was absolutely luxurious!

Overall, it was a decent resort with lots to do and if the sun is shining could be a great time. It was raining the WHOLE week for us (apparently this is the rainy season) but I think that is an anomoly and not something (obviously) in control of the resort!! haha. THE GOOD 1. customer service - everyone was super nice and helpful. I guess it's all relative but service was not an issue for me and people who worked there were accomodating and really nice. 2. poloimino island - this private beach is really cool. easy way to get to the beach and has all the amenities you need. beach chairs, towels, ubrellas if you ask, palapalas, bar for drinks, etc. and the ferry is easy. 3. stingray - seafood rest was pretty good. very expensive for what it is but at least it was ok. but wine (everywhere on the island) is ridiculously expensive and horrible (low level normall $7/bottle kendel jackson for $35-40 bottle). ick! 4. car rental on site enterprise gives you free parking - otherwise they charge $15-20/day. 5. the biouminescent bay is right near the hotel - walking distance. that's a good advantage. dont book through the hotel. it cost double the price! and try to go on a night where the moon is not full or less full if you can because the darker it is the better your experience will be to see the beautiful sparkle. this is a great trip not to be missed. 6. try to book on costco - we didn't have any extra charges and got free bkfst, trasfers to the airport and discount on spa services! THE BAD 1. breakfast - was really good in terms of food quality and choice selection but they charged us gratuity for an included breakfast. I thought that was kind of a joke - and while i didn't mind paying the daily $7.50 it was the principle of having to pay on top of something that's supposed to be included. 2. rooms were ok but not great. I was in the brisas building where they served breakfast which was convenient. the view was great, balcony very cool, bathroom huge but our first room was more run down than I would have liked. We complained and were moved to a room that was a little better. I'm not someone who needs super fancy but it's nice to have a new feeling room - without water stains. but for the price (about $200/night inc brkfst) it was hard to complain too much on this point. 3. Blossoms was the worst chinese food. the habbachi looked pretty good so if you have a hankering for asian that's the way to go. 4. food generally is expensive for what it is. I am ok to pay $200 for dinner if i have to one or two nights if it's AMAZING food and wine - but it's not worth the cost so it's hard to justify that amount. 5. there is a bell hop fee. we took our own bags to and from our room because we were in the close building but if you're far it's not a good idea probably to do it yourself. this service should not have a fee and if it does they should at least tell you bEFORE hand. we were not charged but we read about this so declined them when asked to bring our bags. insider tips - 1. eat at l'estacion offsite. if you ask the hotel to drive you in a golf cart to the front entrance (it's really far to walk) and then make a right and walk about three blocks you'll find the restaurant. You can walk there without the golfcart but it will be about 20-25 minutes because the walk from the hotel to the front gate is very long with the golf course. food was sooooo good and a decent price. atmosphere was cute too. outdoor seating and very good service! 2. another good place is a tapas place on the water - i forget the name but it's authentic and delicious. and better priced than the hotel food. it's something with an \"O\" overlooks the water. 3. you can bring your own bottle of wine to the restaurants in the hotel if you pay for a $15 cork fee. this is a great idea because the wines are so expensive and not very good. we bought some of our good own in town and with the cork fee it was still $5-10 less than the worst bottle of wine on the list! 4. note that the spa has whirlpools and saunas in separate sections for each gender so you cannot enjoy these with your boyfriend/girlfriend which was a bummer. but the massages were really good. worth it if you can get a discount which we got (20% off) with our package by booking with costco! 5. there is a line at breakfast every morning - it's crazy. it looks longer than it is usually but try to get there before 8:30 a.m. or after 11:00 to avoid the wait. if you don't have bkfst included in your package there is really no need to go here - there are plenty of places on site where you can get something - like at starbucks or the store - and it's much less expensive. We wouldn't go back here unless we had kids because it's very kid friendly and wasn't that impressive to return. plus we like to explore other places. but for a week it did the trick and it's the carribean - what's not to love about beautiful blue water, sun, interesting food, lots to do (e.g, water park, beach, tennis, golf, views, water sports, pool, rainforest close by) and decent accomodations if you can get it at a good price.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Honeymoon Experience, Worth a Visit\u201d", "Author": "Viewpoint11", "ReviewID": "UR66026107", "Content": "I went back and forth after reading alot of the reviews on this site. My wife and I just got back from the El Conquistador for our honeymoon. I usually do not write reviews, but felt it was necessary after reading alot of the negative reviews during the decision making process. The resort was great, what a wonderful place to experience Puerto Rico. As far as the staff they were all great. From the moment we stepped on property our bellman Cidely was great with descriptions of the property and provided great information about the whole area. The overall experience with the staff was first class from the front desk to the concierge to the restaurants to the beach. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The beach is unbelievable great place to relax and the water taxi is a short enjoyable ride. The prices were high, but fairly expected for a resort in a US territory. Dinners are expensive and drinks are a little high, but no more than you will pay in every major US city or resort. Overall this place was great and it was well worth not paying attention to the negative reviews. If you are a very critical person or one of those people that always wants to focus on the negatives then you might find negatives here as you would anywhere. A couple things to keep in mind we were there for a honeymoon and they upgraded us to a oceanview room at no charge. They also had a great breakfast every morning that was included in our room. The spa was awesome and is a must it is reasonable for all of the amentities you get as long as you have a service that day. The prices might look high at first, but they have a great mens and womens lounge with sauna, steam and gym. We also got to take a Yoga and Cardio class with a personal trainer that day at no additional cost because we had a service. Definetly recommend some type of service. Another strong recommendation is to at least rent a car one day. The resort is about 45 minutes from San Juan and pretty isolated. We took the hotel transfer both ways, but they have an Enterprise on sight. Side note use the business center and book it online for the next day and you will save about 40 dollars than reserving it at the desk. We took a day trip to the Rain Forest which was awesome and a must if you have time. The place is unbelievable and the rangers are very helpful with decriptions and directions to make sure you see everything. We also went to dinner at a local restaurant which was a nice change of pace. The only downsides I will note that were not suprises, but I will note them. The rooms walls are fairly thin and you can hear stuff in the halls and connecting rooms, but in our case we only heard noise maybe for an hour or two the whole week. The resort restaurants are expensive and not really on par with what you get. Expect to spend a minimum of a 100 a meal with cocktails. The food was middle of the road, it was good, but did not support the prices. Outside of that alot of great water activites and resort amentities that will keep you busy.

To top it all off the 10 day forecast showed rain everyday...........and we worried for nothing! All experiences are different, people are different and expectations are different. Below are some comments and tips that might help you ease your mind as you wade through the \"horror stories\" out there. We stayed in the lower portion - Las Olas. WEATHER - 2 out of 7 days it rained for literally 5 minutes. The rest of the time was blue skies. FUNICULAR - this is the elevator that takes you from the marina level to Las Olas to the upper level. Both were in working condition the entire time. CAR - RENT A CAR at the airport. We got a full size sedan for 200 for the full week, unlimited mileage. Bring your GPS. Este is East, Oeste is West. Driving is not as crazy as we heard, just like any city keep your eyes open. The car allowed us to go to Kmart, Walmart and the grocery store to stock our room with beer and other essentials. FRIDGE - if you have a fridge in your room and its hidden in a cupboard take it out and set it on the floor. It will not get cold in the cupboard. FOOD - we only ate a few meals on site - we enjoyed light lunches at the marina bar and had a great 3 course meal at the Italian place for 36 per person (La PIccola Fontina). I have never had hotter, fresher food or friendlier service. We ate at Stingrays and Blossoms as well. Prices are in line with other resorts. We ate off site at Metropol a few minutes from the resort - awesome food. We ordered room service 4 or 5 nights it always arrived on time and it was fine. OLD SAN JUAN - lots of fun! If you have your own car and GPS its an easy fun day, lots of great history and wonderful bars, shops and authentic cuisine. PALOMINO ISLAND - GORGEOUS out in the middle of no where. Private, secluded. I was told to bring bug spray because you might get bit by sand flies which will results in welts that people mistakenly think are bed bug bites. The ferry over is a beautiful relaxing ride. LAS OLAS ROOM - Based on the carpeting in the lobby and hall I was certain our room would be awful. It wasn't. It had been renovated and it was very spacious with white furniture and white bedding. The tub seemed like the only thing not replaced but it was clean, just a bit worn. New fluffy white towels. The air conditioning was always working, our view was wonderful and most of the time we had the pool to ourselves. SERVICE- Just wonderful. Friendly, helpful, outgoing - certainly not what I get at home at the local grocery store or bank. I'd take Fajarado customer service any day. If someone is quieter it is probably because they don't speak fluent English but most people are bilingual. Most people have lived here their whole lives and are a great source for history and hot spots. CASINO - A fun stop. We are avid gamblers and even this small casino helped us get our fix. HIDDEN CHARGES - we obsessively kept every receipt just preparing to be armed with evidence when faced with hidden charges. Not a single one. Penny to penny. The only snag was that I thought the resort fee was already included however when I consulted my original reservation it was not. HUMIDITY - if your watch or camera fog or get condensation place it in a zip lock for a few minutes. OVERALL- During our stay the hotel was at 30% occupancy so it was perfectly empty for us. The view is incredible, there are a few shops and a few stores, multiple pools and many restaurants. It is very spacious with gorgeous flowers, lush greenery, iguanas, coqui frogs and a constant breeze through the towering palm trees. There is some wear on the property but they are always working to keep it clean. This isn't a Four Seasons or Wynn property but it also doesn't deserve the single star ratings. My advice is RELAX, be patient and smile. You are in paradise.

In a nutshell, you'll pay Ritz Carlton prices for a motel experience. I don't mind paying money on vacation. What I do mind is paying A LOT of money and not getting anything close to what I paid in return. Here are some of the \"highlights\": - The front desk trying to scam my family by putting the 4 of us into one of the cheaper buildings, in a room with one king size bed, despite the fact that we paid for 2 beds in a room in the more expensive Las Brisas building. - Bed bugs that I unfortunately brought back home with me and have to deal with now. - ZERO management presence on the property. - Completely understaffed for the amount of people the week we went. - Throw up in the swimming pool that never got cleaned (of course, there was not a single staff member in sight the whole day, so who was going to clean it up?) - Dirty plastic cups floating in the pool first thing in the morning, which means no one cleaned it up from the day before. - Cups and food all over the floors around the pools, because there were no staff on duty to clean up (not to mention guests who apparently can't clean up after themselves by finding a garbage can). - With hundreds of guests the week we went, not a nurse or medical office on sight to deal with a medical emergency. You are screwed if something happens to you here. - Horrible mixed drinks. We opted for beer and wine by the 2nd day. - No foot or body showers in between the beach and the hotel, so if you are coming from the beach, you have to wash off in your room shower (which would account for the clogged drains after every shower), or like some guests, just jump into the pools. - Long lines everywhere because the resort was so seriously understaffed despite having capacity crowds. - A $42 \"filet mignon\" at Stingrays that tasted like a burnt miniature hockey puck. - A $140 resort fee charged to my room every day. Nothing is included. Assume your room price is just the starting point, and expect to pay signficantly up from that. - Had to move about 4 times on Palomino Island before we could find a few chairs that weren't completely broken. A few good things to note: - Golden Spa (obviously owned and run by another company) was beautiful and the services were great. I should have snuck in and slept there every night. - My husband and son enjoyed the golfing. - Boat ride to Palomino Island was fun. - The resort looks like it had huge potential because it really is beautiful.

We're foodies and have eaten at some of the highest rated restaurants in Philadelphia, New York, and London. That being said, the hotel seems worn out, the staff are not enthusiastic about what they're doing, and the food is horrible.The first night at the Stingray Cafe, the waiter got my order wrong and then when the scallops did arrive, they were chewy and flavorless. The sole was like a fish stick, and the rest of the meal was bland and unimpressive. Worst of all was probably breakfast, with the minimum being $50 for breakfast for four people. The breakfast consisted of a wet croissant with greasy scrambled eggs. The buffet option was $25 a person. My family and I scraped by with coffees at the in-hotel Starbucks every morning. Furthermore, the ocean view room wasn't ready when we got there, and when we finally got inside, we found the bathrooms dirty. The hallway outside echoed and the sheets were rough and old. This atmosphere made it difficult to sleep. The staff was lackluster about everything. They were slow at checking us in, printing our boarding passes, and checking out. Waitresses hardly smiled, and gardeners used leaf blowers while guests were obviously trying to enjoy the pool. The fitness center was a hole in the wall, with about 15 machines total. Finally, the hotel was over an hour from San Juan, so driving to any tourist attractions is costly and exhausting. There were some positives for this hotel. The views were amazing, and Palomino island, accessible via free boat transport from the hotel, was beautiful. The massage at the Golden Door Spa was great, despite the shabby lounge and jacuzzi area. The conference center area was huge and looked really nice, it was just desolate and empty when we were there.

A little background about us, so you can decide whether our opinion matters in comparison to the others. We traveled with a two year old toddler. We are in our 30s. We all love to travel, and spend a lot of time hiking and snorkeling on our vacations. We planned our vacation three months ago and got a rate of 135 a night with breakfast included. We were not penalized for paying this super cheap rate on check in, as we were given a great large room in the Las Brisas wing on the fourth floor. We had the most amazing view across the golf course to the beach and ocean to the northwest. We found this side of the hotel away from the cliffside and pools perfect for us, since it was super quiet at all times of day for the naps we had. The room was very large, with a balcony with chairs and a table, two queen beds, lounge chair with ottoman, desk, flat screen, bar area, and large bathroom with giant closet full of built-ins and separate toilet closet. There was a spot of peeling paint on the ceiling, and a few sloppily grouted tiles in the bath, but I only note this for the perfectionists who would care. After seeing the view, the amount of space, the comfortable beautyrest beds, and the super cleanliness of the rooms, we didn't care. All of the staff were super friendly, as long as you were nice to them. Some preferred Spanish, but all spoke English just fine. We saw a few rude people get perfunctory service, but they were awful to staff, and therefore didn't get the same extra niceness we did. As a large resort, you do have to really explore to find the best nooks and crannies of the place, like there are five pools on three levels. The toddler loved the multiple level pool with ledge options to walk around the edge of the pool. There were shade options nearby for us 100spf people. Palomino island was great, and there actually are some unusual coral formations to see between the beach and the tiny island off the shore of Palomino. Beautiful green and purple sea fans, a big dark orange coral formation with long branching handlike structures, tons of tropical colorful fish with yellow black and white, and a few blue and silver fish. The fish were plentiful and about a foot or so long. On the shore there was a bar and a cafe style restaurant. There were tons of shade umbrellas as well. We had no crowd issues, because it's shoulder season (may 2010). The funicular was fun and always working and never crowded even when the ferry boat came in. Our breakfast deal included the buffet so that's what we had each morning at the Las Brisas cafe. Everything was great- omelets made to order with veggies and meats, tons of fresh fruit and pastries, oatmeal, French toast, waffles, bagels, and fresh sqeezed orange juice and coffee. Choose the rate that includes breakfast!!! Otherwise it's $25 a person. We ate in town other than breakfast, because we are cheap and love the local criollo food. We also loaded up on snacks and drinks and rum at Walmart. We also rented our car from Enterprise and got free parking. We really maxed out the resort and had a total blast. In the end by doing it our way we got a ridiculous amount of fun and sun for a tiny price. We wouldn't change a thing about the place, and hope to go back someday. If you go, and love the outdoors like us, you need to see the Playa Colore a half mile to the west of Seven Seas beach. If you go all the way to the west end of the seven seas beach, there's a trail that starts to take you further out on the peninsula. We walked the first half mile to playa colore and snorkeled with the fish near the rocky areas. Gorgeous!

Before leaving for my trip I read every review on the web. Good thing! Because I did I was prepared for the unpleasant surprises. In case you haven't heard this is what you can expect... Upon check in you will be charged a $20 bellman fee, this is per stay and you pay even if you don't need a bellman, $3 per day maid service, both of these fees are taxed. Upon check in we were informed that our upgrade request was granted (at $29 per night) but our room wasn't ready (it was 2pm, check in is 4pm) so we had lunch while we waited. They said they would call our cell when the room was ready. While having lunch we bumped into other wedding guests and discovered we would be far from the wedding events, so we went back to the front desk to request to be with the others. We were told our upgrade room was ready (no call, but it was busy) but we decided to stay with the others (declining the upgrade). Final location in las brisas. When we checked out the upgrade charge was still there so we asked for it to be removed. We were told that since the room was ready when we chose to change rooms we would have to pay the up-charge anyway! When all the pocket picking was over, the $199 per day room rate (for two nights) plus transfers for two people came to over $725!!! Room rate, upgrade fee, bellman, housekeeping and taxes. Based on another review we didn't use the resort charge option for anything for fear of an additional tax for the convenience. All that being said, the resort location is beautiful. We had the best time at the private island. I had read comments about rocks but if you stayed at the beach area closest to the ferry drop-off, there were almost no rocks at all, just beautiful soft white sand. The spa was great. I had a mango tango treatment with Claire, awesome! for those of you planning/attending a wedding, the food was OK at the wedding but the rehearsal bbq and sunday brunch was just standard hotel chain food. If your worried about the $12 per cocktail you probably haven't stayed at too many resorts. It bothered me more that it was served in a cheap plastic cup (even at the wedding rehersal dinner) except at las brisas restaurant outside lobby. So... this hotel has it's plusses and minuses.

The Hotel/resort seems to be much to big for its own good. Seems to be primarily a convention destination as there were a number of them during our stay. Upon entering this resort you really never get the feeling your on vacation. No music except ocassionally at one of the outdoor bars. Never any type of entertainment. Absolutely no surprises. The night club was open once and that was during a rainy day to show a movie. If you dont have a car to venture out to some of the activities and amazing dining options in the area you really wont find very much to do at the resort. They have ferry service to their own private island that happens to be very nice for about half a day. Not much to do there either except sun bathe and purchase over priced drinks. $12.00 for a pina colada served in a 12oz dixie cup. We sat at an outdoor bar one evening, there were maybe 12 people at the bar, and watched the bartender stroll by 4 or 5 times before I had to ask him for a drink. The staff in general seemed to have a way too layed back attitude bordering on lazy. I certainly am not the kind of person that needs constant pampering but the staff really didnt seem to have very much enthusiasm. Only had dinner one night in the resort at Blossoms. Very nice Chinese/ Sushi.. You will not find Puerto Rican food at the resort. Just outside the resort you will find La Estacion and the Ocean View among others where the food was simply amazing and will probably cost you half of what you will spend in the resort. Once the sun goes down, when most resorts become beautifully well lit, the El Con seems to be saving on electricty. Not attractive at all and very quiet. Although they claimed to be fully occuppied during our visit, the resort, maybe due to its size, seems quiet and empty. Be prepared to walk alot. This is a very large property that has very poor design requireing multiple elevators and a tram called a fonicular to get from one side of the resort to the other. No stairways where it seems painfully obvious that there should be one. Walking around, there really is not much to look at due to poor landscaping and lack of maintenance. Overall if your looking to stay in Fajardo there are not many options.I gave it a thumbs up for this reason alone. For the right price this resort is ok but do yourself a favor and rent a car. You will thank yourself. One down side to parking at the resort is they charge you. $15.00 self park $20.00 valet per day.

The beer selection is atrocious and they are often making 'typical' drinks like Mai-Tai and Margaritas with what ever alcohol they can find. Do not think of ordering anything 'Top Shelf'.

My room was dirty down to the ring in the toilet, not stained, just dirty. The tile had black mold streaks and the tacky plastic headboard had imbedded head grease. It had clean sheets but the towels were stiff and scratchy. And it wasn't just my room. Others were even more moldy smelling to the point where more than one of the attendees got sick. Some had towels so thin and worn they likened them to an economy class hotel. The exterior had been painted too many times without scraping so every white railing had a textured feel that filled with dirt. The convention facilities were recently renovated (I was told) but whomever laid the carpet should be fired. The lines don't match and the edges are fraying and lifting, just terrible workmanship. It desperately needs a carpet stretcher immediately as the humps made several of us trip. I know convention meals can be tough for even the best kitchen but our group was only 150. Warm to hot should have been accomplished. And for the chef - onions in several dishes each meal, even at breakfast, really a bad choice! The orange juice was bitter and the coffee tasted terrible and was cold. Service everywhere was certainly NOT friendly.

We were a little disappointed to see that we still had to pay for parking, but the valet and bellmen were very nice and helpful. They made getting the luggage to the room easy. The one thing we really had a problem with was how much everything cost. We kind of felt like they had us there and treated us like a captive audience.

We asked one of the bartenders and he said that he drinks Medella but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quarter at local bars.

We are used to so much better. I don't consider myself spoiled or picky, so I think this could really use some work. For example, on the beach, we went to the rum shack to get a drink and 2 employees are standing with their backs to us talking (in Spanish) about how they can't wait until their shift is over. Nice.

The waiters and valet staff were nice though. - The room - there was nothing \"wrong\" with it, but I just expected better being at such a nice resort. I could just tell it had been remodeled and I guess I just don't care for the spartan quasi-modern look they were going for. We did opt for the cheapest garden room. The bed was comfortable though. And, it was a pretty big room. - Wireless is not free - I think it was like $15 for 16-24 hours. What?!? - Parking is not free - $16/day for self parking and $21/day for valet. Definitely pay the extra and do valet. We ate dinner every night outside of the hotel, so this was nice. Also the parking isn't super close, but I'm not sure if they'd take you in a golf cart. - There is nothing \"Puerto Rican\" about this place. This resort could be in any country or any island. If you don't care about that, then no big deal. My husband is from there and we just took a weekend holiday, but if you're coming from the states for the first time to Puerto Rico, you will NOT experience Puerto Rico here.

Bring something to eat or eat outside. - There is a wonderful spot to watch the sunset. From the main pool, there is an upper level deck above it. Just the right of this, there is a trellis and 2 chairs and a table. We went there one night, brought the bottle of wine from our room and our ipod and it was wonderful and private. Check it out. - If you are staying in the main El Conquistador resort, you CANNOT go to the Casitas Infinity pool. We walked over there, but you have to have a Casitas keycard to enter the gated pool. Bummer.

Manny, our bell hop, spent a ton of time with us, showing us around, answering questions and pointing out things we should check out later. At the front desk, I believe her name was Jessica (maybe Ana Jessica???) was fantastic. Our room in Las Brisas was outstanding. Comfortable and clean. Huge. Amazing ocean view. We spent a lot of time just sitting on the balcony, looking out. The grounds are gorgeous. We especially liked that we could keep our sliding glass door open at night. As others have mentioned, the funicular did break down a few times. That was a bit of a pain. But we were on vacation, so we just took our time. Thanks to others' reviews, we did rent from Enterprise and not only got a great deal for the week, but also got to park in their lot at the hotel for free. A very short walk; no problem whatsoever. We really enjoyed the pools and Palomino Island during the day. While we thought the open-air restaurant at Palomino was fun because we got to see the iguanas walking around, the food was just \"so-so.\" Service was good and our waiter was friendly. But my husband had to send his meal back twice (asked for well-done burger and got red meat both times). They did take his meal off the bill, which we felt was fair. The food at the hotel restaurants was good. Especially enjoyed the pizza by the pool. Another example of the level of service: My husband mentioned to our server that he'd have preferred regular ham and pineapple on his pizza (not an option on the menu). The server tracked down ham and pineapple from another restaurant on the grounds. Boy, were we surprised! Prices were what we expected at a resort of this quality. Another upside: We were close enough to El Yunque rainforest that we took a day trip there. We also ran to the outlet mall at Canovanas. We stayed at another property in San Juan (La Concha) that was supposed to be of the same caliber for a couple of nights later in the week and kept comparing it to El Conquistador.

El Conquistador is a Con\u201d", "Author": "TiareBora", "ReviewID": "UR61373188", "Content": "My husband and I began our first trip to Puerto Rico in San Juan and we thoroughly enjoyed the time spent in San Juan. Unfortunately, the same can't be said of how our vacation ended. We moved on to the hugely disappointing El Conquistador in Fajardo -- and what a Con it was. 1. False Advertising: Their website boasts about how the Hilton El Con is a world-class, luxury hotel, Waldorf Astoria, 4 diamond resort. 4 diamond my [--]-toria! Clearly these are fake rocks. By claiming to be luxury, the El Con feels uninhibited to charge luxury prices on everything. At best, this is just your run-of-the-mill Hilton hotel; heck I've stayed at the Embassy Suites in Lake Tahoe (Hilton brand) and the rooms and service was much nicer than the El Con. I would not be as upset with our stay at El Con if only they called a spade, a spade. But they set their luxury prices & expectations. 2. Poor Customer Service: Staff have a general air of disdain towards customers. Here is just one of many examples I can share. Upon check in, I inquired as to how much it would cost if we wanted to upgrade. We had done the some at the hotel we stayed at in San Juan and was offered the largest and best room in the hotel (at a nominal upgrade cost). Instead, at the El Con, the person behind the counter wanted nothing more than to rush us thru the check in process and stated that no such room upgrades were available ... even if we agreed to pay more. Hard to believe given the size of this resort. 3. Beware of the room assignment: our room was ocean front on the Marina side of this sprawling hotel. It took at least 10 minutes from the lobby to get to our room. We walked thru a maze of shops and the casino, rode 2 flights down an elevator, walked thru another long corridor of shops until we got to the Tram that took you down the cliff to the bottom of the Marina. All this time, we're thinking about how much time will be spent getting from points A to B at this hotel. 4. Hotel geared towards families with young children: If you're a couple looking for peace and quiet, this is not the place to go. We felt like we were at a Disney hotel -- kids everywhere with their beleaguered parents. 5. El Con/Fajardo remote and far from airport: Traffic in PR can be quite bad and in most cases, getting from San Juan to Fajardo took more than an hour. Once you're at the El Con, you're pretty much stuck. In San Juan, we were within walking distance to other hotels and restaurants or a $20 cab ride to Old San Juan. Without a rental car you had to eat expensive meals at El Con. 6. Lowest point of our stay: Our room had a defective cold water tap/pipe hooked to the bathroom sink. Having watched plenty of This Old House episodes, it was the sound of a very loud, rattling loose pipe (sounded like a jack hammer). To fix the problem, they'd have to cut thru the ceiling dry wall (where the banging was loudest) and secure the pipe. (I took a video of this with audio and tried to post it with our review. Not sure if it will load/play.) We expected a so-called luxury hotel to immediately move us to a comparable, if not better room. But they insisted on sending someone to attempt to \"fix\" the problem saying it was simply air in the pipe -- riiiight. Needless to say, the staff engineer on duty was unable to remedy the problem. It was already late a night, we had unpacked and were exhausted from the long trip, check in to the El Con. Only after a number of calls between the front desk, did they offer to move us to another room 2 doors down. I truly marvel at the rave reviews posted by other people who stayed at the El Con. Did these people stay at the same place? I can only assume the following: They have never stayed at a true luxury property (Ritz Carlton/Four Seasons/Fairmont) and therefore have no appropriate point of comparison. And they are staying here for free using Hilton points. We will never return to this property and strongly recommend others to consider better places to spend their valuable vacation time and money. The only positive aspect of our stay at El Con was the spa. It was the closest thing that resembled luxury amenities and services. Their signature 50 min. massage was worth every penny.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel - No complaints\u201d", "Author": "jerseyrussia", "ReviewID": "UR61357012", "Content": "I read all the reviews before taking this trip..This property is beautiful.

They moved us to a top floor room in the same building which was a little less dirty. Overall, the hotel was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!! I would NEVER go back. Far too crowded and run down.

Let me start with a \"short\" list of the issues we encountered: 1. We got a suite @$738 a night. Ocean views. Adjoining room for kids. First night no one from the hotel pulled down our bed from the wall. We called but were told they were shorthanded. So my wife and I took down a huge painting, moved a table and phone, and pulled down the bed. It was not made up. 2. Shower door handle broke and so did the bottom of the shower door. 3. When we arrived, I noticed dirt and crumbs all over the carpet. Obviously had not been cleaned satisfactorily. 4. Light fixtures in our room did not work. 5. TV armoire door was broken. 6. Service: seems like half the staff could care less if they appear friendly or helpful. 7. Palomino Island......overrated. Snorkel shop opened when they felt like it. When I asked the other marina activity shack why they were closed on a bright sunny day at 12:00 pm I was told \"I don't know.\" Snorkel at your own risk. They show you where to go but it is not for the rookie snorkeler. Fortunately my son and I have snorkeled a lot, but you can find yourself in shallow water atop coral with waves breaking on you. Very dangerous. 8. Lots of chairs on Palomino Island are broken. 9. Dining service in Sting Ray and Strip was atrocious. Took forever to get meals. 10. Water park was ok. Kids had fun. No real complaints there. 11. Use the safes in your room. Other guest told me their money was stolen from their luggage prior to be moved from one room to another. 12. Cockroach in our bathtub. Felt like I was big game hunting. He was huge. Another guest told me a cockroach story. Think Jurassic Park Cockroaches. 13. Housekeeping did the bare minimum each day. Room was never truly clean. 14. Mystery nachos. My son and daughter ordered food poolside. My son's chicken fingers came within 15 minutes. When I asked the waitress where my daughter's nachos were, she just mumbled and walked away. 20 minutes later a basket of nachos arrived. Waitress was nasty and did not apologize for the ridiculous wait. 15. Trash. Either the trash dumpster down in the marina by the ferry or the trash that sits in stuffed trash cans could not be avoided. I could go on and on.....just got back last night, April 10th.

It was our first visit. It is a great spot to go to with kids of varied ages. We were there with another family( 4, 10, 11 and 14) and there were so many options of things to do that the kids had a ball. The guest rooms are spacious and we had a spectacular view and a balcony. It is a very big resort and therefore expect to walk quite a bit to get to an activity or location. The rooms seemed to be recently renovated. Some of the bathrooms are older- yet marble/tile. The closet is in the bathroom which seemed strange at first yet ended up okay. There is a \"private\" toilet which makes it nice since we had three in our room. There was a safe which we loved. The large size of the resort is what made it so nice. We were there for a week and we never felt bored and like we had done everything many times. I thought it would be a hassle to take the funicular and boat to the beach. Instead it was like an adventure. Every day we planned our day and left the room with all of our stuff. A beach bag was a must. Loved the boat to the beach. It reminded us of the nantucket ferry, just shorter. We did not spend much time at the beach. You must bring water shoes with you. Our friends gave us that tip. If you forget them they sell them at the resort. We did not have a car and stayed at the hotel for meals. Loved the Italian restaurant...one of the best we have ever tasted. The Strip house was great the first night and very slow the second night. The water park was fun for the kids. We went in the afternoon on three days and let some of the adults have the afternoon off. The kids enjoyed it. It was perfect for the little guy as well as the big kids. They loved some of the independence that they were able to have. I highly recommend the resort as long as you do not expect a four seasons. It is not as \"fresh\" as a 5 star hotel and could use a power wash or a coat of paint in quite a few locations, however it was an excellent value and they do not make views and locations like this spot. Be sure to enjoy the sunset in the jacuzzi on the cliff near the volleyball pool.

I always figured at the prices we were paying that the room would have been a little nicer but also the problems like the mold and caulk around the sink addressed. When we got moved to the Los Brisas side we liked it much better. When we called for anything the staff was friendly and we did get the things we asked for. We did get a call about a trip that was going to be billed to our account that we didn't make. We were glad they got a hold of us ahead of time for that. The checkout was a nightmare with two very slow women on duty. We needed to get out of there and get to our car rental and plane in San Juan. The best part was the Golden Door Spa and the treatments we had there. They are like the hotel (pricey) but it made the vacation more special. The staff there was also very nice and helpful.

It is really starting to show it's age. The biggest problem area is the room. There were visible stains on the headboard, the couch, the AC leaked the whole time and we had ants (which didn't bother me, we just didn't leave anything out once we saw them). The room has very sterile decor and it looked like it had water damage that was simply painted over. I got the room for a good rate on priceline.com, otherwise if I had paid full price I would have been upset. This hotel is no more than 3 stars based on the room. No bathrobes or coffee makers? Even days inn has a coffee maker in the room! I found out late in the stay that you could request one, but I think it's a ploy to get you to go to starbucks:-) Overall the staff was friendly. The spa is also a very nice facility, the highlight of my stay. The front desk was kind enough to upgrade my room to an ocean view in Las Brisas. Yes, the food was expensive, but since we had a car we just ate off the resort and explored. My favorite place was actually Cafe Caribe they have reasonable breakfast (the buffet at Las Brisas always had a long wait). The island is gorgeous. There is no nightlife, so if you're looking for that-stay in San Juan. The casino is a joke and NO ONE went to the Casablanca nightclub. From reading the previous reviews and forums I wasn't sure if the free parking at enterprise was true so I rented from Alamo who had a cheaper rate. I did find out that you CAN park for free if you rent from enterprise-but the parking spaces get full. Also, a little birdie told me that Enterprise does not keep tabs on who parks in their spaces and other people park there for free too. We didn't chance it, just wasn't worth it.

We were upgraded to a Las Vistas room, but after reading reviews here I asked at check in for a room at the Marina. We had a private, detached balcony overlooking the marina, we slept with the door open most nights, and woke up to the sunrise. The pros: We had a gorgeous room - more european, spare chic than luxury, but perfect for the climate and location. The bathroom was enormous, with a separate WC and closet with drawers. All of the staff members we encountered were delightful and helpful. We arrived on a Wednesday and the resort was moderately full; we had no wait for the funicular and enjoyed the general quiet of the seaside. We dined at the Stingray Cafe - and yes, it's not cheap, but we thought the food was quite good, and the outdoor seating was just delightful. The wait staff was also a pleasure. I enjoyed a morning of exercise, yoga, and spa treatments (I loved it - the spa is very luxurious and the staff was the nicest i've encountered at a spa) while my husband went out with the dive shop (mediocre diving). Palomino Island ... we hiked over the hill to the other beaches; they were much prettier than the front-side beach, but did require a short, semi-steep walk to access. The negatives: Starting on Friday, the place was OVERRUN with children -- apparently on the week-long spring/easter break. Children everywhere! On one level, I can understand - it's a nice, contained place with entertainment for kids and parents ... but suddenly I found my romantic paradise impinged upon. Kids in my cliffside hot-tub, ruining my romantic sunset with their roughhousing. Noise between our room and our neighbors' became a bit of an issue after the arrival of the kids Restaurant-wise, I wish I could say nice things about the Ballyhoo Cafe. Terrible service, terrible drinks. We had a \"cheap\", casual dinner at the pizza place -- $62 for two glasses of wine, one OK pizza, and one OK salad. Money-saving tips: - buy the coupon book - $20 - at the spa, pro shop, or signature shop for discounts on meals, free spa services, BOGO ice cream, discounts on scuba, etc - refill your water bottles in the non-spa fitness center; they have a water cooler, and it's free for everyone -Hilton Honors members get 20% off spa services (not the packages) and free admission to the spa (Jacuzzi, steam room, nicer fitness center) - don't bother renting snorkel gear at Palomino, there is nothing to see. What I would do differently: - get a car early and stock up outside the hotel on breakfast and lunch items, wine/cocktail mixers - get a car early and go to the local beaches (Seven Seas was nice, but the two beaches to the left of it, Playa Escondido and another, were movie-set gorgeous with no one on them. On a glorious Saturday) - get a car and explore old san juan - the forts are fascinating, the food is excellent - check the school schedules - they are apparently overrun with families at Christmas, Presidents' Day, and Easter", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cAwesome....only negative is...\u201d", "Author": "DrRhythm", "ReviewID": "UR59783292", "Content": "El Conquistador- This was one great place. The layout is amazing, with the hotel built into a cliffside and a motorized car (funicular) that runs down to 2 lower levels...one with a separate pool and residences, and the lowest level with the pier, some more private-type rentals (more pricey), a couple of restaurants, and the ferry stop. The ferry takes you to Palomino Island...a private island solely for guests of El Conquistador that has beautiful ice blue water, very calm and shallow, horseback riding, snorkling, jetskiing, diving, etc. Awesome. The view from the top level main hotel complex is just breathtaking, overlooking the Caribbean with Palomino Island, Vieques, and Culebra in the distance (with some tiny little islands dotting the landscape). There are multiple pools, and multiple restaurant options within the resort. If you are used to staying in San Juan, then this will be a different experience. The hotel is amazingly beautiful, but the difference between this and San Juan is there really is nowhere to walk around outside the complex. Basically, you remain in the complex unless you rent a car or take a taxi (expensive). But, if you want to stay at a place that has it all and has one of the most spectacular views I've ever seen at a resort, then you must check it out. The negatives: There are really only 2 negatives that we felt are worth mentioning. First, the cost. The restaurants, and pretty much everything else in the resort, is very expensive. The food, especially, is very overpriced. The second negative are the children. We figured since it is a 4 star resort, people would be less likely to bring a gaggle of screaming kids along. The way the place is set up....very romantic with lots of adult-type of amenities, we were very surprised at how many people were there with tons of screaming little kids. Most of our attempts at having a nice peaceful drink at the pool bar were met with loud, annoying groups of kids with their parents taking up spots at the pool bar, kicking and splashing. When we mentioned it to the staff, they said they were surprised, too, at why people would bring their kids to such a resort, and they thought there were too many kids at the pool too. I don't know about you, but a very romantic, high class 4 star resort isn't where I bring kids. Especially given the prices. We had a family with screaming kids move in toward the end of our stay. So that is one negative: for those looking for romance, be aware of the large numbers of people with lots of children.

We picked it because it was highly rated in the 2010 Frommers Caribbean edition for people with kids. Think they gave it 2 stars which for them means \"very highly recommended\". Anyway, it was nice but not that nice. First, there are over 1000 rooms in the hotel and it's an immense property. For example, we stayed in the Las Olas section (more on this later) and it took the bell hop 20 minutes to get our bags and come back to the front desk because of the walking distance, multiple elevators and funicular. Second, the prices for food and activities are all over the place. It's $20/adult and $15/child to access the Coqui water park which has 3 slides, a small lazy river and a couple of pools. Nice views but overall not that interesting unless you're a tween. Our son was too young to use the slides. One of the very casual restaurants (Cafe Caribe) had fajita's for $30! Oddly enough, sushi rolls at Blossom (one of the more upscale restaurants) were $8 which is almost cheap by NYC standards; highly recommend this restaurant on the property. Third, the Las Olas rooms were a waste of money. The appeal was that the rooms had a separate pool with pool bar, game room, restaurant and sun deck. However, they failed to mention that if there aren't enough people they don't bother staffing the area so everything, but the pool, is closed. Towels were sporadic, no bar service, games were on but game room was looked (why?). This meant we never used that pool and had to take a funicular (seemed to not work for 1-2 hours every other day so unnecessary walking) to get to the main pool. God help you if you forget something in your room as it could take you 20 min. to get back! Beds were too soft, building looked like a 70s throwback, but the rooms were large and nice (except the tub). Finally, I don't know why they associate the property with \"The Waldorf Collection\". Felt very much like a generic Hilton property. Overpriced mediocre food, generic service, etc. The private island/beach was nice but you couldn't get there much before 10 and had to leave by 5:30 - lots of really sun burnt people because of midday basking. Overall, it was a nice looking property with beautiful views and I'm sure if you pony up for the Marina or Casitas room you'll probably really enjoy yourself. Skip Las Olas. Probably best to stay in San Juan at the Ritz Carlton or other hotel. At check-out they discounted our last night and credited me back some money to smooth things over; shouldn't be necessary at a \"Waldorf\" property.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cDon't be afraid to book this hotel.

It was one of the best vacations we ever had. We were looking for total relaxation and fun for the kids. We got the package that included airport tranportation, breakfast, and water park passes. It was perfect for us. El Con was waiting for us as soon as we got to the baggage area, and they had water and wine waiting on the bus for us. We were helped by Atlantis at the front counter. I told her my concerns about bed bugs and she immediately assured me that the rooms had been exterminated and it was no longer a problem. I know that bed bugs are a problem in tropical humid environments. The bellman explained where everthing in the hotel was located on the way to the room and even told us what restaurants would be open for dinner if we had not eaten. Make no mistake, this is a huge property. I saw maintaince (painting, cleaning etc..) going on constantly. If you are looking for soemthign to compain about, you can find it. But overall it was no different than any large hotel we had stayed at. I felt that the service was way above what you usually receive in th Carribean. Most everyone was extremly nice and made sure we got exactly what we needed. We called the night of our arrival becasue we needed more towels and a hairdryer. (About 11 at night) and recevied both items within 10 minutes. They even called to make sure we had received them. The beach is nice and we always found a shaded spot to lay in. There are plenty of activites and food on the isalnd. The ferry ride is very nice, and you get a beautiful view of the property. We are not the type of people who lay on the beach all day, so we went every morning and then headed to the water park. My children 9 and 13, loved it! It was great for a couple of hours each day. My huband played golf twice and had no problem getting a tee time. The course is beautiful. I went to the spa once and it was great. Orlando gives a wonderful massge. The property is large and there is quite a bit of walking. I would not have wanted to have a child in a stroller. We never had to wait for the funicular. Food- this is one of the biggest pluses for me. We stayed at the Grand Wailea several years ago and loved it, but the food was very average and expensive. All the food here is very good. We ate at the water park (burgers and churros), Palomino Beach (chicken), Strip House (excellent), Blossoms (great), La Piccola (wonderful), Las Brisas (breakfast every day) and the Cafe Bella (pizza). Yes, the food is expensive as you would expect of a resort, but it is very good. We walked into all the restaurants with no reservations and they always found a table for us. We ate a big breakfast every day at Las Brisas and then would split something for lunch and go to one of the restaurants for dinner. It worked out great for us. We had a ocean view room in the La Vista wing. It was close to the spa and golf course. It was always very quiet outside our room. We took a noise maker and it helped drown out the people slamming doors etc. There was a wait everyday at the water park to get your wristbands. The hotel computer system needs to be updated. You could easily have bar codes on the backs on the guest cards, and it would make everything run so much smoother.

They do not have a beach directly off their grounds but they do have an Island that makes up for it. The Island and beach are some of the best in the Carribean. The water is about as aqua as your going to get and the Island has every eminity you can think of already on it. I would recommend bringing a cooler with some drinks and snacks before you go.

Our children and 4 month old grandchild were staying in one room and we were several rooms away. The rooms on either side of our children had very loud and disruptive people staying in them. Two phone calls were made to security in the middle of the night and again early in the morning. The night was lost as the baby was awaken and was unable to be calmed back down. The front desk did not respond in an appropriate manner and did not offer to refund the night's stay back to the kids. The front desk claimed that the kids and the baby should have moved their room in the middle of the night. Were they joking when they said that? After several discussions with the front desk, half the money was refunded back to the kids for the lost night. It was not until the last day of their stay that the hotel was willing to credit back more of the cost for the night. We found the front desk not accommodating and not sensitive to the needs of the hotel guests. They appeared angered and annoyed by inquiries. Very strange for a hotel with name Waldof Astoria associated with it. The property is beautiful, but there is nothing to do in the area, it takes quite awhile to get to the beach between the funicular and the ferry (and no one at the front desk knew the schedule of times for the ferry) and the prices for food is ridiculously expensive for a family. Another major problem is that everything is separately owned. The conference center is separate from the hotel, the valet is separate from the hotel, the restaurants are separate from the hotel;so no one knows anything. Really ridiculous. We have never been in a hotel that was so confusing and disorganized. But, if you want to go to a pretty property without any other expectations, the El Conquistador is your place.

First let me say that the grounds are absolutely beautiful, not a bad view from anywhere in the place. Whoever built it knew what they were doing. Also the staff are very pleasant and accommodating. They will do whatever they can to make your stay enjoyable. That being said, I must say the room my wife and I were \"upgraded\" into was in need of help. Lights out or missing, stains on the carpet, bugs in the room both nights, (snails from the garden that came out at night, must have killed 20 or more), no guest services directory in the room, rust stains on the sink countertop, and a bed that is still giving me back problems, I've been home a week. I did make management aware of this and they offered to move me, but seeing that we were only there two nights, I didn't want to spend 2 to 3 hours on the change. Moral of the story, make sure you thouroughly check your room before you unpack. The way I look at it is when staying at the \"WALDORF ASTORIA COLLECTION\" I should not have to begin repairing a room. As far as dining, bring your wallet. The second day I spent $170.00 on lunch and dinner for my wife and I. No alcohol, no snacks. We loved the pool and beach as the weather was perfect, and walked each night down buy the marina. Nightlife = None. Plan on going to your room around 9:00 or 10:00pm. Maybe it is better on the weekend as we were there mid-week, but from the tiny dance club and casino, this place is really about early to rise early to bed. I would probably go back but with caution, plan on spending for food and drink, and make sure you check the room thouroughly. I hope Hilton puts the money needed into the place to keep it going because you could see that right now its at a crossroads.

We hesitated to stay at this property due to the many negative reviews but as we were familiar with the location (having flown over it many times on our way to nearby Vieques) and were able to use Hilton Honors points for part of our stay we decided to give it a try. I am not sure where to start as we encountered almost none of the other reviewers' problems- it is almost as though they were staying at a different hotel! We have stayed at 5 other properties on Puerto Rico as well as having made 4 trips to Vieques, and 1 each to nearby St. John, St. Croix, and Guana Island. This time we were traveling alone without our family and wanted an escape winter getaway with a nice beach, snorkeling, nice room, and good food-- all of which we got at an excellent price. We stayed on a \"Winter Escape\" package which included 2 excellent breakfasts per day. We checked in quickly and were upgraded to an ocean view room in the \"Las Brisas\" wing due to our Hilton Gold status. The air con was already turned on and the room was 65 degrees right from the moment we stepped into it! Lovely room, with king-sized (very comfortable) bed, large sofa with chaise at one end, huge bathroom with separate closet/dressing room, balcony with 2 chairs and table. Loved it! Very clean, NO BED BUGS or ants, excellent maid service (replaced our towels even when we left them up to dry, multiple toiletry bottles that we couldn't even use up, extra towels, turn down service). Hallways throughout the hotel were tile- never saw any \"dirty carpets\" anywhere as another reviewer claimed and I purposely walked through the oldest part of the hotel (La Vista wing). We had read about the $20 luggage fee and since we only had carry-ons we declined any assistance. No fee appeared on our bill anyway as others have stated. Speaking of fees yes there is a 14% resort fee but this is common practice at most of the resorts we have stayed at and here we felt it was well deserved as this covered pool towels (no counts were kept and you didn't have to have them back by 5 pm or get charged), ferry service to the private island and cable car service-- the latter two being quite expensive to maintain. Food was good throughout the hotel. We did not rent a car and ate all but one meal at the hotel. There are many options with varying prices. We had excellent, albeit expensive, dinners at The Striphouse (steaks), La Piccola Fontana (Italian), and The Stingray Cafe (seafood). La Piccola Fontana had surprisingly excellent risotto and tiramisu (and we have been to Italy many times). Breakfast buffet was quite nice with made to order omelets and all the trimmings and there was no \"auto tip\" for the buffet with our package-- we left whatever tip we desired and we DO like to tip even for a buffet as the waiter still brings coffee, juice, etc. The Palomino island food was very pricey and limited in choice but then this is a small island 10 minutes off-shore so we didn't expect a bargain there. We had no trouble with our dinner reservations which we made on-line from home-- our reservations were not \"lost\" and we were never \"rushed out of meals\". Actually, the waiters brought my tiramisu with a candle and sang to me when my hubby casually mentioned it was my birthday!! Palomino Island was wonderful!! A very large beach with both sunny and shaded areas, beautiful sand, and decent off-shore snorkeling if you snorkel way out past the sea grass. Plenty of chairs, not crowded, all facilities at hand. What surprised us was how cool it was in the shade with a beautiful trade wind. We are used to baking on the beach even in the shade on nearby Vieques. This was comfortable enough to sit and read without even needing to get wet to cool off. Water park was very nice and worth the admission price with zero entry, infinity edge pool, lazy river, 3 water slides plus a mini one for the littlest guests, and the most comfortable lounge chairs in the resort. Overall a wonderful place to stay that we are considering returning to next year-- and we don't do a lot of places twice! Negatives- the walls are thin so you can sometimes hear your neighbors and it is more noisy in the common areas than the smaller hotels that we prefer. Finally, another plus is that there are lots of the wonderful coqui frogs on the property. We just love to listen to them at night. And there was very good shopping in the resort.

First of all, I am glad that I went . My wife & I stayed from Feb. 18th - Feb 23rd and we had a terrific time. I will start with the few concerns we had & a couple important tips: The first room we had smelled badly of mold, it obviosly had a leak somewhere. We arrived late (10:20P) and the hotel was booked, so we were stuck that night. They came & sprayed, but it was still pretty bad. The hotel did move us to a much better room the next afternoon in the Las Marinas section near the ferry to Palomino. We loved this room & that was the only real concern with anything at the hotel. We rented a car w/Dollar and this was a mistake. The agency was off the airport & navigating in PR is a challenge. Signage is optional & the mapquest directions were zero help, as was the GPS w/our iphones. It was nice to have wheels to get to Walmart for some snacks & the excursions, but next time we'll take the shuttle, save the parking charges, and forgo the drama finding thehotel & finding our way back to the dollar site. (Near impossible to get to, even after turning around a couple times and retracing steps from the airport) As most everyone has said, the hotel grounds & vistas are terrific. We found the staff to be friendly & other than some inconveniences when one of the funiculars was broken we had no other problems. The SPA is not to be missed & if you are a HH member, you have daily free access to the sauna, heated water, and workout rooms. We didn't know this going in, but it was a nice tip. Plus, you'll get a 20 or 30% discount on services. (Just not the combined specials) My wife loved her treatments & it was first-rate. The food is definitely expensive & having options for breakfast on your own would be a plus. It is $47 for two people for breakfast at Las Brisas for just a simple buffet. You can get oatmeal or something light in another spot, but we opted for cheerios & granola in our room. We bought 24 bottles of water & coupled with the snacks, were great for breakfast & in between meals. Lunch & Dinner on the resort were great. You can eat for $30 or pay $150, depending on the restaurant. We chose casual & lower priced options with great views at Las Brisas most evenings. The views are spectacular & their brick oven pizza is terrific. (Snacks & water were from Walmart about 4 miles away) It is a little loud on yorubalcony down as Las Marinas since it's right over the pier, a couple restaurants & their are a lot of people milling around. I didn't mind & was able to sit out & read with the water and people sounds more like white noise. Activities: We spent a day at the water park (Coqui) and it was fun, even though we'd left our kids at home. My wife would say I acted like a kid, but we both loved the water slides & it was overcast and we nearly had the place to ourselves. Definitely worth the $40 for both tickets at least one day & if you bring your kids, you might do 1/2 days almost everyday. We did the bio bay tour with Kayaking Puerto Rico & we can't say enough good things about it. You can walk there from the gate at the marina (we drove) in 10 min & it was a 10 out of 10 experience. Beautiful, amazing, warm, & the glowing algae were truly spectacular. We say a good bit of wildlife & the guide(s) were awesome. It's the best $45 PP you can spend. We did another excusions with this group & it was the opposite however. It was the miniboat adventure and the water was so rough (8-10ft swells) with zero wildlife. This was a bummer, because we'd heard about the stellar snorkling in PR. We'll try another option next time. They have killer reefs, but the seas were so bad we couldn't get there due to weather. They said this was rare, but I'd check for another option. It was neat captaining our own boat, but the weather ruined it for my wife and it was borderline unsafe. The rooms aren't super luxurious, but they are fairly spacious & servicable. Not 4 Seasons or Ritz-Carlton level by any means, more Hilton Garden Inn Modern. Clean & how much time are you really in their anyway? Palomino Island is great. It's 20 min by ferry and simply beautiful. We chilled under the trees & enjoyed the weather and wildlife. (Chickens, iguanas, etc...) You can play hoops, mini-golf, rent just about anything, eat, shop, or just sunbathe. Temper your expectations & you'll have a great time. We will definitely go back again in the next year, maybe with the kids in tow this time. The various pools were nice, albeit a little crowded at times.

By far the sights from this hotel are its selling point. But after that it goes down hill. Food is pretty good sometimes even really good but you will pay for it (or wait for it). Food near and around the pool is burgers, sandwiches, etc and everything is about 15 bucks. Beers are $5.50 and cocktails get closer to $10 ...and if you want some fancy frozen drink plan on $15. Service when I was there was slow and waited for about an hour one day for a chicken wrap. The food at the restaurants is good and ambiance is nice but super pricey. The island is beautiful. I would advise anyone going there to bring some aqua shoes or something because I found it hard to walk out into the water without stepping on a lot of rocks/coral/shells. Casino is pretty small and the tables get full fast and they close at midnight....seemed pretty crazy one night when the place was packed that they would turn away people with good money ready to gamble. OK the worst part of this place for me was the cleanliness of my room. There were make-up stains on the pillow cases, hair in the corners of the room, and carpet that did not look like it had seen a vacuum. Its not like the room smelled or was obviously dirty, but everyday I would notice something off in the room that just made me realize, \"well if they didn't pick up this candy wrapper off the floor what else have they ignored.\". Actually the first thing I saw when I walked into our room was the lighter and cigarette butts out on the balcony. They were clear as day laying out there but obviously no one cared to sweep them up...so what else did they not care about. Because of the rooms I didn't want to spend anytime in there. The over all pros would be the views, the pool, the weather. Tips if you go: Bring bug spray! Check a bag and load it with plastic airplane bottles if you want to drink cheaper at the resort. You will still have to buy some sodas or something but it will really cut down on costs. Overall I would go back to Puerto Rico, but I wouldn't stay here again.

This year we took advantage of a very attractive Travelzoo Coqui Water package that included:airport transfers for 4, breakfast daily for 4, admittance to the water park daily for 4, and the 5th night free for an ocean view room in the main hotel of $329 plus resort fees and tax. The rate was great - but the hotel gets you with their resort tax, meals, wifi charges, excursions and waterside rentals. Unfortunately upon arrival the ocean front view was not available and we were given a garden room, with no mention by management in a reduction in rate for the room differential. After calls to management, finally a reduction in the room rate of $30 per night was granted. The garden room was perfectly adequate for a family of 4. It had a large bathroom, fridge and a patio overlooking the golf and tennis courts. The room did not have a coffee maker - which was disappointing - because I am an early bird- and like to liesurely have my coffee in the am. Having to fully dress and walk a 1/2 mile to the Starbucks to get a cup of Joe at 6am was a little annoying every day. If you like to work out daily - I suggest visiting the Golden Door Sa and negotiating a vacation package with them for usage of their gym facility during your stay. I find their gym to be cleaner, less crowded, more equiptment options and more updated than the free gym Their normal rate is $25 per day or entrance is free with a spa treatment. However- I negotiated a $50 fee for our 5 night stay and found the extra expense worth it. Do not rely on their fitness class schedule or gym time hours- both were non consistent. One morning the gym was scheduled to open at 7am but the attendent did not show up until 8am. The hotel charges $15 a day for room WIFI access- however it is free in the lobby. Save yourself the $20 a day ( after resort fees and taxes) and carry your lap top to the expansive lobby to connect for free. You will see plenty of other \"in the Know\" travelers doing the same! The billing system at the hotel is not 100% automated. At 99% of the stores and service locations all purchased items had to be manually written up - which resulted in long waits and increased opportunity for billing error. I was very surprised that the hotel had not automated this process. Some places take cash or credit - but most of the convenience stores only accepted the room charge which then made each charge subject to the additional resort tax. I highly reccommend reviewing your bill with a fine tooth comb upon check out. I found over $400 in over charges that had to be adjusted. I also reccomend not booking any excursions through the hotel. One can book the bioluminiscent kayaking trip on their own for $35pp vs, the hotel's $90 pp charge. Also -no need to book a guided rain forest trip. One can book a car on their own for $50 and easily navigate the forest on their leisure. The enterprise rental car company is right on site and one can save $30 a night directly parking with them vs valeting at the hotel if there is availability in one of the 30 of the enterprise customer parking spots. Meals are pricey - be prepared to spend $200 a dinner. We ate off the resort and found those meals were equally expensive - but we enjoyed the off campus experience. If you rent a car to see the rain forest, try to fit a meal in at La Parilla at kiosko #2. The food was excellent, with a beautiful view of Loquillo Beach and it was enroute to the forest. I found the service to be adequate of a Carribean Island. I thought the concierge servive to be the worst of any hotel I have experienced. This hotel is not the Ritz Carlton in terms of service, but the property and amenities were parrallel to those of many other arribean Ritz Carlton Properties. Our children - 9 and 7 years- loved the resort and are anxious to return.Their parents - 41 and 43 - although over all pleased with the trip - are looking for a new spot to visit next year!", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Garrison, NY", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort - Worth Every Penny\u201d", "Author": "Bandlady", "ReviewID": "UR56848844", "Content": "My husband and I took my 77-year-old mother and our teenage daughter to the El Con last week. Although we were told the property was at 100% capacity, we rarely felt that it was overly crowded, as the place is absolutely huge! We rented a car at SJU, which ended up being cheaper for the 4 of us than taking the hotel shuttle. Having the car made it possible for us to stock up on some breakfast items, tour the El Yunque rainforest, and visit a friend in Luquillo for dinner. The resort is beautifully decorated and landscaped, and is located on a cliff high above the ocean, making for stunning views. There are also rooms halfway down the cliff in the Las Olas section, and down by the water at La Marina. We were located in the marina section. All sections are connected by the funicular, which runs continually up and down the mountain. You really get an awesome view from there. Since the property is so large, be prepared to do a lot of walking. OK, there have been some negative posts about this place recently, but I think people have to be realistic about what they will experience in Puerto Rico. The culture is much more relaxed than in the \"States\". Get on \"Puerto Rican time\" as soon as you can, and you will be happy. If you can't accept the more relaxed style, vacation somewhere else. However, the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming, and we've waited longer in many NYC restaurants than we ever did at El Con. The staff is clearly trying very hard to please. Our room was beautiful, with a large bathroom and a marina view. The patio was quite large, and we enjoyed eating breakfast there. Everything was clean, although I believe the hotel will soon want to update some of the carpets and furnishings. We found the bed comfortable and the room amenities very nice. Yes, there was a coffee maker with excellent Puerto Rican coffee! We would recommend the food at Stingray if you like seafood. We also ate at the bar at the marina. The food was fine, and the service excellent. The restaurant on Palomino Island had similar food and fine service, as well. Prices at Stingray were similar to NYC restaurants - dinner for 4 came to about $200. with drinks. Prices at the bar are about half that. We saved money on breakfast by stocking up on OJ, cereal and milk, and then running up to Starbucks for our coffee. To sum up, the El Con is a stunning property with excellent service. You will pay \"resort\" prices, but considering the beautiful landscaping and view, they are worth every penny.", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cstraight forward experience\u201d", "Author": "travel99boston", "ReviewID": "UR56703831", "Content": "I read many reviews on here before picking a hotel. No hotel in Puerto Rico got consistently strong reviews, all seemed to have a hot/cold phenomenon taking place. Some folks loved each resort, others had horrible experiences. So, I took comfort in the fact we were visiting in mid Feb when it's not Christmas. I think that was key as the hotel was not ridiculously busy (though it seemed plenty busy.) We were able to snag chairs at the pool or at the beach by arriving early. This is not the place to casually saunter to the beach/pool at 11 a.m and expect to find many places to plop down. I think if this was Christmas week, we'd have to be on the first boat to the beach area to get the location and chairs we wanted. And even then it might be problematic. As it was, we took the 9:30 boat (first one leaves at 9), and we were fine, but the free umbrellas were taken so we rented one. At the beach, watch out for the coral when you swim, both my kids cut their feet and needed first aid attention despite the fact they wore flip flops (best to wear water shoes, truly.) For the pool, we got there at 10 a.m, and were fine, but by 11, most chairs were taken. The food was good, we actually liked the buffet place near the pool the best (it had the most local authentic cuisine). Service pool side was fine and tasty and appropriately hot or cold depending on the item. The restaurant at the beach was also nice, we waited a bit for our food, but got there before noon and were able to get a table. My guess is that the wait can be ugly during super busy weeks. The Italian place for dinner in the main complex was really average, and one of the most ridiculously expensive restaurants. Best to avoid that restaurant unless pasta is like oxygen for you. Every time I saw a small army manicuring the lawns, I realized that the inflated prices help keep the place looking nice. Thanks to trip advisor, we rented our car from Enterprise, and were able to park for free in the Entreprise lot on site. The weather made our experience. It was just wonderful. Thanks again to Trip Advisor, we didn't get a room that faces the funicular. It would be beyond unbearable to have a room adjacent to that thing. (There is a huge counterweight that makes a lot of noise.) We never had to wait for the funicular, so lines were not an issue for us (maybe once we had to wait, but nothing like what some folks seem to experience in prior posts. ) Best to put your rush hour thinking cap into action....in the late afternoon, as beachgoers return and line up for the funicular, it was busy. Just make sure you're not in a rush at that time of day. Vice versa for going down in the morning. Overall the staff was pleasant. We had a problem with our TV and our air conditioner upon checkin, and we had the engineering folks in our room within 25 minutes to fix both. Then we didn't have a hair dryer and within an hour someone from housekeeping brought one (our room was in the marina, so it was a bit of a hike from the main building.) We tried to tip the engineering staff and they refused. That was pleasant. Overall, we found everyone very attentive, very pleasant, and although the resort was busy, service was under control. I think for holiday weeks, it is likely more of a struggle to feel relaxed, as it's just so busy, and if we had to wait for that funicular, it would have certainly detracted from our stay. Overall, I would return, as it's easy to visit. and easy to get around. Roads easy to navigate (we used the iphone map application to get to the resort from the airport...but there is a new road, route 66 that is not yet on any satellite instruments (but it's on the rental car map, be sure to get one of those.) Flights easy. Also, when you leave PR, your bags get checked for fruit/vegetables, so if you have a prized apple or bag of mangoes, eat them before you get to the airport.

Overall, loved the resort and all it had to offer. We stayed in Las Olas in the middle section. Wanted a cot, but they wouldn't give us one because we had 2 queen beds, so my sons had to switch sleeping on the floor. No car, so we had to eat all our meals on-site. Took the shuttle to and from the resort. The rooms were very big and balcony was generous size with great views of the pool, ocean and Palomino Island. Pros: staff was extremely friendly (some of the best in all of our travels), upper pools were crowded, but ours at Las Olas was not and is available to all hotel guests; island was very cool, even my mother travelled the funicular and all the walking that was needed; was a little rocky with coral, etc. so make sure you and kids have water shoes; snorkelling was ok if you can get out far enough, too murky close to the shore; funicular was easy to use and not long waits; we caught the catamaran every time to and fro the island with no wait or long lines; no car so eating at resort was very expensive. Cons: mini-frig didn't work when we checked in, then it took 2 days to get a new one. That one didn't work either. I filled an ice bag and stuck that in the frig. It kept it cold for rest of the stay. A little dirty......carpets need to be cleaned in the hallways. Room was clean, but balcony should have been rinsed off with a hose. Dirt and funk over most of it, couldn't really walk on it barefoot. Food was VERY expensive and drinks, but i expected this. Better for me than renting a car and trying to find some local joint to take everyone. At checkout, they didn't tally up my bill because they said charges were still coming in?? I still don't know what my final bill was and from what i am seeing on my card charges coming in today, it looks pretty screwed up. SUGGESTIONS - if you have kids, stay away from the \"reservation only \" more expensive restaurants. Food is not great there anyway.

After I called to complain they told me that the hotel doctor has to examine me, nice to learn when I already am back home. Also, this is something they could have mentioned when I complained several times to the front desk, at one point front desk even gave be bug spray and played it off as something very common. They informed me that they will fax me a form the following day so I can document the incident.

On top of all the overcharges I looked at my credit card bill and they processed an extra $100 on my credit card. Still not clue why. The Waldorf Astoria brand should be embarrassed to have their name associated with this hotel. It's extremely unfortunate as the facilities are decent. Something else I found really cute is they charging for everything. Weather you use a bellhop or not checking in or out the hotel will still charge you a $20 fee plus tax.

Waiting for elevators, waiting for the funicular (usually about 5-10 minutes), waiting for the water taxi to the island.

Call the front desk? Be put on hold for 10 minutes. You spend so much time waiting you barely have time to enjoy the place. The other problem is that as a solo traveler you're pretty much invisible.

Therefore, we didn't have to pay anything out of pocket. Our ocean view room was paid for, all meals, etc. With that in mind, here's my review: Rooms - very nicely decorated...although I could see they were starting to show some wear. Nothing a good paint job and some scrubbing couldn't handle (ex: big marks on the wall, looks like blood or pizza sauce on the couch, etc.). The bed was extremely comfortable and I really liked the bathroom. The rooms were kept very clean. Grounds - the view and grounds were absolutely gorgeous. I loved walking around or taking the trolley car because the views were spectacle! Its a pretty far walk to a lot of the amenities, but the view makes them worthwile. Food - good, but the prices looked to be very expensive. Same with drinks. Beach - we LOVED the ferry and the beach. Gorgeous and there were plenty of sun chairs for everyone. The drink service on the beach was also nice. We were suprised to see bunnies on the beach - they were very cute and one napped under my chair the entire time! Activites - Biobay is a close walk. Do NOT book through the hotel. For some reason, they charge a lot more. You can walk down to the marina and book directly with the kayak companies for $20-$30 cheaper. The bay does get crowded and its hard to navigate in the dark, so you are constantly bumping into other kayaks on the way in and out of the bay - but its well worth the trip. Coolest thing I've seen. I would also take a trip to the rainforest. We explored and hiked on our own rather than taking a tour. Pool - the pool was nice, but very crowded. There are two pools, but in the afternoon - they sometiems close one for private functions. Therefore, everyone is stuffed at one pool and chairs were hard to find. Word of caution - we rented a car at the airport and returned it at the resort. The resort rental guy said the car was missing a jack out of the trunk and tried to charge us for it. There was never a jack in the trunk, but the airport rental guy said it was there - after much negoitation, they decided not to charge us for it. Not sure if this is a one-time thing or a way for the rental car companies to make additional revenue. Service - I would say the service is mediocre for what most people pay to stay the resort.

This hotel falls under the Hilton chain. I started to make the reservation online but had questions about water park and golf packages so I called the hotel directly. Despite the computer telling me the resort was available,the reservations agent was telling me they had no openings. To prove my point, while I was on the phone with the agent, I completed my reservation online and then gave him the confirmation number. He was less than graceful in acknowledging that his system obviously was not showing him all availability. And no he couldn't help me with an early check-in, no I could not get a water park discount with Hilton Honors points, no I couldn't get an upgraded room, despite being a HHonors VIP. When I called Hilton Honors to let them know what happened, I got all kind of follow-up calls to apologize for the foregoing and got my questions answered, got the early checkin, etc. It turns out that we got two water park admissions with our package, but no one could tell me that ahead of time. The ocean view was magnificent and the hotel has a superb setting with a terrific golf course, although the course starter was borderline incompetent. We wanted to hit some balls and aside from the lady behind the cash register in the pro shop couldn't find anyone to get a bucket of balls from and had to walk around looking for someone. The starter didn't enforce starting times and instead just went to the driving range and started a mad rush by announcing that someone had to tee off. The hotel food was good but very expensive. We found wonderful food at wonderful prices in some of the nearby restaurants just off the hotel grounds. The hotel has several pools but apparently only offers poolside service by the lower pool with the private cabanas. We were by the pool for many hours and no one came by for drink orders, though they were scurrying around taking orders at the lower pool. The cleanliness of the pool area had a lot to be desired. There were numerous limes laying around on the pool deck in varying stages of decomposition as if some had been there for days. Some of the fountains by the pool looked very pretty from a distance with red flower petals on the surface, but when you got close you could see decomposing petals all over the bottom all brown and decaying like it had not been cleaned for some time. We thought the people were nice, the location beautiful, but this resort has a lot of unrealized potential. They need to reduce their food prices and improve the cleanliness of the pool area if they want to really achieve a four star rating. Parking was very expensive, but I guess most of the high rollers there don't mind. The parking is also a separate business from the hotel and we had to go through a separate check out with them after checking out from the hotel. I can't see this hotel being rated any higher than 3 stars because of the lack of pool service and poor cleanliness.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Place, Nicely Renovated, Great New Waterpark, but EXPENSIVE for the level of service provided\u201d", "Author": "D0ct0r_L", "ReviewID": "UR54178843", "Content": "We returned to visit the El Conquistador (last there in 1995), this time with kids.

We have two older children, 18 and 21, and one toddler, 2 years old. We needed someplace that gave us flexibility for the older kids, but enough freedom to keep the little one busy and safe. The resort is about 45 minutes from the airport. We rented a minivan from Enterprise (which is not on site at the airport, which was a little inconvenient). The ride was not too difficult, and we were able to use the navigation on our cell phones. We stayed from Sunday to Friday. The villa was exceptionally clean (I'm extremely picky). The maid service was attentive but unobtrusive. The decor was modern/zen with neutral colors and tile floors. The resort has enough restaurants to keep you from getting bored. The restaurants are not cheap, but the food is decent. The seafood restaurant seemed to be the best food of them all. The brick oven pizzeria was also great, but be sure to see if they are actually using the brick oven. The second time we went to get pizza, they didn't and it wasn't as good. The Japanese \"hibachi\" was as expected: the kids enjoy this, but the food is mediocre at best. The hamburgers and sandwiches at the restaurant on the water level near the ferry were very good; we returned there for a casual dinner our last night. The villa we rented had a good sized kitchen with full sized refrigerator. We stopped on our way and got some breakfast food for the little one, and some snacks to keep around for everyone. It was nice to have the refrigerator for juice and milk. There is a coffee machine with coffee provided. We had to ask for more coffee once we used the first packets. The villa also had two flat screen tv's, both with dvd players. The pools were clean, but not too warm. The weather was in the upper 70s/low 80s. Going to the beach is a little bit of a hassle with a young child, as you have to take the funicular down to the water level, and then take the resort ferry over to their private island. Once there, it is very nice. The beach is not so great: the sand has a lot of coral, as does the water. There is a restaurant there, and there is also a little shop to purchase any beach items you forgot. The ferry runs every thirty minutes. It was a nice change of pace for our older girls, who went to the beach several times. We did not do the water park, as the big girls weren't interested, and it seemed to be a waste of money for the little one. For kids 5-mid teens I'm sure it would be great fun. There is a casino in the main part of the resort. My husband and the older girls went every evening for something to do. The nightclub was not open while we were there, since we came midweek.

The water was obviously warm and great for swimming. It was disappointing that we paid a resort fee though (almost $50 per day) and then had to rent things like kayaks on the island. Also, the food is expensive on the island - if you can, would bring your own food. 2. View from the hotel: We had a view of where the Atlantic meets the Carribean - truly spectacular with wonderful sunrises. 3. Kayaking Puerto Rico: Would recommend their tours to anyone. We need the Biobay which was the highlight of our trip but also did the rainforest tour - these guys are professional, educational and really nice. You need to do a tour with them if you are in Puerto Rico. 4. Hotel staff: From the bellstaff to the servers - everyone was really friendly. Things to look out for: 1. Check your bill. I had an extra $700.00 of charges on my bill from other folks. The staff fixed this fast for me - but had I not looked, I would have paid much more than I was supposed to. 2. Hotel restaurants: Pretty good (actually Blossoms is really good) but expensive. If you can go off resorts to eat, I would do so.

Many were without water, all of them were standing in their own manure up to their ankles that had not been cleaned in quite some time. Some were in need of medical attention, all of them could not move out of the heat and flies. The stables consist of a shack that is falling down with boards, nails, and garbage lying all around. It is not a safe environment for the horses, nor for the breeding of foals, nor for clients to visit. It was a horrible site for such a high-class hotel. The worst part is that there is no reason why the horses should be forced to live in such awful conditions. They are work horses, and should be treated with dignity as they are forced to help bring money into the hotel. They should be entitled to a nice barn to live in, with clean water to drink, a place to get out of the flies and heat, just as the visitors should enjoy happy steeds to ride, and a pleasant place to visit. I understand the horses do not belong to the hotel and the hotel wishes to ignore all requests to help the horses. However, that is no reason why El Conquistador should not put up appropriate stalls in a barn, a pasture for turnout at night, and enforce the proper care of the horses by the owner and caretakers. The hotel promotes the rides on the beach, and should not be encouraging rides on horses that are not fit to ride due to their dehabilitated state. If the hotel does not want to put up a proper facility for the horses, then I suggest that they get rid of them, tear down the dilapitated building for safety reasons and discontinue the horse rides altogether.

I was very leery about going because of the mixed reviews here, but we went with the proper expectations and were thrilled with the results. There are lots of things you can do to ensure a great stay. But first, let me share with you, the good, the not so good, and the downright ugly. The good: - The \"water park\" is absolutely wonderful. There is a surcharge for it, and personally I'd budget for at least a half day pass every day. It is set right next to the ocean so it feels like being at the beach from a scenery standpoint. The park itself is immaculate, uncrowded, and has plenty of chairs and tubes. The water slides are a lot of fun. There's an easy one, a moderate one, and a scary one. My two boys (ages 11 and 14) loved the scary one the best. The lazy river is beautiful and relaxing. My only beef is that the chairs could be a tad more comfy, but otherwise I LOVED this area of the resort and could spend tons of time there. - The room. We had 3418 and 3419. I thought the rooms were great! We had a breathtaking, almost 180 degree vista of the ocean. The little patio is plenty roomy to sit out and have a drink. There is a TON of clothing storage compared to other hotel rooms I've stayed in. The bathrooms are very spacious. The bathtubs double as showers, but are cleverly sunken into the floor so that when you shower very little water gets spread around. They give you an awesome blowdryer that works FAST. There's a fridge and a makeup area - - just a very well laid out room. The finishes are a notch down from the marble and stuff you'd see at say a Ritz, but frankly, I think they were a lot more friendly for the cleaners to care for and practical. Our room was very clean. - The room rate. We asked for the triple AAA rate which was a significant discount, and no one ever asked us for our triple AAA card . . .so it seems to me that anyone could get this discount. - ice cream parlor/Starbucks - There is an ice cream parlor with Nestles ice cream and a Starbucks in the hotel - - both of which seemed very popular, and we really enjoyed them. - The staff. The staff was uniformly warm, friendly, and helpful with one exception (pool bartender at main pools). - The lap pool. The hotel has three main pools, and one of these is a full sized, beautiful lap pool with lanes. If you like to swim, you can easily get a lane in the morning, and it is beautiful watching the sun rise while you swim. I loved this pool! - The fitness center. I've seen a lot better/bigger/more luxurious fitness centers - - but I enjoyed running there anyway because the Lifefitness equipment was well maintained and state of the art. It probably could stand to be more air conditioned and bigger - - but the views are beautiful, and I still enjoyed working out there. - The golf. We didn't golf this trip, but we were sorry we didn't bring our clubs. The golf course looks breathtakingly beautiful. Probably hard too, but beautiful. The not-so-good: The island beach. As you've probably ascertained, you take a ferry to a private island if you want to go to the beach. The ferry ride is great - - about 15 minutes on a gorgeous catamaran with tons of seating. The island also has TONS of seating and palapas. The beach is pretty, and there is a good restaurant for food. But, the beach is also seated on a dead reef. The snorkeling is non existent as far as we could see. You can book a snorkeling excursion, but snorkeling right off the beach is awful. You definitely NEED water shoes as the bottom of the ocean has tons of dead coral. There aren't big waves at the beach so if you rent boogie boards, they are pretty much useless. The water is very warm and clean for swimming, but my boys were bored pretty quickly. You really had to rent expensive stuff in order to keep them occupied, and personally I'd prefer to hang out at the stunning water park. The computer system at the hotel is terrible. Whenever you go to buy something or get a new key or check in - - anything of that nature - - it seems to take an inordinate amount of time and a zillion key strokes. The drink prices are very high. Frankly, this was the only part of the pricing that I thought was out of line with other resorts. If you want a water or a Coke, you are going to spend too much money. Definitely recommend stocking up on water/Coke outside the hotel if you can. The food prices are high, but I think they are in line with food prices at other resorts. The ugly: The game room for the kids is a huge rip off. They give you one try for $0.50 on games where many locations give multiple tries. The room smelled strongly of vomit. It was just unappealing and a waste of money. DINING: We ate one night at the hotel and three nights outside: Strip House - Same pricing as any high end city steak house. Food was great - - especially do not miss their french fries which are giant spiced steak fries and very yummy. L'Estacion - Directions: Drive to bottom of El Conquistador driveway. Make a right. L'Estacion is no more than a half mile down the road on your left. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Good food reasonably priced. Recommend the pinchas (skewers of meat) and the whole grilled fish (FABULOUS and accompanied by fried plantains that were yummy). Also, I really enjoyed the drinks here - - margarita and an awesome mojiito. The Blue Iguana - This is part of the Farajado Inn. It's kinda tricky to find. Drive down the driveway and make a left. Go straight until you reach Route 195 (right after you pass a big Burger King). Make a left onto 195 at the light. Now, keep your eyes peeled for a sign that reads HOTEL with an arrow pointed to the left. You want to take that left hand turn. It's one of the first lefts you can take. It takes you up a big hill to the Inn. The Blue Iguana has authentic Mexican food, and we really enjoyed it. Highlights were the salsa (order chips and salsa to get it) - - it is delicious! And the carnitas are outstanding!! Everything was quite good except the guacamole . . . The third place we tried was a tapas bar called Tasca Olelelolai. This was my least favorite restaurant in terms of the food, but there were definitely highlights - -like the paella! There were lots of fried items, so kids enjoyed it. Do not get the shrimp tempura. I should have asked more questions about the menu. The atmosphere was lovely though so worth a shot. It is very easy to pass this restaurants/get lost so I suggest asking the concierge for landmarks. The most visible sign faces the other direction from the hotel, and the restaurant is way up high in the building so if you aren't looking up, you'll cruise right by it. The sangria is yummy, but could use more alcohol. Other tips: Rent a car. If you go through Budget you will save enough money to pay for the convenient valet parking. Renting a car means you can buy drinks off property AND eat some dinners off property at a huge savings. The drive from the airport is long and confusing. GPS doesn't work well, but it did get us from the airport to the hotel. We brought our portable one from home. It took a good hour as there's quite a bit of traffic. If you have questions, please feel free to ask. All in all, I loved my vacation - - and won $170 at the blackjack table to boot :).

I'd like to give a 5 star review but I have stayed at some really nice hotels and resorts. The Conquistador is unique and some people will love it and others will not. I'll attempt to break down for you my experience and hopefully it will help you make your decision. The first thing to note is that the hotel is not in San Juan. Fajardo is about 45 minutes away (excluding traffic) and on the eastern Shore of P.R. This is good and bad. It is good if you like to get away from it all. It is bad if you crave nightlife, which San Juan can provide. For me, I like to get away from it all so I enjoyed the remote location. Another major thing to note is that this hotel is not for people who are cheap. It is a remote location and yes, they will nickel and dime you a bit. More like dime and quarter you :) But I can forgive them for this since the room was reasonably priced compared to San Juan hotels and because it isn't close to anything. The hotel lobby is immense and immaculate. Checkin was a breeze (arrived after 11 PM) and service was excellent. The room itself was perfect. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable. The room was clean and had one of the largest bathrooms I've had in a normal room at a resort. Iphone docking station in the radio and flat-screen tv were a nice, modern touch. The location of your room is key as the resort is so large. If you have kids and plan on hitting the water park, ask for a room closer to that area. If you plan to head offsite or spend most of your time at the casino and restaurants, stick with the rooms closest to the main building. I visited the resort's private island on the first full day there. Talk to the front desk to find out what times the ferry runs. It could add some wait time to your trip out to Palomino. The snorkeling is just ok at Palomino although I can't say that I ventured too far around the island. They have a full range of water activities to do there but everything costs money (some resorts, the hobie cats and snorkel gear are free to borrow). Definitely a nice way to kill a day if you sunbathing is your thing. There are plenty of chairs and you don't need to bring towels as they give them to you there. The pool is very nice and since the hotel was dead when I was there, getting chairs. I only ate at the breakfast buffet (excellent), Starbucks, and Blossoms (pretty good teppanyaki, actually). Expect to pay 20-40% more. Something you must do if you stay at this hotel is visit Culebra. It is a very short taxi ride to the ferry and a 40 dollar cab ride to the airport where flights are just 35 dollars each way (15 minute flight versus a 2 hour ferry). Culebra had some of the best beaches I've seen and much better snorkeling than Palomino. Taxis on the island are SUPER cheap. If you like to fish, check with Captain Marcos at 787fishing@gmail.com. He put me on the first tarpon of my life (30 pounds). he launches from Puerto Chico which is pretty close to the resort. Checkout was smooth and the hotel didn't charge me anything unexpected. Parking is not cheap. Valet is 20 a day and self-park is 15. In and out privileges. Below are a few pros and cons: Pros Incredible views Very well maintained Private caribbean island with access to any/all water activities. Romantic Reasonable rates. Cons Far - Factor transportation into the price of your room when you compare Resort fee - I don't believe every hotel in P.R. charges this fee. You should factor this into your cost, as well. Enormous - Getting around takes some time Resort Food is pricey (25 bucks for the breakfast buffet, for example) and local food options are almost non-existant and are only reachable by car. No direct beach access. Must go to the private island for beach. * Also, while Las Casitas is technically listed in tripadvisor as a separate(and higher rated) hotel to book, it is actually 1, 2, and 3 bedroom condo units available for rent that are essentially on the same resort property. * I didn't hit the water park, but everything I heard about it was good", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cWonderful resort..rent a car to explore outside of the resort !

We arrived in San Juan at noon hopped on the hotel shuttle bus and took the 50-60 minute trip to the resort. When we arrived, the staff checked us in and the process took under 5 minutes. We had a garden view room which looked over the tennis courts and golf course and in the distance the rain forest and the Atlantic Ocean. Beautiful view. We had a king size bed in our room. The rooms are European, cosmopolitan in design. Comfortable and CLEAN. The rooms have a hairdryer, and mini fridge. Good size room. We also had a nice terrace. At night we fell asleep to the sound of the coqui frogs chirping. We ate breakfast in Las Brisas. Good food, expensive though. The pools were very clean and we took the funicular to the marina to board the boat for the 7-10 minute ride to Palomino Island. Here are some recommendations so far in this review: 1-Study a map of Puerto Rico (roads etc). This is an island with good roads and signage, don't be afraid to drive it and get off of the resort (it's not Jamaica or Dominican or even Mexico). I would recommend renting a car at the airport and driving to the resort. There are some tricky turns, but if you are up for it give it a try. Otherwise, take the resort transportation and pay attention to the turns and the roads. We rented a car from Enterprise right in the resort, reserved before the trip. We DID NOT pay for parking since we parked in the Enterprise lot. Ask though. Use the car to drive off the resort into Fajardo, we gor breakfast in the morning from a VERY nice bakery, scrambled eggs, coffe and fresh squeezed OJ for 2 people UNDER $20 for the whole check. We went to the grocery store (nicer than the one here at home!) and got beer to stock the fridge and OJ and snacks. Grande or Amigos are good stores. Then we drove into downtown Fajardo, very quaint, we were there Friday after Thanksgiving in the morning. Everyone was so nice we shopped and took in the architecture. Got some nice sports t shirts for my nephews. On Thanksgiving day we ate at La Estacion right near the entrance to the resort. EXCELLENT food and the whole dinner (because it was special holiday fare) came to $25 pp. I was stuffed. One night we drove to old San Juan. I had made reservations at Marmalade (check out the review on TripAdvisor) UNBELIEVABLE the meal and the service and the food. Conde Nast lists this restaurant among the BEST and they are right. I could go on and on about the trip, BOTTOM LINE: Be prepared to pay resort prices--this is not all- inclusive, they have to make a profit SOMEWHERE so it's the food and drink, expect that. If you are used to being waited upon like at all-inclusive resorts in the poverty stricken islands, get over it here, the service is excellent but they don't always have their hands our for a tip after bringing you a drink, like at other resorts or on cruises. This is not some backwards place this is an American territory. This resort will appeal to folks who like to stay on a resort and don't mind paying the prices for that...however Fajardo is a great place to explore, if you are of that nature. This isn't a place where you can't eat certain things or can't drink the water..like I said, this is a clean place not a backwards territory. I would highly recommend renting a car though to take in the island and the local fare. People are so nice, local people. I'd be happy to be a resource to someone who has a question, I'm no big expert. I can't make sweeping judgements about those who have posted disenchanting things about this place, but I don't know how some have arrived at their conclusions. Like I said, this isn't an all-inclusive resort. I asked for a room that was a higher floor and quiet. Also, word to the wise; if you are nice to people they will be nice to you, treat others as you'd like to be treated. I'm a talker and like to get to know others, I have a hard time treating others like servants. This isn't the DR or Jamaica. The employees here take pride in their jobs and are for the most part very warm and personable. Talk to a bar tender, they are a MAsS of information about PR.

By charging $5.50 for a Medalla beer that cost 80 cents just outside the fence, this resort is doing business as if my money means nothing. Cabs are very expensive. and walking to a grocery store or restaurant is out of the question, as the hotel is situated on a coastal bluff behind the golf course. The golf course is a very effective buffer from the surrounding neighborhood, and it virtually imprisons a guest, leaving them no option but to pay inflated prices for average food/beverages. The staff are courteous and helpful although not all are bilingual. My Spanish is poor on every level and it would have been helpful to be more fluent. The main hotel is past it's prime. It's also clear the entire hotel was built with less than qualified craftsmen. For example, the floor in our suite was covered in a fairly nice carpet, but the concrete floor itself was far from level. One had to tread with care as the hollows and ridges created a tripping hazard for ladies in heels. The main entry door to the suite recently had a weather strip installed to prevent dust/geckos and such from coming in. Good thing too, the door wasn't installed particularly well. It wasn't plumb or square. This was representative of the entire resort although the more recent construction appeared to be of a better quality. The over-spray from our tub/shower flooded the lavatory every time someone had a shower. Again, this was a hazard as the floor became quite slick two or three times a day. The scuba from this resort is OK, but pretty expensive given the limited options. The water-park is actually REALLY GOOD! I could potentially spend a week just hanging around there. Palomino Island was OK, although the snorkeling was best on the opposite side of the island and it was a bit challenging to get to. The coral is suffering from too many nutrients, but it's not dead. There's a good variety of tropical fish/turtles etc. but the local scuba operator will get you to better sites. We did a snorkel/sail thing to some small islands to the north of the resort. They anchored quite a way from the reef to protect the coral. Although the visibility was poor because of all the recent rain, by swimming 20 minutes toward the break over the reef I found some very nice coral heads and lots of fish. Pay attention to your bills in the restaurants. Blossoms added a 15% gratuity and a blank space for an added tip; Pretty expensive if you don't catch it. Checkout was fairly straight forward, but again I suggest you review your bill the night before to ensure things like parking are treated appropriately. Some changes were needed on our bill. The golf course appeared to be pretty good for a tropical track. The rates were a little enthusiastic. A twilight rate (after 3:30 PM) of $150.00 plus $55.00 for rental clubs before taxes and supplies left me a bit cold when I figured I'd likely finish in the dark, if at all. There are better values in Puerto Rico.

Our room was located on the end of the building overlooking the waterpark and away from the Funicular, which resulted in extensive walking when going to the main building for breakfast or dinner but was a great location for waterpark use and also to access the boat to Palamino island. Resort staff was extremely attentive and always pleasant. The daily breakfast buffet in Las Brisas was excellent and was included in our room rate. Prices at the resort are a bit high but with the waterpark package, breakfast and airport transfers were included. On two evenings we ate dinner at restaurants outside the resort. We also booked a bio bay trip with Kayaking Puerto Rico and were very impressed with the trip and our guides. My wife, who does not like water where she cannot see the bottom even had a great time once we got the trip started.

It does not have the luxury associated with the Waldorf Astoria but it's pretty good for a Hilton. The property itself is beautiful with great views. But you need to know what you're getting. The hotel is huge with several separate buildings, two of which were closed when we were there. We were first put in the Marina building which requires a funicula to get to from the main areas. That didn't bother us much until it turned out we could hear it rumbling like distant thunder all night long. We switched to the Las Brisas building (which a friendly bellman had told us was his favorite) and were offered a room with a better, more open view (for which we paid an additional $19). As others have pointed out, certain basics like cleanliness are not in top form. In our first room, our bathroom had coffee stains in the sink, and the counters hadn't been cleaned. In the second, my daughter found stains on her sheet. The decor is a little tired, with linoleum instead of marble for the floors. Again, as others notes, the food in the restaurants we ate in was expensive and mediocre at best (although drinks were very good). Based on tripadvisor advice we got a car so we were able to drive to San Juan and Loquillo to eat. It was a schlep, but well worth it. Primarily, we were there for the Golden Door spa and we over-indulged in treatments that were uniformly fabulous. Unlike other's experience, we found the service everywhere in the hotel including the spa to be friendly and helpful. I'd made our appts. by phone from NY and Grace in the spa voluntarily offered a 15% discount. By the time we'd had our full complement of massages and treatments, we were too blissed out to care much about anything else and decided we'd happily come again. Since we'd left the kids at home, we didn't need to avail ourselves of the many pools and water park, but we did note that this would be an excellent place for a family, especially if you wanted to stay in a casita with kitchen facilities.

Walking fast, it took 15 min. from our room (at the far end of the marina, near sea level) to the impressive conference center at the opposite end of the hotel atop the cliff (the distance might be unacceptable for the elderly or young children). This involves stairs (or elevator), a funicular ride up the cliff, a long walk, and another elevator, just to reach the \"ground\" floor of the hotel. We were part of a large meeting occupying 2/3rds of the rooms and most of the conference space. Rooms were listed (negotiated conference rate) at \"only\" $174. But adding resort charge, portage fee, housekeeping fee, etc., it was $215 a night. Self-parking (which we didn't use) is expensive, although a car rented from Enterprise (at either the resort or the airport), parks free. No beach is on the premises, but 100-acre Palomino Island offshore, owned by the resort, is 10 min. by catamaran; it is surrounded by beaches (some \"cloth optional\"), with hiking trails, activities, and a casual restaurant. The catamaran runs every hour (it says every half-hour, but it was deemed \"off-season\" when we stayed). Many shops and activities are on the hotel site: golf course, casino, water park, and several large pools. The El Con literature lists nearly 30 separate eating establishments, including room services and some fancy places in the ritzy Casitas condos, which may not be open to people from the regular resort. Options range from Starbucks (with a morning queue avoiding costly sit-down venues), an ice cream place, and \"David's Cookies\", to trendy and extremely expensive restaurants; several were closed (for breakfast, or just plain closed), but you have many choices if you have a hefty balance on your credit card. We dined at Stingray late one night (they close at 10 pm). It has a pleasant outdoor ambience near the yachts; service was adequate and the food good, but not worth the extreme expense. The cheapest wine was $12 per glass; bottles averaged around $100. Appetizers cost what an entree would at an equivalent mainland restaurant. With no affordable place for a simple meal, we took most lunches and dinners off-site, which requires a long walk from the marina (to a few modest restaurants), at a minimum, and generally a car (it is a mile to the hotel's entrance gate and at least a mile beyond to several restaurants). Breakfast options include a full buffet, which normally costs $25 (plus tax and tip), but reduced for our meeting to \"only\" $19 (plus tax and tip). The omlets were good, the fruit fresh and ripe, and the orange juice good (though not fresh-squeezed on site)...one felt one had to eat a huge breakfast just to \"get your money's worth.\" Our room was on the 3rd floor above the sea, which was 100 feet beyond our balcony. Our room was better than a standard hotel room, with an unusually large bathroom, more than ample closets, a small safe, a mini-frig, a modest flat-screen TV (and DVD player), an iPod dock, a ceiling fan, a small desk, a large couch, a comfortable bed, and an ample outdoor deck...but no coffee-maker. Wireless internet ($15 a day) had the speed of a dial-up modem (why do pricey hotels charge, when internet is free in cheap motels?). (USA Today and the NY Times were supposedly free on-line, but the Times wouldn't load throughout our stay, despite our complaint.) Slow, erratic internet is free in the lobby, where caged parrots were often intolerably loud. The whole resort is air-conditioned like a refrigerator; our room could not be set above 72 deg. The toilet was proficient: be careful your clothing isn't sucked in when you flush. The shower head provided abundant water; the tub's surface was slippery but no rubber mat provided. Outside, coqui frogs chirped at night and iguanas rested in the trees by day. The resort's ambience is luxurious and tropical, but not overly much so. What is over the top is the sheer scale of the place. Despite stunning architecture and plentiful amenities, many things were broken: our telephone and frig had to be replaced and it took a maintenance man with a screwdriver to reset our clock, which was off by 1.5 hours; but maintenance responses were quick. And someone is available 24/7 by dialing \"88\" to answer questions. The funicular broke down at a critical time; the lobby escalator and a critical elevator were broken much of the week. The resort offers mini- or full-size-bus transport to/from San Juan airport, taking about an hour, $75 per person round-trip (water, sodas, and rum are available). You are greeted at the resort with a brief overview, then assigned to a porter who takes you to your room (the latter is mandatory, with portage fee added to your bill...it may be a good thing: we couldn't have found our room on our own). The El Con is part of HiltonHonors. Our dinner experience one evening was disappointing. We returned from Palomino Island to find the marina Bally-hoo bar&grill empty. Returning half-an-hour later, we were told we must wait 30 min. for a table by the water...most of the restaurant was reserved for a big party (later, loud music played into the night). So we went to the fake-Italian poolside restaurant by the lobby. My wife ordered \"The Caprese\", supposedly made of vine-ripened tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil leaves. What came was one plastic tomato, hard bits of mozzarella, and lettuce (not basil). We sent it back. The linguine was ordinary. But the price of our dinner was extraordinary. Needing to depart on a bus tour at 7 a.m., we asked where we could get breakfast beforehand. The Cafe Caribe supposedly opens at 6:30 a.m., but it was still closed at 6:40 a.m. Between coughs into his hand, the cook explained that his cashier hadn't arrived. We escaped that flu-laden scene and had a few pricey things at Starbucks, which was open. Our last dinner, at Blossoms, was pretty good. My wife had crispy duck in orange sauce from the Chinese menu and I selected a combination of sushi and sashimi. Service was professional, not pretentious, and the food was good.

We didn't, but when we explained that we didn't want to pay the $3.12 per day for maid service because we had ants the whole time, even after they sprayed twice, they accused us of having food in our room. Not the typical response I would have expected from a five star resort. By this time we had had enough of the lackluster service, as in we don't care what you think, and said goodbye. We also chose to take the stairs as opposed to the elevator. The lights were out in the hallway between the third and fourth floors. We began asking them to change the lights the night we arrived (10/3), and they were not ever changed and we left on the 11th. It was a little scary and most certainly dangerous. I appreciate hotels leaving a card saying they won't change the sheets every day or towels, if you prefer it that way. We didn't have that card in our room, but our sheets were not changed once while we were there. How do I know? I put a little pen mark on a corner after a couple of days to see if I was wrong. I wasn't. We did get clean towels. There is no microwave, fridge, or coffee maker - unless you ask for them. You are charged $10 per person for bellman service - regardless. You are also charged a daily resort fee equal to the amount of hotel tax each day - averages about $20. So, if you do stay here, use the resort in every way possible, otherwise you really will feel burned. There is a small water park with slides, but it also costs $20 to use it, each time. The resort fee could be for the ferry that takes you to the private island where there is a beach, chairs, towels, and umbrellas - and really cool huge iguanas and roosters and rabbits and horses to ride. What you can't do is walk into the water without water shoes because the coral is really sharp and everywhere. The pools on the property are beautiful and well maintained, but only 3 1/2 feet deep in all of the pools, including the lap pool. Not such a problem, just odd. I drank a beer at the pool, $8 - we paid the same in Japan?!?!?! Did I mention you also have to pay $16 a day to self park your car and maybe get a ride in a club cart from the parking lot to the hotel - or $20 a day for a valet to park the car for you. We did have a good time, but I would never in a million years give this place a five star rating, and my husband had to talk me into the 3 - he liked the ferry ride. They have a lot of people on their payroll, but not many actually working to keep the place up. The floors in the hallways were filthy - always wear shoes, door handles on the stair way doors were almost yanked off, it just doesn't feel like a place that the people who work there give a darn about one way or the other. Waldorf-Astoria/Hilton/whatever - it's just not what it's hyped up to be. One last bit, they have a tacky little survey on your tv, if you need a laugh, check that out too.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cNice weekend\u201d", "Author": "CharyPuertoRico", "ReviewID": "UR46873488", "Content": "I wanted to spend sometime with my children on the weekend and get off the daily routine.

I took the free water taxi (nice) to get to the hotel's Palomino Island just offshore for a relaxing afternoon but once there I paid $14 for a smallish margarita in a plastic Dixie cup (no cash accepted there, only your room card). here's the kicker: it took 45+ minutes to check out for no apparent reason, even though the line was only 4 deep. counter staff casually came and went without actually attending to customers.

As world travelers, I would have to say we've never stayed in a hotel with as many mixed reviews as this one had and as others have expressed, I had concerns before we went. Careful reading of the many detailed previous posts on Tripadvisor about this hotel enabled us to go fully prepared and to have a very good experience overall. I hope to both validate and add to the great information in these previous posts. Since we had read that the hotel restaurants were overpriced and not terrific (true) and the lack of a car would make us largely dependent on these restaurants, we rented a car at the airport. Enterprise is the only rental car agency which has it's own, free, self parking lot at this hotel and this lot is located closest of any parking to the hotel lobby. Parking spaces were never a problem and cost savings over either self or valet parking was significant. Renting a car in PR was also fairly inexpensive; we paid $160 for the full week. Since none of the hotel restaurants offer PR cuisine, having the car enabled us to venture further afield, see more of the Island and try some great recommended restaurants. We did find the Caribe Cafe which is located across from the casino a very acceptable and reasonably priced option for breakfast. Service and food were fine if not somewhat lacking in variety. Early in our stay, we found the Amigo supermarket located close to the hotel and stocked up on snacks and supplies. We had no issues bringing things along in our beach bags on the ferry to Palomino Island and no one checked. We checked into the hotel on a Saturday afternoon well before the 4:00 pm check in time with no wait and had no problem getting upgraded to an ocean front room in the Las Brisas wing which I had requested based on previous reviews. This wing is located within walking distance of the lobby (very convenient if attending a conference in the convention center), is up to date and the floor we were on (5th) was the same floor as the lobby. Las Brisas has two wings and our room (3506) was on the left, north facing side which actually overlooked marina where the kayaks leave for the bio bay. The room had a beautiful view of the ocean beyond. Since this wing did not get the direct sun of the south facing right hand side, we were even able to sit out on the deck despite the warm temperatures. The room was clean, serviced early every day (about 9-10 am)...which was great...and well maintained throughout our stay. We had no issues getting supplies or towels replenished. The only complaint I would state (as others did) was that the bed linens were the most worn I've seen in the hotel in years. Totally unacceptable for a luxury hotel. As described in other posts, the grounds are indeed beautiful. The size of our room was better than many we've stayed in. The bathroom was very large and included a terrific walk in closet with a large dresser.. We were able to store our luggage out of the way and not feel cramped for space. Water pressure was fine in the shower, the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. We never heard other guests. Another distinct advantage of our location in Las Brisas was that wireless actually worked extremely well in this room. Although the cost for internet was the same ripoff as you'd find at other top level hotels, at least it worked. Both my husband and I were able to connect easily every day which most of the other conference participants were relegated to working in the lobby. The main hotel has two beautiful pools which I used on several days when I didn't take the ferry to Palomino Island. The ferry didn't make it's first trip to the island until 9:00 am; it would have been great if they'd run the ferries a little earlier in the day. Still, the island is magnificent. There is plenty of room to spread out, have some solitude, sit in a lounge chair under a tree, rent sailboats, kayaks, etc. As many have said, it's the best part of the resort. Two restaurants were recommended in previous reviews and we found them as good as the reviews described. La Estacion is located just outside the hotel's gates and has wonderful food and service. We both really enjoyed the mofongo, pinchos (skewers of grilled meats) barbequed ribs and especially the cheeseburgers....just great. Tasca is located a short distance away and has a wonderful view of a bay; service is equally good as is the food. We probably went to La Estacion 4 times over the course of the week (closed on Thursdays) and Tasca twice (closed on Monday and Tuesday) . Dining at these two places was both cost effective and enabled us to experience local cuisine. Over the course of the week we hiked in the El Yunque rain forest, did the bio bay kayak trip, toured the Aricebo Radio Telescope along with the spacecraft team my husband is a member of, checked out Ponce; PR's second largest city and drove at least 350 miles around the island...all interesting pursuits. As recommended by others, we reviewed our bill a couple of days before we checked out to make sure there were no erroneous charges which would have been time consuming to correct at checkout. One duplicate charge for internet service was corrected in advance and check out was quick the day we left. This resort does nickle and dime it's guests, in addition to the internet cost, daily housekeeping, a bellman's fee, and resort fees/taxes are all added to the rate which I knew based on previous posts . But staying in a nice, clean and spacious room with a great view, well located to the convention center, not depending on the hotel for meals, having free parking and making the most of the beautiful grounds, pools and Palomino Island made for a good experience overall.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the price\u201d", "Author": "Pheros", "ReviewID": "UR46598481", "Content": "Trapped on campus, the hotel staff uses this excuse to under-serve and ignore you while the restaurants charge you exorbitant rates for mediocre food.

Mr. Perez is a former Drill Instructor for the Army and took time to help me remember what to do. He spent hours refreshing my memory and I am now comfortable with my drill and ceremony.

This resort lived up to everyone of our expectations! We booked a Garden view room to save money and I feel we got much more than we paid for! Though it faced the back \"garden\" part of the hotel, we could actually see part of the ocean from our huge balcony! There is no beach directly located on the resort, but the El Conquistador holds access to it's own private island,only for resort guests. Palomino Island is only a 5 min ferry ride from the resort, it's powder white sand beaches, snorkeling & scuba activities , and cabana boy drink service made this an excellent first day retreat. Before I got there I was a bit bummed to find out that I wouldn't be able to walk straight out to the beach from my hotel, but this island makes it all worth it. Since it is private to El Con only it feels like you are on your own private beach resort. There are just enough people to take care of you, and just as few people to bother you and make you feel like you're at a crowded hotel. There are also scuba and snorkeling excursions you can do right from the island. It was perfect. The second day there we were a bit disappointed it was raining all day, but no worries- we all thought it best to have a spa day at the Golden Door Spa, part of the resort. I enjoyed the Pineapple Body Bliss treatment. One of the lesser expensive full body treatments, i was still able to experience the full luxury of the spa, and relax with a head to toe body scrub and massage. It left me smooth and silky for the rest of my trip. One day we made a trip up to El Yunque Rainforest. Only about a 30 min drive from the resort. What a beautiful place! It was a bit crowded with lots of people on the trails. But we were able to find a secluded waterfall along the way. We had to scale some slippery rocks to get there, but a few bumps ad bruises were well worth it to have that spot all to ourselves. Another excursion that I HIGHLY recommend is the bioluminescent bay tours! We walked down the Fajardo coast from the resort to see if we could hop on to one of the Bio-Bay tours. I had read so much about this natural phenomenon I was so excited to actually experience it for myself. This glowing natural wonder only occurs in 5 remote lagoons in the world! Puerto Rico is host to 3 of them. It was only a 5 min walk from the El Con resort, and once we got there it was easy to find a tour that we could hop on to (there are many ways to make reservations for the tours online, but we took a chance it it was very easy for the 3 of us to squeeze on to one of the trips). Once it's dark enough outside, they begin to take groups of about 10 two person kayaks at a time out to the lagoon. The experience of seeing the glowing water is absolutely breathtaking!!!

My spouse booked the trip on his own and I had many doubts and was apprehensive after having ready so many negative reviews here and on other sites. Our experience is based on two adults on a relaxing retreat on a moderate budget. We booked through a discount travel agency, so we got a very good rate and avoided paying the 14% resort tax because it was included in our package. We opted to rent a car so that we would have more mobility for excursions and meals off resort. After car rental and self parking, the cost of having a car was about $50 more than having taken the shuttle from the airport that the hotel runs (and charges you per-person for). The self parking lot has attendants and a shuttle or golf cart to take you to the main hotel. Sometimes there was a wait but it was usually no more than 10 minutes. In the meantime you can enjoy the views of the golf course, the mountains and El Yunque, and the lighthouse and grounds of the nature preserve Las Cabezas de San Juan. Since we arrived on a Tuesday during the off season, there was a very low occupancy rate and a we were given a free upgrade to an Ocean View room. This was a nice surprise, considering there was a convention going on at the time. Garden View would have been fine, since the grounds are very pretty, but Ocean View was fantastic since you got to see the sunrise over Culebra, Palomino Island and the nearby cays. Different levels of the resort are accessible via the funicular. We found it to be charming and a nice way to take in the views of the property, which ranges from just above sea level to 300 feet above sea level. We stayed on the 6th floor of the La Vista wing of the hotel. This afforded us views of Palomino, the cays of the cordillera, Laguna Grande, and the coastal towns. This was a perfect spot for watching the sunrise. Rooms were spacious and neat, with low modernist furniture. Some furniture was discolored and could use some careful cleaning. Some repairs were also needed in common areas of the hotel guest floors. Some of the issues were simply routine maintenance due to exposure to extreme temperatures and weather variations. Many areas looked to be in the midst of the repair process. A few of the elevators needed attention. One of the panoramic elevators in the las Brisas wing was under repair. Being up so high gave us stunning views of the sea, the full moon and stars, and the wall of rain that would envelop the surrounding islands. It is amazing to watch a storm approach like this. It could be raining ten feet away from where you are standing and you won't get wet until the cloud heads right to you. Water pressure in baths was good, bath drainage was not the best. It is further impeded by the type of in-drain tub stopper that is used in tubs. The force of water from the faucet is enough to partially depress the stopper, making efficient shower drainage difficult. It took me until my last day at the hotel to realize this was the root of the drainage problems. Clothing closets were large with many hangers. I experienced no problems with housekeeping/towel service and was generally pleased by their service to us. The pools are lovely, and when there is sun, the waters are warm all night. Night swimming here is really, really nice. There are no lifeguards, however, and it is swim at own risk. The pools are all fairly shallow, 3'6\" or 1.1 meters in most places. There are several jaccuzzis, a few have ocean views. For night swimming there are no towels or attendants, so no poolside food or beverage service. The waterpark is nice, and has an infinity pool. Guests of las casitas have a private infinity pool just for their use. Guests of El Con only have access to this one (for a fee). The pools and slides were fun, and are scarier than they look if you are not careful. I took a couple of spills in the pool and was pretty banged up the next day. Again, there are no lifeguards, just attendants who occasionally were more interested in text messaging than in overseeing the water park activity, but that is typical for any amusement park. The Marina is being renovated in on area, so there is some construction noise and jackhammering. Since it was low occupancy season, it appears not many guests were staying there. The ferry to Palomino was lovely and it is a fast trip. Posting the departure and arrival times would have been helpful. Palomino Island is very pretty. The water at beachfront immediately near the ferry dock is clear, calm and not rocky. There are some dark patches of seaweed, which was soft like wet grass. You can walk out pretty far and be in up to about 4.5 feet. Swimming areas are cordoned off. The rocky areas of the beach are on the island's southern shore, and what you think are rocks are mostly damaged dead coral. This part of the beach makes from some more interesting snorkeling than comfortable swimming. There are marina and beach activities available through the hotel's marina desk as well as La Casa del Mar Dive center. They had decent prices, pretty competitive considering they are conveniently located at the hotel grounds. Since we were there during the off season, we were affected by a tropical storm. During storms, the Coast Guard regulates which off islands are open/closed. The CG issued a probition on passage to the island and to any of the cays for the last two days we were there. This cancelled our plans for further trips to the beach or on snorkeling excursions. We should have planned better for rainy day activities. In general, restaurants and food were very expensive. Rooms have a bar area and a refrigerator, but no coffee maker, which was annoying. Breakfast on resort is pricey, especially the breakfast buffet at the Las Brisas, which we did not get. Some packages include breakfast. Ours did not. We relied on Starbucks or waited to go off resort. At the end of Avenida Conquistador, on route 3, is El Meson Sandwiches, which serves good breakfast and great coffee. It is a reliable and tasty quick service cafe. Kind of like a diner, but with a more limited menu. For dinners we liked Tasca Ole Lelolai and Pasion por el Fogon in Fajardo, on route 987. We mostly skipped lunch or grabbed a little something from a roadside kiosk. The casino has a preponderance of slot machines. I will leave it at that. In bad/stormy weather, it is closed per government regulation. The Golden Door Spa is very, very nice, and during the off season has daily specials. The niwa/shower and bathing areas were clean and well lit, and the bathing products were luxurious. Tea rooms in the spa were well appointed, and staff was kind, professional and discreet. It is closed on Mondays. Overall this was a great trip. We felt like we were the only ones there most of the time. Business picked up toward the weekend and it was much more busy. El Con staff were friendly and helpful. I'd love to go back and spend more time at the beach and out on the cays.", "Date": "September 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cExcellent renovations, 2nd time back and can't wait to return\u201d", "Author": "esk10024", "ReviewID": "UR39807568", "Content": "I just returned from my 2nd stay at El Conquistador and it was even better this time around. The first time I went there, it was a Wyndham and the rooms were dingy and in need of an upgrade. Regardless of the rooms, El Con is special because it has its own private island and this is the one, if only reason, to return. I did just that and was excited to see that the resort underwent a hundred-something million dollar renovation and I could definitely tell. CHECK-IN / ROOMS / SECURITY: The renovated rooms are now modern, simple, and elegantly designed. The staff was noticeably more attentive and courteous. Upon arrival, the line to check in was long but it is expected as it was a Friday and there were 5 front desk attendants checking in all the guests. I had reserved a single non-smoking king room and when the front desk realized they didn't have this on file, they arranged it so that we not only received a non-smoking king, but it was full ocean view. Our room was by the harbour and I found it to be beneficial because we did go to Palomino Island, the resort's private island, every day that we were there. The first night I was there, I noticed that the ice machine on my floor was broken so I was wandering around looking for another one. I went to another floor and immediately a security guard came up to me and mentioned that he watched me going from ice machine to ice machine and even escorted me and held an additional bag of ice that he insisted on bringing back to my room. It was a nice feeling that for a resort so large, security was able to spot one person out of several thousand. PALOMINO ISLAND: Palomino Island is spectacular and even if the hotel was a Super 8, I would still go back for the island alone. Yes, many people have suggest bringing acqua socks but I found that my flip flops worked just fine. It is about $25 to rent a full snorkel set on Palomino but I suggest purchasing your own prior to your trip. My entire set (mask/snorkel/fins) cost about $30 on Amazon and that's fine for someone like myself that uses it 1-2 times a year. We swam to Palominito, the mini island off of Palomino, a couple times and it is definitely worth it if you want to feel a sense of accomplishment. It's not close but is an enjoyable swim. FOOD: We rented a car from San Juan so we did not eat at the resort for the most part. It is overpriced so we did some light grocery shopping and packed sandwiches when we went to Palomino Island and ate dinner off-site. Palomino Island does have a no food/ no drink policy but during the summer I found it to be lax - no one stopped us from bringing food onto Palomino. I'm assuming that this policy is probably enforced during the peak season. We ate at some wonderful surround restaurants such as La Estacion and Calizo Seafood and the seafood at both restaurants is impeccable. CONS: If there was anything to complain about I would say that the on-site restaurants are overpriced for what they are and the housekeeping was a bit weak. I'm not a huge stickler on this but when we arrived, there was no shampoo or face towels in the room so I had to call the front desk about it. I thought that maybe they didn't provide but it was made clear that they did so these items were immediately brought to my room. My toiletries were not replenished for a few days after my arrival so I had to call the front desk again to bring shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. to my room. I thought that maybe it was an environmental thing but I guess housekeeping isn't that attentive even when you tip well. One last note - the sofa in the rooms is made out of a weird outdoor material so it may not feel suitable for indoors. Perhaps it's because most people are wet when they come back to their rooms? On a whole, El Con is even more pleasurable as a RItz and I can't wait to go back. My suggestions: rent a car, relax on Palomino, bring your own snorkel gear, and just enjoy what the island offers you.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "trinidad", "Title": "\u201cheaven on earth\u201d", "Author": "shopahollic", "ReviewID": "UR39702824", "Content": "its really beautiful.i love coqui waterpark and the coqui frogs make such a cute noise.its cheap for what you get.las brisas breakfast buffet is fantastic.piron and tony are the best servers.palomino is the best beach i have been to i should know i live in trinidad", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phila, PA", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time.\u201d", "Author": "PhilaPhil", "ReviewID": "UR38991931", "Content": "My wife and I along with our two sons (20 & 27) stayed for 5 nights and had a great time.

The golf course is excellent but was being aerated so we only played once. Well worth it but very humid when down in the valleys away from the breeze. The elevations are amazing. The water park is nice - go after 2 p.m., it's half price. Only a few rides, so unless you have young kids, you won't spend more than a few hours any way. The private island beaches are great, but make a reservation for the waverunners before you go out there or you may get shut out. You can't just walk up and rent one. Unless you're an avid snorkeler, take the half day tour on a motorboat rather than the all day on the catamaran. You can walk to the kayaking tour in the bioluminescent bay. Take the early tour, it'll be dark by the time you get to the bay. Otherwise you're kayaking both ways in the dark through a mangrove swamp. You're in the kayak for 2.5 - 3 hours and there are no lights except glowsticks on the kayaks. Pictures don't work, so don't bring a camera unless it's really expensive and takes really low light pictures in which case you probably don't want it in a wet kayak. The boys went ziplining through the rainforest, about 20 minutes away and loved it. The only downside is San Juan is a good hour's drive and the radiotelescope at Arecibo and the caves around there are a good two hour drive. The casino isn't very big and only has a few game tables, but they weren't crowded when we were there. The drinking age is 18, so we had our first legal drink with our youngest son.

The ocean view room we had was incredible - the room they boast is newly remodeled which it is BUT the bathrooms are not! Our bathroom had broken tiles - embedded and worn dirty floor and the wall were in dire need of paint - a definite strike here. You see in other reviews about the high price restaurants - not true - if you have travelled the islands you will know EVERYTHING on islands are more expensive - this place is no different. The average meal came out about $40.00 for two of us - really not bad. Here is where I vent about the below average side of this place - first The Golden Door Spa - Now from one who has been in some of the best spa's in the world - this place cannot hold a candle to them - while very nice there is nothing extraordinary. I took advantage of the spa access and enjoyed a jacuzzi which was very nice and a steam room which seemed slightly neglected. Here is where they fall off the cliff - the first day I went to shower in the ladies shower - of the 4 stalls - 2 doors were broken and stayed open when showing and 3 of them had women's hair stuck all over the wall! I figured maybe they had not had a chance to clean them and would give them a break - on the 3 following days I visited the spa - the same hair was hanging off the walls! They never cleaned the shower stalls! Gross yes! Next strike- the Strip Steak House - we had visited the Blossom Restaurant the night before and nothing could have been better! Great food - Great Service! So we figure try our luck at the Strip House - we saw that they had the PR native dish Mofongo and we were anxious to try it. The place itself seemed nice - good atmosphere. So we asked the waitress about the Mofongo and she told us it was fabulous - so on her recommendation we ordered one seafood and one steak mofongo When it was delivered - the presentation very nice - but the food HORRIBLE! The steak was a pile of meat doused in Mojo and had the texture of shoe leather. The seafood mofongo was horrible as well - the plantains mixed with the way they do their plantain mash turned my stomach. We sent back the steak dish and dug our way through the awful seafood dish as we were hungry. The kicker here - the busy boy saw us send the dish back and snuck over to our table when the waitress left and told us to not judge this PR native dish on how their chef does it - that he has seen how it is cooked and it was nothing like the native dish should be made. He recommended we go to a restaurant a few miles away to try it. It was horrible and no one should ever order this dish they way their chef makes it - it is an insult to the native dish.

I was very apprehensive after so many negative reviews and almost changed our plans because of them. We were very happy that we didnt. I can see where some of the complaints may have possibly come from but I have to say, you would really have to be looking for things to complain about. At least thats my opinion. I am well traveled person and appreciate finer things and have stayed at the top resorts all over the world. Having said that, I was very pleased with the the resort and its amenities. The staff is a little thin overall but the workers they do have are very accommodating and friendly. They should definately do more in the way of night life. We traveled with a 20, 17 and 16year old.At night there was absolutely nothing for them to do. We were surprised the resort never had a live band or music playing. Ther were no teen activities at night at all. Except for the casino and ice cream shop- nothing to do at all after the sun goes down. So -the room, we had a 2 bed room suite in the las Brisas part of the hotel. I recommend this area especially if you dont like to walk far to the main hotel, have small children and like the quite. Our room was beautiful and clean with breathtaking views from every terrace. The cleaning staff could have been better -but over all it was very clean. Turn down service has to be requested at least I had to. But it wasnt what I am accustomed to in the way of nightly service. They just basically give you fresh towels(if requested) and turn down your bed. Other than that(very minor) we loved being in our room and felt very comfortable as it was fresh and clean every day. The resturants- The Italian resturant- dont bother going - it was terrible, I mean really bad. The sauce was like ketchup and the pasta dishes had no taste. The fish was inedible as was the chicken parm. Strip house- was very good. Everyone liked their food. The dishes were nicely prepared and fresh. Blossoms- fun for the family at the Hibachi table- if you like meeting and sitting with other families. Otherwise you can request a private table.The food was nice and they serve sushi as well. Sting ray cafe- At the marina - we also enjoyed. The dishes were flavorful and the resturant was pretty. WHen going to palimino island, you def need water shoes. If you walk to the other side of the island the water is clearer. No one checked our bags or even asked us if we had drinks etc. THe ride over took about 8 mins and was so very enjoyable. We loved going there. The food was pricey and not so good but for beach food, it was ok.You can do water sports, horse back ride or look at the bunnies and iguanas. THe pool areas were all very nice and clean. There was pool service at the lower pool off the main pool. The water park was fun for our 4 year old and the adults did also enjoy the pools and water slides. Half a day begins at 2 and seriously, doing a half day is plenty. We went to the beach in the morning one day tand then to the water park at 2. It was great. On other days we went early and bought full day tickets. But we never stayed a full day. So if your looking to save a little(and it is helpful to try here) I recommend a half day at the water park. The marina village is adorable and off the beaten path. I would not like to stay ther bec. you have to take the finicular every time you want to go the the main hotel, resturants etc. Las Olas look nice but again, you had to take the finicular there and everytime you wanted to go to the main part of the hotel.

I highly recommend renting a car and getting groceries so that you can eat in your room for some of the meals. We actually never ate at the resort restaurants due to so many complaints here about the expense of the food there. We got groceries for breakfast that we ate in our room, we made sandwiches for lunch and took them to Palomino Island with us and then we went to a different restaurant every night in Fajardo for dinner. Dinners in Fajardo ran an average of $50 for 2 adults and 2 kids. There is excellent local \"caribbean\" food a LUquillo Beach and many other places right outside the resort. Palomino Island was by far the best part of the resort. We were able to walk out and snorkel right off the shore. It was gorgeous!!! Definantly bring water shoes as the water is rocky. We also went hiking on the trails at the island which had amazing views. My husband and the kids also kayaked to a small nearby island. As far as parking goes, we loved the valet parking. It was only $5 more per night, which I thought was a steal! We just walked up to get our car each time we wanted to leave and within 3 minutes they had it for us. Service-We thought the service was outstanding. Yes, overall things move slower but we found that to be true throughout all of Puerto Rico, not just at the resort. As Americans, we are just so used to going at a faster pace than they go in Puerto Rico. Everyone at the resort was so friendly and very accomodating. Right when we checked in I asked if it was possible to be upgraded to one of the Marina view rooms rather than a garden view. Sure enough, they upgraded us at no extra charge.

Climbing the waterfall was such a unique experience although the climb to get there and back is long. Bioluminescent Bay is also amazing...just make sure you know how to kayak (I didnt and it was hard!). Old San Juan was very interesting too.

We had an issue with the room phone and the refrigerator, when we called the front desk, they had someone in our room within 10 minutes to address the problem. It was resolved immediately. Remember this hotel is huge, so be prepared to do a lot of walking. Breakfast is expensive ($25 pp), but we got a package that included it and all we had to pay was the gratuity ($14). Go out of the hotel to eat dinner if money is an issue, since that could be expensive as well. The Coqui Water Park was also included in our package, our kids loved the slides, especially because the wait was short. The lazy river was my thing. Palomino island was a beautiful beach, with white sand and clear blue water. Make sure you have sunblock on, especially if you sit on the top floor of the boat that takes you to the island. We didn't have any on, and we got burned and still suffering the consequences of it. I highly recommend the Bio-bay Kayak excursion. We had so much fun, the captain Andres was incredible and so were his associates. Looking forward to doing it again soon. The Conquistador was the highlight of our vacation. Granted we only stayed there for 3 days but well worth it. The rest of our time was spent throughout the island. So please if you are considering staying at the Conquistador, go and judge for yourself. I hope you love it as much as my family and I did.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, D.C.", "Title": "\u201cDon't bother\u201d", "Author": "love2bead", "ReviewID": "UR37507366", "Content": "This was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever had.

We told them that this was not acceptable to us so we waited an hour for a room to become available with two beds.

We did not get a room until 7:30pm. You would think that during this time they would send maintenance over to fix the leak, this did not happen. They did upgrade us to a marina front room that was very nice, exluding the fact that from the balcony there was a stench of garbage. In addition to the poor service upon check in there is a problem with the funicular, it breaks down . At El Conquistador you spend way too much time waiting; the funicular, the ferry to the island (the only beach), the shuttle to the parking lot, just a waste of precious vacation time. Also the resort is in need of repairs. The carpet in the lobby is filthy dirty, there is actually a hole in the wall in the lobby that is open to the air from rotting wood. It is such a shame.

I actually asked her if she knew what the AMEX FHR package was and she said no. I went to eat lunch and came back at 5:30 PM; my room was still not ready (check in time published by the hotel was 4pm). The front desk agent said the room was clean but had not been inspected by a supervisor yet. - I wanted to go to the beach, however was told the hotel does not have a beach, but has a private island you can take a ferry to, only the last ferry to the island left at 3pm. How can a beach resort hotel stop letting people go to their beach at 3pm, when sunset is around 7pm? - The hotel's wireless internet has lots of defects; my room number and name did not match in the internet system. When I called the hotel operator to inquire they said it happens all the time and for me to use a generic login, which they provided. The internet was so slow it reminded me of when dialup internet first became available for your home PC. - I went to eat dinner at Striphouse, in the hotel. The restaurant was empty and was way too dark. The waiter was nice, but you could tell he was not a full-time waiter. There was no bartender and the waiters were making the drinks themselves. - I ordered my food and it came out quickly which was nice. The steak tasted strange, so I barely ate it. I also ordered a glass of wine and when it arrived it smelled and tasted stale, as if the bottle it came from had been opened a week or so ago. I did not drink the wine. The electricity also went out while I was eating. The generator took about 8 seconds to kick in, but the power going out was just another inconvenient surprise. - I left almost all my food and wine without eating it, and the waiter asked me if I wanted dessert, which I declined, but ordered an espresso. The waiter never brought the coffee, but brought me the check. - The next day housekeeping was knocking on my door at 9am despite the privacy sign. - I went to the ferry departure point at about noon to head to the beach. I stood in line for 15 minutes only to find out the guy before me was the last person they let on (boat was full). I waited another 30 minutes at the head of this new line, but the boat didn't come and I was so frustrated I decided to go to the pool. - Upon arrival at the pool, there were too many families with little kids, which is fine, but the parents did not control their kids and it made it inconvenient (not the hotel's fault, I understand). - There was a severe lack of pool servers, I was at the pool for 3 hours and no one asked me if I wanted anything to drink or eat. I would have ordered several beverages and lunch, so this was revenue loss for the hotel. - Upon returning to my room after the pool, my room key didn't work. I walked to the front desk and had to wait 20 minutes in line to have a new key made. The agent told me it didn't work because it was time for me to check out. I told her I had a guaranteed 4pm checkout with my booking, and she also had no idea what AMEX FHR was. - While showering the housekeeper knocked, again with the privacy sign on. When I said to please come back later she said \"you need to check out\" and closed the door. - I went to check out and again waited 20 minutes in line.

The first was on our honeymoon 5 years ago. I think it was a bit better this time around. The resort was owned by Wynndam(sp?) the first time we stayed and now it is owned by Waldorf Astoria. The staff couldn't be nicer! We took advantage of the hotel deal going on for all of PR (I believe) where they give you a $200 credit, a $100 debit card and when you buy 3 nights, you get the 4th free. We also went through NWA's travel company and got an excellent package with airfare! I would highly recommend taking advantage of this offer this year! We had reserved a garden room and, upon check in, had received an up grade to an ocean view by the pools. The entire resort is beautiful! Being on the coast, I think the upkeep is pretty extensive. There were some parts of the resort that may have needed to be repainted, but nothing too severe. The room was nice. It was recently renovated, but needed some upkeep - worn light switches, needed some tile work in the bathroom, worn light fixtures in the bathroom, etc. But it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The best part about this resort is the private island - Palomino island! It's nice to go to a beach where there are only a few (50 or so) people around and it's not crowded. We got there early one day (9:30am) and basically had the beach to ourselves. My husband snorkeled while I lay on the beach under an umbrella and read. It was very relaxing! They have all kinds of water-type things to do on the beach - jet skis, catamarans, snorkel, etc. My only large complaint is the cost of eating at the resort. I understand they want you to pay for the convenience, but it's a little outrageous. We ate at the so-so japanese restaurant at the hibachi grill and our bill was $115 for two of the cheaper dinners, edamame and two beers. It was a lot more expensive than any other japanese restaurant I'v'e been too and it wasn't very good. The Italian restaurant was also pricey, but at least the food was very good. Some cost cutting measures we took this second trip - we rented a car (online before we left home) through Enterprise at the hotel and it was very cheep compared to walking up to the desk and renting a car when you got there. We went to the store (Wal-mart, Kmart, Sam's club, PitUSA, Costco are all near by) and bought water and beer to keep in our room's fridge. They charge about $6 per bottle of beer at the resort and you can get a six pack for about the same price. We ventured outside of the resort for dinner one night. L'estacion was right down the street from the resort (past the resort entrance about 1/4 mile) and I'd read lots of good reviews about the food there. However, we attempted to go there on a Wednesday night and they were closed. Also, the appearance of the outside of the restaurant (I believe all dining is outside too) did not look very nice. Maybe the food makes up for it. We never found out. We ate at Pasion restaurant which is the opposite way from L'estacion in relation to the resort. The car rental staff recommended it for dinner and it was excellent! They have mostly seafood, but some beef and chicken dishes. The service was also great! We also took the bioluminecent kayak tour which was highly recommended by people who had been to the resort. There are about 10 companies that offer the tour and we chose the one with the glass bottom kayaks. I would highly recommend taking this tour! It was $45 per person and the experience was worth the money! We were soaked when the tour was finished. So, make sure you wear clothes and shoes that you don't mind getting wet. There are signs on the way into the resort with phone numbers to call and reserve your spot for the kayak tour, you can look it up online before hand or you can just walk to the public beach which is a short walk down and to the left of the hotel - along the water. We will definitely go back - as long as there is a deal similar to the one we got for this trip.

(A) rent a car instead of paying for the shuttle service. Yes, you have to pay to park at the resort, but not anywhere near what you would pay by taking the shuttle. Plus, guess what, you can drive to other places, like the rain forest, Old San Juan and other beaches, etc. at your leisure. Furthermore, on your drive to the resort, stop at the Walmart or any other of the hundred Walgreens or supermarkets you pass. Buy some zip locks, a loaf of bread, peanut butter and jelly and tunafish for lunches poolside or at the beach. No one checks your back pack or beach bag (it would be a different story if you blatantly brought a cooler filled with food and drinks). Oh yeah, another thing....if you don't want to pay an arm and leg for a beer/cocktail, buy alcohol at the thousand liquor stores you pass on your way to the resort. I had no problem shaking up my own martinis or having a brew. It felt great not to feel like a sucker paying Manhattan prices for a drink! They also have ice machines throughout the resort, so the guy that payed $.75 for a cup of ice is a moron. The mini-fridge is a decent size, so it holds plenty of drinks and food that needs to stay cool. We bought a whole case of water and it lasted us 5 days. Don't be embarrased to drag all this food and drink to your room either, especially if you have kids with you. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Bring your own snorkel gear for the beach so you don't have to pay the exhorbitant rental fee (plus, you'll know it's clean if it's your own stuff). Upon check-in, I asked for a room upgrade and specifed that I wanted to be in the Las Marinas Village because I wanted to be close to the boat that takes you to the beach. The hotel was empty when we went which was still season for Puerto Rico, so obviously there was plenty of rooms available. I think the economy has really affected tourism here. The view from our room was spectacular, overlooking the harbor and Palamino Island. A nice balcony to relax, sip a cocktail and enjoy the view/ocean breezes. If you don't expect to be at the beach too much and feel the tram is a hassle, then stay in the areas located above the tram. The pools are great...at many times throughout our stay, I felt as if we were the only people at the pool! One night we splurged and went to the steakhouse. Yes, it was pricey, but you get what you pay for. I thought it was one of the best steaks I ever had and the atmosphere was very posh and classy. Plus, the view was spectacular and service was top rate. If you want to save a few bucks and try some local flare, take a short walk to a few restaurants past the marina. Just ask anyone for directions if you can't find it. We went at night with another vacationing couple we met and it was safe and well lit. I wouldn't be out there past midnight, but again, I never felt out of place or unsafe. We found this awesome breakfast/bakery/diner on our last day leaving the resort (wish we found it sooner!) It's the first \"sketchy\" neighborhood you drive past on your way out (yes, there are sketchy areas of Puerto Rico). I forget the name of it, but it had diner stools and seemed like a locals place, so we gave it a shot. Food was great and had the local flare we were looking for.

First it was Wyndham, then Luxury Resort Hotels, and now Waldorf Astoria. While the prices went up under this new luxury chain, and new fees were added, the quality has gone WAY down. Last year I wrote a wonderful review for the hotel, which you won't see now. The grounds are still beautiful, the views are of romance book kind, and the options for activities are many, but I was very disappointed. Besides the room rate and tax, now you have to pay an additional 14% resort fee. Which many hotels have and is normally considered acceptable for a resort of this kind. What I don't consider acceptable is that if I'm being charged a 14% resort fee, I expect the amenities to be top notch, and they weren't. On top of that, admission to the water park comes at an additional price. So when you pay for all these extras, the least they could do was offer CLEAN towels WITHOUT holes in them, a clean bathtub (had hairs from previous guest upon our arrival, it was not cleaned when housekeeping went, had to clean it myself), bedsheets without stains and holes in them, no bird poop on the beach and pool chairs/lounges, and a working air conditioner. Oh, and to top it off, we were charged for lunch and drinks we didn't have. I had to make a long line upon check-out to get this corrected. But to their credit, they corrected this quickly and apologized (and another guest without principles had written our room number on the check, so it was a valid confusion). Mind you, I am NOT a complainer. I am one of those people that sees the ray on sunshine in even the worst conditions, so trust me when I say I was very disappointed this time. You can even compare the review I wrote last year with this one, and there is a great difference. So my recommendation? Stay there if you don't mind paying extra for services not provided.

Restaurants in the hotel are mediocre and excessively over-priced (except Cafe Caribe for a quick a la carte breakfast), but thankfully there are plenty of good local places a short drive away into town (if you have a car).

Our room (two queen size beds, by the marina) was plenty spacious for our family, although we spent little time in it. The room was clean, bright and welcoming, and we enjoyed our view of the marina and the ocean. The service ranged from good to excellent -- no bad service experiences here. We received a great deal through CheapCaribbean.com, which helped offset some of the other expenses of our stay. Anyone who has read the reviews or is familiar with resorts should not be surprised at the expense of the meals. Thanks to the refrigerator in our room, we saved money by eating breakfast in the room (or on our patio) every morning. We ate lunch at the resort (usually at the restaurant on Palomino, or at the water park), and ate our dinners out on the island. There is a Wal-Mart and several grocery stores nearby at which you can purchase food items. The island was beautiful. As a parent, I loved the shallow water because I didn't have to worry about my kids as much. Had a great time relaxing while my kids played. You must bring water shoes though; the coral and rocks make it impossible to wade in otherwise. Water shoes on Palomino Island are outrageously priced ($20 to $30); you should bring them from home or stop at a local WalMart or Payless. The horseback rides are outrageously priced so we didn't indulge; lunch was also pricey but that was the only time on those days when we ate at a resort-based restaurant. Two things you must do: hike through El Yunque rainforest and kayak to the bioluminescent bay. It's cheaper to rent a car and drive to El Yunque yourself than Check out the lovely visitor center (with a brief movie about the park); I recommend taking Big Tree Trail to Las Minas falls (and for goodness sake, wear decent walking shoes, not flip-flops or 3-inch espadrilles...no wonder we kept getting asked \"how much further?\" on our way back...it's less than a mile to the waterfall, with plenty of places to stop and rest.) After El Yunque, stop at the kioskos by Luquillo beach for authentic, inexpensive Puerto Rican food. As for the bio-bay...there are only 5 such places in the world...Puerto Rico has 3 of them. We had a wonderful experience with Inland Island Adventures, and it was a great learning opportunity for our children. There are many wonderful places on the island to get authentic Puerto Rican food, including Rosas in Fajardo (not too cheap, but still cheaper than the hotel and much better food). Avoid the Ocean View restaurant in Las Croabas -- overpriced, dirty restaurant with poor service and lousy food. PR is an island that is blessed with great natural beauty. My husband is a native and I have been visiting the island for many years. Yes, there are many parts of the island that are unattractive or rundown -- this is a reflection of the poverty (no money to fix things up) and/or a culture whose tastes and budgets are simply different from the suburban American lifestyles of those of us visiting the resorts. Most parts of the island are not going to be beautifully manicured and freshly painted or well-maintained, unlike the resorts you are mostly likely going to be staying at. Don't let this put you off from exploring the island's natural wonders, historical treasures (like Old San Juan), and other fascinations (like the Arecibo Observatory -- my kids loved it.) Keep an open mind while visiting and remember that you are a guest in their world...you will find that many Puerto Ricans will bend over backwards to ensure that you have a pleasurable stay.", "Date": "June 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cMagnificent, Overpriced Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "BlueSheep718", "ReviewID": "UR33485535", "Content": "El Conquistador sits atop a 300 foot bluff and most of the property overlooks the eastern shores of Puerto Rico. Our honeymoon started with the 60 minute coach ride from the airport to Fajardo, home to the resort. Check-in was quick and easy, and our room was upgraded to an ocean-front room at the marina level. The room was large, with modern design and light, airy colors. The bellman gave us a tour of the room, including a wonderful patio, but the handle to the door fell off in his hands. He called maintenance to fix it, but during the seven days we were there the door was never fixed. We did find a way to open the door, even without the handle, so we were able to enjoy the wonderful breezes during the day and the sounds of the rainforest at night. My wife saw a cockroach in the bathroom on two occasions, but by the time I rushed in to \"save\" her the cockroach had disappeared. The bed was very comfortable and we both slept solidly each night. The private beach at El Conquistador is accessed from a ferry that runs from 9-6 or so each day. We tended to take the first ferry. This gave us a lot of \"alone time\" on the beach, as most people didn't start to arrive until 11AM. The beaches are kept very clean, but I recommend wearing beach shoes, even in the water. The resort has an Enterprise car rental on-property. I recommend going on-line and reserving the car on the web, versus walking up to the counter. You can save yourself a lot of money. El Conquistador has many pools throughout the property, including a water park. The pools are extremely clean, and the water is a perfect temperature. The water park has two flumes, and a tall slide, plus a large pool. All of this is lovely, especially for the kids, but the $20 entry fee is prohibitive, especially if you've already paid thousands to stay at the resort. The food choices at El Conquistador range from grab-and-go counters to high-end restaurants. All of our food was excellent, especially the seafood and the steak. One thing we did do was buy groceries at Wal-Mart (in town). We found the prices of food to be very high across the board. Mostly we used our groceries for breakfast, but lunches would cost $40-60 (for two people) and dinners ranged from $120-250 (for two). El Conquistador offers various tours, including guided tours of El Yunque (rainforest), trips to San Juan, and Bioluminescent Bay. Expect to pay double if you book these through the resort, rather than making your own arrangements. We spent an afternoon at the Golden Door Spa, a full-service spa with treatments for men and women. The facility is extremely clean and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We started with showers and soaking in the (gender separate) hot tubs. Our time included a nice couples massage, then the Mrs had a champagne/chocolate facial while I had a citrus scrub. She claimed the facial was so good she wanted to \"eat it.\" My scrub, while invigorating, would not qualify as edible. We enjoyed the services provided, and purchased some of the cleaners/treatments available in the store downstairs. Again, expect to pay over $100 each for most treatments. We didn't play golf or tennis on the grounds, but were impressed with their beauty and design. I'm not sure of the costs associated with these services, but expect it to be on the high-end. Summary - a peaceful, relaxing, fun, and beautiful honeymoon experience. El Conquistador strikes an excellent balance for couples seeking fun (on-site casino) or privacy (private beach). Just know that a week's worth of amenities, excellent dining, and excursions will probably accumulate an extra $1k-$2k of charges on your room beyond the room rate.", "Date": "June 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "raleigh, nc", "Title": "\u201cbeware of hidden cost and lots of walking\u201d", "Author": "sewven", "ReviewID": "UR33244178", "Content": "This place is very very large.

Facility-wise, we knew what we were getting into, since we had visited the facility many times in the past. We had heard horror stories about the lack of value for the services they charge, and were advised to keep an eye at the tab. However, we weren't ready for this... I'll be the first to say that hotel service in Puerto Rico isn't usually great, and by our standards, the service ran from excellent to fair, depending on the person and the place (s)he served at -it tended to be good, not great. The facility overall is, of course, to die for: a huge 500-acre resort which probably would be a golfer's paradise (I couldn't care less about golf), with its own water park, marina, semi-private island, decent restaurants with good -even excellent- food, and ample rooms. Ours, however, smelled musty, and the balcony hadn't been cleaned -apparently in months. Clean, to the point of maid service leaving a full bottle of cleaning agent in the bathroom, in reach of my 4-yr old, who found it fun to spray the tiles with it... The water park was fun for the children -they wouldn't want to leave. The areas were generally well kept. The food is great. However, the prices are just obscene. Granted, it is a luxury resort, but a $75 breakfast buffet for four or a $42 brunch (three potato chip bags, three hot dogs, a serving of nachos and three soft drinks) is not my idea of value. I could live with that (merely by leaving in the evenings and explore nearby Fajardo), if it wasn't for the many cunning ways the resort would try to extricate money from you. A daily(?) $20 bellhop fee (Daily? Would the bellhop move your bags around the resort each day you stayed?) A $28.16 daily resort fee (claimed to be a tax... which truly wasn't). Three different excuses to charge, either partially or totally, the buffet that was included in our offer (which, of course, front desk didn't know the details for). Even $3.50 for bottled water... which we didn't use at all... I'm now being billed $121 for breakfasts that weren't apparently covered by the third different package offer they're claiming I bought. They either don't have their act together, or are just plain abusing of their patrons. I did ask some of the rank and file employees about why the service isn't as wonderful as the prices demand. Turns out they aren't happy, since management is squeezing the best out of them: to give you an example, apparently some bozo (promptly made an ex-employee soon after this) stole an apple from a buffet table and, as a reprisal, employees can't go to the water park to relax with their families any longer as a benefit. You'd chat with them, and they'd reluctantly tell you that they're being pressured left and right to cut costs and shave on the offerings... literally at the expense of guests.

We went to Puerto Rico pretty much to stay here, and did a few other things along the way. The previous Spring we spent in Costa Rica for LESS money and did MUCH more. Based on a post here I requested an upgrade to the marina area. I think that worked out well, though getting anywhere (Las Brisas for bfx, car, groceries, ice cream) was a bit of a pain since it took about 15min from down there. Rooms were fine except the A/C didn't work in one of ours - not a big deal in April. The last night we were moved to the rooms we really paid for w/o an ocean view - functional, but not as nice in my opinion. Only thing I'd recommend about the Marina rooms is try to get up high as there's a bit of foot traffic. Of note, when you sit on your balcony, you're not listening to the waves. there are no waves! You're looking at the tops of boats, and a bar, then out to the (pretty) ocean and a built up island out there. there is no beach to walk to, you must take a ferry. Unfortunately that ferry does not run exactly on schedule...we ate a ridiculous lunch by the ferry ($14 burger for even the kids) and walked around the other side to the ferry with 5min to spare only to see the ferry already gone and we had to wait an hour (they had more running later in the week when they were busier). The breakfast in our plan at Las Brisas was terrific! but o/w we avoided eating at the hotel as the prices were just too insane. We rented a car and went into town for fast food sadly enough, so I can't comment on the quality. We went to the island twice. Frankly the beach is nothing compared to Florida! Brought snorkel gear but you can't go out very far before the coral makes the water too shallow to swim over. Wanted to rent floats to go over to the tiny island, but didn't have time. Climbed the trails but the kids stepped on cactus that went all the way through their tennies and had to abort. Views are nice, but very exposed and hot even in early April. Fitness center is WAYYY too small for the size of the hotel. People waited in line for a piece of cardio equipment and finally gave up...and that was at 7am! So, it's a nice enough hotel if you're going there anyway for a meeting, but I would recommend against planning a trip around this resort. If you want Caribbean choose another island.

Our room offered a wonderful view but unfortunately the first few days of our vacation the weather was overcast with the threat of rain.

The best (fastest) wireless access is on the benches outside David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ice Cream. Free wireless is available in the lobby with tolerable but not fast transfer rates, but the lobby is often rather noisy (next to the casino, music, and loud parrots caged in the lobby). Many things here generally are not thoughtfully designed, and El Conquistador seems to be much more about appearances than actual substance. If you are not planning to leave the resort (which is rather isolated), you should note that dining here is expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the quality is not bad but also not particularly good. (We did enjoy the salads at the caf\u00c3\u00a9 right next to the main lobby.) Prices are about double what you would pay in the continental U.S. After a few days, I have come to feel taken advantage of by the lack of reasonable dining options. Furthermore, within the resort, the only fruit readily available and not blended into drinks is bananas and the same red and green apples from Washington State. We picked up some fresh mangoes from a roadside stand (car trip required), and they are delicious but not available at El Conquistador. Some things in our room are also poorly designed.

The ride was quite pleasant. The beaches on El Palamino were nice, and many people enjoyed swimming, sunbathing, and drinking at the beach. We explored hiking trails on El Palamino, but the island is rather desolate apart from the beach. In summary, El Conquistador is preoccupied with their bottom line.

(Only real negative was that one night we were kept out by two drunken men yelling in the pool area all night, and security did not shut them up despite two calls. Complained to management the next morning, and problem was solved.) Again, we were there when the resort seemed fairly empty and got a great room and a huge pool and jacuzzi essentially to ourselves, but we did notice that the resort will close various operations (or do maintenance) during those periods. None of that detracted from our visit, and I would definitely come again. When you compare the prices to some of the other luxury resorts, the prices here actually were on the lower side. All that said, I could see things getting frayed when the place is truly packed (e.g., not enough check-in desks, not enough tram capacity, not enough places to eat for breakfast, hard-to-get reservations at the other restaurants, etc.), but a lot of places could be like that during peak season. Based on this visit alone, I would visit again without hesitation, but would look to book outside of the high season. If you rent a car, there are plenty of places within 5 miles of the resort (Walmart, Walgreens, grocery stores, etc.) to stock up on food and provisions, so if you rent one of the Casitas villas, you could really save on meals. Actually, if you had a car (and you can rent one at the Enterprise operation at the resort, which isn't that bad when you consider parking is free when you rent a car), you could really save on excursions to the El Yunque rain forest, Old San Juan, etc., which we did.

This came with $100 resort credit for each of the two rooms we booked, plus several other deals we could use during this stay and future stays at Waldorf Astoria Collection Resorts. Check in was quick and easy after a drive from San Juan airport during rush hour traffic took us almost two hours for what should have been a 45 minute trip. We arrived after 5pm and were the only people at the desk. It took about 10 minutes. We were escorted to our rooms in the Las Vista wing and had beautiful views of the tennis and gold courts. Both rooms were spacious and clean. I had a king and the girls shared a room with two queens right next door. The sitting area in the king room was large enough for all of us to be comfortable. The patios were perfect. The bathrooms were large and the closet was great! I did notice some wear and tear in the bathroom, there was a missing fixture in the tub and some rust where it used to be. The main thing that kept me from giving the resort a perfect score were the sheets. They were old, not dingy, just natty from seeing so many washings. It is not very luxurious getting into a comfortable bed and night, laying on natty sheets. The resort itself is beautiful. Everyone was very helpful and gracious. We rented a car and drove from San Juan. The concierge we helpful every time I visited the desk to ask for a directions, a map or suggestions on things to do. One evening the girls got a little restless and I had no desire to drive to San Juan at night, so the concierge helped us find a nice little bowling alley in a neighboring town we were got free salsa lessons and then had time to bowl! Our other excursions were easy to navigate as well, We spent a day in El Yunque, the rainforest and then spent the afternoon cooling off at Luquillo Beach. We drove up to Old San Juan and then found a nice outlet mall on the way back. Every morning while the girls slept in I explored the resort (decided not to get a spa treatment because I missed a great special the day before), and inevitably ended up at the fabulous pool. The pools are fantastic. Get up early and go before 11am and you will be rewarded with some of the most peaceful relaxing time you can imagine. Take a bottle of water with you because there's no service before then. We also spent a fabulous afternoon on Palomino Island. The ferry ride was quick and easy. I was nervous because I have horrible motion sickness and forgot to take anything before we left the room. But I sat up on the outside deck and was fine for the entire ride. It felt like no more than a 10 minute ride. On the island I found a quiet spot and didn't venture out too far because of all the rocks, shells you had to maneuver before you got to smooth sand. But the girls kayaked and tried out the jet skis. They loved it all. The next day they went to the water park and had a good time there too. The food at the resort is very expensive. Went to Wal-Mart the first night and stocked some basics in the fridge in our rooms. We ate at the cafes for breakfast (kids ate free breakfast as a part of our package) and for late night snacks. We ate fast food when we were out on excursions, made sandwiches in the rooms and we splurged at Blossoms on our last night. We all enjoyed the meal. With the two rooms we had a combined resort credit of $200 that we used to cover the expense of parking for the week (valet parked the first day, self parked the rest of the week), a few in room movies and internet usage and some of our meals/snacks. So all in all, it was not a bad deal at all. I have visited Puerto Rico several times, my brother's wife is from the island. We planned their wedding there and I have traveled and am comfortable with the eastern part of the island from north to south. I have stayed in family homes and small southern towns and in paradores in Fajardo. The El Conquistador Resort is the best, in my opinion, on this part of the island if you are looking for a relaxing vacation at a resort that is very family friendly and has something for adults, teenagers and children. The girls (all 17) made lots of friends (as did I) and the staff took very good care of them. After the first night I had no worries letting them wander around the resort on their own. I would love to come back with my family IF they continue to have specials like the Winter Escape package. I can imagine that I would not feel the same way if I had paid a higher rate for the room and did not have the extras thrown in. They just need to get new linens for the beds and update the bathtub. As it stands, we was a wonderful vacation at a great value!", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plainfield,IL", "Title": "\u201cBest of Both Worlds the El Con was spectacular\u201d", "Author": "MB3448", "ReviewID": "UR30494616", "Content": "Experience a secluded beautiful resort that has real Puerto Rican food at the Las Croabas Park just outside of the marina maybe a quarter mile away.

We were tired of the metropolitan beaches. If you don't want to risk renting a car and driving macho-boriqua-style, then San Juan or Carolina is for you. The first view of el Yunque, the rainforest, and you feel transported. Take a hike if you are in the neighborhood. We briefly strolled along the paved roads, but we had a 4 and a 1 in a stroller, so we cut it short this time. Go hiking on the nature paths. On a clear day, the views are breathtaking. We stayed 3 days this time. That was sufficient. I prefer to move around and see all parts of the island. We also visit frequently the metropolitan area, Ponce, Humacao, Mar Chiquita, Areciebo, and Cabo Rojo. All the beaches and all sides of the island are different. We first stayed at El Con several years ago for a romantic weekend. It was so-so. Now with 2 small children, (4 and 1) and the addition of the water park, we decided to try it again. The property rests on the side of a steep slope with the buildings occupying different level terraces. They have added two buildings on the lower-most levels accessible via the funicular, the same one you take on the way to the ferry to Isla de Palaminito; one barrio half-way down the funicular (ultra-quiet uncrowded pool and jacuzzi and game room) and one at the bottom for the water park patrons.We stayed in a room at the very end of the second level close to the water park. It was clean, quiet, with an ocean view, fridge, and cathedral ceilings. Huge bathroom. Very nice. All new. The walk to the far end of the building was punctuated with sitings of iguanas camoulflaged in the trees (far enough away to be safe, but close enough to spy them). If you don't want to walk, stop here and pick another place. It was quite a hike back to the main lobby, about 10 minutes of constant walking: the full length of the building, the funicular ride to take us to the midway, walking past the row of shops (with slightly desperate shop-keepers spreading thickly the charm to make a sale) then to another elevator to the main level, past more shops and restaurants, past the casino, and then finally the lobby. We knew this going in. We were at the fathest point from the lobby. But it was a pleasant stroll and I had no difficulty pushing a stroller all the way every time. You will have a wonderful view all the way from the funicular and the walk past the shops, plenty to see, like a subliminal encouragement slow your pace. Look at the bromiliads, the iguanas, the shore, Palimino. The water park was the focus of our stay and with 2 small children in tow, you do not get anywhere fast. Plus at that distance from the lobby, you don't see any check-in/check-out traffic, bellboys, luggage, vehicle traffic, or lost tourists. It feels very private. The people chat with you while waiting for the funicular or even just walking the same direction. We felt very safe. The children's pool area was just perfect for our two little ones. One half was less than 3 feet deep and had a mini slide, sprinklers, and little submerged toad stools to climb on. The pool had a beach-like walk-in for toddlers and an infinity edge. The water park is small, 3 or 4 rides, and a lazy river, one slide is tame enough for my just turned 4-year-old to go on (about 50 times!). For PR, this is great! If you want a multitude of massive rides, go to Orlando. The private beach across the bay is only accessible by catamaran - 5 minute ride every 30 minutes from 8AM to 4PM. They have increased the frequency of the catamarans to Palimino Island (their beach). There is a path that winds all around the isla and to the top of the hill where sits an itty-bitty chapel and an arch for exchaning vows. The waterfront of the hotel is a boat dock. There is no swimming allowed there. There are restaurants with waterfront seating, but beware. You are paying for the view. Rent a car and cruise into town for meals (5-7 minute drive). Pollo Tropical is fast and better quality than chain fast food. There are fast-food chains, pizza places, Chinese restaurants, and moderate sit-down places. Plenty to choose from. We have had no problem with the local Mami & Papi restaurants and the food has been delicious and fresh. And two grocery stores right at the end of the road to stock up on anything else.

At first glance (a very short one) - everything seems as it should for a 5-star Waldorf-Asotria mediterranean golf resort. After a 45-minute hotel bus shuttle ($68 round trip fare) from the airport, you finally arrive at the main hotel gate, only to find that the bus keeps going for at least another mile of scenic golf grounds, until you finally reach the main hotel building/check in. As you roll out of the bus onto the roundabout main entrance - the view is impressive. Columns and striped awnings flank a breathtaking view of the very blue ocean framed by colonial terrace overlooking the set of main pools below, with steps leading down to a fountain and terrace bar/restaurant. On the left, the main entrance to the lobby and check in. As we approached check-in, warm staff approach us with smiles and greetings and assuring words of comfort, such as \"welcome to your vacation, let us do all the work for you.\" Lovely! In retrospect, how ironic. I ended up having to do triple work to UNDO all their \"work.\" But more on that later. There was one party to check in in front of me as I got in line, which made me happy. However, I waited in line for almost 20 minutes. There were 3 clerks working. Go figure. Then, the clerk who finally checked me in asked for my credit card - so I give him my Amex (which is what I used to purchase the pre-paid flight/resort package booked through the resort's site). Fine. Then there was a lot of keyboard punching, then a confused look, then more keyboard. 10 minutes later, he gives me the key card and a resort id card, which you need to use everywhere in the resort in order to charge things to your room (they don't take cash pretty much anywhere). Our room was in the Las Brisas wing (my 3-year old daughter and my husband). The room at first was tasteful and lovely. Modern, white, balcony overlooking golf grounds (we took a \"garden view\"). It looked very clean...at first. On closer inspection, the corners of the room appeared a bit worn and \"soiled\" and I caught a glimpse of a few dust bunnies and crumbs on the carpet (not very well vacuumed). An armchair's ottoman also appeared to have some stains, resembling blood - yikes. The bathroom was large, with a closet to boot - but unfortunately, I chose not to use it as it smelled like a soiled damp cloth. Also, the bathtub looked very dirty and not very well cleaned. Mildewy and black crud molded around the hardware fixtures, and again...stains resembling blood on the tub floor...yuck! I immediately called Housekeeping, put on hold for 5 minutes, then got transferred to another line, waited a minute or so, then got transferred again until I finally got to speak with someone. They listened and told me they will send housekeeping up to re-clean it. 15 minutes go by, and I call again, get transferred again, then finally reach the same person who apologized and told me she will call me back. She never did. After 40 minutes, housekeeping finally came, scrubbed (at least got the bloody stains out, but not the other mildewy crap), plonked a damp yellowing tub mat over the whole tub, and called it a day. 5-Star resort? The pools were standard, fine. The beach was nice, but very \"reefy\" - water stays ankle-high all around Palomino island, not a \"swimming\" kind of beach. Also, quite rocky so wear your crocs. The ferry ride was about 10 min, but you have to wait quite a bit for it - so you need to count in a travel time of about 30 mins to get there. There were a lot of activities there - snorkeling, scuba trips, equip rentals - all at dear prices, of course. No shovels and pails for the kids at the very least? $25 for a lame little plastic set you can get at CVS for $5. Coqui Water Park - $20 per person for what was advertised as THE water park to go to. Basically, it was 3 \"slides\" and some inner tubes thrown into a \"river\" like pool. It was fun, but you definitely don't spend an entire day there. The drinks were all tropical and fruity. Where was the wine selection? 5-Star resort boasting 20 restaurants, and no wine? One pool bartender however \"dug up\" a bottle somewhere and it was horrible. We ate at the resort the first night, at their outdoor terrace pizzeria. Wasn't bad, wasn't good. Thin-crust NY pizza? Not even close. Boom, $25 a pop (personal size). Caeser salad. Bland, and more bland. Breakfast buffet in the morning, nice restaurant, but nothing beyond a free buffet at a Marriott Courtyard - $25 a person. They also told me I was not allowed to sign to my room upon presenting them with my resort \"ID\" card, and did not know the reason why. I had to go all the way to the front desk to inquire about this. The person who helped me informed me that there were 2 credit card numbers attached to my room and they did not know which one to use, so they just decided to \"block\" the bill to room service. 2 credit cards? How did that happen? So I inform them to use the Amex I gave them, so she proceeded to do some key punching and assured me it was taken care of. Confused, but eager to not drag out the issue, I accepted and headed back to my family. 5-star efficient service? Highly questionable. We also tried the beach island's eatery, where we had a $20 burger (ok) and a iceberg lettuce-only greek salad and a couple beverages somehow totaling over $60. The only other place we ate at was down at the marina where I ate a stale $14 chicken wrap - bland bland bland - slapped together and was 90% wrap, and hardly anything inside. We soon began to feel claustrophobic in terms of food options. One can't just stroll out of the resort either, we were literally \"stuck on campus.\" (That mile-long drive from the gate to the hotel buildings was probably intentional - to keep guests in so they will have to eat and pay for the resort food!) We finally left, and took a van taxi to go out of the resort for our dinners - $20 each way (for a less than 5 minute drive) for our party of three. Literally 3-5 minutes outside of the resort were restaurants, 3 of which we ended up trying. The food outside of the resort in general was - SO delicious! We ate at L'Estacion, Calizo and Pasion por el Fogon - all three were amazing! Fresh local fish and produce, amazing flavors with culinary sophistication - were they really so good, or were we just SO desperate from all the resort food? The ribs at L'Estacion, the mofongo and the fresh paella at Calizo, and the fresh grilled whole red snapper at Pasion por el Fogon - all excellent! It dawned on me that there was nothing fresh about the food at the resort. Puerto Rico has such a wealth of flavors and fresh produce and sea life - a culinary dream - I just couldn't understand why none it was included in the menus at the resort. A shame, really. It was sort of like finding yourself on this beautiful mediterranean island, but your taste buds were stuck in a TGI Fridays. 5-Star resort? On our last night, we go back to our room after a nice evening out at Pasion por el Fogon, full, tired and content. My daughter half asleep on my husband's shoulder, and all of us eager to get back to our room to put her down. What do we find? Our card keys don't work. Both of them. So I shlep back all the way to the main lobby and wait to speak to a front desk clerk. My poor husband stays by our room with my sleeping daughter. The woman who helped me this time was all confused as to why this is happening. Again, it was a credit card issue. I told her that I kept telling them to get rid of any other credit card numbers on my account and just to use my Amex - how many times do I have to repeat this information (I even called my credit card and was reassured that my account was fine and there shouldn't be any problems, etc). I didn't even recognize the other Mastercard credit card number they told me was on my account! How is it they just - without informing the guest first - BLOCK the guest from entering their own room - with all their possessions in it - and yet cannot even explain to the guest why?!! Infuriating! I also started to worry - if they can't even keep their account info straight, am I looking at a near future of time-consuming sorting out of issues regarding billing, etc and other errors? 5-star? Meanwhile, my daughter so needs to sleep! Finally, after what seemed like an eternity and an embarrassing \"scene\" - I was assured that my keys will work. Which they didn't. Can you believe this? Somehow or other, because i was just so beyond infuriated, my husband got someone to let us in, and guess what? Our in-room safe couldn not be opened (with our passports and cash and cards inside). Another bout of sorting out with the front desk and waiting time for some guy to come up and open it for us. And it doesn't even stop there. Our guaranteed wake-up call for 5:30am - didn't happen. Thank God I somehow woke up just in the nick of time. You would think after all this trouble they would at least ensure that we get at least a wake-up call. Unbelievable. So, to sum it all up, this resort should be rated as 3-star at the most. The decision one makes between a 4-star or a 5-star is crucial in regards to the little details, such as service, cleanliness, food. It's these very things that make one decide to go one star up. If you don't get what that one extra star promises you - why go there? Why not just stay at the 4-star? Or the 3-star, in this case? Puerto Rico is beautiful, and we would definitely go back there - but definitely never ever would we step foot in this place again. I have no problems with mediocre food - at a 3-star hotel. I have no problems with even less than desirable service - at a 3-star hotel. I would be perfectly understanding with the wear and tear and a dust bunny or two - at a 3-star hotel. BUT NOT at a hotel that boasts 5-stars. Next time, we would stay closer to Old San Juan, at a resort with a couple pools and easy access to LEAVE \"campus\" and enjoy the local culture and local culinary delights.

Had I not booked this package, many of the included items were not worth purchasing/including at a la carte prices. First, I really tried to enjoy the resort in spite of some negative reviews. The views were amazing since the resort was perched on a hillside and I stayed at the Marina (bottom of the funicular & where you catch the ferry to Palomino Island). My room 1324, was well appointed and everything seemed fine, except I noticed a damp, musty smell on my bed that never went away and was a distraction when sleeping. The staff did do a good job cleaning the room however. Second, my best friend and his family surprised me and showed up to help celebrate my birthday...that was one of the most special moments. They stayed in the Las Olas part of the resort which was near our room. However, this part of the resort needs a tremendous make-over. The carpet was noticeably worn down (how is this a luxury resort?) and there is no elevator here. Luggage and strollers cannot easily be negotiated up these narrow steps. My friend and his wife are both medical doctors and have traveled to many luxury resorts and I felt embarrassed they had to stay there. They were in Room 2344. The only saving grace was their area had it's own swimming pool and we were able to use it pretty much to ourselves, unlike the main pool area which is crowded. The ferry was efficient and Palomino Island was a pleasure to be on...unlike another reviewer, I liked the lack of waves so my toddler daughter can play in the ocean. The food was...uninspired. The only restaurant I felt was good, was Stingray, which had pretty high prices. I knew the food would expensive, but I had hoped there would be some decent taste to the dishes at the other restaurants. Last night we went to Ritchie's Cafe in Rio Grande (about a 20 minute drive) and the food was delicious, reasonably priced, and the view was spectacular. We had a party of 5 adults, 2 kids, 2 toddlers and a baby for this dinner and the bill came to be just under $300 (incl gratuities). This is the only time I did not feel ripped off from eating. I highly recommend this restaurant because the waiters did a fantastic job of taking care of us. At the end of the dinner, the waiter offered to have my little daughter's utensils and dish cleaned (we bring our own because it's plastic). Now that is service! Previous reviewers may describe this resort as being in disrepair, but I think that is too harsh. Professionally, I know about capital improvements and building maintenance, so I can see when things have not been properly maintained. I personally witnessed staff cleaning, dusting and making repairs, however, these are things I noticed: 1. Elevators seemed always to be out of service. Most elevator banks on the resort was in pairs and there were many instances 1 of the pair of elevators would be out of service and remain that way for a day or two. With so many people, crowds and wait times are unacceptable for a luxury resort. Where I work, elevator technicians would respond the same day and would never be out of service more than a day. I don't remember if I read a previous post about the resort fee, but my friend just checked out and was hit with a $47.50/day resort fee. I am positive I was not told this on check-in and it was not on my reservation confirmation. I check out tomorrow and will see if I am charged this also. I enjoyed my trip because I celebrated a milestone in my life with people I love.

The resort is supposed to have high speed internet access in the rooms (for a fee of $14.95 for 24 hours). The first three days the internet did not work in the room so I had to go to the Business Center. The issue, though, was the lack of response from the staff. First, they tried to say that I was the only having a problem (implying that it was my computer). I was there with a conference of 200 people so was able to ask others if they had problems with access in the rooms. All of them said yes, regardless of where they were staying within the hotel. Then, at our request, we asked if we could try the access in other rooms. They finally agreed so my husband spent two hours running around rooms with my laptop, looking for access. Nothing. Then one staff person recommended that I come to the lobby to use the \"free\" access. First, I had already tried that and the signal was not working in the lobby either. Second, I work late at night so was not thrilled with the idea of setting up laptop, mouse, and working papers in the lobby at midnight. It was a big mess for those first few days, and an unnecessary aggravation. We were finally told by a staff person that the internet access has been an ongoing issue for awhile and that the hotel is in the process of changing internet providers/tech support.

I decided to give it another try because of the new waterpark that I knew the kids would love. Here is the lowdown: PROS: The waterpark is indeed a ton of fun that the kids (ranging from ages 4 to 11) loved the views are gorgeous the food in restaurants for dinner is very good albeit expensive our rooms in the Las Olas section happened to be the only two with direct access to the pool (rooms 2231 and 2230) - which was great as you could just run down from the balcony, my husband could fix drinks in the room and bring them down for a pre-dinner cocktail hour the water at Palomino is wonderful and clear CONS: I was thinking to myself how people complain about the cable car for nothing for the first 3 days when everything was running smoothly. when one cable car broke down for 1 1/2 days it was quite annoying standing there waiting for the one car running filled with people. The ferry to Palomino can be a 45 min ordeal (it is NOT 8 minutes!) You have to watch every charge on the bill - we were overcharged, double charged, etc multiple times. And yes, a hot dog should not cost $10. A chicken sandwich for $12 had a chicken patty that was half the size of the bun - my husband made them remake it.

We went for 5 days. We're in our late 20's, and we wanted a more relaxed vacation therefor passing up the San Juan hotels. Well, this is what we got!!! Ive stayed at some pretty amazing places before- and I am a exceedingly picky. Especially when we were told this is one of the most expensive places to stay in PR. It was worth every penny, and exceeded my expectations. It was clean, and HUGE!!!! The property was pristine, the scenery was beautiful. The beach was perfect. For the most part, the food was good. The only COMPLAINTS, which were minor were the following: The so-called \"italian\" place.... was horrible. But then again, coming from NY, we KNOW what italian food should be. The sauce was bright RED, and had no flavor. bleh. Otherwise- the service was excellent. There was no local flavor-type restaurants in the hotel. I mean, they have a wide selection, but nothing \"Puerto Rican\" in style..... The front desk service, and Concierge could have been nicer. Some were helpful, and nice, but more often then not, we encountered women who were, well, they couldnt be bothered with us. The first room we were given was definitely for someone who had a medical disability. The shower was level with the rest of the bathroom- and after the 3 of us showered, there was water flooding to the toilet bowl. We complained, and were given a new room asap. Much nicer. They should really pay more attention to their clientele. The spa- the hot tub in the women's locker room area was tepid at best. On the colder side. LEAVING THE RESORT/EXCURSIONS: We did drive to San Juan/Old San Juan/Condado a few nights, just to see what the nightife was like when we didnt feel like hanging out at the pool bar, or the other bar by the restaurants upstairs. It was about 45 mins away. Not a bad drive. We were thankful we rented a car so we can sightsee. I highly recommend renting a car if you are going to stay at the Conquistador. I found Enterprise to be cheaper than most of the places. We went to the rainforest one day when it was overcast in the morning, it was so beautiful. We were supposed to do the Biobay kayaking tour at night, but I messed up the scheduling- and we ended up missing it! oops! Next time we definitely want to go the outer island- Vieques and/or Culebra. They look amazing.... oh well. Theres a million reasons to return to PR, and especially to El Con. WHO THIS RESORT IS GOOD FOR: Its a great place for families with children- because its so huge, and they have a waterpark. We were actually concerned we would be inundated with children running around us- but honestly, its so spacious, we really didnt have a problem. PLUS there is a pool at the 2nd level on the way down to the Marina, which is usually empty! It would also be a great place for couples- its soooo romantic. PRICES: Ive read many of reviews complaining about the prices of food and drinks. I guess they were pricey. I think being from Long Island, and NYC, were more used to higher prices. For us, they were more normal than anything. Like 12-15 bucks for a cocktail kind of thing. Resort prices basically. SPA: We received massages one day as well. I got the Golden Door massage, 80 mins. It was THE BEST massage Ive ever had. And I use spas as much as I can. We also took a yoga class. No complaints about that either. The gym was great aswell. Fairly up-to-date machines. Within the last 5 years altleast. It was empty when I went, so it was good. They give you towels. There is also a juice bar, which makes great fruit-smoothies. All in all, we/I would go back in a heartbeat! I didnt want to leave!!!

I know that I use this site all the time to get people's opinions and ideas - so here goes: Stayed for four nights, April 2-5. HOTEL SHUTTLE SERVICE TO AND FROM AIRPORT: Must sign up for this ahead of time. $68 per person round trip (taxis are at least as expensive, so this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a bad deal). Someone was waiting at the luggage pickup area with an El Con sign. You must collect your luggage and then walk with your luggage about a block to the shuttle bus. We only had two bags plus two carry ons, but if you had more luggage, you would probably want to get a porter. At the shuttle stop, they check off your name, tag your luggage, and for us, within about 15 minutes we left. The ride is about 45-60 minutes depending on traffic conditions. Upon arrival, you are instructed to go inside and check-in and then come back and retrieve your luggage (in our case, a person from the bell staff took us to our room.) CHECK-IN: We arrived on a Thursday and the line was very short. However, we were in the first seats on the bus, so we were pretty much the first to make it inside to check in. ROOMS: I had originally booked a room in the Las Olas area. I wanted this area because it is between the top level and the marina level and I figured that it would be better to be in between going to the beach and going to the rental car, etc. However, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a connecting room as they all too often create a noise problem. I was told that all the Las Olas rooms were connecting and she recommended the Las Brias section. Well, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know where that was, so for a moment, I just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to do. She said that they were recently renovated rooms and that I would still have an ocean view with a balcony with chairs and a table. She also said they were much nicer rooms. So, I agreed. I AM SO GLAD THAT I AGREED TO THAT CHANGE, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my opinion why: The Las Olas rooms are actually just about down to the marina level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can walk up and down to that level via stairs, if you want to. The Las Brias rooms are pretty much in the main building \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just a short walk to the lobby, restaurants, pools, funicular, and most importantly to our rental car. It was so much better to me to be where we could easily get to things. HOWEVER, just as importantly, was the balcony situation. We really like to spend time sitting out on a balcony. The views from the Las Brias building on the ocean side, were just amazing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we were on the second floor, not the top floor. Plus we like as much privacy as can be possible given the fact that you are surrounded by rooms. The balconies in this area had solid walls completely to the top and out to the front on both sides. I could clearly see the balconies in the Las Olas section, and they were not completely private. They had walls that were completely to the top in the back and then ended up about half way up in the front. I would not have liked that. Worse yet were the balconies on the marina level. I think these are the expensive rooms, but these balconies only had railings around each balcony. You might as well be sitting with the people next to you, because they are only a few feet away and in full view. Our room was large and kept clean. I called about the refrigerator not being cold at all, and when someone didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come in 30 minutes, I received a call asking if someone had been there and when I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd someone arrived within 5 minutes. Plus I received another call asking if the situation was resolved to my satisfaction. It turns out these aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really refrigerators so to speak, but electric coolers. However, as the time went on, for some reason it seemed to get much colder. Perhaps it had just been turned on before we arrived. There was no coffee maker in our room. I knew this up front and brought a hot pot and luckily my husband likes instant coffee so that is what he does. RENTAL CAR: There is an Enterprise station in the lobby. It costs about $20 more a day to rent there rather than off site, but then you have to get off site, etc. I reserved a medium size car ahead of time and paid $44 a day for all costs. Also, if you rent a car from them, you can park in their parking spaces for free. If you bring in your car or another rental car, you will pay $15 a day minimum for parking. And all the parking is pretty much in the same area. It is about a 4-5 minute walk from the lot to the lobby. DRIVING IN THE AREA: If you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been to Puerto Rico, just be aware that we noticed two very definite things about driving habits there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stop (pare) signs are pretty much ignored \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most people didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even slow down. Many people do not drive in their own lane and make turns from the wrong lane. Getting around the area is easy, however. Enterprise gives you a very detailed map. We used the car to go to Walmart and the grocery stores for food, case of water, beer, etc. The Walmart, KMart, food stores and many restaurants are just 10 minutes from El Con. FOOD: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t purchase the food plan. We knew up front that the food is very expensive. We did decide one morning to go to the breakfast buffet and that was a mistake. It really was a poor buffet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fruit choices limited, etc. It just certainly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything that I would go back to twice. I realized later that the casual restaurant in the Las Brias area (across from the casino) served a sit down breakfast for a fairly reasonable price. We did get a cheeseburger/fries from that restaurant one night and it was about $16. It was a large cheeseburger and quite good. I know that most people that post have a fit about the price of the food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a Holiday Inn. Most places to which I have traveled charge a lot for food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Atlantis, comes to mind. I think a beer was about $6 and a larger bottle of water was $4. That is one reason we rented a car, so we could stock up and avoid paying the exhorbitant food prices. We figured that with the cost of the car rental, we saved about $75 additional by shopping and eating at other places. FUNICULAR: The funicular takes you from the main level to the marina level. They just keep going up and down, so the wait is never long. I thought it was kind of a neat thing and I went down to the marina level 2-3 times just to walk around. Two days that we were there, the funicular wasn't stopping at the Las Olas section - made me even happier that I wasn't there - that would have been a major inconvenience. PALOMINO ISLAND: El Con\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private island is reached by boat. They had one boat operating while we were there. It left every 30 minutes and the ride is about 10 minutes. The boats are large. The island has LOTS of seating and is a beautiful setting. We went to snorkel, and it was the worst snorkeling experience we have ever had. Actually, we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even snorkel as the water level never went above 2\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unless you probably walked out several 100 yards. It was ridiculous. We gave up and left. I saw people in the roped off swimming area standing way out and the water was only up to their knees. So, we never went back. They have a towel station as soon as you get off the boat. POOLS: If you like pools, then you should like El Con. Las Brias is next to two large pool areas. We had no trouble finding a lounge in the shade in the one pool. The other pool might have been for adults, saw no kids there, but all lounges were in the sun except for the shaded section that was roped off, for some reason. We could see the Las Olas pool from our balcony, and I never saw more than 3-4 people in it. So, you could always go to that pool area if you want something not as crowded and don't care about a pool bar. We had a small soft sided cooler that we used to take water/beer when we went to the pools. GOLF/TENNIS: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do either, but the course and courts looked very well maintained. CASINO: Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go in, but walked by it every time we went to the car. Nice enough size for this resort. FITNESS: I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go the spa area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c costs each day just to get in and I never pay for massages, etc., that I regularly get at home. I do exercise, however. There is a SMALL free fitness area in the Las Brias section on the walkway to the funicular. It is pretty pathetic, but I just wanted to use free weights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and they had plenty and a small area for me to work out in. They had maybe about 10 cardio machines but they were all in use while I was there and I noticed that 2-3 people were waiting. No one wanted to pay $25 a day to use equipment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t either. SERVICE: I found everyone that I came in contact with to be very friendly and helpful. The front desk people didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem quite as friendly, but then again, they often have to put up with a lot of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd all day long. Overall, I thought El Con was a beautiful setting and a lot of fun to explore. If you do your research before your trip, you can find lots of excursions to do on your own. We had a snorkeling day sail set that was cancelled the day before our trip due to the illness of the captain. That was our only disappointment and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother trying to find a substitute because I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get stuck on a boat with 40 other people. The only decent snorkeling is definitely via boat, from what I gather. If you are looking to get a way on a romantic adult getaway, this probably isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your place unless you plan carefully so you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there during possible school breaks. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about whether kids were there or not, but I could tell as it closer to Easter week, that kids were coming in by the droves. I can see how one could feel completely surrounded and overrun by noise and kids. However, if you have kids, they will probably love it.

Now I know what he means. The check-in line that took 20 minutes was a preview of the week - lines for breakfast, wait for the boat to Palamino Island (40 minutes because only 1 was running) and the worst was the funicular which wasn't working properly for 2 days to the Las Olas section of the hotel where we were staying. This meant that we had to walk down 4 flights of steps to get to the Marina area, and take the express funicular up to the main level or conversely, take the express to the Marina and walk up 4 flights to get to our room. Not so much a problem in bathing suits, but my wife didn't find it very enjoyable dressed in heels for dinner. The carpets in Las Olas were worn and dirty. The walls had the marks from suitcases on them. In our walk-in closet area there was a bare metal bar with rusty screws left in the wall where a picture or mirror had once hung but was never replaced. There was a metal strip coming off the entrance door which was never repaired even though it was quite apparent. Some nights we had turn-down service, some nights we didn't. None of the things are a big deal, but you don't find them in a true 5-star hotel. \"Tired\" best describes the entire Las Olas area. The thing that annoyed me the most was the food prices. I realize that whether you pay less for your room and more for the food, or the other way around the total cost is the same, but it was annoying to pay $10 for a hot dog or $14 for a cheeseburger. On the island, a mediocre lunch for 3, served in plastic dishes, cost $75. At dinner (which was very good at Sting Ray), there wasn't a single bottle of wine under $45 dollars (even in the lower priced pizza restaurant it was $42).. I know these wines and the mark-up was not double, but triple. Perhaps if we stayed at the upper level, our impression would have been different. The area leading to the Golden Door Spa area was beautifully landscaped but that only served to show the contrast that existed there and at the Las Olas area where we were given a room.

While there weren't many people in line, it took way too long. One of the clerks was talking with a friend instead of helping customers. Then, when it was my turn, they told me they didn't have a room with two queen beds--even though I reserved this specifically.

Everything was white and drab. Perhaps other rooms were nicer--mine wasn't extraordinary in any way. 3. My final day, I found mites (little red bugs) in the bed.

An example of what I'm talking about is - they want to charge you $7.00 for bottled water in your room, one word for that - \"ridiculous\". We spent $58.00 for lunch and all we had were fish and chips and a grilled chicken sandwich. We ordered 2 pina coladas with extra rum and were charged $29.00. The resort has 15 restaurants and not one of them serves the local cuisine; unexceptable. The on site water park is great, but don't bother with that because its not complimentary. Instead go to their private island - Palomino Island and enjoy the free swimming. I strongly suggest you bring your own snorkel gear, you will end up paying for the cost of 2 sets of snorkel gear for the price it costs to rent one.

We had the water park package which included the buffett breakfast. The Breakfast was 25 each and after tax tip and gratuitey for three it came to 91.00.

The food was awful and we had to spray our selves wtih OFF which they did provide. The mosquitoes were bad. The Bill was 63.00 for gumbo, pasta and a shrimp and three cokes. Were went on a shopping and Bacardi Rum factory tour through the hotel. They packed 11 people into a van for a 1hr ride into San Juan. For $50 each it should have been a nice motor coach. When we got to San Juan we were told we were on our own for the rum factory tour. We were not changed for the tour to the factory but we went on our own. Skip the rum factory tour. You can by Rum at the airport on your way home and it is cheaper than the factory. When you buy it at the airport you can then bring it on the plane with you. If you buy it at the factory you have to put in your luggage. We just felt so ripped off every time we went to dinner. If they are going to charge alot for food make it the best and not mediocre.

Breakfast was over $100 for 2 adults and 2 kids. Ate dinner in 2 different hotel restaurants. Both times it took over an hour for our meal. It was so bad that another patron came over to us and apologized for getting his meal first--and then talked to the manager on our behalf. When the bill came for our cold and poorly cooked Chinese dinner, the service charge was still included. My husband talked to the manager who told us that there were Chinese cooks and he was Puerto Rican--all we heard were excuses, and no offer to make it right. I complained to the night manager, who expressed concern and then to the Head of Food and Beverage the next day who did not seem concerned. The response of the hotel was nothing but excuses and no real effort to make up for the terrible experiences. The whole week seemed like a very good hotel was cutting corners--the hot tubs were tepid at best (management did not seen concerned there either). The rooms were nice, the front desk was great and the concierge did a good job. Otherwise, it was hard to get employees' attention as they spent most of their time chatting in groups or text messaging. Since I had 5 Puerto Rican friends tell me that this was a super hotel, I can only assume that something has changed. I can only say that the overall service and leadership was terrible. We rode to the airport with several other couples who had similar experiences at other restaurants in the hotel. The hotel is about 55 miles from San Juan--a $78 shuttle ride arranged through the hotel. Nothing cheaper with other agencies. If you don't want to be a captive at the resort, car rental is $50 a day or so. No real place to eat in Fajardo, so taking a cab anywhere will add up in a hurry. The beach is a 10 min shuttle boat ride away (private island owned by hotel). Rental of an inner tube float was $11 day, jet ski was $110 an hour, a mojito was $9. Shuttle ran every half hour.

Prior to our arrival, it was rather easy to add our HHonors number after the switch from LXR to Hilton. The reservation showed up on our HHonors reservation portfolio and the requests / information carried over flawlessly. We booked a Garden View room, but were happy to learn before arriving it had been upgraded first to a La Vista Ocean View and then to a Las Brisas Ocean View. We arrived at the hotel at approximately 1:30AM on Thursday nigh / Friday morning. We were greeted at the front desk by a young woman with a strong southern accent. She seemed kind of aloof. Nonetheless, after a rather long check-in given the time of night, we were off to our room. The Las Brisas Ocean View King room was very clean and looked exactly like the pictures on the El Conquistador website. Small couch, balcone, desk, large mirror, lcd television and a large bathroom that included a walk-in closet. The only problem with the room upon check-in was that the safe was locked shut and we had some things we wanted to get into it, but dealt with it in the morning. A couple hours after going to sleep, we were awoken at 5:00AM by an alarm. At first it was not clear what the alarm was for, but it sounded like a fire alarm. We tried calling the front desk but there was no answer. We went out the front door to only see other guests standing in the open air hallways looking as confused as we were. As we were about to follow the exit signs after the alarm had been going off for 5 minutes or so and no answer from the front desk, the alarm stopped. A final call to the front desk finally got someone and they were aware of the alarm but did not have any idea what caused it and it took them time to find the manual override to shut it off. It definitely seemed like the hotel staff did not know how to deal with this situation and thankfully it was not a real hazard. During our stay we found the property to be very well kept and enjoyable to go around. The pools are very nice, clean, easy access to lounge chairs and several bars with food options throughout the main pool area. Towels are provided at main location that also displays activity options for the day (none of which occurred even though they were listed). Casino The Casino is small and recently renovated. It no longer has Craps tables. There are two blackjack tables (usually only one operates), a roulette table and a 3 card poker table. Minimum bets during out stay at the blackjack was as high as $10 and usually $5. The roulette table has a minimum bet of $2. There are a lot of slot machines with a mix of bonus slots and traditional slots all varying in ranged from 1 cent to $1. Casino is open from Noon to 3:00AM daily. Food Food was probably the most disappointing part of the hotel. By far the best food was at the outside bar Bella Vista just off the lobby. It is italian, but the food was very good. It was while we dined here that we met three people from Hilton who were surveying the hotel. The fine dining options were disappointing. We ate at the Stingray Cafe at the marina twice which was good, but not great. Presentation of certain dishes was subpar and the restaurant that advertises itself as Med / Caribbean flavor could not hit either with greatness. We are there twice, but only because it was the better of the fine dining options. Blossoms, an Asian restaurant was no better than the Asian restaurants within blocks of my apartment. Food was just not flavorful and when the restaurant messed up our order, they did not offer to fix it but just asked that we eat around the problem - completely unacceptable for a nice restaurant at a resort. In addition, the appetizer pan fried pot stickers / dumplings might have been the worse I have ever eaten. Just disgusting. We were really excited about this restaurant and it was incredibly disappointing. Breakfast options are alright, with Las Brisas being the only main buffet option (the casitas area has a continental breakfast) was pretty good. Made to order omelettes, french toast, pastries, meats, cereals and fruits. $25 per person and not bad. Other options include a small cafe past the Casino which was alright (order the ala carte eggs and a side toast to save money). Starbucks was probably the most busy breakfast place and the little bodega-like places all had breakfast but rarely got in new product each morning - so the same muffin would be out for three days. We tried dining at the Spa Cafe three times, but it was closed every day we were there for no reason. Food on the small beach island, Palimon Island, was okay but expensive like all other options for lunch. It did the trick though for our visit to the beach. Other lunch options around the pools have similar fried / burger-like food and salads and are also very expensive. I almost wished they had a better fast food option on property for a lunch option. It was tough forking out $50 for lunch everyday. Drinks were expensive, served in small plastic cups, insufficient alchohol and hardly worth the $10 to $14 prices that are charged at the various bars. A big disappointment as the tropical environment makes you crave some great tropical and freshly made drinks. Instead, boxed mixes dominate all the drinks and just make for a plain and boring drink experience at the various bars around the property. Probably the only great drink on the property is down at the marina bar, the Ballyhoo - a mix of rums and juices which is the signature drink of the marina-area. Stores There are number of different small stores on the property selling clothes, small food options, drinks and even a sunglass hut. They were open most of the day and were not too bad. Different stores though had different prices for the same things, so that was kind of odd. One thing is that $4 water gets old quickly, especially when they do not offer complimentary water at the pool area during the hot days. Business / Internet A small business center is available with computers that allow for airline check-in for free but all other internet is for a cost - unless you know how to make the free check-in computer work for you to get other internet access (which I took advantage of). They advertise in room internet via WiFi, but it did not work in the Las Brisas wing and the hotel admitted that outside of the lobby, WiFi is sketchy. We used our computer in the lobby area and although they charge for WiFi, we were able to access it for free our entire stay. Palomino Island Great little island that is easy to get via the furnicular (little elevator) to the marina and short (7 to 10 minute) boat ride to the island. There is a small outside restaurant with normal lunch options and same drinks as the main pools. There is also a small bar out by the beach and two small stores with various things, including snacks and suntan lotion. There are activity options and I was really excited about doing some snorkeling. However, I would not recommend wasting your money renting snorkel gear on the island. The first 100 yards or so out from the beach is filled with rocks, dead coral, and grass in water about no deeper than 2 feet. It makes it rather impossible to get out to the area where you could snorkel in about 10 to 12 feet of water. You really would need water shoes to get out to this area as it is very tough to wade out in flippers and bare feet is not possible. Swimming in this shallow area is impossible as well. Just not worth the effort. Otherwise, the little island is great and enjoyable with plenty of lounge chairs and easy access to one set of bathrooms. Golden Door Spa We were very excited about using the Spa at this hotel for our long weekend and were very disappointed by it. Although they advertise a number of yoga classes and other activities at the spa, during our stay every time we went to attend one it was cancelled. I am guessing it was a result of the low occupancy numbers. However, there was bad communication between the Spa and the concierge in terms of timing for classes and availability. Every time we went to the spa, either a class was cancelled, its time had been changed or a service was not available that day. We never got to use the Spa once and the staff was completely indifferent about it at the Spa. This was a huge disappointment, especially since our winter getaway provided comp Spa access and 50% off second treatments. As mentioned above, not even the Spa Cafe was open any of the days we were there. We walked over there each morning in hopes of something being available, but never got to use it once. Check-Out When we checked-in, we were told we could receive a complimentary late check-out of 1:30PM. Normal check-out is between 11:00 and Noon according to the hotel staff. When we called Monday morning to confirm our late check-out, the staff told us it would be $65 an hour beyond Noon. With 17% occupancy and after spending almost $900 at the hotel, this was quite obnoxious. After some arguing, the hotel caved and allowed us to take a 1:30PM check-out at no extra cost. Otherwise, the check-out was a little tough as many of the places we ate / shopped at the property had different names when on the bill. This was quite confusing, especially since the hotel did not tell us at first as we struggled with the bill. Also, because most places on the property do not take cash, there are lots and lots of room charges, especially if you did not leave the property. In addition, although the hotel advertises free local / 800 calls, we were charged for them on our bill. After a lot of struggling to get them removed (the hotel gave us no problem removing them), they were removed from the bill. We are still waiting for our points to post, 4 days after departure. Conclusion Overall we really liked the property and it was perfect for a long weekend get away in the winter. Views are fantastic from the property and the property is clean and very well maintained. As mentioned above, the hotel should consider revamping the food options on the property. The hotel needs better management and is not worthy of the W=A designation yet. There is a lot of confusion on the property about Hilton and I imagine it will take time for the staff to get used to the system and general Hilton policies. I give it a year before they get this place in great working order and fix the lousy food options. I think there needs to be a lot of streamlining as a lot of people seemed to be doing nothing in some areas, while other areas of the hotel went unattended. Nonetheless, based on the property, the facilities and views, we would definitely return for a long weekend. We may be more inclined to rent a car next time, but that may be offset by $16 per day parking.", "Date": "March 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cgreat water park and pool, overpriced food\u201d", "Author": "azpNewYorkCity", "ReviewID": "UR26023536", "Content": "We spent a week over february break at el conquistador with our 2 children.

The refurbed rooms smell of mildew and all \"new\" carpeting has trapped scents of it. The skeleton crew, however pleasant, cannot maintain positive service when faced with a group our size because so many of staff has been let go for the recession. Unfortunately, we the guests w/expectations of the great El Con days past suffer when faced with sitting over 20 minutes for a coffee at Las Brisas. When we went to the Golden Door Spa, the cracks in the walls connecting the 3 floors tells enough about the investment of time and money going into this place. On the 2nd floor, all of the fun classes have been cancelled and some new idea has surfaced to chage $25 per class on an \"as needed\" basis if they can find an instructor. They used to offer 8 classes a day that were fun, exciting, and taught by industry professionals with dvds and books. Their program rivalled our David Lloyd and Virgin Active clubs here in the UK with great instructors, innovative classes, and amazing ideas. Gone is the aquatic fitnes as well which used to attract so many individuals around 11 each day as a COMPLIMENTARY attraction promoting the Spa. No more such fun exists. When we requested male therapists, we were told that there were none availalbe due to recent cutbacks. At Palomino Island, there is horrible service and no food option.

The veiws were spectacular, there was plenty of things to do, and the employees were very kind and helpful. We were supposed to stay in Las Olas, but when we got to the room we found that the ocean veiw was parcialy blocked by a building and that the whole Las Olas area was in need of a little TLC. The front desk however accomodated us with a free upgrade to a better room in Las Marinas. I'd suggest that you definatley stay there. You are close to the boat so you can get to Palamino Island quickly, there are two resturants, shops,and a waterpark down in the marina area so it is not a pain to go down the funicular everytime you want to do one of those activities. Also, the veiws in the marina are beautiful as well. Going to Palomino Island was a highlight of the trip. It is only a 7 minute boat ride and your on a tropical island paradise. The water is warm, however there is alot of coral so i'd suggest you bring water shoes. There is a restaurant on the island as well as a small gift shop. Close to Palomino Island is an island called Palimonitos Island. You can rent anything from a noodle or a tube to a windsurfer or jetski to get over to the island. We took a kayak over and the ride was very fun. The island has nice water for snorkling or just swimmimg, and plently of treasures to find such as a sea fans or shells. You can also go horseback riding on Palamino Island (the main island). El Conquistador offers an array of fantastic dining. The Strip House had the most amazing steak I have ever tasted but it was quite expensive along with all of the other restuarants. If you have kids I would suggest going to the Ballyhoo Bar and Grill across from Stingray. They have salads, hamburgers, hot dogs ect. for a reasonable price. Up at the main hotel there are three great pools. One has volley ball net, the other is a lap pool and what we thought was the best was the large pool that had a swim-up bar. The hotel also offers a water park too. Coqui water park is located in the marina, it was actually right in front of our room. There is admission to get in.

The resort has a magnificent setting, truly gorgeous, and Palomino Island is fantastic, but there are a lot of problems. Most have to do with management. The resort is under occupied and we suspect it is short staffed and it definitely overpriced for the services provided (remember to add about 25% to the cost of the hotel room for taxes and \"resort fees.\") Here are our comments and recommendations: (1) Rent a car in San Juan - the least expensive option - OR hire Carlos, a fantastic driver and guide who will meet you at the airport, give tours of the rain forest and other areas, recommend and take you to fun restaurants, etc. (I noticed another reviewer praised him as well) Otherwise, you are essentially stuck at the hotel. Cabs are VERY expensive ($20 minimum fee) If you do want a driver, phone the hotel before your arrival in San Juan and ask that Carlos be assigned to pick you up. (2) Be politely assertive about your rooms. We booked directly through the hotel and paid extra to stay at Las Olas to ensure a nice room with an ocean view - and it still took us almost 5 hours and 2 room changes before we were placed in an acceptable, albeit hugely overpriced, room. Las Olas is dated, tired looking, and most of all, dirty, so I can't figure out why it is more expensive than the main building. The carpets in the hallways are terribly stained and were not vacuumed once during our entire stay. Balcony furniture is minimal, without even a small table. Way overpriced (We could and should have stayed at Las Casitas for less.) (3) The food is exorbitant for the quality. Blossoms and Stingray have ok food, but overpriced. La Vista has a great view and good casual food; breakfasts at the Cafe Caribe are much less expensive than at Las Brisas; breakfast at the Bally hoo at the marina bar, is great and the setting unbeatable; the food on Palomino Island is absurdly expensive, but you can get take out sandwiches, chips and sodas at David's Cookies or the Cozy Gourmet at reasonable prices and take them with you. (4) The hotel had a low occupancy rate for most of our stay and several tours were cancelled. The eastern part of the island is noted for snorkeling, but the hotel was unable to get the minimum 8 people for a half or full day tour. (5) if you want to go to the bio-luminescent tour, do not book through the hotel. Go to the marina, past the ferry to the island, and through the gate. A short walk takes you to the small fishing village. At 6 pm, numerous kayak tour companies prepare to set out for the lagoon and you will pay half the cost of booking through the hotel. (6) This is also a good place to try some local food. (7) if we were to do it over again, we would book at least 1 night in Vieques or Culebra to take advantage of the beaches and snorkeling there - as well as the evening tour of Mosquito Bay, which has by far the best bio-luminescent displays (and you can swim in the water).; (8) the trip to the nature reserve near the El Conquistador is wonderful - well worth the short trip; (9) El Yunque, the rain forest, is also fun. Have Carlos take you in the morning, before the crowds arrive. He will see that you swim in a small clean pool under a waterfall, will find and identify some of the flowers and give options for various walks. (10) the main pools are nice with glorious views.

While we enjoyed our week together, we were disappointed with the resort and won't return. Overall, we felt that it was comparable to an all-inclusive or a similarly mid-range hotel; had we paid a \"budget\" price, we would have been satisfied with our experience. It's not in the same class with similarly-priced high-end hotels. Our rooms were in the Marina with a beautiful ocean view. With an upgrade, we were on the top floor - these rooms have an elevated ceiling, which made the space feel huge. We were very happy with the rooms and the housekeeping staff. We hired babysitters for several nights and they were great. We found the funicular swift and fun for our kids. Ditto with the boat ride to Palomino island - rather than a drawback, it was actually a nice relaxing trip. We loved the island - as others have said, it's a beautiful beach. Our biggest complaint was the food. The food was as overpriced as one would expect at a major resort ($15 hamburgers, etc.), and we were prepared for that. It ranged in quality from poor to totally inedible. The only two exceptions were the dinners we had at the steak house and the teppanyaki place. The other \"nice\" restaurants were simply terrible.... for $35, the entrees were inexcusable. It was very frustrating that the cafe on the island was so horrible - we really couldn't eat there, so that forced us to return on the boat prior to lunch time. The water park is nice, but it's quite small and they charge a hefty daily fee for it, which was annoying; at Atlantis, for example, the daily \"resort fee\" covers the vastly larger water park options. Most of the areas of the hotel are far past their prime, including the main pools. We were glad to be staying at the marina, as the other wings looked very poorly kept up. There's lots of cracked cement, peeling paint, etc. everywhere - again, if you were at a budget hotel, this wouldn't seem so bad, but for the price you'd expect a lot more. It is certainly not comparable to other high-end resorts. The one exception seemed to be the Casitas; we took a walk up there and they look lovely, with their own pool and restaurants. They're owned and managed separately, so that's perhaps a better bet. All in all... it needs a major overhaul, as several others have commented.

The rooms are not luxurious as compared to other 5 star resorts. I do realize the resort is continually undergoing a facelift, but it is far from complete. We stayed in the 4000 building which on first impression as we were walking to our room reminded me of a vintage hospital with it's mint green walls and peeling paint. Beds were comfy, some had ants so if you are itching check that out. The view from our room was definately 5 star. Gorgeous sunrises! Room service is speedy and the Cubano sandwhich is so good we had it practically everyday. We had a $15 cab ride to a nearby gas station to buy beer and sodas so we wouldn't have to pay for them on the resort. We walked out the gate past the ferry down past the apartments and did the BioBay tour from there. It's $88 if you book through the hotel and only $45 if you go down there. Get the glass bottom kayaks. It is quite a paddle, if you are weak or not wanting to put some effort into it, don't go. When we went the tide was going out and it was very hard to paddle against it, but the bay at the end was totally worth it. Old San Juan is an hour away, take comfy shoes and plan to stay the day as there is a ton of stuff to do there. They have high end shopping as well as puerto rico vendor shopping. My husband booked a light tackle tour in the hotel for 6. It was about $700. They should have gone to the marina and hired someone themselves for about half that cost. But the trip was worth it as they all had a great time. The casino is small and dated, the stores at the resort are extrememly well priced for shirts and such. If you are waiting to go off resort to purchase these items cheaper you may rethink it. The quality of the resort items is well worth the extra couple of dollars. Lots of walking up and down slopes and stairs as well as a short ride on a cable trolley type thing called a funicular.

The location and viewa are wonderful. The food in the finer restaurants was very good. Most of the staff were very accomodating but mostly when something was pointed out to them. I had a number of instances which service, amenities and basic comforts were lacking. For 3 days there wasn't any hot water in my room and one day I used the Golden Spa to shower. The refrigerator in the cabana we rented ($350 p/day) had to be replaced after the first day. Lunch at the lower main pool bar took 1 hour 20 minutes on another day. Our reservation at the Italina restaurant was not honored and we had to wait 45 minutes one evening. The spa needs signiffcant updating and renovations as does some other areas of the hotel. I spoke with the hotel manager one day about the incoveneinces my family had incurred (ie: lack of hot water, delayed lunch, dinner reservation, etc.). He asked what he could do for me and I said I will leave it up to you. absolutely nothing was done. The hotel does offer wonderful surrpondings and if you are willing to pay has enough amenities. It is not a great place for teenagers had limited activities in the evening for them. Having to take a water shuttle to the beach for all water activities is a inconveneioce guests should be aware of prior to booking.

It's a little overwhelming, actually. There are a two or three shallow swimming pools (no deep ends) and then a water park consisting of three slides and a lazy river for an additional fee. To get to the beach, you need to wait for the ferry that will take you on a 10 minute ride to a private island that is owned by the hotel. It is open from 9 to 5 and has one restaurant that serves bar food for lunch. To get to the ferry, you need to take an elevator down to a funicular ride, and hope you've timed it so that the ferry isn't JUST pulling away as you get there. All of this means that from slapping on your bikini to flopping on your towel COULD take you an hour. The good: The staff was fantastically friendly. The food was pretty good. Try the key lime pie, it's to die for, in fact, I ordered it via room service at midnight, and it arrived SO promptly. The views are AMAZING! The water park is fun, and a neat addition. There are TONS of activities to do on the premises (kayaking, snorkeling, SCUBA diving, ocean swimming, pool swimming, nightly movies, jet skis, banana boats, golf, tennis, etc.) and the front desk can hook you up with other tours nearby. The beach island has iguanas, rabbits, tiny lizards and roosters. There is also a horse tour that looked fun, although I didn't go. The hiking is great, too, so if you're with people who lay around on the beach but you really want to get up and go, you can do both without having to separate all day long. That's pretty nice. The water is clean and clear, but there is sharp coral that bruised my feet. It's fun to collect though. I also found a conch in it's shell, and that was cool (be careful; one of the locals wandered over as I was showing a group of kids how cool our \"new friend\" was and talked about how she was going to use it when I was finished for soup. I set him free when she wasn't looking, to the delight of the little kids who were sad when she talked about cooking him and when her boyfriend talked about eating him raw.) My niece saw a manatee (we are all still jealous we missed it), and our whole family was greeted by a humming bird flitting around the bush we were sitting by. The bad: Even thought the hotel wasn't crowded, service in the restaurants and on the hotel's beach island was beyond slow. In the Italian restaurant we waited over an hour before our appetizers arrived, and I watched other people leave in disgust after waiting so long. We had a bad experience with our biolumninescent tour; it was nearly a mile of kayacking and was nearly impossible for my 60 something mother in law and 9 year old nephew to keep up with, even though we were told it was appropriate for all ages. Everyone in between (my husband and I, 26, and 27 and his siblings and older nieces and nephews) were just fine, as were all the other people in our group who were in the 16-50 range. This tour was booked through the hotel for $90 per person, but if you just go to the docks where they leave from, you can book on the spot for around $45. There are several companies that offer tours of this really cool glow-in-the-dark bay, so if you are a small group, this is probably a good option. (Go out the small white gate by where you catch the ferry, past the apartments, through a kind of sketchy area that just looks abandoned but is totally fine; there are parked cars, and just walk a bit. You'll stumble across several tourists snapping into life vests getting ready to go around 6, 6:30 and later. Def. check out those bioluminescent waters. It's pretty awesome.) The worst for me was the \"hot\"tubs, which we nicknamed \"bubble tubs\" because they were not hot at all. It was pretty disappointing. The water park is an extra charge, which is ridiculous considering what it is and what you're paying for everything else. It would be nice if it was free. There's plenty of room for adults to lounge \"pool side\" at the water park and there is a large shallow pool for the tiny kiddos, with a tiny kiddo waterslide, too. It would be great to get the families there and have the pools and hot tubs consisting of mostly adults. (We have a theory they kept the hot tubs so cool to be kid-friendly). The place is large which is cool, but I found this to be overwhelming and annoying, too. It was also overrun with little kids (the week between Christmas and New Years, though, means little kids everywhere.)

If you are looking for a one stop destination- where you do not need to leave the resort to do anything- you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll love it. I will start with the pluses- the staff. They are sweet, attentive and seem to want to please. The golf is phenomenal- and this might be one of a few resorts in PR where there is golf onsite. The spa is good- but expensive ($147 for a 50 minute massage with mandatory added gratuity). While I always tip the therapist- it is usually commensurate with the quality of the service. I happened to have had a great massage but did not run back at the cost for a second service. To me the most fun activity is Palomino Island. They tender you over to their private island- where they have beautiful chairs with some umbrellas. Same drill as most resorts- early bird gets the worm with seating under shade. There are jet skis, banana boats, snorkeling, and kayaks. Beware- the restaurant had problems keeping up with our busy day and food was so-so. Maybe bring a sandwich from Starbucks (see below). Bring a small cooler for this that fits in a bag- they have ice machines near all rooms. Renting a little noodle was $6 and a raft $11 - bring a few blow up rings or floats for your little guys to save a few bucks there. A few cons. First the state of the maintenance of the resort is fair. Examples include facades in need of painting, the hot tub sans bubbles (no plan to fix I guess), floors needing cleaning, pools which could also be cleaner\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I truly think this is an economic related numbers issue- as occupancy is surely down. We laughed as the walk to the lower pool had dirt/hair balls the whole 6 days that just blew around and were never swept- well it is a big resort and must be a nightmare to maintain. If you have a teenager as I do- BEWARE as the drinking age is 18 (not 21). That blew me away and my son and my friends kids bellied up to the bar and drank. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 19- but I wish I had foreseen this and snuffed it out before we got there. Plus they had no problems freely serving my 17 year old either. Scary stuff as a parent. Every guest gets these charge cards- I wonder if they have a way to restrict them? Worth asking- after all, kids will be kids. Food is very expensive (what else is new at a resort). Lots of walking there too - I guess an issue if infirmed or elderly. Rooms could be just a tad cleaner- but the sweet staff taking care of the rooms made up for it. Also be aware the drive from the airport is long- with traffic could be an hour or more. One other con- my husband and son are certified in scuba diving- but my 17 year old is not. My 2 sons did get a refresher in the pool- but on their dive the staff was inattentive at best. They haphazardly checked their gear- and you better bring your own buddy to dive with as you are on your own. That is a little scary. Tips- bring a bottle of rum/some beer for your room if you like a drink before dinner. They have a refrigerator that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empty. Bring snacks for the kids- the food is quite expensive and is nice to at least defray some of that. We bought rum, wine (bring a corkscrew), beer, cokes- and had a happy hour on our beautiful balconies that saved money. I spoke to a guy who rented a car and this gave him eating/drinking/snack flexibility we did not have. We booked the garden view- and they kindly gave us a partial and full ocean view- wow. We had originally booked partial- changed to garden- that saved us > $1000 each room. I recommend the marina location - unless you are a casino person. I liked being on the bottom of the funicular. After getting off the boat- I saw some people who had to wait in line to go up the mountain. You have snorkel gear? Bring it and snorkel to the small island next to Palomino- my husband and sons did this and said was terrific. I kayaked to there too- and it was awesome. Want to know the deal on the resort? Starbucks- yes that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right. The cheapest sandwich seems to be $10-$14 elsewhere. The worker said they are the most expensive Starbucks on the island- but the hidden secret of the resort. The breakfast parfait is maybe $3- the breakfast buffet is (ready for this) $25 plus tax and tip. Yipes. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face it the food is always outrageous at nice resorts- but beware the dinners are a fortune too ($45 steak and $11 Caesar salad). What else? Well we ended up not doing the luminescence tour in the kayaks- but figured out if you walk around the corner (to the left of where you get on the boat)- is \u00c2\u00bd the cost as opposed to booking through the resort ($44 versus $88 or something like that). My other tip is the lower pool- kind of hidden but very relaxing versus the noisy upper pool. You know they have this water park- but our kids were maybe a little too old for it and I guess the $20 cost put them off (versus them sneaking daiquiris- go figure). I hope this information helps- I am always so indebted to tips I get from other reviews- so thanks to all of you.", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMemorable\u201d", "Author": "Drexel3", "ReviewID": "UR22416396", "Content": "I stayed here about 6 years ago as a kid with my parent's.

Service was not dependent on tips (though they were appreciated). The restaurants are world-class. We ate at Blossoms, the Strip House, Stingray Cafe, and other pool area cafes (warning: you will pay dearly for this quality!). The amenities are more than expected: a shuttle boat to the private island leaves every hour, the pools are varied and well-maintained, the shops are all-encompassing. Now the good: the housekeeping is good. We had a clean room every day, plenty of towels (family of 5 remember), and refills on soap,shampoo, etc. There are a number of hotel partnered activities: we went on the rainforest tour, the catarmaran snorkel trip, and the luminescent bay kayak trip. Thought the catarmaran tip was the most expensive ($100 per person) it was the most enjoyable. I recommend it to snorkelers. We also snorkeled at Palomino island but be prepared for a 100 yard trek over rocks and sea grass before you reach the reef. The cat drops you on top of a reef near Icacos Island (highlight of th trip for us). Next time I would travel to the rainforest on my own and hike, rather than with a guide (though our guide was very helpful, friendly, and educated). The trip is aimed at older folks who are not very fit or find exercise a problem. The kayak trip was nice but more of a workout than many in our group realized. The poor guide had to tow 3 boats after a short period of rowing. OK, now the bad: the room quality just doesn't fit the rest of the hotel. We stayed in 3503. The wall plaster was chipped. The room smelled strongly of mold. The decor was dated and just generally \"worn\". The tub handle was broken. People run up and down the hall at night knocking on doors. Good views from the balcony but beware if you have small children. The railing is a little loose and also aged. My summary: I would return but would try to rent one of the newer \"condos\" at the south end of the resort rather than a hotel room. Our timing was great. We felt like we had the resort to ourselves at times this last week of October. Not crowded at all early in the week. It did get more crowded on the weekend.

The reviews are really all over the board and I truly think it depends on your expectation level of a 5 star resort/vacation. We were part of a large group of realtors and spouses on a business retreat. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate as there was rain almost the entire week, with a threat of Hurricane Omar (that luckily missed the island). When you have the extra time on your hand, you tend to notice some of the imperfections (and there are many). The hotel overall is in serious need of maintenance. How they can maintain their 5 star rating is curious and almost laughable. With the current condition of the resort, this should receive 3 stars. The windows leaked throughout the resort and in the rooms. The staff had yellow pool towels rolled up at the base of every window, everywhere. Rugs were soggy... The pools are in need of refurbishing. It looks like my child did the grout work around the pool. The grounds are nice, but lacked maintenance. There is chipped paint, marks of the walls throughout the hallways, and generally feels like half of the staff did not show up to complete the level of work needed to maintain this caliber of hotel. With the anticipated storm, all but 2 of the restaurants closed (they have 21 I think) for two days. The food is expensive, so bring your wallet. Drinks too, and not just alcoholic. An Arizona Ice Tea ($1.00 a can in the States) is $5.75, a coke is $3.75 and the Fuji bottled water in the room is $7.00. We enjoyed a fabulous dinner one night at Stingrays, but it set us back $144. The rooms are a nice size with an incredible view of the ocean and pools. Our room looked like it had been recently renovated (very modern, sleek), however, the bathroom looked original (to what year, I'm not sure!). The grout was dirty and stained, and again was sloppy. There was peeling paint on the celing of our bathroom. The water was luke warm at best on some days. We were lucky enough to finally receive a wash cloth on the last 2 days of our 6 day stay. I'm not sure housekeeping spent more than a minute or so in our room cleaning it. The entrance as you come into the resort has large tiles. Obviously, the constant rain made it difficult to keep this area dry. But the tiles are dangerously slick. Someone in our group fell and injured her finger. Why anyone would think it is a good idea to put slick tile in a main entry way that is susceptible to rain, I don't know. We did not play the slot machines or even enter the casino. They did close the casinos down in anticipation of the storm. The area looked nice. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. I did not see any presence of management throughout our stay. Overall, it seemed like the hotel was generally understaffed. I am hopeful that by sharing our experience will help you make a decision about this resort. Again, I will say, had the weather been beautiful the whole week, our group would not have noticed all of the little details, I'm sure.

What a difference a few years make. First we were picked up by the hotel bus and he told us that we usually would have dinks on the bus (for the 1 to 1.5 hours drive from the airport) but he didn't have time to fill the cooler. We get to the hotel and our room is in the main building and has a great view until it rained that night. We woke up to a carpet that was drenched from the sliding doors almost to the bed. When we asked to switch rooms, we were told nothing was available until the next day with the view and king bed we paid for. The new room wasn't ready until the next night and it was a garden view with two doubles. We went to call the front desk and that room's phone wasn't working. The bellman called the front desk from his cell phone and they hung up on him twice before sending us to another room with and ocean view, but still two double beds. We were too tired of packing and moving rooms that night, so we accepted this room. We went to the casino and the female dealers were friendly, the male dealers were not. It was also took a long time to get a drink when playing the tables. We got back to our room to find water leaking from the ceiling into the bathroom. This was 2am so we waited unitl the next day and moved again. Four rooms in five days. In general the staff was nice but the hotel was in serious need of a cleaning. The pools were dirty and being a pool owner, I looked in the skimmers and found them clogged with debris. They did not clean the skimmers for the next two days. The maid service was horrible. They never vacuumed, we had to take wash clothes from the fitness room because they never left us any, even after asking and they were very frugal with large bath towels. There are several more things...lots of cracked plaster, missing tiles, broken elevators and tram, missing door knobs, etc...etc... but it is suffice to say we will never go there again. One of the staff told us they were purchased a couple of months ago by an investment bankers group.

We would start our day off with coffee from starbucks, maybe a banana and a power bar, and then pick lighty during the day and wait for dinner. The food was fantastic! Each meal topped the previous one, every restaurant we tried was just delicious. They have everything there, starbucks, fruit, brick oven pizza, chinese food, steakhouses, you name it! My husband and I are so sick of traveling to Vegas and Disney where there is always so much to do you squeeze it in a few short days and burn yourself out, we just wanted a resort where we could just sit and relax and not have to leave to go anywhere! We felt so safe and so relaxed just hanging out every day on the property, there is so much to see and so much to do. I like it that the beach is only accessible by boat, it was a very short and fun ride, and it made it adventurous, like something fun to do that day, instead of the usual boring stroll to the beach. The water park was awesome! We had more fun than the children there! We picked the best time to go. August 22nd was a very quiet week there, I guess because everyone was going back to school, but the week before was packed and a lot of people were complaining about waiting for the funnicular and elevators and boats, we had such an easy time. There were no waits, no lines, I enjoyed the ride in the funnicular to take us down to another part of the hotel, I loved walking around everywhere exploring learning the resort, it was great! The spa was really nice as well. And no I didn't think this resort or the restaurants were really expensive. MAybe because we are from the NY/NJ area, and we are used to getting bent, we're used to prices like that. In fact a red bull and vodka at the casino is only 7 bucks! NY it's 12!!! If you are all inclusive people, then I would suggest places like the Domincan Republic. But I hate all inclusive. The casino was fun but small, only one black jack table, no poker, no hold em my husband was disappointed. I had great luck playing the slots though, monte carlo was so fun and good to me! Our biggest regret was not taking our 2 year old. Yeah it was nice to get away, but we almost cried when we saw the baby water slide. He would have had a blast.

I must say my daughter, sister and I were sorry to leave the El Conquistador Spa and Resort in Farjado Puerto Rico. Before I left for my trip, I read several reviews on this website and after reading them, I was rethinking if I had made the right decision for our vacation spot, but that thought was quickly put to rest. We arrived on Tuesday August 26, 2008. We took the shuttle provided by the hotel and arrived quickly at our destination. Upon arriving we were greeted by friendly and informative staff, but there was one person in particular who was extremely nice and it was truly a pleasure doing business with him, Mr. Rogelio Santos is truly a professional. We were checked in, with no problems and shown to our room, given a small tour and left to enjoy paradise. My room was an ocean view located near the marina, its also very close to the water park, if you have kids that's where you want to be. Our first dining experience at the hotel was at Cafe Bell Vista. Once again I had read the reviews of how expensive food was and was a little apprehensive, but was I pleasantly surprised at our meal and the price and wonderful service. Everything was freshly prepared and served by our wonderful server Sally. Of course you are going to pay a little more, but that is to be expected but it wasn't outrageous and for the quality and quantity it was well worth it. We also ate at Cafe Caribe. Once again the food was delicious and freshly prepared. I thoroughly enjoyed the arroz con pollo. I also suggest the Ballyhoo, my sister had the steak with rice and beans, she couldn't stop talking about it. Drinks at the hotel are good and roughly the same price as I pay in any restaurant in New York. I chose to avoid the more expensive restaurants upstairs because their prices seemed over the top for what they were offering. We enjoyed several days at the beach and didn't venture out of the hotel because everything was there. The food at the beach was very good. I suggest the grilled chicken sandwich. ( Don't drop any food because the roosters will be right there to eat it. LOL.) The beach also offers horse back riding, which is cheaper than what the hotel offers. If you want to go on tours, they can be a little pricey. Private tours are available outside the hotel. Information for that was given by other guests who were staying there. ( I still have the number if anyone is interested.) If you have a little time on your hands don't hesitate to visit the casino. I would suggest a little more entertainment in the night club downstairs, or maybe even a beach party for the guests that would be nice. I think guests would enjoy a little diversion. LOL. My only complaints are as follows: My daughter has a sensitive stomach, so I had to keep ginger ale on stock. I paid $1.79 for a 10 oz botte. They don't provide anything larger. I spent roughly $20 on soda. I would suggest having larger sizes. The bugs will eat you alive, bring bug spray and anti-itch cream. Dining is outside in some restaurants, the bugs will get you. Since we were there around Labor Day weekend and there was a conference, I noticed that elevators and the funicular were broken during the weekend. It was quickly prepared, but I can only attribute this towards the large groups that began to arrive. It was an inconvenience, but the staff did everything to make sure the inconvenience was minimum. I went there for rest and relaxation and that is what I received. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are very modern and a pleasure to be sleep in. The cleaning staff was always there to provide whatever I needed as well as all the staff.

The first three nights we stayed at a sister hotel to the El Con called the El San Juan Hotel in Isla Verde for the touristy, busy part of our honeymoon...loved it, and will go back. Then we spent 4 nights at the El Conquistador with the Romance Package including airport shuttle, daily breakfast for two, two 50 minute massages, and tax and tariff. good price offered for what we thought would be the \"luxurious and romantic\" part of our honeymoon...hated it, will NOT go back. First of all, everyone hit the nail on the head with expensive food costs. The cheapest meal was $45, for a cesear wrap and tuna pita, and water to drink. I agree the food was not anything to remember, not fantastic, nor worth the price. Half the restuarants were closed majority of the time, only one tram worked to get you up and down the resort which made us miss the catamaran multiple times to the beach (supposed to run every half hour but ran every hour). Biggest problem, screaming kids everywhere. The \"7 luxurious pools\" were full of them. This hotel did not bend backwards, forwards or even shuffle a step for guests. It felt like a rip off. Large Dasani bottles of water-$10. No microwave in your room, so if you did have leftovers from your $100 dinner, you couldn't even eat it. The Dance club is only open 3 days of the week, for a place that traps you there, they sure limit your amenity options. The power kepts tripping off for seconds at a time multiple nights the week we were there. The Spa wasn't as clean as it should've been and the massage was not relaxing, very rigid and tacky. Luckily the view from our room was amazing, go for the Ocean View rooms, its breathtaking. Loved the walk in closet, to actually unpack was nice. The safe didn't work and staff never came to assist. Palomino Island, the private beach, was overcrowded with chairs everywhere, the beach and water was SO rocky and filled with coral, so painful on your feet. Plus tons of jellyfish in the water, be careful. If you are hungry, the hamburger was good, but $15. We had a 5 pack of cerveza for $30 and to rent a floatie for the water was $22 a day, and they kick you off the island at 5:30pm. But there were awesome Iquanas wandering around everywhere there. If you wanted to escape with a tour, the kayaking was $88 per person, which was by far the best activity we have ever done in Puerto Rico all the years we have visited, but the dock was a 3 minute bus ride from the hotel. Our friends stayed in San Juan and paid $60 per person for the same tour that drove them the hour drive to the same dock we were already at AND fed them. The El Yunque Rainforest tour for $55 per person was nice, very informative and worth the price. If you want to experience Puerto Rico, don't stay here, go to Isla Verde or San Juan. You will never taste Puerto Rican food at this hotel, nor experience the friendly, vibrant, artistic culture of Puerto Rico. If you are rich, have loud children and want to take them somewhere to dump them at the pool and pay $12 for macaroni and cheese they won't eat, then this is the place for you!

I booked the Coqui Water Park Package that included transfers back and forth to the hotel, breakfast each morning and the water park. It was truly the best thing I could have ever done. Once we arrived off the air plane, there was a person there waiting from the hotel and directed us where to go for the shuttle. The shuttle offered cold drinks, air conditioning and was very comfortable. We waited just 20 minutes and then we were on our way. It was an hour drive from the airport, but we liked that we were further away from the very tourist areas. Once we arrived, someone was there to greet us and explained where to go with check and in how our baggage would be handled. Check in was a breeze and the representative at the desk was more than friendly. We were then explained briefly what section our room was and what the best ways were to get there from certain areas. We stayed in the Las Brisas section and found it to be right in the middle of everything. It was just a short walk to the funicular and it was just a short walk to the main building. In other reviews I had read about nightmare stories of the funicular taking so long. Each time we took the funicular it was no longer than a two minute wait. Once down in the marina you could take the ferry to Palamino Island which is just a wonderful way to spend the day. The Coqui Water park is just so much fun for all ages. We were there during the week so we almost felt like we had the park to ourselves (the weekends seemed much more crowded). Back at the main building the pools were all just so nice and are open 24 hours.. The property is beautifully maintained and again, all the staff was more than accomodating. We did rent a car from Enterprise which is on site at the hotel. Because our package included the shuttle back and forth from the airport we only needed to rent for the days in between. This was also good because Enterprise allows you to park in their lot, therefore, saving you the parking cost of the hotel. Renting a car allowed us to save money on guided tours such as Old San Juan and The Rainforest. The hotel gives very good directions to both places and it is very easy to drive. Both are must sees in Puerto Rico! Going in August, we knew it would be hot, but honestly, there seems always to be a bit of a breeze going. We thought the weather was just perfect. The rooms at the hotel were very clean and modern with more than enough space. Needless to say, this hotel must have the best views in all of Puerto Rico. Now for the restaurants. Yes, they are outrageously priced. But one of our dinners was in Old San Juan and the price was just as comparable as eating at the hotel. I think the hotel has many choices. For a lighter fare and a lighter budget...try Ballyhoo's at the Marina or Cafe Bella Vista.

I disagree with those that felt the hotel is in disrepair. It's a family resort, the rooms were clean confortable and nicely air conditioned considering the August heat. The public areas were nicely kept and service was very kind considering there was a mix up with our rooms and agreed to accomodate in any way possible. We booked the water package plan which allowed us access to the water park all day, buffet breakfast and airport shuttle. In relation to the cost of the room per night the packages was a good deal. Sounds good right! Wrong. I will have a hard time recommending this place without emphasizing the biggest fault. There is something wrong with a place where Starbucks is a bargain. What are they thinking? Fifteen bucks for a cold hamburger? Eighteen dollars for frozen pizza? Thirty dollars for a half filled pasta dish that would have serious competition from a chain restaurant. Come on El Con it is apparent that you guys don't work on repeat business. Get them while they are here. The cost of the food is excessive but the shame of it if they want to be a first class operation, do something about the quality of the food. Gourmet prices at run of the house quality. Blossoms was only passable. Othello was a disgrace to be called Italian. The outdoor cafe and the the Bally Hoo at the marina should consider only selling drinks.

It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The resort is very beautiful, but that's it. For that scale of hotel, I really was expecting a lot more. Compared to other hotels of that scale in the Caribbean (Bahamas, Virgin Islands) the resort could have been better. Positives - We loved the Coqui water park. The slides were lots of fun and the infiniti pool was gorgeous. The beach was OK (too many rocks). We were able to use the waverunners without a problem (lot of the summer traffic was gone by August). Horseback riding was available. Wanted to do the rainforest, but didn't have time. Other tourists I spoke with during the trip said they enjoyed the rainforest. Negatives - The resort is isolated. It's hard to get off the property unless you rent a car or are going on an excursion. The hotel is pricey for what you get. Food was expensive for the casual restaurants. $90 for breakfast for two kids and two adults - how much do eggs, milk, bacon and waffles really cost? Carpet was dirty in our hotel room. The housekeeping was subpar. I could tell no one was really cleaning - ring around the tub for days. The toilet area had a constant urine smell I noticed on the first day (never went away). Nightlife, activities and good music were lacking.

I would not come back considering I have other places in the Caribbean and Mexico to vacation.", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOur Stay at The El Conq\u201d", "Author": "Treepalm", "ReviewID": "UR18759511", "Content": "My wife and I recently returned from a five night stay at the EQ with our two children ages 6 and 8. We were a little unsure of what to expect given the varying reviews we have read. We have traveled quite a bit in the Caribbean with our kids and on a whole we were very pleased with the hotel. Here are some of our impressions, comments and tips. We purchased a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Coqui water park\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdpackage which included transportation on their shuttle bus to and from resort. An EQ rep was there at baggage claim and old us where their stand is. We waited for our bags and walked over (2-3 minutes) to their stand/pick up location. We waited about five minutes for shuttle (I imagine it can be longer) to arrive and then another five minutes for a few more passengers to arrive. Shuttle was nice with on-board bathroom and refridgerated complimentary drinks like soda and bottled water which was a nice touch. Drive to resort took 1:10. Entrance area was very nice, set on high cliff with views of sea. Check in went smoothly and we received our requested room down at the Marina section. As many have said this hotel is large. With almost 1000 rooms it feels more like an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all inclusive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than a hotel. Bellman escorted us down to Marina level via long walkways, an elevator and funicular. We passed the casino, Starbucks, and a number of small convenience store selling sundries, clothes, jewelry, sandwiches, sodas and bottled water. We were very pleased with our room which we found large and well decorated (contemporary). Bathroom was large and room had good storage space. If you chose to stay in marina level then perhaps request a room on fourth floor as ceilings are vaulted and hence very high. We proceeded to waterpark which was very close by and which we found very well done. It has a regular pool, lazy river with tubes, one tube slide, one body slide and one speed slide. As late July pool temp was 86 degrees plus. There were lots of people and kids, and lines for slides were a bit long (5-15 minutes). We found it fun but a bit loud (music playing) and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zoo-ey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They have many chairs but are side to side to side and often taken. We ended up going only twice out of five days. We enjoyed, but only stayed about an hour each time. If you purchase tix a la carte they are only avail for full day and cost $20 adults and $15 for kids. It seemed quieter at end of day and imagine first thing when it opens. We then headed back up to Bella Vista resto which was outdoors and casual where we all enjoyed our meals. We found prices very fair for these types of resorts and were impressed to see kids menus with most offerings at $6 per meal which included fries. Our package included buffet breakfast up at Las Brisas each day. We found the enormous variety and quality of food as well as the service and views to be outstanding. This was a great way to start each day. We noted the a la carte price for adults ($25) and kids ($12) plus tax and tip to be around $90. They also have an a la carte menu which looked reasonable. One of the important things to be sure to realize if you are considering this hotel is that there is no beach at the resort. This is a detail that was fine for us for this trip but certainly is one that may not be for everyone. Yes they have their own private island which you reach by their very nice ten minute ferry ride but you must keep in mind that it can take quite some time and walking to get down to ferry from the main level, plus you are dependent on ferry times, with last one coming back at 5 PM before sunset. In short, this is not a resort where you can simply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153head down to the beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! You must also be sure not to forget anything as returning to your hotel room will likely not be an option (although there are two stores on island that sell basic beach stuff). As I said, for us this was fine and just part of the experience staying there. Beaches themselves were very nice with palm trees and palapas for much needed shade. We had no problem finding chairs even though the resort was 100% full. Minor problem was that beach on one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153side\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of island had little breezes and quite a bit of seagrass in front, while beach on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other side\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (beaches are actually connected) had lots of broken coral in the water. Having water shoes can help with this problem. We all enjoyed being in the ocean and despite these pieces of coral everywhere in water, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be the kind that can cut you (just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bother\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd you). The beach area was quite crowded though with lots of people around (and probably 500 + chairs) so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come here expecting a quiet, secluded beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more like a beach at an all-inclusive. There is a small deserted island not far away which I actually swam to and walked to but most people rent kayaks from resort to explore. Fun. Snorkeling off the beach was half decent. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m spoiled and used to much better but if you swim around and find the right area you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see some stuff. We had lunches at the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resto and again enjoyed. Service can be slow but no different than any other Caribbean island. They have a putting green and free putters and balls which we had fun playing. They also have full washrooms. We rented car on our second day from Enterprise which has a desk in hotel. Can take some time to actually get your car as only one computer at desk but we were glad to have one as ventured out to some great spots like El Yunque rainforest and good restuarants. Hotel is only about fifteen minutes from Walgreens, Walmart, Mcd's, Pizza Hut etc... After third day and given we were using car we found that it was becoming just too long a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153schlep\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be heading up and down from Marina level to car and so we switched to room up in main section on top which we found much more convenient (The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kicker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had been when I realized the night before that I was pretty sure I had left my camcorder and camera in bag in truck of car and wanted to be sure so left room and set stop watch: it took me 35 minutes to head up from marina to car park and back with quite a bit of walking!) We had lunch by the beautiful main pool up top which we enjoyed as well as another good dinner down at the Ballyou bar and grill in the marina section near the water. All these restos were outdoors and on the casual side and prices were fine for resort. Check out was fine, with no problems with our bill. Only complaint and reason we give 4 stars and not 5 was that we found the resort was a bit rough around the edges. For example, my wife and two kids got stuck in an elevator for ten minutes which was hot and scary. At one point one of the two funiculars was broken which meant for a 15 minute wait for one. Up at main level we found both key elevators not working for a few hours one morning so had to find others. I elected not to bring my laptop as I had called and was told that there was a business center I could use any time - problem was that for the entire five days we were there the three computers in the center were all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of order\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. One night we took kids to game room which requires tokens but both machines were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of order\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. One night I went to get ice and both machines on our floor had no ice. You kind of get the picture. Having said that we know that we would definitely return to this resort which we felt was of very good value given the time of year. If anyone has any more questions about the El Conq you can PM me.", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cNot quite what we expected\u201d", "Author": "LFWright", "ReviewID": "UR18697643", "Content": "If you are used to staying at high-end 4 or 5 star resorts, this is probably not the right resort for you. Although the property is somewhat nice and the views are spectacular, this resort is absolutely not worth the money. All the reviews about broken elevators and service problems are absolutely accurate. We stayed in the marina area and to get to the room, we had to ride the funculars up and down the hillside. When they were working, it wasn't an issue. However, if one of them was broken, it took forever to get to the room or up to the resort. There is no alternative way to get down to the marina so it wasn't the best experience. Although our room was renovated and well decorated, the new decor couldn't make up for the major ant problem in the room (even though we were on the top floor and didn't leave food out) and the cleanliness of the room. Minor renovations were also needed but obviously not attended to. Although there is a resort shuttle to/from the airport, they didn't bother telling us that the ride was $140. It just showed up on our bill. The service is slow at this resort (our iron broke and it took an hour to get a new one) and the room service is outrageously slow and expensive. It took an hour each time (and they were 15 minutes later than promised) and 2 breakfast egg plates w/ coffee will run you $85. On the positive side, the food and service at the restaurants is great. Although expensive, we don't mind paying for good food and service. I highly recommend Blossom's and The Stingray Cafe for dinner. For lunch, we loved the Ballyhoo bar/grill outside in the marina. The casino doesn't comp and they only have blackjack and Caribbean Stud tables, and slots, but we enjoyed the time we spent there. The highlight of our trip was our fishing excursion with Capt. Marcos of Light Tackle Paradise. We booked through the hotel (big mistake - they pocket $250 of the fee). I definitely recommend Capt. Marcos' fishing trips, though. Call him directly at 787-FISHING. His rates are very affordable and it'll be worth it!! I should probably mention that we have stayed twice at the Atlantis and that resort really sets the bar high for other resorts in the Caribbean. In comparison, the El Conquistador isn't even close. The Atlantis is expensive too, but worth it. There is so much to see and do for free that this resort doesn't offer. If it rains at the El Con, your only alternative is the casino or stay in the room.

I regularly felt like there were people right in my room with me... that's how clear and loud the conversations were. The only thing this hotel has going for it is its beautiful location. My biggest complaint was the food. As a vegetarian, I expect that my choices will be limited. But I also expect that restaurant & hotel staff will at least TRY to accommodate my needs. I'm really not that picky. I was here with a convention of 500+ people. When I asked for a vegetarian meal at lunch, I was told \"we don't have anything for you\" (and then they put a plate of meat in front of me.) That's all. So I was forced to go order lunch at the outdoor bar (for another $25 for a very simple meal). At dinner, I was told that they could make me a \"vegetable plate\". What they brought me was an enormous pile of boiled broccoli, boiled asparagus, and boiled green beans. I went hungry that night because none of the other restaurants would serve me (because our convention had booked those restaurants). I tried room service once. I was put on hold and the operator never came back. I gave up after 5+ minutes. I ordered a salad (take-out) from one of the restaurants.

Myself, husband & 15 year old daughter. Pros: beautiful views from most areas of the resort; lots of shopping, dining, activities. Especially liked the Godiva chocolate shop - it made for a great dessert stop in the evenings. The rooms are large, recently renovated, well-equipped. Las Brisas breakfast buffet was excellent and the view fantastic! We also ate at the Italian and Japanese tepanyaki restaurants - both were very good, although expensive. Food at Iguana's on Palomino Island was just average, but it came quickly even when they were very busy. Service in general was good - friendly, helpful employees. Lastly, we thought the Cocqui waterpark area was beautiful. There is an infinity edge pool right near the ocean that we really liked. Much nicer than the pools in the main part of the resort. Even though there were lots of kids around, it seemed more peaceful. Rides were limited, but fun. I would definitely recommend it, especially for those with younger children. Cons: Of course, very expensive, but we expected that. I don't feel we got too bad a deal because we did an American Express package that included 1 free night, breakfast for two each morning & one-day Cocqui waterpark passes for each of us. We also stopped & bought some food & beer, wine, etc, so that we wouldn't always be buying the $10 drinks. (which were very good, by the way, especially on Palomino Island.) The poor quality of the pools & beach areas were my main objection. Be aware that the main pool areas are very shallow (like 3-4 feet), so not very good for adults to swim in. The water was also very warm & a bit cloudy. Having a pool at home - I know what it means when the water gets cloudy - something's growing in there that you don't want! Also, there were areas where the columns & tile around the pool areas were crumbling. Bit surprising considering how nicely maintained the rooms were. There were two hot tubs - but one wasn't heated at all. Oh - and if you have any physical disabilities - DO NOT stay here - for some reason, they can't seem to keep the elevators in working order. Biggest negative was Palomino Island - it's fine if you just want to sit in the chair & enjoy the scenery. However, almost no swimmable areas, lots of rock & seagrass as others have said. I've been to lots of other Caribbean resorts that dredge out swimming areas - for what this resort charges - they could afford to do that. We are also into snorkeling & found that to be poor. We also wanted to rent waverunners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the rental stand was never staffed. And you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk around the island coastline very far, either. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mostly rocky along the shore except for the one beach area. The resort has really only developed a small area of the island, the rest is undeveloped scrub brush. Last negative - it is rather isolated - this didn't bother us for the first three days -there's enough to do for that long, but by the 4th day my daughter & I were ready to go somewhere a little more lively. The only evening entertainment is dining & the casino. To sum up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for an upscale Caribbean resort similar to what you would find on other islands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like Bahamas or Virgin Islands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare. We went because we wanted to hike the rain forest & swim in the Biobay (both excellent, by the way!).

While I am not cheap by any means, this hotel went far beyond my budget. A lot of walking is required and climbing stairs to get to various places in the hotel. There is even a tram to take you to different areas. HOTEL: Upon arrival we paid for an ocean view room with 2 queen beds. (For 4 people). They gave us a shoe box sized room with a garden view. They offered us an ocean view with one full and an air mattress. That was unacceptable! They finally upgraded us to La Casitas, off the main hotel up on a hill where we had to be driven there, in a golf cart or a mini van if we got lucky, because it is too far from the main hotel (the driver expected a tip every time). Although the room was large and the view was beautiful they only offer 2 full size beds, which was a problem for us since we were four. We were also put on the second floor with a long flight of stairs to climb. There were also multiple long flights of stairs down to the pool, which was a huge problem because I was with my parents who are in their late 60s and my mother has health issues, they were not fit enough for the climbing and long walk. To get to the main hotel we had to call the hotel transportation and wait outside to be picked up which took anywhere from 10-15 minutes, just to get to a restaurant to eat. The second day we demanded the ocean view room we originally paid for, we argued on the phone 3 times and they made us wait 2 hours while they discussed whether they would move us. We threatened to leave and they finally moved us to the ocean view room with 2 queen beds on the first floor in the main hotel. To go down to the marina in order to get to the water park, ferry to Palomino Island (the beach) or the shops and bar & grill, we had to take an elevator down, walk across the entire hotel, and then take a tram down. The tram usually had a long wait because so many people needed to get on it. PLEASE NOTE: there is NO BEACH AT THE HOTEL. You need to take the ferry to what they call their private beach, which is their ONLY beach. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 at the beach is also extremely overpriced and they give you barely enough food to hold you for an hour. FOOD: I know resorts usually have expensive food, but the prices were just not a little expensive, they were OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. There is no choice but to eat within the resort and ALL the restaurants are overpriced. There were no reasonable prices or even \"just a little expensive\" places to eat. It doesn't make sense to rent a car to try to find food cheaper off the resort because parking at the resort is $15/day. Besides the cost of renting a car, and there really are no decent places to eat outside the resort. Be prepared to spend between $15 - 22 for a hamburger and fries. Breakfast, lunch and dinner averaged over $100/meal for four people. Also be prepared to WAIT 30-40 minutes for your food everywhere. La Caribe gave me and my mother our breakfast after 30 minutes and gave my father his 20 minutes later, with no apologies. The drinks were incredibly watered down. I ordered a few alcoholic drinks that had almost no alcohol in them. The tropical drinks go from $12 - 15 a drink. And don't expect fancy tropical drinks. They are in regular plastic cups or hurricane glasses. The sandwich shop you can get a sandwich from 9pm to 1am at $10 and up. But be prepared to wait on a huge line then wait another 20 minutes for them to make the sandwich, and they expect a gratuity even though it's considered \"take out\". SERVICE: Besides not getting the right room when we arrived, then giving us the run around the next day to get the right room and waiting hours, the first day at La Casitas I needed a hair dryer. There was none in the room. I called the front desk at 8 in the morning; I didn't receive the dryer until 9am. The hotel elevators did not work. There were two and one was broken for the entire week. The plumbing is awful! The water pressure is way too low in the showers and the water is always luke warm. The room at the main hotel had no coffee maker...forcing us to buy the overpriced coffee at Starbucks in the lobby, or go to Daniels Cookies, another coffee shop where they expect a gratuity for making your coffee. On the way home we called for a bell hop to take our luggage out front and were told there was a 30 minute wait. We could not wait because we had to get on the bus to the airport in 20 minutes. There is a small internet room with 4 computers with free internet. 3 were constantly not working and one was always being used. The staff is not very willing to help with anything and half of them were very rude! KIDS/WATER PARK If you have kids there is a water park that is $20 /person for 3 slides. That's about all that encompasses the \"water park\". Long lines to use the slides. We went here because I have a 15 year old son. If you don't like kids don't come here! It's crawling with small kids running around, screaming and crying constantly.. AND they are up ALL night long!!! There is NO QUIET place in the hotel! NIGHTLIFE There pretty much is none. There is a small night club with not much going on, and usually empty at night. CASINO Forget about getting any complimentary \"free drinks and sandwiches\". There are NO waiters to be seen offering anything. But there is a bar in there to buy drinks. And the machines don't pay out at all! POOLS/ BEACH The pools are nice but loaded with kids! Get there early! The beaches are beautiful but again, get there early to get an umbrella or you'll have to rent one for the day. Any activities at the beach again, are very expensive. SIGHTSEEING Don't expect to do any sight seeing after exhausting all your funds for food and activities at this hotel. Just to go to Old San Juan for \"shopping\", its $50 per person. We did no sight seeing. SHOPS I know its to be expected, but I have to mention, yes.. everything in the shops are triple the amount of what you would pay at home. IN CONCLUSION For such an expensive place it is NOT WORTH it. Be prepared to spend a fortune on food, wait in long lines for virtually everything, and get aggravated by the less the helpful staff! If you are elderly or handicapped, or even have health issues, don't go here. If you don't like kids, don't come here. If you don't have tons of money to waste, don't come here!

Many things have stayed the same over the years. The food is still banal and high priced. It is also distinctly not very Puerto Rican - I don't mind so much because I don't really like PR cuisine (No flaming please! I lived in Viejo San Juan for 6 months and tried hard to keep an open mind. Just don't like it!) Some things have improved: the boats to Palamino are bigger, more steady and faster; the health club is bigger and better. The biggest change for us was the addition of our son during this last trip. He was 2 1/2 at the time and the waterpark had just opened. Watching his eyes light up as we tried to track down Coquis, floating down the Lazy River, dipping our toes in the ocean, spashing around in the pools, trying his hand at mini mini golf (they have really small clubs at the towel counter on Palamino!) -- it was Magic all over again! For this trip, there was one annoying thing: we had gone out of our way to arrange through the concierge for a driver to pick us up at a residence in Condado and transport us WITH A CARSEAT to Fajardo. We spoke at least 3 times to specifically make sure that the CARSEAT would be the right size, etc. Well, at the appointed hour, the driver showed up in an enormous vehicle - the kind that shuttles you to a car rental office from the airport! - with no carseat whatsoever. In fact, not even so much as a seatbelt. All for much more than the price of El Con's normal airport shuttle. On the plus side, we stayed at the Casitas.

In hindsight this probably took about 45 min but my boyfriend and I were on vacation - what's the rush? The island has plenty of activities and seating to lay back and relax. Spending $15 on water daily became ridiculous so after a couple of days we rented a car and headed to the local supermarket about 25 minutes away to get water and snacks. Dansani water is 3 bucks a pop on the resort. If you decide to take the bioluminescent bay tour don't pay the hotel's fee of $90. Walk down to the marina around 5:30 pm, pass the parking lot into the local Park (if you can call it a park). The kayaking tour guides line up and for $40 will give you a 3 hour tour.

The waterpark was perfect for them. They had a zero entry pool with a little kids slide and the pool goes as deep as 4'6 so you can actually swim a little. They had 3 larger waterslides and my 3 year old was able to go onto the slide that requires an intertube (they have tandems and singles) and my 6 year old could do one of the other slides by herself. There are additional pools up at the main hotel to use also. Everyday we went to Palomino Island to unwind a little and we all enjoyed this part of the day as well. The boat ride was something my kids thought was fun to do. The island is nice, has bathrooms, and a restaurant. I would be careful into the ocean as it is pretty rocky initially but gets better as you go further in. It remains shallow for quite a distance from shore. The Island and the Coqui waterpark only takes room charge and no cash transactions. Everywhere else they give you a choice. The rooms were nice and clean and maid service came early and did a good job. Believe the reviews about food prices. The food prices are very inflated however, if you prepare yourself then there should be no issue. The water in the room is $7 per bottle, however in the main lobby you can get a bottle for $2.25 or at Starbucks for $2.50 per bottle. Ballyhoo was the only place that we had a bad experience with dining. We ate at Stingrays and had good food and good service. There is a restaurant up by the main lobby that overlooks the pool that has the lowest priced menu that we had seen...the menu is limited but with kids a hotdog or pizza is just fine for them! As I mentioned we had purchased the package which included the daily buffet breakfast for 4, daily entry to the water park full day, and our transportation to and from the hotel. For us this worked out well. There was one small error on our hotel bill and it was easily taken care of no problems at all. There were no surprise surcharges other then the ones you had charged to your room. The package includes all the taxes and resort fees so you have a clear idea of how much your vacation will cost you.

We traveled from April 19- 24th We stayed at the LAS OLAS SECTION OF THE RESORT in my opinion this is the best part to be in.... Centrally located to everything... need to take the funicular up to the main level but you can go down to the Marina by stairs if you choose to.. you also have a pool to your selves at the Las Olas... I feel it is more relaxing than the main level of the resort. The food is good... The better restaurants like the Strip house, Otellos and Blossoms are excellent. They are alittle pricey but I am from New York so I am used to expensive. There is alot of walking at this resort but that is okay because everywhere you go the views are absolutely breathtaking. I hope whoever wants to go to this resort does not get discouraged by the poor reviews that some people have made. We went to the waterpark 3 times while there my son Justin who is 11 loved it and SO DID I..... The beach is also something to see.. The ocean is so clean and gorgeous... I am definetly going back to the EL CONQUISTADOR IN the very near future. I Have nothing bad to say about this resort Oh I even won money at the casino... I will be posted some photos shortly.....

Ages ranged from 3 to 65. We stayed at the Las Casitas Village at El Conquistador. Having vacationed last year at the Atlantis Paradise Island, we could not help but compare the two. I will try to enter a comparison somewhere on this site First - Positive points on Las Casitas: 1) The villas and the grounds were absolutely beautiful, very clean, spacious and tastefully done. You are surrounded by gorgeous views of the Atlantic and the surrounding countryside including the mountainous rain forest \"El Yunque\" in the near distance 2)We were no more than 10 steps from a roman pool with two hot tubs and a short walk to the beautiful Infinity pool with one hot tub and a view which is magnificent. You are perched high above the Atlantic facing Palomino Island. Fantastic 3) Staff was extremely helpful and eager to be of service - joyfully. Some language problems but nothing you can't work thru. You have to be persistent sometimes to get towels, toilet paper. etc but eventually they will deliver 4) Golf course right behind the Las Casitas village so if you are a golfer this is where you should stay 5) Walking around Las Casitas villas is easy and soft on the feet. 6) There is one small restaurant at Las Casitas. They will bring you food and drink at the Infinity Pool 7) We used room service and Blossom (Chinese and Japanese ) main hotel restaurant delivery quite a bit. Food was good Overall: 1) If you want to visit Old San Juan and El Yunque (the rain forest) you will need a car or arrange for a tour. I highly recommend Emmanuel \"Manny\" Mulero - 787-863-7312 -he arranged all our activities at the last moment and on a holiday and came through.I called him \"The King of Puerto Rico\". He was cheaper than the hotel services as well. We also went on the banana boat and snorkeling too - great experience 2) You may want to skip the kayaking. It was fun but somewhat difficult - it is pitch black - you do this at night time, you kayak through a mangrove swamp to get to a bay where if you swish your hands in the water it glows. Nice but I am not sure it was worth the effort although I am happy we did it. We felt like Indiana Jones.:-)) 3) Las Casitas is set off on its own. I like this but be prepared to take the shuttle back and forth to the main hotel and the marina. We all enjoyed the shuttle rides thru the golf course. We never waited more than 5 - 6 minutes for the shuttle 4) Beach on Palomino Island is nice but we had difficulty getting clean chairs in the shade. It is somewhat annoying to have to travel by boat to get to the beach but it is a fun ride 5) Water park is small - three slides, small Lazy River and a nice infinity pool 6) Casino is very small with lots of penny and nickel slots. 7) Some shopping on site - enough for me but not all my family agreed 8) Pool at main hotel was nice - bigger than the Las Casitas pools but not huge 9) Somewhat expensive - a bit higher than the Atlantis 10) No teen club yet 11) On the weekend, it was crowded. Local people stay at the hotel on those days. Not packed with people but more crowded and noisy then during the week Everyone enjoyed their stay and had a great time. My three year old grand-daughter cried when we had to leave.

Was there on a company retreat. Weather was not great, windy, overcast and at times rainy. The resort was ok but far from great. Its actaully divided up into several different areas that are spread out across their property...really spread out. We stayed in the part of the resort down by the Marina. Rooms were fine, nothing special but clean and nicely appointed. Would suggest that you get a room on the top floor at the marina so that you get high ceilings, and one thats on the corner so that you get an extra window. Each room had a DVD player and a nice LCD tv. (Had to unplug the DVD video cable from the tv to get the tv to show channels and the remote was missing batteries when we got there.) The rooms each have a balcony which was great for sitting and having a glass of wine at the end of the day. I suggest buying a bottle/and or snacks at one of the many general stores instead of the restaraunt/ bar..The rooms each have fridges that you can use to put what ever you buy.- but no snacks or drinks were in the room. (these could have been removed by my company ? ) The draw back to the marina was that in order to get to the main part of the hotel you needed to take a tram up from the seaside level the top level, then walk a long hall way to an elevator to the main hotel...sound like alot ? It is. The positives are that you are down on the water and by the water park and the boat that takes you to the resort's private beach island. If you are up top, it takes a long tme to get to these attractions. In short, the resort was ok, good for a company event as it has everything a big company event needs, but its really lacking in charm, charater and the layout leaves a lot to be desired.", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cWedding Planning at El Conquistador\u201d", "Author": "quetee_02", "ReviewID": "UR15055858", "Content": "Overview I stayed at El Conquistador with my mother for two non-consecutive nights while we are planning for my wedding which will take place there summer 2009. Coming from New York and my mother from Ohio, this trip was basically to sell her on why I want a destination wedding and more importantly, why I think El Conquistador is a wonderful venue for such an occasion. Accommodations We arrived and parked our car in the adjacent lot. We then took a short shuttle ride to check-in where we were greeted warmly by the front desk. Our room was an ocean-view room in Las Brisas. The attendant who walked us there with our bags was very friendly and quickly got us up to speed on the layout of the resort and answered any questions we had. The room was spacious and appointed with everything we needed. The attendant even explained the motion-sensor sliding glass doors off the balcony. The bright colors of the room were refreshing and for us two ladies, we really appreciated the well-lit spacious size of the bathroom. We could both move around freely when it was time to get ready to go out. Another layout feature I liked was the walk-in closet within the bathroom. This made it very easy to get ready in the morning after showering without waking the other person who was still sleeping. While these statements are true for both of the two Las Brisas rooms we had during our visit, the first room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tub was not as clean as it should have been, but it was a minor disappointment. Finally, we really liked the toiletry products as they smelled very crisp and even stayed on all day. When returning to New York I continued to use the lotion as it reminded me of the resort! Spa Facilities I had visited the property the year prior for a couples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 massage but this was without an overnight visit. I found the attendants to be very gracious and the facilities superb. I found it to be a very soothing environment so on this trip I thought my mom should get to experience it especially because she had just come from 20\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of snow in Ohio. I called the day of the appointment I wanted and easily was able to get her a massage appointment. Because there are other amenities to take advantage of, I made sure she arrived almost one hour before her appointment. When returning after the appointment, my mom looked so refreshed! She said it was one of the best massages she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever had and also enjoyed meeting other ladies in the lounge. She also mentioned that she liked the whirlpool and spent some time there relaxing afterwards. Coqui Water Park While my mom was at the spa, my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I decided to check out the new water park. We had heard quite a bit about it and wanted to see it for ourselves. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located at the bottom of the funicular which was a an easy ride. It cost $20/person for admission and it actually took quite a while to gain entrance as the computer processing was very slow. I understand that while we were there the front desk was undergoing training so tickets could be purchased there as to speed up the entrance time. Regarding our experience, we found it to be more appropriate for children although there were some larger slides. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it to be worth the $20 admission although the inner tubes were included in the price, but I can see the appeal for families. We also liked the lazy river, but I wish there had been a whirlpool portion along the river as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen at other water parks. We also would have liked to have lockers available as we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want feel comfortable leaving them wrapped in our towels on the beach chairs. We were sure to be very vigilant. Overall, I think this was a good addition for the resort and my wedding guests with children will probably enjoy it. Blossoms My fianc\u00c3\u00a9, mom and I went to Blossoms for dinner. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe a reservation was required, but we made one and were promptly seated when we arrived. I ordered the orange beef which was delicious, while my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 had a beef peppercorn dish which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as spicy as was advertised (he likes spicy!) and my mom had a seafood dish which she enjoyed. The only complaint was that the waiter didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring chopsticks when I asked and I also thought it was odd that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have chopsticks out on the table already as it was an Asian restaurant. This obviously wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep me from returning, but it was just an observation. Overall, we were pleased with the restaurant. Wedding Planning Offices For anyone considering a wedding at El Conquistador, the staff is very easy to work with. Although you can only reserve one year prior and not before, they were still willing to meet with me and answer all of my questions. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9, mother and I took a tour of the facilities and discussed our timeline. As a nice touch, they sent up a fruit and cheese plate after our meeting. My mom and I really appreciated their attention to detail and look forward to having my wedding here next year.", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "ntj", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place!\u201d", "Author": "ntj", "ReviewID": "UR14992446", "Content": "To all of the people who wrote negative revies...This place is huge!

We did know that it was very expensive to get to the hotel via shuttle so we decided to rent cars. It was definitely the way to go. Thrifty had the best price for a car and it was a 40 minute easy drive to the hotel. I should start by saying that I booked our trip through AMEX Platinum Business travel and were given an automatic upgrade on arrival with comp breakfast for two, normally $25 per person. The hotel grounds were very beautiful and kept very clean. We were in a recently renovated room and the view was beautiful. The bathroom was quite large with a seperate walk in closet. The room itself was beautiful, clean and well maintained. We found the staff to be very helpful and accommodating. We too were there during the Chase and Bank Of America corporate events and my husband was unable to get a tee time because of it. They certainly do cater to the needs of their corporate events over the \"regular\" guests. We were fortunate to be there the week after Easter and the resort was pretty empty or so it seemed. Our kids really loved the water park and we spent two full days there. We were able to really relax as the park was small enough that we were able to keep an eye on the kids at all times. It was safe and extremely clean. The snack bar served decent food also. The spa was beautiful and the massage was fantastic. Food Prices - I will say that there were restaurants that were slightly overpriced but we are from New Jersey/New York and we're used to paying top dollar for food anyway. You're on vacation; if you constantly worry about the price of food this resort is not the place for you. For the people whining about the prices should stay at a 2 star all inclusive resort and eat the same food everyday! There was a McD's and Church's Fried Chicken 5 minutes from the hotel for the complainers! The hibachi restaurant and Stingray restaurant were fantastic. Casino - STAY AWAY! You'll never win in this casino! Palomino Island - Very beautiful and definitely worth the trip. Short private boat ride from the resort.

The ferry to this private island was a short 7 minute ride and very relaxing so it was not a problem for us. Once we were there, we stayed until the last ferry returned at 5:30. I do recommend bringing you own bottled water and snacks as things are very pricey - $6.00 for a virgin Caribbean Breeze and $8 if you want it with alcohol. The only negative I will say is the food cost. This I hope will change over time as people like us write our reviews. One night we ate at Blossoms (Japanesse place) and it was $160 for 3 people and 1 glass of wine - way over board for mediocre food.

We received a great offer to come back and visit after the renovations were completed so we found ourselves back in La Marina February 9-16th of 2008. The rooms are bright and tasteful, if somewhat IKEA in style. All of the standard upgrades that you would expect; flat screen tv, better bedding, more spa products in the room. The service remains consistently friendly. Not once in either one of our trips did we have poor service. I honestly don't get the horror stories that I read here about poor/lackluster service. Giovanni Jones was outstanding, professional, and really went above and beyond to insure satisfaction. Everyone from the bellmen to the valets to housekeeping were very outgoing and approachable. The food is another story. We are from New England and have an abundace of great restaurants so it is always a fun challenge to find the same quality. The Strip House and Blossoms, the Japanese restaurant were good. Stingrays, the seafood restaurant (remember where we're from) was a bust. Prices overall are high. We rented a car so we were not at the mercy of the resort 24/7 and ate out on a few occassions. They did a nice job on the water park with many different alternatives for swimming, staffed by a young enthusastic group. The landscaping was not complete so it wasn't that appealing to look at, but it was functional, and fun! Palomino Island, boatride and all, is a refreshing change from the 1/4 mile strip of beach you sometimes end up sharing with 10 other resorts. The golf course was in good shape and getting a tee time was never a problem. My only negative would be the prices of the food. Since we got such a great rate tto stay there this year, we really didn't mind paying on the high side for food. Unfortunately we have not received another generous offer to return (that renovation cost some serious cash). We've gotten the standard offer that they are marketing to everyone ($75 resort credit for a 2-night stay, and so on).

I heard it was formerly some type of university. The absence of a beach concerned me, but the shuttle to the private island worked well, and we really enjoyed our time out there.

I just felt like it was a constant attempt to extract money from us. It really ruined our vacation. The cream of the rip off was the shuttle service from the airport. Most hotels are so glad to have you , they give you free shuttle service to and from the hotel. We were charged 832 dollars for our group of 14 on the day we check out. Nice surprise. It would be one thing if they warned you or mentioned it anywhere, but no, they left he surprise for the last day. The bus that brought us there had a terrible mildew smell inside, and the video system broke down that was to give us orientation to the island, then the transmission went out, and we had to go 1 mile per hour for the last 1/4 mile.

My experience with the resort started poorly and failed to improve over the 4 days that I was there. Things started with a luggage mixup in which we had inadvertently grabbed the wrong suitcase from baggage claim at the airport. We realized the problem immediately upon arrival at the hotel and contacted the Concierge desk to assist in sorting things out. They were the most hapless group of individuals I came across while at the hotel and probably at any hotel I have stayed at in the past 20 years. It took almost a day and a half to get our suitcase even though we had confirmed that the correct bag was at the airport and the hotel made countless roundtrips to and from the airport each day. After countless screw-ups, lies, and conflicting stories, we relieved the Concierge team of the task of retrieving our bag and made the trip back to the airport ourselves. We were able to get our bag within minutes. The hotel itself was clearly, at one time, an impressive resort. Now it has the feel of a place that is clearly living on past glory. The room, we were in had clearly never been renovated since it was originally built and it had a 1980's feel to it. I will say, however, that the room was large and spacious. The rest of the hotel could use a facelift too - or at least a good painting. Instead they seem to invest in attractions like a water park or new bungalows, while the main hotel continues to deteriorate. I don't get it. The food and activities were very expensive. One expects this at a resort, especially one that is as isolated as the El Con. They have a license to gouge and they use it. Expect to pay double what you would at home. If you decide to do activities, don't book through the hotel. By way of example, the hotel charged $90 for the luminescent bay kayaking trip - we took the exact same trip for $35 by walking around the corner from the hotel.

The resort has some good qualities, but it one of the worst value vacations we have ever experienced. It has the ambiance, food quality, and feel of a mid-range \"Sandals\" type resort, but is priced like a Ritz Carlton. We spent almost $3000 on a 4 day trip there, with a middle-road \"Ocean View\" room (actually we were given a blocked view, but that's another story). Bottom line - 4 days in Hawaii could be done for this price, or 2 weeks in a similar quality all-inclusive adult or family resort. The problems seemed to be mainly service based, rather than facility based (other than them giving us the wrong room and refusing to acknowledge it). We are very seasoned travelers and have spent time in the Carribean, Mexico, Africa, Europe, and all over small towns in the US - so we are not sheltered Yankees with bad attitudes - I promise. We maintained our patience the whole time but by the end of the trip we were ready to go home, which is not typical for a 4 day weekend in a supposed luxury resort. Waiters/waitresses were understaffed, had bad attitudes, and were not attentive. Pricing throughout the resort was ridiculous (every meal was $50 for two people, usually a salad and sandwich with soda). On top of that, there was no authentic Puerto Rican twist, not even a local type restaurant, on the resort. It could have been located anywhere. I would suggest to the resort that they space out their conventions or add a convention wing to separate convention guests from other guests. They actually closed the main pool on 2 out of the 4 days we were there for the corporate parties, which for us was pretty disheartening. There were 2 conventions while were there - Chase and B of A, back to back. This was a big spring break week, too, so it was 100% capacity. The resort should not have booked the hotel to 100% capacity, as the restaurants and staff were not able to handle it. Again, attitudes were poor, guests were grumbling, and many people's room bills had invalid charges. I would recommend spending 4 days at the Mirage or Caesar's in Las Vegas, or heading to an all inclusive mega resort in the Carribean or Mexico instead of spending your money at El Conquistador.

We also ate dinner at Cafe Bella Vista by the main pool, for 4 people with drinks and desert it was about $100. There are also off site restaurants that are good. We ate at Metropol and Calizo in Fajardo and both were great. Overall this was a beautiful resort and a good place for a vacation.

We had breakfast in our room every morning. I would recommend lunch when you can at the little Sweet Corner Cafe near the funicular. We ate lunch there a few times for around $30 for 4 people. You will pay 60-80 at the other places. We traveled off the resort for dinner. There is a Sizzler about 10 minutes away by car in Fajardo off rt. 3. In addition, there are other fast food choices like Wendys and Mcdonalds. We ate one meal at Blossoms for $130. The food and service was average. The room itself was pretty nice. We had trouble with no hot water one morning. The pools and water park were nice. The grounds and views at the resort are outstanding. The resort was crowded since it was Easter break for families. I saw an advertisement(we stayed near the airport on the last night) for Puerto Rico residents for 129 a night. I paid 185 plus taxes.

After a long flight and drive to the hotel, my boyfriend, 16-year old daughter and I were looking forward to unloading our luggage and enjoying some late afternoon sun. We arrived around 1:30 PM, and we had to wait until 4:00 PM for the room to be available. In the meantime, we enjoyed a $90 lunch (sandwiches and salads) and walked the property. Our room was located on Level 2, Las Olas. The only way to reach this area is via the tram, which is very slow-moving and holds 20-30 people max. Our room was decent enough, but being stuck in the middle of the cliff was less than appealing. Getting to the marina and lower-level restaurants was easy as stairs are available. However, going up is a challenge - no stairs and only one of the two trams stops at Las Olas. Service was fairly good in the restaurants, especially the Stingray Cafe'. However, stay clear of Iguana Grill on the island - horrible, horrible service at a mere price of $105. A rental car was not in our original plan, but after reviewing the prices of trips to San Juan, the rental fee was the better option. Having a car also allowed us to eat off-site, and the restaurants in Farjardo are much better and affordably priced. Do not book excursions through the hotel - there is about a $30 markup on the Snorkel and Catamaran trip alone. We called a company in the Fajardo area and booked a trip for $60 each - 5.5 hours and it included lunch. The same trip was $98 through the hotel. By the end of the trip, we vowed never to return. The hotel is too large in size to receive personal service and the prices are not justifiable. I do not mind paying money for good food, but $18 for a tuna sandwich is a bit overboard. Tips if you stay at this hotel: (1) Get to Starbucks early or very late - the line many times went outside to the pool area; (2) a few restaurants are located near the service gate. It costs $20 each way for a cab to go about a mile (from the lobby to the entrance). Ask the bell captain to drive you there by golf cart or parking shuttle. We enjoyed La Estacion and Calizo without paying a dime in cab fare. La Estacion is very close to the service gate and Calizo is about 0.3 miles away (although no shoulder). There are also restaurants with 0.5 miles of the marina area at the bottom of the resort.; (3) rent a car - it will save you a ton of money; and (4) look off-site for excursions.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "morris county", "Title": "\u201cMade Great New Friends\u201d", "Author": "horsedadMorrisCounty", "ReviewID": "UR14620954", "Content": "I read alot of the reviews on this site.

It does take away from the resort. Be aware the ugly American has arrived. (and I'm from New Jersey, LOL.) Bottom line, we made many new friends. Jessica Colon, the concierge supervisor is the kindest, most caring person we have run across in many hotels. Well before our trip we lost two family members. Jessica, was so kind and attentive that I decided to take a private car to the resort instead of the bus provided. Just to pick up flowers for her. Jessica set us up with Millinium Limos. Pedro the owner (whom I never met) provided superior service. Nestor, our friend and driver was fantastic. I could not imagine the island without Nestor. Nestor, took us and our friends to Old San Juan. His knowledge and experience made our trip second to none. Norman, the bell captain, truly, made us feel like family. I know that Norman is now welcome in our home, as we are in his. We spent alot of time talking to him. He is a wonderful person. Selelnia, our server at the pool, was wonderful. Luis, Louis and Juan were also great. However, Selenia was the best. We adopted each other. Not knowing that adopting one was adopting all the servers. It got to the point that we were hugging so many people we thought we were family. It was nice. Restaurants We never had a bad meal. You do have to exercise your will at Blossom. The Japanese Hibachi side will go really fast unless you control the timing. StripHouse, Great NYC steakhouse. NYC prices. StingRay, good food, when busy they put tables on the walkway. Ask for the terrace or inside. Otellos, got to be served by Christian and his crew. Dancing, singing and phenom service. Again, I think they are coming to live at my house and they are welcome, LOL. Martini Bar, violin music while relaxing before or after dinner. Anyway, expensive. We saw many people being rude to the staff because of prices. Heard many people abusing the staff for no rational reason other than they were disgruntled over prices. Good dinning at the pool at night, I heard. Bottom line we could hardly walk through the resort with out hugging, embracing and kissing staff members As a matter of fact, other guests were rather rude to us because we never waited for a table, everyone knew our name and we never waited in a line. Also didn't play the towel game either. Ask if a convention is booked. Ask if the resort is full. Then meet your extended family. The El Conquistador staff will surprise you if given the chance.

We had a good week, but were very disappointed by several aspects of the hotel. First, the food was uniformly terrible, not to mention overpriced. The hotel has many restaurants; we tried 7 or 8 of them and never found one that could make a decent meal aside from breakfast (but, how hard is it to make scrambled eggs, bacon and fresh fruit?). Service was friendly, which is fortunate since many restaurants automatically included a 20% gratuity on every bill. Also, there is lots of walking/traveling involved at this hotel. The Casitas are nice, set aside from the rest of the hotel. But it is a walk to everything. The hotel makes a big deal about the personal butler service that comes with the casitas. We were told we would have a butler everyday. The first day our butler, Steve, called and stopped by. He was great. Gave us some tips, brought us a DVD player (the casita only had an old VHS machine). But after a couple of days, he had 2 days off and we couldn't find anyone who was assigned to our casita. We enjoyed the water park, although it is small. It is at the bottom of the hill, accessible only by two small funiculars that travel up and down the cliff. Fun for the kids once or twice, but a drag when lots of folks are trying to go to the same place at the same time. The waterpark itself has three slides, a lazy river and a shallow area for small children to play. If your kids have been to other water parks, be sure to set their expectations fairly low. It is certainly more fun than a traditional hotel pool, but it is not that great for a water park. And not free. The tickets are about $13 for kids and $20 for adults. The beach is on a separate island. To get there, you take a free ferry ride. You can rent rafts, inner tubes and other fun things, but everything is overpriced. A kayak is $48 for an hour, for example. A noodle, $6. We rented a car from Enterprise at the front desk to tour the rain forest -- much cheaper than the $50/person for their half-day tour. And we could set our own schedule. The rain forest was beautiful and the hiking was great for kids. I highly recommend at least a 1/2 day there. We also went on a boat tour of the bioluminescent bay. Many folks take the kayak tours, but I really recommend the boat, as we got to jump in the water once we were there. I didn't see any of the kayakers getting into the water. We arranged this trip separately from the hotel with a man named Captain Suarez. He took us in a small boat with about 12 people. We would through mangroves in the dark, with Captain Suarez shining a powerful flashlight onto the mangroves. We saw huge iguanas sleeping in the trees and he pointed out lots of ither interesting nature facts. Swimming in the water was a trip. Water lighting up all around you.

Very professional, kind and effective. Also, the Golden Door Spa/Fitness Center is like an oasis of great karma. Everyone there is gracious and first rate as are the facilities. Rita Maldanado and Juan Perez, the personal trainers are the best in every respect - they are true professionals, as well as inspiring, encouraging, etc . Juan designed a personal fitness program and then throughout the stay he and Rita helped refine it. I worked out with them several times to get the program into a fluid routine. Rita and others also led some wonderful Yoga and meditation sessions which the entire family enjoyed (2 adults, 2 teenagers). One could spend all day at the Spa/Fitness Center. Sofi Valentin, Guest Services Manager of the Spa was equally terrific. The 9 pools and numerous retaurants provide a great variety of atmosphere. Palomina Island is a good beach and fun.

There are two problems with going to the beach here: 1) you have to walk a long way through the hotel, go down a cable car (funicular), board a boat and be taken to a separate island 2) the hotel has expanded drastically in recent years and there is not enough beach space to accommodate all the guests. We spent a week at the hotel during the recent winter break holiday. The staff was very kind and accommodating but they could not make up for a facility that was overwhelmed by the sheer number of guests. The hotel has added on hundreds of rooms in the last few years but they haven't been able to expand the swimming, boating, snorkeling or restaurant facilities to keep up with all the guests. In addition, the newer, nicer area where we stayed, (Las Casitas) is that much further from the main restaurants, beach facilities etc. One day we came back from the beach by one of the later boats, had a half hour wait for the funicular to get up to the hotel and then a 20 minute walk to our room. It took over an hour from the time I left the beach till I was sitting in my room. I also caution people against using the hotel's tour company to kayak into the bioluminescent bay. It is a wonderful sight and there were many other, better organized tour groups out at the same time as ours. The hotel's tour guides went ahead with the faster people in our group and left me with my 10 year old son to find the way to the bay by ourselves. We were alone in the water at night, couldn't see the way to go and were afraid to turn back. It was a very unpleasant experience. My husband enjoyed the golf course very much and was able to get tee times quite easily. My son had tennis lessons from a very good teaching pro. We found that the food was outrageously expensive and generally mediocre. We had rented a car and after a few days used it to go out for dinner every night. We discovered numerous restaurants right by the hotel serving terrific food. I particularly recommend Estacion, which cooks everything on an outdoor grill.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful location but beware . . .\u201d", "Author": "soccermomwestchester", "ReviewID": "UR14106858", "Content": "We stayed at Las Casitas during the February break this year. The location is beautiful and the unit we stayed in was very nicely appointed. Having a kitchen was a huge plus for us since we were traveling with young children. You should most definitely use the hotel service to purchase groceries upon your arrival or rent a car or taxi to go to the local supermarket (about 5 minutes from the hotel), you will save money and be better fed. There were, however, significant negatives to the hotel which would prevent us from returning: 1. It took an hour to get from our room to the beach at Palomino Island. You have to take a golf cart to the main hotel, walk about 4 city blocks through parts of the hotel, take an elevator to the tram, wait on line for the tram, wait for the boat to arrive and then travel to the island. No part of the trip was unpleasant but that is a considerable amount of time (especiallyl with kids in tow) and your entire day had to be planned around trying to get to the beach. 2. The hotel was extremely crowded (not suprisingly) because of the holiday and they seemed unprepared for the crowds. By the time we arrived at the beach they ran out of chairs, we had to wait 1 hour to pick up our lunch at the only restaurant on the island, the ice cream parlor in the main hotel ran out of most flavors and one of the restaurants we ate in even ran out of napkins. I think this also contributed to the fact that we received very poor customer service from the certain members of the hotel staff. 3. The hotel adds additional costs at every turn. Given the cost of our room per night they should not charge an additional fee ($25 per day per guest) to use the Golden Door Spa. Similarly, the $25 per person fee they charged for cancelled dinner reservations in hotel restaurants detered us from making any reservations in advance. This proved to be a wise choice because 2 of our children became sick during our visit and we would have spent $150 not to have dinner.", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cSpecatacular views & a few cash saving tips\u201d", "Author": "DCChiq", "ReviewID": "UR14102131", "Content": "Just returned from 3 nights and 4 days at El Con.

If you're looking for lavish and luxury, this is the place to go. If you're looking for the \"real Puerto Rico\", venture towards the West side of the island and don't stay here because this is truly for relaxation and luxury. The thing I liked the most about this resort is that nothing was \"set in stone\". If you needed something - they'd go above and beyond to accomodate you. If it was possible, they'd make it happen. We never heard the word \"no\" to anything we needed or asked for. Things we loved: *Cleanliness. *The room had great decor and very spacious. It had an i-home on one of the dressers which was great to prop up your i-pod while you're getting ready or just lounging on your balcony at sunrise or sunset. *Great service by the staff. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. We arrived at 11am and they let us check in early which was awesome. I recommend to stay in the main building because it will eliminate the longer walks and it's central to everything. *The amazing pools. Check out the Infinity pool in Las Casitas (not the small one by the waterpark). This Infinity pool has the most beautiful view I've ever seen. Although the pool is in Las Casitas, it is open to all guests. *Variety of tropical drinks. Try the El Conquistador. *Fridge in room. *Amazing views - the resort is located on a cliff. *Weather was at a steady 85 degrees every day (a few sprinkles once a day and there but nothing that lasted longer than 15 minutes). Things that could've been better: *Prices at the restaurants. However, there is a way around this!!! ***CASH SAVING TIPS*** -->Get a ride in to town and go to the Amigo (grocery store) and buy bottle water (Desani since that is what they use and you can get away with towing your bottled water to Palomino island). This saved us $100. -->The further you away from the \"main building\" where check in was, the cheaper things were. For example, if you walked all the way down to the marina, the bottles of water were cheaper. --> We found an all you can eat breakfast down by the marina for $18. This beat the $30 breakfast everywhere else and the quality was excellent. -->If you rent jet skiis at Palomino island and they are having a slow day with jet ski rental, they'll come down on the price.

It all ended with a $65 charge for a two hour extended check-out. The food at the independent restaurants was amazing. We ate at The Stingray Cafe at the Marina and it was great. We had sushi at the bar at Blossoms one night and it was fabulous and very reasonable. The Striphouse was very dark and we almost fell asleep (maybe too much rum) but very good food. We did not eat at Otello's but it look very nice. The food at the restaurants owned by the hotel were pretty bad. Iguana's on Palamino is aweful and it's your only choice. Palamino Island is nice. Great beach but you can only walk so far and have to turn around. Snorkeling wasn't great. If you want to go to the beach it's your only option. The first day it was great and taking the high speed catamaran was awesome! By the last day it was a total pain. It would have been so nice to be able to walk to the beach, go back to your room if you wanted, or switch to the pool in a matter of minutes. The island also closes at 5:30 so you have not choice but to come back to the resort. If you are someone who loves the late afternoon sun to read and nap find another resort. The sun goes behind the mountain at 5:15pm (at least in Feb.) so it's not an option. The swim up bar is nice but would be so better if it was in the sun at cocktail hour. The resort caters to large conventions. MTV had their Sales Meeting when we were there and if they had an event the rest of the hotel guests suffered. They closed the pool bar and blocked off areas.

The grounds are BEAUTIFUL! But, the place is so huge and there too many rooms. About the fourth day we were there, the hotel was 90% full (they have about 1,000 rooms). So, that made it less enjoyable. There were a lot of little kids and the hotel was family oriented. We stayed in the \"Las Olas\" complex and the room was great. The bathroom was clean and big. It had a fridge, which was nice, and the beds were pretty comfortable. There is a decent pool and large sunbathing deck at Las Olas that anyone can use, but not too many people ever did. This was nice, though, because it was quiet and relaxing at the pool and at our room. I would highly recommend this complex if you want a private area to stay in that is not far away from everything. Palomino Island was very nice. The first time we went over to it was in the morning (the first ferry ride over of the day), which seemed to be the best time to go. As the day went on, the beach became EXTREMELY and CRAZY CROWDED. The beach itself was very nice, though, and there is always a breeze. We snorkeled one day and rented a full set of equipment for only $15 per person. The permanent cabanas are really nice, but they get snatched up fast. The ocean was beautiful and the water was great. The ferry rides only take about 10 minutes to get there and are very smooth. The main pools are excellent. The water is very refreshing and the atmosphere is wonderful, and so is the ocean view. The Coqui Water Park was so much fun. Again, like Palomino, it became very crowded as the day went on. But, overall it was time, and money- very reasonable ticket prices- well spent. There is a slide that you go down on an inner tube, one without, and a speed slide, all of which were very fun. The lazy river is actually fun, too. The landscaping is very pretty and the views of the ocean are amazing. Here is where the sticker shock comes into play: the food. The prices are so crazy. A margarita, for example, was $11! It was so unbelievable! Meals were the same. We (2 adults and 2 teenagers) had lunch at Palomino Island at the Iguana's Bar, and it cost $90.00! The food was just ordinary American food, too. \"Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Caribe\" (near the lobby) and \"The Ballyhoo Bar\" (outdoors, in front of the marina) seemed to be the cheapest places to eat at. The hotel had no Puerto Rican restaurants, which was a little disappointing. But, if you follow a little paved road north that starts at the ferry marina and passes the condos and is along the ocean, it will take you to a little park (off of the hotel grounds) where there are local PUERTO RICAN restaurants that serve great local food. We went to \"Ocean View\" and \"Mar Adentro\". They were excellent! We just talked to workers in the boutiques at the hotel (who are all Puerto Rican) about local restaurants and they highly recommended these ones for true Puerto Rican food that was close by. Another great restaurant that you can't get to from this little road is called \"La Estacion\". It is owned by an American and they serve Puerto Rican, as well as American food. It was very good and we recommend it. The hotel's taxi service was RIDICULOUS also! To get to the hotel from the airport, it would cost $66 per person round trip! We booked a local taxi at the airport to take us to the hotel and it cost about $80 there and $80 back for 4 people. Much more reasonable! And the driver knew exactly where to take us, so it wasn't an uneasy ride there. When he dropped us off, he scheduled our pickup time to go back to the airport and he was right on time. To get to La Estacion, which is literally just down the hill from the hotel, it would have cost $20 there and $20 back! So, WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU RENT A CAR. It only cost $15 a day to park it in the hotel's lot. We rented a little 4 door Toyota for just $40 a day from Thrifty. Overall, I don't think that we would stay here again. We would like to stay in San Juan or Old San Juan (which was EXTREMELY FUN) or try Culebra Island, which we have heard is very laid back and beautiful. Puerto Rico is so pretty and exotic and beats Florida by a mile weather wise! The weather was excellent (mid 80's everyday) and it only rained 1 day (out of 7) and we went to the Yunque Rain Forest- which was worth going to- that day; very fitting! We drove the rental car there as the hotel shuttle and some sort of tour was I think about $70 per person. We were very curious about this hotel and wanted to try it, and we recommend that you do too if you don't think you will be easily bothered by the food prices. The hotel was excellent, clean, beautiful; just paradise! But, once was enough. I wouldn't spend my money here again.", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "gomo42", "Title": "\u201cFun vacation at the El Conquistador in Fajardo Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "gomo42", "ReviewID": "UR13759706", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the El Conquistador for a week in Feb durning school vacation. We were driven to the hotel from the airport by a private driver. We got his name from the hotel. We enjoyed having a driver since he knew the area very well and had great stories to share about the island. Once we got to the resort we were stunned with the amazing ocean view. Pictures don't do it justice you must see it with your own eyes. Check in was easy a little line since it was school break. We did request a better room but no one followed through on it. Rooms- We had 2 rooms in the main section of the hotel, the older section. My parents were on the first floor so the view from their balcony was not as nice as ours on the 4th floor. My room had no DVD player and a very small balcony basically just a huge window. We did have a beautiful view! Our hallway floor was getting repainted or some type of work done on it so the workers placed towels under our doors so water would not seep through. The room was bright, pretty big and a large bathroom. It was great to leave the windows open at night so we could hear the ocean. Resort/Pools- The lobby is huge. There are tons of little stores inside the lobby including a Starbucks which was packed every morning! There are local bands that perform great music in the lobby at around 10:30 P.M, fun to watch everyone dancing. We did not go to the Casino but it looked nice. We did wish that the hotel had more info on events that were happening durning our stay. The pool was great. We reserved 4 chairs early in the A.M under a palm tree. The cabanas at the pool costed $218 for just one day. There is a great pool bar as well. The water park we did not use because it looked like there was construction going on. All in all everything at the resort is expensive but we did know that going into it after reading other reviews. The hotel is very spread out and sometimes can be complicated but after the first day we got the hang of it. Palomino Island was great. We had so much fun on the island. The boat ride over was lots of fun and it was also a quick ride 8-10 mins. Once on the island each person gets one towel. The beach is calm and serene once you get away from the dock area. There are many cabanas and lots of chairs. There is also a place to eat and tons of water activities. The coolest part was just being on our own island and seeing the resort up in the mountains. The ferry comes every 30 mins and the crew on board is very nice. You do have to take the funicular down to the marina so give yourself plenty of travel time. The funicular is pretty fast, there sometimes can be a line which is to be expected. Tip: Try to avoid taking the funicular around 5-6 P.M if you can. We had to wait 30-40 mins in line for the funicular at that time since that is when everyone leaves Palomino Island and the water park to go back to their rooms. Food and drinks were very expensive but again we did know that. We loved Stingray and Bella Vistas. We also had a lot of fun at Ballyhoo bar and Grill which was down near the Marina. It has great views of the ocean and everyone there was very helpful and fun to talk to. The bartenders were great and told us where some of the New York Yankee players live and other famous people that they met. We also went to Pasion Fugeo for dinner outside of the hotel.....great food, lots of fun to leave the resort and see Fajardo! We had a very good time at El Conquistador but were a little disappointed with our rooms since they were in an older section. The employees were great,very helpful and always saying Hola to us! Lastly, It is always windy at the El Conquistador since it is so close to the ocean and it can be a little chilly at night.", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cWonderful, Worth the Money!!!\u201d", "Author": "sherriengo", "ReviewID": "UR13746976", "Content": "This trip was a b-day surpise for my husband.

Both couples have traveled extensively and stayed in accomodations from cabins to world class. Here is the down and dirty on the El C. Getting There. The El C charges $140.00 per couple round trip from the airport to their facility. For $280 we decided instead to rent a car at Enterprise by the airport. The week rental (plus gas) was no more than the El C charge and gave us a vehicle for the week. Yes the drive on Route 3 has many stop signs so take Route 66 until you must merge with Route 3. The Hotel & Grounds. The grounds are magnificent as is the cliff side location. Clean and well maintained with many beautiful views of the ocean. The hotel is huge - like a small city. Anyone who complains about the size has no one to blame but themself for booking here. You know about the size before you come - right? Since we were not there on school vacation week we were amazed at how uncrowded everything seemed. No hassles anywhere with crowds or waiting. The Rooms. We stayed in ocean view rooms in the Las Brisas wing. They were large, well appointed and clean. The view from the balcony was fantastic. A mini frig was perfect. Not one complaint about anything. FYI...I would not want to stay in the middle complex rooms or at the base (Marina). You are then tied into using the tram all the time to gain access to the main hotel buildings. Service. Superb. Everyone was friendly, helpful and made you feel like a guest to be pampered. The Tram. We saw several complaints about the tram. Truth be told we did not have one problem. The trams (there are 2) run constantly and we found our longest wait maybe 2-3 minutes. The trip up or down takes only a couple of minutes at most. Maybe this is more of a hassle during school vacation week. The Ferry. If you want to got the resorts private beach island you must take the ferry. They run every half hour and the trip to the island takes 10-15 minutes. Again, not one hassle with this. The Island. Fabulous. Plenty of chairs - sun or shade. Great swimming etc. Perfect in all respects. Water shoes are not necessary but if you have tender feet or sit on the far side of the island (away from ferry dock) you might need because of coral. Towels are available as are rest rooms and food and drink. Really a fun way to spent a day. Casino. We are not big gamblers and found the casino perfect. Not too big, not too small. Something fro everyone. Gold Course. We did not play but it looked spectacular. We inquired and it $180 a round. Spa. We did not use..no comment. Food & Drinks. Hold onto your wallet. Everything is expensive, expensive, expensive. We ate at numerous grills and also at Stingray and Othellos. For the prices you expect world class cuisine but that was not the case. THIS IS WHERE THE CAR COMES INTO PLAY!!!!! We went to the local store in Fajardo and loaded up on waters, fruit, yougert etc. so that we could take breakfast or a light lunch on our balacony if we wanted. We also bought some booze and had cocktails on our balconies at night before dinner. This is the way to go and will save you a fortune. This also allowed us to go off site and visit local restraunts. This was a blast and we met some great local folks. Rain Forest. We went. Lots of hiking but honestly unless you have never been out in the nature and want to experience it don't lose any sleep if you miss this. The can't miss waterfall in the forest was disappointing for its lack of size. Bioluminescent Bay. DO NOT BOOK THIS THROUGH THE HOTEL AT $90 A PERSON. Ther are many local companies to book through. We went through Eco at $45 a person. This was also dissappointing. The luminescence is brightest in the summer...not much help for all of us there in the winter. It is further diminished if the moon is out. Honestly we could barely tell it existed. Also be aware that you will get wet so bring a change of clothes and it is a workout to get there. We are all in great shape but felt like we had been to the gym. Luquillo Beach. This is a great side trip if you have a car. It is a \"Blue Flag\" beach and is fantastic. You can rent lounges for $5 and an umbrealla if you want. Restrooms and snacks are available. If you go you have to head down to the kiosks for lunch.

It is located on the north-eastern point of the island and is miles from anyplace you would really want to travel. The prices are ridiculous and exorbitant for all commodities. The majority of the food is bland and tasteless and many of the restaurants are second rate. There is no creole food to speak of and what passes for authentic pr/caribe food is not to be eaten. You will be a captive at the resort since there is no local grocery store and the hotel does not sell anything you could use to fashion a meal. If you are unlucky enough to be stuck in one of the rooms serviced by the the funicular railroad, you will be spending much of the day waiting or walking. The room we had was spacious but the a/c was so noisy that it sounded like we had a jet engine or vacuum cleaner in the room when it was on-- we kept it off as much as possible. The staff was friendly enough but loud and noisy. I actually had to call the front desk one night when the security guards decided to have a party outside our room. The internet access is hit and miss since the wifi antennas are located in suboptimal locations. The road west is a nightmare(C-3) since it is stop and go traffic lights and the local drivers have a deathwish. Thus you will be disinclined to travel outside of the resort and sooner or later, if you stay long enough, you will feel trapped and abused by the outrageous prices and poor food. I can recommend a trip to San Juan to eat at Pikayo, the Wilo Benet restaurant in the Museum of Art. The food and service are superb and will make you cry when you must return to the hotel. Overall, I would never set foot in this place again. We stayed here to attend a meeting. Otherwise, we would have moved to the another hotel in San Juan. If you are looking for a Puerto Rican experience, do not stay here. If you are looking for an American type hotel where you can drink to your hearts content, get shafted by the costs, admire the view, compromise on most things, then this is the place for you. The hotel can only get away with such robbery if we pay the price. I say, don't do it.

I relied heavily upon this website before leaving for our visit and was glad it prepared me for the resort. Here is my take on it: Location: The drive from the airport to the resort was about 50 minutes...really far when travelling with children who had been up since 4 AM; and, with everyone ready to start vacation. We had the prearranged shuttle waiting for us, so, there was no time at the airport for us to eat (and the airline ran out of food before our seats were served) so needless to say, we were tired & hungry. The shuttle had a cooler with water bottles (HINT: grab a number of them and put them in your fridge once you get into your room, because the resort price for bottled water is about $3/bottle). Pulling into the resort you immediately see that it is well decorated and has beautiful grounds. However, the resort was far too big for me. I felt as though I was in a town. Nothing is really within a quick walk. Check In/Rooms: The hotel staff member we worked with was very helpful (Joanne) however, checking in was a problem for us. We had made a prior request for an ocean view room that would be near the main hotel area (versus taking the funicular to/from our room); and, we were told we had an ocean view room (2 queen beds) down the bottom of the funicular. The only ocean view room available that was not in the funicular area was a king size bed and, to accommodate the kids, we were told that they would bring in an air mattress! Now, that was not acceptable to us...our children were also on vacation and we were not paying those high rates for them to sleep on an air mattress. The only ocean view room with 2 queens in the main hotel part would be available in 3 days -- so, we took that one and stayed the first few nights in the king room and the air mattress. The first air mattress lost all of its air within 2 hours; and, the staff needed to come in the room and set up a new one (while my kids and I sat up in my bed in our PJs...an uncomfortable situation!). This ordeal took until 10:30 PM to sort out and we were very tired and hungry and not real pleased with El Con at this point! (HINT: if you are placed in this same situation, and are told you need to use an air mattress in a king bed room, make sure that you get one of the larger king bed rooms. There are 2 size rooms with king beds...the first one that they tried to use the air mattress in was so small that we literally needed to side step through the room in single file to get dressed, watch TV, get to the beds, etc. After complaining about that we were moved to a larger king size room which held the air mattress a little better and again because it was temporary (just 3 days) we suffered through). Now this next comment is going to sound odd, but, it was an issue: there are no blankets or covers. The room was always very cold and we switched back and forth between having the air set on 74 degrees or turned off and just ran the ceiling fan. We called guest services for 2 blankets, but, 4 blankets would have been better! The bathroom was very large and clean. My only complaint with the shower was in our room that had the 2 queen beds, and, that was that we never had hot water. It didn't matter if we showered first thing in the morning, afternoon or evening, our water was always tepid. And, when we moved the nozzle to \"hot\" there was a loud vibrating noise that ran the whole time we showered. Pools & Beach: The pools are kept very clean. The water temperature was fine, and, there are pool noodles, balls, towels, etc. (which did not have a service fee or charge attached to the use of these things --- that was surprising because with the exorbitant fees we paid for food/drinks/services for everything else, I would have expected a $20/person/day charge for the towels and pool usage!). Almost every day we took the boat ride to the private island to go to the beach (the resort is not directly on the beach...so if you want sand/snorkeling you need to get on the boat to get there). The food at the beach as well as the pool service (at the resort itself) is very expensive and nothing unique to Puerto Rico. It is very standard fare (burgers, chicken, salads, sandwiches). The drinks were all expensive and I am still sickened by the money we spent on food/drinks each day. Staff: The staff (at all places: pool, beach, front desk, concierge, restaurants, cafes, etc.) were always pleasant, quick, helpful, but that didn't take away the pain of the expense! Kids Activities: All I can say here is \"it will cost you\". There was one morning that my husband was golfing, and, I had to work for 1.5 hours. So, I put my kids in the kids club. Imagine my surprise to learn that the kids club is not free -- it is $45/child for 1/2 day (9:00 - 12:00, no lunch provided) and $75/child for a full day (lunch and snack provided). Yes, it was $90 for 1.5 hours. Restaurants within the Resort: The cost of food was astronomical. I saw a lot of comments about it before we left and somehow it didn't hit home until we experienced it...it is crazy what you will pay to feed a family of 4, 3 meals a day. And, the taste of the food is not very good and actually seemed worse given the cost! There were no places within the resort that offered local food. I kept forgetting I was on vacation because the menu choices were that what you get at home (but double the price). Water Park: The water park was supposed to open in December (which was a big reason we booked in November for a late January/early February stay). Well the opening got pushed back several times and it finally opened at 11 AM on the day before we left the resort. Due to the inconvenience of the opening day/time, we were allowed in for free. That was great! (Normally the fees are $20/adult; $15/child, I think). We spent the entire day at the water park and it is a lot of fun. I am glad that it was not opened the entire time we were there because the daily ticket prices would have just added to our outrageous bill. Checking Out: Read your bill extra carefully. We had a self parking fee on our bill for each day we were there -- and we didn't even have a car! The staff was great about taking it off immediately. There were also some charges that we did not expect due to taxes being added after we signed off on our bills already (example: we ordered food while on the beach; before you place your order you need to show your resort card and give your room #, then, the order is placed on your master bill with the resort. before you leave the beach for the day, you 'check out' with the beach staff, and you sign off on your bill. we would look it over and make sure the right number of drinks/food were noted; and, then we would add a tip. the total that we would sign off for would be about $45 (example only). yet, on the last day when the charges were all printed out for us to check-out, that $45 charge would show up as a $49 charge because they would add taxes to the bill after we signed it!) Feeling trapped: Okay, my final complaint --- I felt like we were stuck on the property (we did not rent a car due to the expense of rental and parking each day at the resort ($16/day to self park) and we felt forced to pay ridiculous prices in order to \"survive\". There are a few local restaurants within walking distance for adults, but, not for those with small children so we did not opt to walk 15-minutes to try out the food at these places. Overall, we spent an awful lot of money on the room and our meals/drinks and nothing felt luxurious or extravagant... it was all very ordinary and we were left feeling like we were ripped off.", "Date": "February 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "central illinois", "Title": "\u201cJan. 2008 trip\u201d", "Author": "tamlyn63", "ReviewID": "UR13134847", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the El Con Jan. 6-11, 2008. The resort is really spectacular, and you WILL pay for that. Fortunately we were there through a trip with one of my chemical vendors, which included our airfare, ground transfers, breakfast every day, and a couple of dinners. The resort is sprawled out on 3 different levels. Be prepared to do a LOT of walking, especially if your room is on the marina level like ours was. The rooms was very big, very clean, and very well appointed. My only problem with our room was that it was on the first level right above the Ballyhoo Bar & Grill, so we did have a little noise on a couple nights we retired early. Prices at the resort are pretty outrageous in my opinion. $9 hot dogs, $14 burgers, etc. We ate at the Cafe Caribe the first night. Don't remember what I had, but it was $$$$$. We had a welcome buffet thru my vendor on our 2nd night which was very good and free! Third night we ate at the Strip House with 2 other couples and our bill was $700 plus $140 tip. 2 bottles of wine, 6 entrees, 6 sides, and 3 bottles of water. Ask for tap water or you pay$7 per btl for FIJI water. Entrees don't come with sides, those are priced separate. I had Mahi $32 and garlic mashed potatoes $11. It was good but not THAT good. We discovered too late that if you go down to the marina and walk west you come out in an area with a lot of local bars and restaurants. We did go there for a few beers after dinner and $2-3 per beer compared to $6 at the resort. We could have had lobster at one place for under $25. I would not venture out walking here unless you're in a group. There were 16 of us. Also rent a car! We got smart and rented one and went to Walmart and the grocery store. We bought beer, soda, rum n mixers,deli sandwhich fixings and snacks, and took it back to our room. That's what we ate for the remainder of our stay except for my vendors farewell dinner. To think of the money we could have saved if I had known beforehand! Palimino Island is great, but take your own food and snacks and drinks. I took ours in a small collapsible cooler from the Walmart. We pretty much just laid by the pool or on the beach the whole time except for one day a power cat to Culebra and Culebrita through www.eastwindcats.com I highly recommend them! Don't be surprised to see celebrities while staying at this resort either, we saw Mariah Carey and \"Da Brat\". Rumors were rampant thet Johnny Depp was also there, but if he was we didn't see him. All in all, the resort is great, staff is outstanding, views ore superb, and the rooms were impressive. This type of resort is not a place I'd normally stay because it is so expensive. Would I go back?

I like to travel but I will warn those of you reading this that I am very particular when it comes to where I stay and what I receive for my money. While I'm not cheap, it is very important to me when I'm on vacation that the accommodations are the same or better than what I'm accustomed to at home. With that said, here's my review. Location: Really far from the airport (about 45 minutes) and the same distance to most local shopping or sightseeing activities. The cab ride from here to town will cost you more that what it's worth so if you stay here, plan to be here your entire stay. However, the location is beautiful and the Resort is decorated really nicely. I recommend the boat ride to the private island for a day of fun in the sun as the El Conquistador is not directly on the beach. After 3 days of an all expense paid, job related event, my husband and I gladly relocated to a hotel closer in town and near the airport for the remainder of our stay in PR. Food: Sadly, the food was not what you would expect from a Resort style facility. Not only was it insanely expensive, it was not very good for what you were asked to pay. You could buy two gallons of ice cream for what they charged for two scoops. Unfortunately, you're stuck on the property and almost forced to pay if you want a treat. Rooms: I'm personally not a fan of platform beds so I was not pleased at having to fall down into the bed instead of crawling up. The mattress was too soft so if you have back problems, you're in trouble. I've been home for a week now and I still have sore muscles in my neck from the soft mattress and pillows. I'm an extra firm fan so if soft is your thing, you'll be right at home. The bathroom was nicely remodeled and clean. It was also surprisingly large. I did however have one complaint. Every time we took a shower, the water would drain really slowly in the tub and before long, I would be standing is water up to my ankles. I called and requested maintenance but we checked out before the problem was fixed. This is a really pricey resort so please consider your options carefully. Frankly, I would recomend the Marriott in Condado.", "Date": "January 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cLoved the El Con Resort!!\u201d", "Author": "mmt", "ReviewID": "UR12963648", "Content": "Stayed at the El Con in January with Travelzoo promotion that included breakfast for 2 for five nights. We are a 30 something couple, and had a wonderful time. We were very concerned about the reviews here referring to theft, but this turned out to be a non-issue...just exercise common sense and be careful and you'll be fine. The resort is beautiful, breathtaking grounds and golf course. We stayed in the main hotel area overlooking the main pool and our room was renovated, but I did not like the fact that we didn't have a balcony and the door entrance to our room was outside - I hate hearing high heels and the rolling of housekeeping and luggage carts on the cement outside our door.... but it wasn't bad - if the window was closed, we never heard sound from the events right outside our windows and definitely never heard those in the rooms next to us except for the doors slamming sometimes. Soundproofing is really good...If you want a balcony, and indoor carpeted entrances, then book Las Brisas. We couldn't get this wing because there was a convention there that had booked the whole wing. More about that - the hotel will not tell you if there is a convention booked during your upcoming stay, and on our second day there this company really took over the resort. It wasn't terrible, but we spent a lot of time, over an hour, at the harbor waiting to go to the beach because they chartered one of the two catamarans that takes you to the private island. There were some other regular hotel guests that were really steamed about this, and I totally don't blame them...but of course the resort is going to cater to the big group that's spending tons of money for their employees...there was a wedding on the first night we arrived, and another group coming in after the first convention left....seems to be nonstop conventions and private events. Also the hotel DID close the main pool area two of our five nights for the private events.... we could still go to the Las Olas pool area, and there is a hot tub there as well..so really it wasn't that big of a deal. We had breakfast everyday in Las Brisas - very nice buffet, $25 a person, or you can order a la carte, but it's resort prices so be forewarned...we had breakfast included so we took advantage of this. There is a Starbucks on site, and another cafe with ice cream and late night sandwiches, but but we never ate at any of the other restaurants, except the one by the main pool. We ordered a brick oven pizza and took it back to our room and it was delicious, like $16.00 for 12 inch I think....the resort is very family and child friendly, and beside from 1 very badly behaved tyrannical British 4 year old, (you could seriously hear this kid coming from a mile away...and then we would laugh as his parents tried to catch up with him and stop his terrorizing of hotel staff and guests)....the kids were not a problem, they have great programs to keep them busy and happy and out of the adults' peaceful vacations... the beach is beautiful with padded chairs and shade huts, watersports and waitered bar service, bring beach shoes it is very rocky, and not good for snorkeling unless you go over the cliff to the other side, but it's treacherous among the coral and rocks.....very shallow, warm water. We were lucky every day was sunny and 90 degrees....you can rent a small sail hobie for $45 and go out to the Palominito island which is tiny but much smoother and sandier.....The bio luminescent bay tour is fun - just walk down to the left of the harbor and you can sign up with a company - you shouldn't pay more than $40 a person to go.....quite an experience. There will be many island dogs and cats laying around and if you decide to eat in one of the local restaurants around the park where the bio bay tours set off from, the dogs will follow you around, don't be scared. We took the ferry from Fajardo to Vieques and (an hour and a half) and went to Media Luna Beach - the ferry is only $2.25 and the dock is very close to the resort - if you have a rental car (we did) you can drive there in less than 10 minutes. Media Luna is a TRIP to get to (get a cab) but very unspoiled - again, bring beach shoes, there are not much fish to see but plenty of stingrays in this amazingly white soft sandy beach. Bring towels and water as well - no amenities here....we also went to Old San Juan (about 50 minutes from resort)- there were five cruiseships in that evening and lots of action, and the rainforest El Yunque was so exciting, after about a mile and a half hike up you will find a waterfall you can swim in, only 25 minutes from the resort with a $3.00 per person entrance fee!! There is so much to do in Puerto Rico we cannot wait to go back and explore the caves, and Culebra, we just ran out of time but we really recommend this resort for your home base!", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cPleased with the Updates\u201d", "Author": "Manatee", "ReviewID": "UR12916192", "Content": "Having stayed at the El Con last year for a convention I was interested in seeing how the renovations had come along when I found out the same convention would be returning this year.

The staff was very helpful and attentive during the entire stay. Check in was smooth and quick. Eva was very pleasant and courteous. All of the staff that I encountered said hello and were willing to help. I tried Stingray Cafe this year. The sea bass was excellent and the waitress was willing to substitute items if asked.

My husband and I are not golfers and the prettiest part of the hotel IS the golf course. We stayed in Las Vistas wing in which you were awakened to what seemed like a jack-hammering noise probably due to old water pipes. The elevators were broken since the day we arrived and we were on the fifth floor. There was no tropical atmosphere in your room whatsoever. The food was beyond below expectations. Again, being in Puerto Rico a person would expect to have some kind of local foods to sample. If we would have eaten at IHop the food would have been better. We attended a semi-formal event in which we were served hockey-pucks. Thankfully we were there on a business reward otherwise my review would prabably be worse. I feel bad for the fact that our company had to dish out money to this place where we could have had more fun in South Florida. The only good point is that the staff is friendly. The worst part of the whole place was the fact that if you wanted to go to San Juan or elsewhere, which YOU wanted to, it was an hour and a half out. We spent half a day on sitting on buses. There are plenty of hotels within three miles of the airport which are cheaper and better worth your time. It is truly false advertising for them to state they are a luxury hotel.

I played as a single golfer and saw monkeys and mammoth iguana on nearly every hole, very cool...So about the resort you know food expensive and service may or may not be sub par, this happens on any resort and this one is huge so get over it.....Palomino island is great for lounging and i mean special/great awesome place/ but def not snorkeling like st john/barbados..I dont snorkel so i always brought my gap wedge and chipped on their chipping/putting surface on Palomino very cool, when i wasnt swimming .Basically for new insight that other reviewers havnt touched on if you want great nightlife go to Cancun, Cabo or Aruba....If you want the best of the best ever go to Sandy Lane Barbados or 4 Seasons Nieves/St Kitts but beside these aforementioned destinations this can not be beat.....I would never stay at a San Juan resort or dominican republic after going here.

When calling concierge, the line was often busy with no waiting system.

It was not busy at all but the bartender ingnored us and a another staffer was just hanging out and advised he \"only served food\".

The El Conquistador is about an hour's drive from the airport, which makes it feel like a tranquil getaway yet doesn't take 5 hours of driving to get to. Compared to Intercontinental, which is basically in the middle of a semi-sketchy area, this place was paradise. We stayed in the new tower that had just been renovated. It was super clean, modern, and chic, and had an incredible view of the ocean. The resort is a self contained unit, ideal for families or couples who want to get to their destination and then just relax, without the trouble of renting a car, etc. There are multiple restaurants and shops. The pools are beautiful and you can't possibly walk the grounds without being in absolute awe of the views. Everywhere you turn, beauty. The hotel has exclusive access to a small island, and you basically get an i.d. bracelet each morning, which allows you to take a boat (free) from the hotel to the island. Once you arrive, you'll find lawn chairs and water sport equipment rentals available at average prices. There's a small cafe with basic burger/salad options. There's a teeny tiny island (like 20 yards across!) that you can kayak to or swim, if you're so inclined. The snorkeling in this part of Puerto Rico is disappointing, if you're used to seeing lots of sea life when snorkeling other islands. There was lots of dead (maybe bleached) coral, and it was tough to determine if it was from hurricane damage or global warming. We chartered a sailboat (I recommend Erin Go Braugh) and they took us to some great places that were accessible by boat only. Still, it's no St. John! We had no problem with service. In fact, the woman at the front desk was an absolute gem. Very helpful. If you're looking for a place where you can relax by a pool, or have an adventurous day scouting a teeny tiny postcard-esque island, this is a place for you. It's also within driving distance of a lovely rain forest trail, so you aren't limited to staying at the resort.

After everything room wise etc, we recommend this resort, read on. We normally stay at small boutique style hotels but wanted a large resort to stay on property and use their facilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Pool, Restaurants etc. We are in our early 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with No kids traveling with us and we are travel professionals. As with previous reports, this one has a lot of details \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some things were left out as they were already mentioned on the board. We decided to take the resorts motorcoach service from the airport and we were met in the baggage claim area and advised where to pick up the bus. The bus ride took about an hour, bathroom on board was in rough shape and non-useable and the bus had a musty-moldy smell from the A/C. I thought what did we get into? The return trip in the motor coach went better with hardly any smell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not sure about the bathroom. Use their motorcoach service, unless you plan to be off property, you can save the drive out and car rental/parking fees. The bus has complementary refreshments on board. We were met at the bus and our bags were removed and we went to the main reception area for check in. At check in we were assigned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A Las Caitas Village North suite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Oceanview. The room was large with a full kitchen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c large bathroom, King bed and separate sitting area with TV, nice stereo & DVD systems and according to my wife had a nice charm to it. However, our worst fear hit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were in a non-renovated room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c musty smell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c couch-carpets were dirty and bedroom ceiling was dirty. We were not happy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no rooms were available for change but we were assured that a change could & would happen the next day. Note: We understand the 5500 & above Las Caitas area was renovated. After speaking with the front desk, based on our room rate, and explaining our problem an Oceanview Marina room was assigned to us. What a difference! Large single room, one TV, nice balcony, great view of the marina and ocean, nice Bathroom and modern (Clean). This room lacked the Charm but was much nicer. I would recommend the marina area.

Plenty of beach lounge chairs available. The Coqui Waterpark- since there were a lot of kids - young/teen and young at heart around they opened the waterpark on limited 2 daily - 4 hour basis by room numbers. The slides were great, they had a large fast body slide, body slide with curves and a slide for tubes into the lazy river ride plus a swimming pool - see pictures. You could not hold the kids back they were so excited. Once officially opened it will be beautiful and a great place to spend time with the family. Estimated February. Main Swimming Pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Great service around the pool, people offering fresh fruit, cool water sprays and cold towels. Plus other servers taking drink & food orders. Teen Club \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Based on all the teens/families for the holidays \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they had a teen club with DJ/Soda etc available. Heard it was a success, the staff hopes they keep it open \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the teens need a place to go in the evening especially if you offer them a waterpark during the day! Spa & Golf course looked great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t partake. Overall the hotel was great, we had a wonderful time. Food & Service overall was Ok, somewhat expensive.

We knew a bunch of people who had stayed there and raved about everything except its location- about an hour away from San Juan airport. So we thought it was a safe bet. I even did my homework on trip advisor, and noticed that some people mentioned some renovations being done on grounds. So I called the hotel and asked about that. Two different people told me that everything was fully opened and the only thing being worked on was the Coqui Water park (due to open Dec 2007). So off we went. First thing I hear when we check in in the lobby? Drills! First thing I smell? Paint. Lovely. But not enough to ruin the trip. Our room was renovated and big and nice and clean (part of the 50% of the hotel rooms that were available as the rest of the rooms were in fact being worked on). The pools were pretty but 2 of them were closed for 3 out of the 5 days we were there. The restuarant on the beach? Closed. Virgin Burger (poolside food service?) Closed for 2 days. The worst part was that no one at the hotel had a good handle of what was going on. The front desk continued to tell us things were open when we were standing there and they were closed. The people taking reservations (we called to test them) told us the water park was complete and open! They did let people in on strict schedules the day we left, but there were still men gluing fake grass on the ground and I would say it was still only 89% done. (it will be good entertainment for kids when it is finished). The other part that disappointed us was that there was NO ONE there! Yes I know it should be nice to have a huge resort to yourself, but there is something creepy about being the ONLY people in a restaurant at 7:30pm! The positives: Easy to get seats at the beach/pool everyday, the service at restaurants and by housekeeping was very attentive. Maria the poolside server was great she brought me waters all day long (I am pregnant!) while another male server told us he was too busy when we asked him for something! The hotel did fill up a but more closer to Christmas, which made it feel more alive. The casino was fun but it is hardly the world class gambling mecca they claim it to be. So maybe we were just there at the wrong time. The bottom line is it is a pretty place, will be even nicer when it is complete, but don't trust what they tell you over the phone! It is a quick easy flight from NY, and it's remote and there is a lot to keep you busy if you don't want to make the drive to San Juan.

Then we moved to the Villas, and WOW are they great! A good kitchen, a nice living room, even made us sick-folk comfortable. Once we recovered, we began to explore. The boat ride to the island for beaching is quick, and lots of fun for my little guy. The island itself has natives: iguanas and chickens, along with the snack bars and rentals. Close by is the El Yunque rainforest, good hiking, even some tame enough for 3 year olds.

The grounds are a tropical paradise. The milti-tiered pools allow you to lay out with some degree of privacy. I enjoyed travelling down the inclinator to the marina and rooms at sea level. The seafood restaurant there is very good, and the outdoor bar is a lot of fun. What makes this resort really special is the private Palamino island serviced by large ferry boats. The water, beach and amenities are outstanding. Some may feel inconvenienced by the ferry trip, but I felt it just put you in the right \"mental attitude\" to go the beach. for those who just can't be \"unwired\" I got a good cell signal from the island.

The resort is somewhat remote, so--aside from a small village just down the road (walking distance...but did not eat/drink there) you're pretty much \"at\" the resort.

As you walk from your vehicle through an outdoor cavernous walkway, you are awestruck but it's beautiful tropical awnings/canopys as you peer at the blue Carribean waters that appear so inviting. Once inside, if you are as lucky as me, you will be greeted by Krysis, Magda or Marilyn. Initially, I was met by Krysis and her glowing smile. I can honestly say that the service I received upon my check-in with Krysis was unparrelled. She was charming and explained each and every one of the amenities at the resort, including but not limited to their private island, the transportation there with the resorts private transportation; the golf courses; shopping and dining venues and the casino. Krysis arranged for me to stay in an ocean front room with balcony was tropically decorated and elegant yet serene as I could see the crystal blue waters and skies. As I sat in total awe on my balcony, I observed small and large watercrafts dotting the waters and berthed at the resorts marina. I could also see the resorts private island, Palomino and in the foreground, the island that is home to Flamenco Beach. Flamenco Beach is reknowned and a must see which can be reached by a small 9 seat plane or by ferry. I took the 15 minute flight and it was spectacular as we flew over the sea and look at the various islands along the way. During the remainder of the stay, I was very fortunate in that I got to meet Tomas and Edwin at the concierge desk. They were the individuals that told me to visit Flamenco Beach and made all of the arrangements. They also told me to visit the Bio-illuminescent Bay and arranged for me to meet with Captain Suartez, the 14 seat boat owner who captained our boat through the mangroves in the dark of night only to reach this incredible phoshorous water. He invited us to jump in the water and swim. As each of the participants glowed, one could only think of how lucky they were to be at that place in that point of time. It was incredible!. Tomas and Edwin, when asked about off-site restaurants, immediately stated Pasions without hesitation. Krysis confirmed that Pasions was her favorite as well. I went there with high expectations that were exceeded by incomparable atmosphere and phenomenal food. Sadly, I had to leave earlier than expected to return to San Diego for a meeting I had forgotten.

Before my trip to El Conquistador I read all of the ratings I could find on the internet and I was very confused and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure what to expect. When it comes to a place this large there are many opportunities to disappoint a customer and I guess over time improvements can change things as well. OK, after all that I am one of the customers that felt very good about my trip to El Con. Our room was on the north side of the Las Brisas wing overlooking the village of Las Croabas. It was very well appointed and except for the safe being locked when we arrived (it was easily fixed by security) the room was very pleasant and even if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the view was so spectacular that the condition of the room wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t almost matter. To be clear the room was top notch. As far as the resort atmosphere it is spectacular. There is such beauty to behold I found myself just taking pictures everywhere I went. The pictures on the web site will give you a good idea of how beautiful this place is. [--] We found the service to be adequate. A few times we waited a little bit longer that we were used to but after we relaxed into the place it was not so long as to concern us. I am not used to spending a small fortune on a resort like this so because it was a business outing it was worth it to me. We were able to take advantage of a good room rate and extend our stay a few days and enjoy the resort. The cost of everything at the resort is at resort prices but that is to be expected at a place like this. We rented a car because of the ratings we read and it was worth it. It allowed us the flexibility to take advantage of the local countryside and local stores. Overall, this is not a resort for bargain hunters and never will be. But we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We never ate at the three big restaurants in the Mirador level but we ate twice at the Stingray Caf\u00c3\u00a9 in the marina and found that it was great food at a good value. The breakfast buffet is very nice but very pricey. The pool area is unmatched in options and beauty. Palomino Island is a nice spot to relax. I would suggest you bring a pair of water shoes as the sandy beach doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t extend too far off the shore and if you want to get to deep water you have to go a ways out. Take the short walk from the Marina to the village of Las Croabas. You will have instant contact with the local color. In the evening in Las Croabas, if the moon isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too full you might want to take a kayak to the lagoon and see the bioluminescent organism that live in the water there.

The water level got to be about a foot deep in the tub while I showered, good thing I was rooming alone because it took a couple of hours for it to drain. I checked with the guest in the room below me and he indicated that his drain worked just fine. I called engineering about 4 times for assistance, I am pretty sure that help did not arrrive for about 8 hours, and though his intensions were good the results were poor, water still pooled in the tub. Next, I requested a wake up call for 7:00 am on the day of departure that I am still waiting for. On my last day I figured I could squeeze in a fast trip to the private island for a swim.

One thing you notice right away is how incredibly huge the resort is. You'd think it would have left me with a feeling of awe and enchantment, but if anything, I just felt sorry for the poor blokes who have to run the place. With that being said, I can see how some of the negative reviews might have generated; El Con is simply too big for their own good. With a place that size, things are bound to get overlooked and neglected. Store fronts with broken/smashed windows, common areas with peeling paint, ferries that could have run more on time, and the ol' broken funicular. Nonetheless, there were still many \"pros\" not to be dismissed. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The beds were cozy and inviting and the bathrooms were stocked with towels and good toiletries. The flat screen TV and iPod dock were also nice additions. El Con's private island, \"Palomino Island\" was relaxing and calm. I could have lounged there all day and night. The ferry ride was a quick 7-10 mins away, perfect for any seasick -prone patron (like me)! As for the high prices, I think it's \"manageble\" with the right planning. Don't eat at all the fancy, expensive restaurants if you can't. The hotel bars served decent \"bar & grill\" type meals for cheaper. A newly opened Starbucks on the premise is also a god-send. It definitely saved me a few dollars in the morning, getting some coffee and a breakfast sandwich instead of the $25 hotel buffet. The local beer (Medalla) was about $3-4/bottle. The pool area is also quite decent, with cabanas for rent for additional privacy. There was also an area with a ping pong table and foos ball for added enjoyment. That was a pleasant surprise. Overall, I think El Con does a great job anticipating guests' needs. A major \"con\" however is that the place is not terribly accessible. Our room was towards the bottom of a hill - an elevator and funicular ride away (one of them being broken). Sometimes, we also encounted a long line at the funicular, which took 2-3 cycles before we actually made it on. We felt bad for the patrons in wheelchairs who had to navigate that terrain on a daily basis. The good news is, you do end up getting used to the trek by the 2nd or 3rd day! As for the service, we felt that the staff was quite pleasant and attentive. Always saying hello in the hallways and meeting our needs. I will say though, that they don't go out of their way to be nice if you don't deserve it. Don't expect any major [--]-kissing because you won't get it here. Just straight-forward, no-nonense assistance is how I can best put it. Also, while the hotel advertises as being 45 mins away from the airport, I would say it's closer to 1.5 hours on any given day. Seemed to take that long for us to get to the hotel, due to the rush hour on a Saturday afternoon. Then, getting to the airport on Monday morning, it easily took that long due to an accident on the freeway and the snail-like traffic on the backroads. Definitely give yourself plenty of time! I barely made my flight home! The shuttles back to the airport only run every hour and a half (i.e. 5am, 6:30am, 8am, 9:30am, etc), so plan accordingly. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by El Con. The staff was friendly, the rooms were very nice, and the views are gorgeous. I would absolutely recommend this place to others. They've got quite a handful to deal with, and perhaps they're doing the best they can.

Given the shoddy desk service, lack of in-room amenities, failed wireless internet access, bad food, horrible bellhop service, and other disappointments, there's no reason to think one should have confidence in the cable car (which in fact went on the blink when we were there).", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "fredericksburg, va", "Title": "\u201cWe loved El Conquistador\u201d", "Author": "julie078", "ReviewID": "UR10014943", "Content": "We found the hotel to be absolutely wonderful... landscaping was incredible - as was the water taxi ride to the private island.

As someone who travels quite a bit for business and pleasure, I was leary of the El Con because of some of the bad reviews, yet the dramatic 'loved it' or 'hated it' was confusing. I needed a quick trip without a passport, so I gave it a shot. The resort itself is beautiful and kept immaculate. Everything I saw there was very well maintained. It was a busy weekend and the main hotel was booked so we were moved to Las Casitas. If you have kids, stay at the main hotel, more activities for kids. If you want peace and quite and can spend a few extra bucks, I highly recommend staying at Las Casitas. It is only a minute or two walk between the main hotel and Las Casitas. The staff was exceptionally friendly and very eager to please. Palamino island is incredible. Rent some snorkelling gear and swim to the little island, quite impressive fish and sea life. The hotel casino is very small, if you are a gambler, you are a long way from Vegas. Two blackjack tables, 1 poker table, 1 roulette wheel, 1 craps table, 1 Carribean Stud table, that's it for table games. Only 4 video poker machines. Save your gambling $$ for Vegas, rent a snorkel and enjoy the beautiful fish on Palamino. The things I would agree with most reviews on is the prices on food and billing issues. The resort is in an area where you probably won't want to leave the resort, so you are left only with the resort restaraunts. I went expecting resort prices, maybe 20% over NYC or Vegas, but it was considerably higher. Dinner for 2 in the Italian restaraunt was over $100, with simply one app and 2 entrees (add the $65 bottle of wine that would go for maybe $30 in an NYC restaraunt, grand total of over $185). Breakfast at Las Casitas cafe was usually around $50. (French Toast - 17, omlette 19, plus drinks). Breakfast buffet at Las Brisas rest is good, but at $25 per person, can be pricey for just breakfast. The food and service were exceptional in every restaraunt, but if you are staying for more than a day or two it can start to get expensive. Several reviews complianed about the El Con billing. I am dealing with this right now. Be sure to check your bill carefully and make sure everything is correct and you are paying for the correct account. It wasn't the fault of the desk person, it seems they have a lousy system. Thus far they have been very helpful in resolving the issue. I would definitely stay at the El Con again and recommend it. I would suggest staying at Las Casitas, and if you can, get a casita with a kitchen and hit at one of the grocery stores close by. If you can have a couple of meals in your casita, you'll be able to make up the difference in price on the room vs eating every meal in the restaraunts. If you stay at Las Casitas, rent a car at the airport, it's cheaper than the El Con shuttle, parking at Las Casitas is free, and you can run out to the store to save a few bucks. Parking at the El Con is 15-20 a day. Go for the beautiful beach and sea life on Palamino, super friendly people, and well kept resort.

Here is where the nightmare began on our anniversary night we had a great dinner at the strip house with is a premire steak house the food was excellent and service was above average. We decided to go to the casino around 11.30 p.m. for texas holdem limt play . My wife gracelessly asked if I would like to take the only empty seat at the one table they had. I sat down while she put her name on the waiting list for the next seat several others that came in after us also put there name on the waiting list. About 35 minutes went by, be for there was a open seat at the table, a gentleman who had just arrived at the casino took a seat my wife informed the dealer that she had been waiting for the seat for 35 minutes and her name was next on the list. The dealer continued to ignore her and continued to allow the gentleman who afford to give the seat up since there was a waiting list the dealer informed my wife that he would have the seat since he is a man and she could wait. Sexual Discrimanation at its worst she in formed the pit bose who also ignoed her and then procedded to ask for the casnio manager who also gave her lip service wanting to voice my opionin in the mattter but not wanting to trump my wife handling of this matter I continued to be a spectator, after the situation continued with not the slightest apology or resolution ,she told me she was going up stairs to pack and that we checking out after that, but for me to continue my game till then. They had numerous opportunities to apologize to her but they never did . They did offer us dinner on them witch we refused. This casnio is poorly ran with the dealers not knowning the rules and pit boses who are not capable of making sound judgements as to the gaming rules , not all the dealers and pit boses, but most are poorly trained . When my wife came down to say she was ready to check out at 3.00am, I gatherd my chips and in the hast to leave took my cards that we in play at the table with my chips. They offerd me a 3 night comp Till this day I have never recieved our room comp that they said should make up for the blatent sexual discrimination that presist in the el conquistador resorts casino . .So women beware sexual discrimination is alive and well in that resort.

I think we were in the Las Brisas section, which had ocean views. The rooms were clean and up to date, so I'm not sure what some of the reviewers mean by outdated and dirty. The beds were a little hard, i have to admit, and my husband and I think we have been bitten by bedbugs, but it could possibly be mosquitos. Overall, the resort is beautiful. There is the private beach which is a short ferry ride away. The one complaint I have about that is the cable car that goes to the marina. There are supposed to be 2, but only one was working, so the wait was a little inconvenient. So besides the beds and the cable cars, I give the resort itself an A+ On the negative side, we felt that they tried to squeeze as much money as possible out of us. It was ridiculous. Internet service was 15.00 a day! Not 15 bucks for the duration of the stay, which still would have been a lot, but each 24 hr period, was $15. Ridiculous.

We came off a beautiful cruise to the Southern Caribbean with Royal Caribbean and thought what better time to visit the beautiful El Conquistador. I had stayed here approximately 3 years ago and loved the entire experience. This experience, however, left much to be desired. I booked a 1 bedroom villa in the Las Casitas. When we arrived, the room had not been cleaned. The refuse laid on the front landing. Additionally, we paid $500.00 for a oceanview. For one to see the ocean you must go out on the front landing and look around the palm trees. We made the best of the stay becase of our prior experience; that was until we went to dinner. Being from NY, we are accostumed to higher prices, however, this was insulting. The restaurants were mediocre at best. During our previous stay, we were entitled to a complimentary breakfast at the Las Casitas. When we awoke, we did not see the same continental breakfast. We asked the wait staff and were told: \"there is new management, no more breakfast.\" We visited the concierge and were informed that the information given by the waitstaff was correct; the new management eliminated the breakfast. Subsequently, I had the $18.00 \"Golden Spa\" egg white omelet. We complained to the concierge about the messy, outdated villa. As a result, they moved our room, but informed us that he could not assist us further. He promised to send a bellboy to assist us with our luggage. Unfortunately, he forgot. I called and voiced my frustration. A bellboy arrived and brought us to a new room. The room was better, but not worth the rate. We became so frustrated that we contacted the airline and cut our visit short. The airline informed us that it would cost an additional $200.00 per person. It was worth salvaging our wonderful honeymoon experience. When we called the concierge, they did not seem surprised. Overall, the resort has beautiful property, but the El Conquistador seemed to be open to the public as a day resort which made for crowded pools and a not so luxorious Las Casitas. It was very disappointing because we loved it so much on our previous visit. I was relieved that when we boarded the shuttle bus to the airport an older couple echoed the same sentiments about this disappointing visit. Additionally, they informed us that they paid $280.00 per night for the same room. I would not recommend this resort to anybody in the future.

The island was a cool concept with a ferry getting you there in less than ten minutes, but the place is CRAMMED with chairs, cans of drinks laying by chairs by day's end (perhaps brought in by people who were not suppose to bring their own food?!?!) and a restaurant with marginal, overpriced food. The main issues - Overall Decor-Paint peeling everywhere, chairs by the pool are old with caked on dirt and need to be replaced - the whole place looks like it is hanging on by a thread. They are doing many renovations so hopefully in a year or two, they will be back up to speed. Restaurants-OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced with very average food. The one exception was The Strip House which was expensive but very good food, presentation and service with a decent wine list.

We stayed one week from July 31st and got a great deal on Hotwire so I cannot complain about the room rate. Then we were upgraded to a beautiful oceanfront room with a terrace or balcony that was at least 12 feet by 13 feet and had breathtaking and ever changing views. The room had not yet been updated but we found it very clean and appreciated the DVD player, coffee pot (with free coffee) and mini fridge. The safe was big enough to hold a laptop plus other items. There were no robes and no turn down service than one comes to expect in most 4 star hotels. Contrary to many of the reviews we did not find anything missing from our room, all staff were always nice, polite and friendly and the two small complaints we had were corrected by maintenance within half an hour. We found our bill to be correct but had saved all receipts as a precaution. Fortunately and based on information we had read in previous reviews we rented a car at the airport for the duration of the trip. We used the self parking which cost $15.00 plus tax per day but was well worth it as it allowed us to do all our sightseeing and exploring on our own along with many outings for meals. We bought our own breakfast supplies and ate on our terrace each morning. We even went to town to the blockbuster and rented movies. The private island is spectacular and some of the food is cheaper there than at the hotel, a fact which made no sense to us. Jet skis $110 per hour, double kayaks $38.00 per hour. Mask and fins and snorkel $15.00 just to give you a reference for rental rates. They also had sailboats, horseback riding and a sort of mini-put. The snorkelling was great about 200 ft off shore but we had to laugh as most guests stayed within 30 or 40 feet where there was absolutely nothing to see but the odd stray fish. The ferry could use a schedule and the funicular must become a huge problem when the hotel is full but was fine during our stay. We found two major problems for us at this hotel. The first, being the cost of everything. The cheapest bottle of wine on any menu is $40 but once you add tax and tip you are closer to $50. A hotdog and fries is $10 of course you still have tax and tip. Beer is $6 and drinks range from $8 to $14, again you must add tax and tip. Everybody we spoke to at the hotel felt it was pushed over the top and most were consuming all kinds food and drink in their rooms to avoid the excessive charges. We enjoyed a meal in the Chinese restaurant $60.00 for 2 with no drinks and the Italian at $75.00 for 2 with no drinks or wine. Both restaurants gave us excellent service and above average food. We also shared a pizza one night by the pool which came to $22 and was really good. The second problem was the other clients, the hotel was overrun with huge noisy families that had little or no concern in displaying the respect that a resort of this calibre should deserve. One previous reviewer referred to them as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153day-trippers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but in fact most of them are staying at the hotel using a special non-advertised Puerto Rican off season rate. We witnessed guest behaviour that you might expect at a Super 8 motel but not at an upscale resort. Guests often stayed in the pools with lots of hollering, horsing around and screaming and crying till past midnight. Because off the cheap room rate we were paying it was easy for us to overlook these issues. If I was paying top dollar I would have been really disappointed in my stay. The best tip I also found in one of these reviews was to leave the hotel on foot by walking past the gate at the marina. Within 5 minutes you will come to a small fishing village with many little bars and restaurants. The road is well lit so even if you come back late it felt reasonably safe. Local beer was $1.50 and although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat, some of the plates we saw go by looked pretty good. This is also where the trips to the Bio bay leave from. You can book directly from one of the operators here. I would stay here again if the rate was good but only with a car.

Everything seems perfect when we spoke to the hotel people and looked at the website. We set up the weeding via email and telephone. When we arrive to the hotel it took almost 2 hours to get us checked in our room. After that delay we went to check out the hotel and it was a little dirty. We said well we are here already might as well make the best of it. Next problem arose the hotel is in a mountain and due to this they charge ridiculous prices for their food and amenities, and I mean over priced. If you want to go out of the resort to eat which you can eat great food and affordable prices you have to either walk like miles or you can get a cab which will cost you about $40 dollars just to get down the mountain. Then same amount to get back. So of course we had to stay in the complex. So I decided I wanted to rent a car so that I can go out of the complex but wait if you rent a car you have to pay about 30.00 per day unless you rent the car through the hotel. ok so finally we give the final numbers of people coming to the wedding we told them 48 people plus 2 dj and 2 photographers. The photographers and djs would eat hamburgers and a drink for about 25 each. so here is the kicker on the contract they put 52 people total which was correct as per our count. 48 people invited and 4 workers at a discount price. When the weeding was over at the end of the night when we are drinking and having a great time they gave us the contract and it said 52 total people attended. So we signed it. Cool, our cards were charged we closed out and we were gone. Until about July 07 when they charged an additional 936.00 dollars. So I called the hotel and asked why the charge well they said we signed the contract for 52 people I said correct. 48 people plus the 4 workers. They told me that the reason was that they forgot to add the 4 plates at 234.00 each. I was like what; those people are part of the job which was supposed to be charged at the quoted price of 25.00 each as per our emails. Even with our email backup they refused to give us our money back. They said that we signed the contract for 52 and that charges were correct. This was completely done on purpose as they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break down the amount of people so after that fact they can come back and charge an extra 936.00. I have to say also that security was really bad there things were missing and in the own complex cars were left without tires all 4 tires. I just want to let people know to be very careful when booking with this hotel and check the taxes and all other hidden fees that they have. Outrages. Also if you have to buy souvenirs best to buy at the airport if not you will get ripped off. The food in the hotel in no way real Spanish Puerto Rican food. So if you are going to the hotel and expect real Spanish food forget it and I know I am Puerto Rican and lived most of my life there. Well good luck to all.

Our experience overall was great. RESORT: The resort itself is very big...takes a bit of time to get everywhere. The high-speed ferry to the beach is great (and fun!) - takes about 10 minutes. The private island is nice, however, the novelty wore off after a couple of days - it became kind of inconvenient to have to catch a ferry to get the the beach. The ferry runs every 1/2 hour and the last one back is at 5:30. The pool was very crowded, lots of kids. ROOM: We stayed in a deluxe oceanview room in the renovated Las Brisas wing. The room was AWESOME - king sized bed looked straight out at a gorgeous view of the ocean, balcony, huge bathroom and dressing area, DVD player in room, flat screen TV, iPod dock - no complaints here! FOOD: The food at the hotel is VERY expensive. Since we had a car, we were able to go to the supermarket and pick up basic amenities - water, breakfast bars, etc. I highly recommend doing this. The breakfast buffet was just okay...definitely not worth $25. We did go to the Italian restaurant, Otello, which was fantastic - highly recommend this. Aside from that, the food was just mediocre (esp. considering the high cost). We did go to a restaurant off of the resort called Pasion, which was highly recommended - it was cute and pretty good, but nothing spectacular. SERVICE: Just okay - didn't seem like anybody was going out of their way to help. The concierge was not helpful at all when it came to local activities, which was very surprising for such a high end hotel. ACTIVITIES: DEFINITELY go on a kayak tour of the bio-bay in Fajardo - this is not to be missed if you are in the area. Though I read a lot about Vieques being the better experience, it was just not convenient to get there (you would need to stay overnight, since the tour is at night). We tried Fajardo instead and it was an AMAZING experience. I went in the water and it was gorgeous (not scary!). We did the tour with Island Adventures and they were great. We also went Scuba diving through the resort - took a pool course and then went on a shallow dive. The dive was only about 20 feet and the water was not crystal clear - but it was still a fun experience.

We had one ocean view room and one garden view room. The garden view room was on the 6th floor and had, in my opinion, a pretty darn good view of the ocean. For the money, it may not be worth the upgrade to an ocean view room if you can manage to get a garden view room on a top floor. My girlfriend and I were in the ocean room. The first one they put us in was right next to an elevator, so we requested a change. The second room they put us in was right next to the funicular railway, which, by the way, runs all night! You'd think that if you request to be moved due to noise in the first place, that they wouldn't put you right next to something else that's equally as annoying. That room was also next to a family with who knows how many kids whose primary goal in life was to slam doors and yell loudly. We requested another move and were put on the other side of that particular wing in another ocean view room. This time, we weren't near anything noisy, and this room's view far exceeded that of the first two. Clearly, the rooms here aren't created equally. Speak up and get a nice one! The bed in the ocean view room was really comfortable, but forget about the L shaped vinyl couch. Whoever came up with that idea should be fired. Overall we found the staff very pleasant, helpful, and accommodating. We tried to sign up for a couple of the tours, but unless the hotel has enough people signed up, they won't run them, which was disappointing. Luckily, we decided to rent a car for a day and go out on our own. The rentals are cheap (there's an enterprise desk right next to the concierge), and this was the best decision we could have made. A car offers infinitely more freedom on this island (I didn't see any public trans), and since this hotel is literally on top of a huge hill and far away from San Juan, it's the only way to escape - for example - to eat somewhere local and reasonably priced (try El Pasion if you're looking for a good nearby restaurant). With four people, we spent nearly half as much on the car/gas as we would have doing the hotel's tours. We also saw double the amount of attractions. The most annoying thing about this place is that the beach is on an island and you have to take a boat out there to get to it. We didn't even bother doing this due to our schedule. The last boat out there leaves at 3 PM and the last boat back to the hotel leaves at 5 PM. At other hotels we visited during our business meeting, a beach was no more than a 2 minute walk from the hotel lobby (e.g. Rio Mar Hotel near El Yunque rainforest - as an aside, we swam at the beach here around 4 PM and it was amazing). At El Con, I guess you are just out of luck if you want to have a beer on the sand after 5 PM! The pools are open 24 hours, though, but during the day were crowded to the point where I wouldn't even really consider using them. I wondered if half the people using them were even staying at the resort. The Sting Ray Cafe offered delicious fine dining for around $50 a person not including drinks. The other restaurants were overpriced and were acceptable otherwise. I believe it's much better to go into Fajardo and find a local place instead. Overall, the place has amazing views. It's probably better for families than it is for couples. If you want beach access without a huge hassle, don't stay here. Also, this place is better for those who don't want to travel around the island - those looking for the resort experience only. The golf course looked great, too, although scorched in some parts. Also, the casino was a lot of fun, but for anyone who likes video poker, the pay table are awful (6/5 Jacks or Better).

You are told to park several blocks away from the hotel and then you wait in the blistering sun for a van to pick you up and bring you to the main lobby, all of which you are charged $15 a day for. Neither the van driver nor the bell men at the dropoff point assist you with your baggage (even women and children) unless you pay them up front. If you stay at Las Casitas (the higher end property) nobody at the main hotel will help you find your way as they appear to not care what happens to that property's guests. A cot for an additional guest in your room will run $45 a night and bedding (comforter) is not included. Everything you order from the bars has a 20% gratuity already included although the servers do not act like it. On our first day, four drinks cost us $58. Sandwiches for 3 people was $92. Then once you check out, your bill will undoubtebly have a multitude of charges that you never approved, everything from maid services (thought that was included in the price of the room?) to shuttle transportation that was never provided to parking charges for multiple vehicles even though you only had one vehicle. And please, do yourself a favor and do not leave the bar without signing your bill, assuming the staff will close it for you. That seems to be when most of the erroneous charges occur. After returning from Puerto Rico, I realized my card had been charged $6,000.00 erroneously which was in addition to the $2,000 mischarged while I was there. When I phoned the hotel to have it fixed, they told me their systems were down and they couldn't help me. That was the same answer I received when I was checking out and disputed several of the aforementioned charges they had erroneously applied to my account. All in all, my total tab was +$16,000.00 with more than $2,000.00 in erronecous charges which again, the hotel could not refund at the time of checkout because their computers were down as was internet in the room the entire time we were there (Great for spouses who want their spouse to focus on vacation, BAD for business people who have to keep tabs on the office while they're gone!). I can only guess how I will get my money back at this point. To be fair, the views at this hotel are like no other, as is the infinty pool and the private island available for guest use. The staff are next to worthless in terms of their desire to help you but if you can find a way to not be affected by their inattentiveness, your private moments with your family and loved ones can truly be priceless.

There were a few things that I didn't care for in the resort, the overpriced food and the parking. One day my boyfriend and I bought breakfast and spent 45 dollars for silver dollar pancakes and a breakfast buffet after that we headed out of the hotel to eat. We decided to self park since it was 15 a day instead of 20 for valet parking. Everyday when you self park you grab a ticket for that day and then park, the parking lot was a bit far so we had to wait for a van to pick us up which took a while some days and we had to walk maybe a 5 min walk up the hill. When you want to leave the next day you have to validate the ticket and have 20 mins to use the ticket to leave the parking lot which was a bit annoying. In the resort just about everything is charged to your room so make sure to keep your receipts because you will get a bill on your last day. I went to the bank one night and noticed a $250 charge on my credit card from a cigar bar which i never stepped foot in, apparently someone used my room number to charge my card, luckily my bank refunded me the money and i had to call the bar to tell them the situation. Places I would recommend- Palomino Island which is owned by El Conquistador. El Yunque- try La Mina Trail which is 30 min hike but the waterfall is so worth it. Snuba diving- is like scuba but without all the equipment, absolutely loved it especially if you're a first timer like I was. If you have a car go to Luquillo beach. I went to the biobay in Fajardo, didn't really care for it and it was one of the excursions i was most excited about. I took a ferry to Culebra Island which is an hour and a half ride and went to Flamenco beach, which was absolutely gorgeous.

I really can't say enough about this resort. I know that food tends to be expensive, but no more than if you stayed in any other resort, we live in Florida so you must know what I mean. The shuttle was always waiting to take you from the parking lot to the lobby. We took the funicular one night down to the marina and walked out into the little town and had dinner - it was wonderful and inexpensive, so that is an option also. We had a car, which was great, since the only problem with the resort is that the tour desk does not book tours unless they have enough people sign up and that can be a problem if you had your heart set on doing something outside the resort. But honestly, that is the only problem we encountered. There are locals stores to buy things on the way in and you have a refrigerator in the room, for drinks, etc. The views from anywhere in the resort were breath taking.

Even the golf course looked beautiful (and I don't golf!!!) We ended up SPLURGING on one night at the Conquistador because we were there for a wedding. Even with the group wedding rate, one night with breakfast and parking costs was close to 400 bucks. Which to us....is a huge splurge. (For a nice budget location see my review of the Passion Fruit B&B, which is just down the road.) Upon arrival, I had to leave my car with the valet b/c I was blocked in by other cars and couldn't move it myself to self-park. That was sorta like strike one. Then I rush into the lobby to check in. It was no use to rush because there was a pretty long line to check in. You could say this was strike two. Then I notice a computer for electronic check in. The lady behind me noticed it too. So we came to an agreement....I would hold her place in line while she tried it out and then she'd do the same for me. Her attempt was not successful...it computer did not allow her to check in. It was my turn. Same results. This is now strike three and I had not been there an hour! Fortunately, the bellman was standing nearby and investigated our errors at the machine. It turns out our rooms were not ready and thats why the machine had not been successful at checking us in. And he also mentioned that the automated check in had just been installed that same week! So if you try it...good luck! By the time I made it to the counter, my room was still not ready. I was told to return in two hours time. It was ok because I had a wedding practice to attend. Two hours later.... and my room was still not ready! Strike four?!? Instead of making an angry woman scene, I decided for \"feel sorry for me, i've been up since 3 am and need a shower\" and it worked. I had a room in five minutes and things started to get better. And then another oh my God moment. The room was awesome. It was newly renovated in this contemporary look. I loved it, my husband thought different of the decor. Oh well. I'll post pics...check them out and you decide for yourself. The balcony was awesome. It was so neat to wake up and see the ocean from the bed! Breakfast at las Brisas was delicious. The staff at Las Brisas was super nice. Again, spectacular views. The pool was great. Unfortunatly, because of the wedding, we didnt do much else. So I can't go into Palomino Island, the Spa, or anything else. Kinda disheartening when we paid all that $$ and didnt do much. Which is why I'd like to return to the resort. I can say that it was a beautiful resort with accomidating staff. I'd stay here again only because I feel like I missed out on the amenities. And they have big plans for the future....they are in the process of building new ballrooms and a water park. My only real dislike would be the valet service. The guys were ok and I guess you cant really complain b/c they were real busy...but I think the valet manager guy could have been more helpful and a little nicer.", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cBueatiful but overpriced\u201d", "Author": "outtawv", "ReviewID": "UR7711349", "Content": "Rooms were old.

Before we left we made sure to read the reviews and were a little scared after seeing all the negative reviews. In fact, we almost cancelled the trip after reading that someone got bedbugs at the hotel. But in the end we decided to continue our trip because we figured that there was just no way that it could be that bad.... and after returning from the trip I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we didn't listen to all those negative posting. The resort itself it beautiful. The views you will see there are unlike any others that I ve ever encountered. They are simply breathtaking. The resort is about an hour from the airport and far from the city, but to me that was one of its best features. San Juan is very congested and there are only a few beachfront hotels and none that have views like that of The El Conquistador. Also being so far out gave us a chance to see the countryside of the island, which is something that you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t encounter if you stay in the city. The Resort is very big and although the hotel might be at capacity you do not feel crowed at all. Our check in/out was very smooth and only took minutes. We had a Garden View Room that was very spacious with an incredible view of the tennis courts and the golf course. The room itself was average at best. The room was very outdated and was screaming for an upgrade. The comforter on the bed was from the 80s maybe 70s and was very hard. The sheets on our bed were never changed the entire stay, unless all their sheets have holes in them. The room was clean and there was no mold or leaking ceilings to report like mentioned in the other reviews. Overall the room was okay, but by no stretch of the imagination could it be considered 5 star. ( Oh, and beware if you get a garden view room, the birds will chirp all night long. So if you cant sleep through that, you might want to upgrade. However it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us, and we were actually amused by it.) Palomino Island is beautiful with white beaches and crystal clear blue water perfect for snorkeling. You had to get on the funicular and a ferry to get to the beach, but it was not at all the hassle I read about. Usually we got on the funicular without a wait, but on a few occasions we waited at the most 5-minutes. The ride on the ferry only took about 10 minutes to get to the beach. The food and the drinks on the island ( and the entire hotel ) were not that great. The drinks were watery and the food was mediocre at best. The prices for the food was high but it was to be expected at a resort. The service was slow at all the daytime restaurants and it was almost like the wait staff were on vacation too. Several people advised us that there are good local restaurants in walking distant from the hotel near the marinas. We did not get a chance to find them but I would advise people to eat off of the resort and to rent a car so you don't have to be stuck at the hotel. While there were plenty off activities to choose from during the day, the nightlife was very dull. The casino was small and not that entertaining. Casablanca, the club on the resort, was always empty. On our last night there I looked through one of the books in the hotel room and discovered that there were an array of different nighttime activities to choose from like taking a sunset cruise or private dinners at the marina. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the adventurous type I would recommend the Bioluminescent Bay Kayak Adventure at night. Its very exciting and most people say that its the highlight of their trip. If you have a rental car I would recommend going to Old San Juan for a day. Its a very historic town with lots to see and do. If you don't have a car and have to go with a tour group I would recommend going with the group that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include the Rum factor. Don't get me wrong, the Rum factor is nice as well, but it doesn't compare to exploring the streets of Old San Juan. We did the combination tour and only had two hours in Old San Juan. We found ourselves racing back to the bus and there was still a ton of stuff to see and do. I felt like we missed out on a lot and really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a taste of what Old San Juan had to offer. Overall our trip to Puerto Rico was really great and I would return to the hotel when I go back. I know for next time to rent a car so I will be able to see more sites and be able to dine at local restaurants. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a laidback getaway without all the crowds and the tourist, this place is for you. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re younger and are looking for more of a party scene and a high-energy nightlife, this is not the place for you.

I was leery going into the trip because of the reviews that I had been reading leading up to our departure. I vowed to write a review of my own, good or bad, because I think a lot of people are like me and don't know how much to believe these reviews. First, the resort is about 1.5 hours away from the airport. We were told it was about 1 hour, so we were just a bit disappointed. But that changed when we arrived and caught glimpse of the resort! The resort was beautiful, inside and out. Although we did see the construction mentioned in some of the reviews, it was off in the distance and never interfered with our enjoyment of the resort. The pools are pristine and the lounge chairs are plentiful. Everywhere I turned on the resort, I saw beautiful flowers and trees...it was just gorgeous. And the views were breathtaking. We took the funicular to the marina on a few occasions and had to wait a few minutes some of the time, but it was nothing worth complaining about. The ferry to the island was new and quick and we were there in no time. The island itself is gorgeous and the sand and water were exactly what the doctor ordered. (Bring aqua shoes for some spots in the ocean...other spots are just fine). At the island, you can do anything you can think of (at a price...for example, rent a personal raft for $11 a day) and you can even take a hike or visit a clothing optional secluded beach (we didn't!). Beware though! If the resort is busy and a lot of guests are on the island for the day, plan in advance when you want to return. The last ferry back to the resort leaves at 5:30 p.m. We were at the dock at 4:00 p.m. but because of the line, we didn't go until the 4:30 trip. The resort has two ferries and I don't know why they weren't running both of them, considering the obvious crowd at the island! We stayed in the Las Brisas wing, which is the renovated part of the resort. The room was spacious and the decor was modern and very nice. The bed was comfortable but nothing I'd write home about. The best part of the room was the ocean view. We left the doorwall open to the balcony for most of our trip because the ocean breeze was quite amazing. And, the sounds of the little coqui frogs made it a perfect way to fall asleep. The rooms were quiet and we had quick service when we called to request extra towels. My one complaint is that the tub in the bathroom is quite dangerous! The top of the tub is at floor level and you have to step down into the tub to get in. Had I not been looking, I would have surely injured myself falling into the tub. There were no handrails either to assist you...I had to sort of awkwardly grip the walls to climb down into the tub. Not so fun after you've had a couple of Tropical Itch drinks (have one - they are great!). We ate at Stingray Cafe, Cafe Bella Vista, Iguana's (on the island), Cafe Caribe, Virgin Burgers and David's Cookies. Everything everyone says about the prices are correct - it is a bit on the pricey side. But, we knew that going in and weren't too shocked by the price of food on the resort. The price of the pizza at Cafe Bella Vista ($19 for a thin 12 inch pizza) was a bit obnoxious, but the food was good. So was my $17 chicken salad. Drinks were around $7-$8, which is what I've paid in the past at some of the nicer restaurants in my town and in Chicago. We cut corners by eating at David's Cookies every morning for breakfast. Their warm croissants with ham and Swiss cheese were perfect right before a soak in the pool. We also snuck some liqour onto the island (which is prohibited) and mixed a few drinks with our friends. Casablanca's is the only nightclub that I recall seeing on the resort and it was okay...smallish and the selection of music isn't the greatest. The Casino also is quite small and not very generous, though, thankfully I didn't spend much of my time there. For the most part, we had an excellent experience with the staff at El Conquistador. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. Our bellman Alex was quite informative and gave us a wonderful synopsis of the resort as he took us to our room. The service at Stingray Cafe was impeccable. The service at Iguana's, Virgin Burgers and Cafe Bella Vista was painfully slow. When we were at Iguana's, our friends at another table moved to a completely different section of the restaurant because they hadn't seen a server for the first twenty minutes they were there! And none of the other servers were willing to help. We had been warned about \"island time\" before we left and now we know exactly what that means. On one of the evenings, we attended a private party and were treated splendidly by the staff at El Conquistador. I was disappointed to not have tried any authentic Puerto Rican food while staying at the resort. I wish one of their restaurants offered something of the sort. And, due to the location of the resort, you are so secluded that it's rather a pain to leave the resort! If you don't have a rental car (which, if you are staying anywhere other than Las Casitas, you must pay to park $15 per day), you can get a ride into town, but it will cost you...$20 there and $20 back.) And it's a hike to get anywhere in the resort. I know that some people have complained about it, but if you've seen the photos of the resort (and the map that is viewable on their website) this should not have come as a shock to you. The walks to and from destinations just gave us more time to enjoy the beautiful surroundings. All in all, we had a wonderful time. We went into the trip well aware of the prices and were not surprised at our tabs. And, we went in expecting to quite possibly be disappointed in our room. Because of this, we were so pleasantly surprised with our beautiful room and even more beautiful ocean view. If we ever return to Puerto Rico, I may be hesitant about booking a room at El Con only because of the fact that we would be so secluded from the rest of the island. But that's nothing a rental car wouldn't fix. Definitely give it a try if you won't be too shocked by the price of the food and drinks.

While everything is connected, the El Conquistador hotel was huge and the pool area was massive - lots of chairs, lots of people, I felt like it was \"spring break-ish\". The casitas were more secluded and the pool area (not the one by the restaurant) was spectacular- we used it everyday and didn't even venture to the island that the resort has. I have stayed in many hotels (I am a big business traveler), and if you say you are a 5 star, then I expect a certain level. While everyone was nice and accomodating, I can safely say the rooms are not 5 star qualilty (we moved because the first room we were placed in was at best, a room that you would get at a Quality Inn). The second room had a balcony and a view of nothing much but it was far superior than the first room. We were moved quickly and the butler (nice name for a bell boy) was very social. The service was not 5 star, they were nice but S-L-O-W, and considering they include a 20% tip in every transaction, why should they servers go faster? Everyday, we had to go and find a server to come to the pool area. At the pool, we would havedrinks and lunch and bill was always around $100 - we didn't drink anything fancy it is just that expensive. A diet coke can was 4.95, just for an example of the prices. We got room service and it was another $100. they charge you double the service charge to deliver to the casitas and the 20% tip. The marina area is dumpy and the Los Olos area isn't much nicer, we only went to the marina to get picked up for the bioluminecent tour. The kayaking was nice but make sure you use BUG spray, I did and still have 12 bites on one arm. Good experience to go into the lagoon and you do get wet, so bring a towel for when you are finished. Don't bring cameras, etc. they will get wet. Got pizza from one of the restaurants and it was FABULOUS. seriously, the best meal we had. Ate at Strip, and it was very good, the service was exceptional and the manager on duty was doing everything right, he came by our table and ensured everything was going well (not obtrusively..just wanted to take care of his guests). I would recommend this place for a nice dinner. Had massages at the spa, and I thought they did a nice job. Efficient, on time and most of all, I felt as thought I had gotten a massage. We rented a car at the airport and it worked out well for us. You don't have to pay for parking if you stay at the Casitas but will if you stay at the El Conquistador (like 15/day or something). Overall, i would stay at this hotel again, but would remember it is not a 5 star but a 4 star in need of some fancier rooms (lost water one morning and the faucets were poorly attached to the sink), some more training of the staff (housekeeping was hit/miss and no turn down service - the cornerstone of 5 star service) and more maintenance of the common areas (someone broke glass in front our entrance, it was cleaned up somewhat but a bunch of glass remained and probably is still there).", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clinton, NJ", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, all in all good bet\u201d", "Author": "njmom4", "ReviewID": "UR7668924", "Content": "We just got back from a week at this hotel.

We just came back from a 5 days stay at El Conquistador and all I can say is that we had a wonderful experience. Housekeeping of our room was always good, perhaps on the 4th day (Thursday) it was a little \"short\" as the hotel was crowded with newcomers and the checkouts of people on conferences. However, I must add that on the 4th night I called guest requests and asked them to make the sofabed of our room and I was impressed by how quickly they got to our room to get it done. I know that each guest at a hotel gets a unique experience, so, this is mine! I can't wait to go back and spend more time by the pool, or at the Palomino Island, or even just to take the \"water taxi\" to Palomino and enjoy the Ocean Breeze and the views. At night, it was fun to \"waste\" a few dollars at the casino and watch the \"serious players\" or just walk around!. You can listen to some music (live music on weekends), dance, or simply have a drink outside at Brisas Cafe (I think that's the name!) . There is a nice bar and seafood restaurant by the marina area. There are lots of nice seating areas in the hotel, so you can just sit and relax. My $ tips... One thing to keep in mind when booking a hotel like El Conquistador is that regardless of the room deal that you may find, (who doesn't like to get a designers pair of jeans at 75% cleareance!!) the reality is that the prices for food will most likely remain the same, no deal there. I say this because I am surprise by the amount of reviews pointing at the high cost of meals...I honestly think that the prices are fair, for the most part. The italian restaurant had a sunset deal from 6 to 7:30 which was ok, $40 for a 3 course meal, not bad!, I won't recommend it after 7:30 PM. The prices at the asian , steak house and seafood restaurants were, in my opinion, reasonable and competitive when compared to similar restaurants in PR or the US, main entrees range from $17 to over $40 pp, I'll say that's average. Breakfast can range from $4 to $25 per person...i.e., you can get a ham & cheese bagel and coffee for about $4 at the cookies' place, or the \"whole 9 yrds\" at the $25 buffet, where kids under 4 won't pay, or have a breakfast special at the restaurant in front of the casino for about $8-10. I tried them all. You can also stock up your room with some breakfast items that won't require refrigeration (i.e. cereals). You can buy a 1/2 gallon of milk at the cookies store (about $4) and keep it in your room small refrigerator (when traveling with kids, milk is essential...you should have their favorite snacks also). The hotel provides you with 2 top quality PRican coffee packs for your room coffee maker everyday. The bkfst buffet is really good! but once during the stay is enough, you won't need lunch after the buffet. Drinks are what they are! always costly in hotels. You can basically buy all kinds of alcoholic beverages components at any local grocery store, so, you can keep some in your room, there's plenty of ice available. Otherwise, be ready to pay from $6 to $10 for beers & cocktails. As for lunch, average cost is about $17 but I highly recommend sharing, so that makes it less than $9 per person, not bad and more than enough food. You can try local restaurants, PRican food is really good and local restaurants are usually less expensive. Definetly try the seafood stuffed arepas or coconut arepas, you can get them at Las Croabas, near the hotel, a short walk from the marina (hotel dock) where there are many places that sell them from $4 to $6, nice lunch alternative or mid-afternoon snack, so that you can have a very late dinner. Ask the employees, they'll help with directions. Last but not less important, kids portions, you can get some from $4 to $8 at the restaurants by the pool or the one by the casino, but keep in mind that the high end restaurants which open after 6PM don't have many choices for kids (the asian does).

They did not want to leave and neither did we! This phenomenal property is located on a cliff with unsurpassed ocean views. Our two connecting rooms were deluxe with large bathrooms (nicely upgraded), walk-in closets, large bedrooms, nice sized balcony and flat screen TVs (full cable access). I might also mention that the beds were very comfortable! There is so much to do while \"on property\" that we never felt the need to leave. We all enjoyed the two brand new $2 million+ catamarans that sweep you from the Hotel's marina to their private island. We visited the island every day - sometimes staying 2 hours, sometimes longer. Our two children (ages 3 and 6) played endlessly in the safe clear water while we relaxed over cocktails and good reading. There is fun for the adults, too! I had the most amazing 80 minute facial (The Rainforest Organic Facial) at the Golden Door Spa. I personally belong to a very high end spa in Colorado and the Golden Door was superior to my spa by far! I highly recommend the Rainforest Facial, all of the massages and the reflexology treatment. You will not be disappointed! The treatments along with the venue are superb. I also attended many of the fitness classes at the spa. One of the instructors taught me some great balance techniques during a group class. This particular trainer was very knowledgeable and used to train Mariah Carey! My husband skipped the spa and played two rounds on the golf course. He was pretty excited to get to play more than once! I know he had a great time. I did not play the course but drove by it a few times in the complimentary valet golf cart. The course is beautiful with breathtaking views and lovely landscaping. The hotel service is superb and the restaurants are \"top notch\". There is plenty to choose from. However, we particularly enjoyed our gourmet meal at The Strip House (try the Lobster Bisque as an appetizer and do not miss the Cheesecake for dessert). We were overwhelmed by the amazing sushi at Blossoms Restaurant. While at Blossoms be sure to order the spicy tuna rolls - they are \"to die for\"! Drakes Martini Bar is right across the hall with great cocktails and a stylish decor. Recreation at the hotel also includes a casino, multiple shops, outdoor pools and many smaller restaurants for quick and tasty meals. The funicular entertained our children and provides lovely ocean views (it takes passengers from the hotel to the marina). It is important to mention that there is a kids camp for children ages 4 and up (must be potty trained). Our 6 year old son spent a couple of days in the program and had a blast. The counselors were terrific and my son made some new friends. Finally, both of our children were endlessly entertained by the water slide at the main pool. I believe at last count our son went down that slide 243 times during our stay. Exciting news to share is that the hotel is in the process of building a state of the art water park. More slides!!

However I was pleasantly surprised!! From the moment we stepped out of the cab to the moment we were dropped off at the airport, the staff was extremely courteous - my family and I are not used to this kind of service. The property and views will take your breath away. We went in the first week of May from Mon-Thurs so there were fewer crowds and the staff had more time to really take care of you, so if you're planning to go for a weekend in July/Aug keep in mind they are probably booked to capacity and cut them some slack!! Also, there was construction going on in some areas but honestly it didn't bother us, the workers were friendly to you if you were nice to them. Also there were no problems with our bill. Some warnings: be prepared for the expensive restaurants; we spent the most on food while we were there. Apparently, there is a small fishing village you can walk to from the marina where you can experience real Puerto Rican cuisine for cheap prices; we didn't find out until the day we left so we missed out on that. Palomino Island (their private island) is a great place to spend a day, they have tons of water sports and horseback riding, etc. Again, keep in mind the prices. For tours and excursions, I would recommend renting a car for El Yunque Rainforest instead of paying for the tour. I would recommend bringing rain gear and wearing a swimsuit as it WILL rain when you go, and there are these falls which you can swim in. However it is a 35 minute hike from the main trail. For Old San Juan you should go with a tour; we went by ourselves and had no idea where to go. Also, for most of the tours that the hotel organizes, there is a 6-8 person minimum so we missed out on some of them cause there weren't enough people interested in going. If you're going with a group then you're fine but if you're in a smaller group (we were 3) then keep that in mind. Probably in the middle of the summer the tours will leave every day but make sure to call ahead to check. All in all - this is a great place for groups to go to, there is so much for everyone to do. They have a lot of wedding parties here as well, they have a beautiful location for a wedding although I have no idea how much that would cost. Really romantic for couples. Families would enjoy themselves as well - they have a children's \"club\" with activities. I would definitely recommend this hotel for people who enjoy watersports, otherwise you will have less to do. Basically take these reviews with a grain of salt, as each person's experience will be different. We went at an opportune time because it wasn't so crowded and we were able to enjoy ourselves. When we left on Thursday we noticed the crowds rolling in and they probably had a different experience than us, who knows.

DO NOT STAY THERE! Yes, for the most part, the negative reviews posted on Trip Advisor are true. The bellman summed it up very simply, \"Nothing is free at this hotel except the air.\" They charge you for everything, parking, tennis, the gym, etc. In addition to that, everything is expensive. Bottled water is $6.00, a simple greek salad (very small) is $19.00, and dinner for 2 at the Italian restaurant ran us $180.00. We found the food in the restaurants to be mediocre at best. After our $180 experience we started eating off the property. There are many very good restaurants in the area. Although the boat ride to the beach is fun, it only ran every half hour at best. This was not very convenient, especially if we left the property for a trip and returned in the afternoon. There wasn't enough time to park the car, walk back to the room quickly, and use the tram to get to the boat, when the last boat back was at 5:00. I didn't go all the way to Puerto Rico to sit by the pool. The room we had was very outdated and it looked like it had not been renovated since the 80's. The furniture was \"beat\" looking and also damaged. It looked like furniture you would expect if you were paying $69.00 a night, not $430.00 a night! The room didn't have a balcony, or a refrigerator. We were provided a \"cooler\" which kept water cool as long as I kept adding ice to it two times a day. I also was not pleased with their customer service. One day I was changing my clothes and a stranger walked in my room. Unfortunately a bellman let him in to the wrong room. When I went to the front desk, very upset, the clerk was helpful, and brought the manager over to me. He apologized to me, but did not offer anything from the hotel to apologize. Even after I stated, \"Sorry doesn't cut it for me, you can at the very least comp me a meal,\" the manager told me he would get back to me.

The property is beautiful, and the amenities are abundant. There is much to enjoy and there is much not to like. For your reference, I came in on a Monday and left on a Thursday. I would urge you to consider the following before committing to this hotel: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The property is self-contained and removed from the rest of Fajardo. If you are looking for a real and total Puerto Rican experience, you are not likely to encounter it here. My entire stay felt like a mainstream mainland resort experience. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The private island and its views are stunning. The beach there is beautiful and in good shape. Aside from the strong winds, the day I spent on the island was really great. (The food and drinks were respectable, too, but a bit pricey.) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2You will walk\u00e2\u20ac\u201da lot. The property is huge, and you will likely do a lot of walking to get from where your bed is to wherever you want to go. So much moving around is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something to consider. This is especially true since there is not all that much to see after the second day. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2This is a destination hotel, resort, and spa. Although most of the rooms seemed empty during my visit, there was a convention going on and there were two private nighttime events. So, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for quiet, isolated seclusion, you might not find it here. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2I ate at least four meals at the hotel. They were completely unremarkable in just about every way I can think of. This is not to say that they were bad. It is just that the food is upscale hotel fare that seemed more like generic chic than inspired. I think Rachel Ray would like it, but Anthony Bourdain would not. Several of the restaurants were not open during my stay, though I never had to wait any place I went. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Do not (necessarily) believe the guidebook hype about this being a jumping resort at night. Whether it was the time of year, the fact that my stay was in the middle of the week, or just happenstance, most of the bars and clubs on the property were dead or closed. Moreover, the casino is small and the slot machines do not take coins\u00e2\u20ac\u201da big disappointment to those of us who like the clank of real coins hitting the bucket. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Like airports, universities, and other hotels, this property is under construction. This was not a really big deal, except it was a bit of a hassle parking my rental car. Also, although tolerable, the construction noise was annoying and went well past six at night. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2From my point of view, El Conquistador is trying to be all things to all kinds of travelers. The current wave of construction involves a convention center, a water park, and upgraded ocean-view rooms. Throw in the spa, the golf course, tennis, the private island, and shopping, and it is more like a town than a hotel. Personally, I found it quaintly boring\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbeautiful but uninteresting. It would probably be perfect for large family gatherings (weddings and family reunions come to mind) or for getaways that need not be too exciting or too active. I would avoid this property if you are looking for fine luxury, real adventure, or genuine character. If you want a nice place to go for a bit, El Conquistador will suit you fine. There are so many different kinds of rooms at El Conquistador that it would be unfair judge the whole resort based on my experience. I had a garden room with a view of the tennis court and the golf course. The most impressive feature of the room was its size. It was bigger than my two-bedroom apartment (less my kitchen). Two full beds looked small in the huge main room that opened up to the spacious balcony. This area also had a sitting area, writing table, armoire with television and stereo, a wet bar, and a minifridge. The bathroom area had a full tub, separate water closet (toilet) area, make-up table, and full closet. The room was so big that the Swedish Bikini Team could have had the U.S. Beach Volleyball Team over for drinks and there would have been room left over. Several things really irked me about the room. The beds were substandard. Had I been paying the rack rate (about $450 I think), I would have demanded a better room. I stayed at a $99-a-night Marriott with a bed about 10 times better. The wall lamps were broken\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwell, they worked, but in every way other than that they turned on and off, they needed to be replaced. During my four days, not once was the coffee or tea replenished for the in-room coffee maker. Never have I stayed at a hotel where the coffee and tea service were not replaced daily. (And considering the long walk to the restaurants from my room, I was really peeved about this.) Some other notes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Parking is expensive, but really worth it if you want to see the rest of the island or just want to make a trip to the grocery store to pick up some essentials for the fridge. (There is a large strip mall nearby, and other stores very close.) Most of the people at the resort were young couples (many with babies), small families, and older couples without kids (or grandkids). Singles, and even active couples, might find El Conquistador a little too tame. The most adventurous thing about this place is the funicular and the boat ride to the island. I mentioned it above, but the property is under construction. Ask about this before you book a room. Ask if your room is newly renovated. Ask what the view is. Know what you are getting into. I would not expect that the construction noise and activities would bother most people, but it might bother you and it is worth asking about it. I received a mysterious charge from the hotel on my credit card two weeks after I left the resort, although I do not have any record or recollection of this charge. American Express is currently investigating. At this point, I cannot say that is any more than a mix-up or a simple mistake. Still, the experience proves the value of checking your statements diligently. Finally, Puerto Rico is not that large of an island, and Fajardo is not too far from San Juan and is close to El Yunque. You should be able to see these places without a problem if you have a car.

We had a wonderful time. I would attribute this to the fact that we weren't paying for anything (this was a corporate award trip) and that our group had an on-site meeting planner who dealt with any potential pitfalls and kept us blissfully ingnorant. While our room was not yet renovated, it did have a spectacular view of the Caribean and was comfortably close to everything we needed, including the spa. It was clean enough, though not pristine, not \"5 star\" but perfectly acceptable. The hotel was supposed to be at 100% capacity, which concerned me upon check in - but the resort is so huge, you really don't feel like you're in a crowd at any time. The only thing we waited for was the funicular to get to the ferry. This wasn't ever any more than 5 minutes - no problem. The spa is wonderful, not the BEST, but good and clean with wonderful attendants. Food is good, again, not \"5 star\" but resort quality with one notable exception. . . Strip House is at least as good as most fine steak houses in NY or Chicago and the prices are similar (very high) but worth a trip upstairs. The decor is stunning. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. NOW, the warnings: a couple in our group did experience bed bugs and the type of nonchalant service described by other reviewers. They were shuffled from one disgusting, dirty room to another for two days and missed a couple of night's sleep. Another member of our party had jewelery stolen from a locked in-room safe. Not cool at all. Still others confided that their rooms were dirty, buggy, moldy, had holes in the walls or ceilings or were loud at night. Personally, I really enjoyed the natural sound of the tiny frogs and exotic birds at night. Overall, I think it's really the luck of the draw at the el con. We got lucky and are very thankful. Others, had a very unfortunate experience. In addition, the prices for food and services here are positively criminal. We enjoyed a six pack of Coors Light on the beach at Palomino Island for $36 plus tip. Breakfast buffet for two with taxes and tip (no alcohol) was $63. Lunch (hot dog and quesadilla with two beers) was over $70. A private cabanna at the pool is $214 per day, 50 minute massage $150 plus taxes and tip.

They did not advise it at check in. - The food was terrible and overpiced. Every place you ate, the menu was the same. - Fine Dinning - The resort has 3 high end restuarants for dinner only. The food was good, but everthing was 2x what should have been charged. - Grounds - The resort is beautifully located on the cliffs, but without easy acess to a beach, made for a major disappointment. The private island is not that great. You have to wait for a ferry, which only runs on the 1/2 hour and the ride is about 15 minutes. After all the dealing, it is not worth it. Because of the inconvience, we only went to the island one time and spend all the time at the pool. The island was not that great. - The trams - you have to take a tram down to the lower part of the resort. Most of the time that we were there, one of the trams was broken. Everyday we spent about 30 minutes waiting in line for the tram. - Activities - the pricing to snorkel, fish, sail, etc. were so over inflated, that we did not spend the money. - The Golden Door Spa- We really enjoyed the treatments and the staff were fantastic. The spa seemed to not fit in with the resort since it was so much nicer than any spots on the resort. The only negative about the spa is that it was SO EXPENSIVE. But once you are at this resort, you are looknig for some relief from your overpriced reality.", "Date": "April 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cDon't Let The Bad Reviews Scare You...Loved It!\u201d", "Author": "TravelGrl63", "ReviewID": "UR7282415", "Content": "We were booked at this hotel for an awards trip that my husband won.

I have to say that after reading many of the reviews here I was more than a little scared that our visit would have more than a fair share of problems and disappointments. Let me reassure you, the bad reviews were completely off. We had a wonderful time, beginning immediately when we arrived at the resort and were escorted to the check in desk. Check in went very quickly and we were escorted to our room. Now, we were not put in the newly renovated rooms, and I will say that the room was a bit outdated and in need of some upgrading; however, it was not the nightmare I had read about in other reviews. We had a lovely ocean view which was incredibly beautiful! We were also right above the three main pools, which were also beautiful. The food was very expensive, and we were glad that most of our meals were taken care of by my husbands company; however, the meals that we did eat there were exceptional. The Stingray Cafe was a great experience as was the little cafe by the pool (great pina coladas and pizza). There is also a little place right behind the casino that has great coconut ice cream. Yum! Palomino Island, the private island owned by the resort is wonderful. Plenty of lounge chairs and plenty of shade after you've had enough of the sun. The only bad thing about the island was again, the food was expensive, and the pina coladas were not that great. Oh well. The service the entire time we were there was outstanding! We were constantly greeted...everyone always had a smile and said hello. One wonderful lady from the housekeeping staff even took the time to walk us all the way from the front lobby to the funicular (the transport to the marina) because we couldn't find it. The grounds are incredibly beautiful as well. We will definitely go back to this great resort and bring our kids with us this time.

The hotel looks great on the website and promises a great deal of value but we experienced quite a few problems whiel staying there. 1. Check in - it took us over 45 minuters to check in. Cannot figure out why since the hotel already had all the info from the initial reservations. People were growing very impatient while waiting. To top it off ,nobody could get room keys for the next 3-4 hours so everytiem you wanted to re-enter the room, we had to call the bell service. No apologies were offered, I guess it is a normal practice. 2. The room was large, as promised but extrremalty outdayted (Garden View) with some kind of pasta sauce/ketchup/blood on the walls and the ceiling. It took me 2 days to get this issue resolved (they repainted the room). A decent 4-star hotel would give us a different room aoreven an upgrade but we could not even get an apology. 3. The food is very pricey but that was expected. Plenty of cheap local food if you are willing to walk 10 minutes from the marina . 4. The beach is very good, although weekends are very crowded and noisy due to the influx of locals. 5. Service in some resuarants is non-existant. We waited for about 20 minutes just to get menus. But upscsale restaurants have very good service. We've been to many 4 and 5 star hotels in US, Europe and Australia. El Conquistador compares only in pricing but not in service and hospitality.

It's a standard beach with a restaurant and bar. And if you think about it, it's a pain to take a ferry to the beach so we only did this once.

There was a band that would play in the area next to the casino on many nights and people would dance out in the front. There was also a nightclub in the main area that had music and dancing. We thought the Las Casitas side had a more romantic feel to it. They have an amazing pool on that side which is supposedly only for their guests. If you are low key about things you can head over there and relax. The pool at the El Conquistador side was too crowded and not our taste.

We won this on priceline from the mid 250s which is not cheap but quite low compared to the 375 and up rates for the President's Day weekend we were there. Was it worth that price? Probably not. But had I paid what some people on this site list as prices they paid, I'd have definitely been happier with the deal. I think this place has many pluses and negatives, and they kind of balance out. For me, the two big negatives were the state of the rooms (mentioned repeatedly in other reviews posted here) and the total lack of security - not necessarily in thefts (we had nothing stolen) but in who roams the grounds freely at what hours, access to swimming pools and various parts of the resorts (see below). The first thing to note about this hotel is that the grounds and location on the cliff are heavenly. Gorgeous views from every part of the grounds - and a beautiful golf course. If you just spend most of your time walking around the different parts of the hotel, you can't deny how lovely the location is. The pools are also quite nice, especially very late at night when there are not too many people around and the locals populating them have left... and there are many pools to choose from. However, it is not really practical to attempt to get anywhere with the Funicular (including lower level rooms, or pools, so avoid those). I highly recommend avoiding the rooms at Marino or the mid-level Las Olas village if you plan on going to the Casino, restaurants, or if you have a car you have to retreive at any point of time (by the way, use the valet service for car, its the best extra $5 you will ever spend). The Las Brisas wing is redone and the photos I was shown looked spectacular but it is quite pricey- about 125-165 more than an ocean view room in the La Vista section. We had one Ocean View room (via upgrade) n La Vista, and one Garden View. The surprise is the Garden View, on 6th floor, was ten times better than the much pricier Ocean View. If you can get a room that is closest to the Spa on the Garden/golf course side, such that you don't have to look in on all the construction, or Tennis Courts (this would be the very farthest rooms a the end of La Vista farthest from lobby) and if you can get it on the 5th or 6th floor, you will have a far better room than any full ocean view room in La Vista. The garden and golf course views from the upper La Vista levels are just spectacular, and you also have a huge balcony. The Ocean View rooms are smaller, cramped, and with very dirty windows you may not be able to open! But as I said, the value all depends on what you pay. Be prepared for most things in the room not to function and just decide to spend time outside the room. I am very picky about hotel rooms and had I not already read every single review on tripadvisor, I would have been shocked upon arrival and far more miserable- Luckily I arrived with low expectations. The out of date state of the rooms was less disturbing than the filth. One of our rooms had food cookies and pretzels on the carpet when we arrived, and a huge puddle. There was hair on the bathroom floor in both rooms we had. I do not think these rooms are cleaned properly at all and there is little hope they will be. On the plus side, the staff worked incredibly hard to get us a new room when I complained (the food on carpet was too much!)- Once we got over the hair-cookies-pretzels issues, I tried not to notice the many other new problems in our new rooms - the remote not working in one room, the cordless phone totally broken in the other, the coffee pot and safe not functioning in one room, and so on.... there are only so many times you can change rooms and you just have to decide to leave the room and hang out on the grounds and the pools or the Casino and enjoy the sun and sea. If you can't live with room problems and you need a fantastic four or five star room, don't go to this resort. At best three star rooms with one star cleaning.... But in my opinion its worth ignoring the rooms and just sleeping in them in the evening (and not much else). On the plus side the staff are really lovely and helpful and go out of their way to try to fix the problems that arise. Not that housekeeping will understand a single word of English, but the way I saw it we were guests in another land (U.S. territory or not!) Now the issue of security: There is absolutey none. On our first evening there, despite the resort being fully booked, it became clear that many many locals simply show up at the hotel and go straight to the different pools. In fact the Infinity pool at the Casitas was ONLY visiting locals (at a supposedly exclusive pool). We walked around there, chatted, took photos - noone will stop you - no one asks anyone if they are hotel guests. This became apparant through the trip. There is noone stopping you to see your room card for any part of this resort except Palomina. There is nothing to stop you from parking your car in various spots available all around the resort, esp. around the Casitas Village, and walking in, to any pool area at this resort, swimming, etc. and then leaving when you please. The same goes for any part of the grounds. We ventured into so many places we were supposedly not supposed to, and even as guests - it was a bit disturbing. We also had an incident where the tied up mini-bar (yes, the tie it up with a plastic cord!!) was cut open even though we had a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door during the period we left our room, which we had to report to their security center. From the many detailed forms they brought us, it was clear that security problems were a constant issue. A DO NOT DISTURB sign means nothing at this resort. Someone WILL enter your room (and manage to cut the mini bar cord, and leave it cut). There were so many little incidences pertaining to lack of security to notice, all small, but nonetheless possibly of concern to those who may want a more exclusive or safe feel at a resort. This place is just too big to monitor and there is absolutely nothing to stop any person who wants from walking in to any section of the resort to break in to rooms, etc. Don't take valuables, don't leave anything around, go prepared to find locals in the pools at all hours and you will be ok.... but you just have to be mentally prepared for all this. I even found myself thinking, why pay thousands as we did? Next time I will find somewhere cheap to sleep and just come hang out at this hotel - its that easy! If its so prevalent on a sold-out weekend, and folks are so open about it, it must be occuring all the time and just accepted. Palomina Island is worth a trip just to ride the boat and see the place - but its not anything to write home about - yes, its nice for lying in the sun - but so is any beach in Puerto Rico. It is not a great beach for swimming, really. The level of seaweed and plant growth is just too much - you get all tangled up in it. I would not go there twice. Find a way to get to Luqillo which is a nice public beach... and I was not happy about the 1 towel policy once you get off the boat. They really can't afford to give you an extra towel? There were many water activities and most people seemed happy with the services- but nothing any different than a standard beach resort. The absolute best experience is to do the biolumenescent bay tour by kayak at the later night hours, in the total dark. There are many tour companies to choose from - avoid booking through hotel - you can book it on your own for half the price and its so easy to get to the docks from the hotel - there is info all over the web on the many companies in Fajardo. I have to warn you, however, if you have never kayaked - do not listen to the statements on how easy it will be, and how they will train you. There is no time to be trained to learn to kayak your way in weaving mangroves if you have no experience. But don't worry, they will either place you with a guide, or even pull you through. Most people do well but the guides are so great, they will save you even if you end up going in circles.... Finally -avoid the restaurants - for some of the best Mexican food anywhere and fantastic prices - we ate there every night (!) go to the famous Lolita's. Wonderful staff, even better food. I can't recommend it enough! That was the best advice I got on tripadvisor for our stay - eat at Lolita's. And buy your breakfast at the grocery store to bring to the room - ours had a free fridge to use. Having a car rental will serve you well for all this... Would I recommend the place - I actually would, if the price is right. Its beautiful, the people are nice, and you just have to get into the frame of mind to not care a stitch about the room, or the lax security.

The location is beautiful! That said, trying to get to the beach requires getting on a cable car and then catching a water taxi to Palomino island. If you want to go to the beach, give yourself 30-45 minutes to get there as the hotel has 2 of these cable car type buggys and one has been broken for weeks so everyone has to use just one. Overall, This resort has fallen into disrepair with water stained ceilings, corrosion on many of the elevators, permanent stains on carpets and fabrics, ripped carpets, etc.. The resort is under a major rennovation at the moment and the new rooms are going with a very Art-Deco theme. The porblem is that when you look out of these rooms, you are looking at a construction site with tools and heavy equipment everywhere as well as lots of noise. The couches in these rooms have 2 coushions on them but the look and feel more like crib matresses. They are plastic and feel like a rock. We moved our room from the new section to the building overlooking the pool. I would call these rooms \"vintage\". I love old world spanish looking decor but the hotel rooms were dingy and lacked charm. Ripped carpets, plain walls, cracked tiles, and water stains were all apparent in my room and true also for the others I was traveling with (16 rooms in total). The pools were nice but the drinks were pricey. It was $60+ dollars for 3 frozen drinks and 3 bottles of water. ouch!

Palomino Island which is a ferry away that you take on the property was beautiful with tons of water activities. Upon your arrival you are treated like a king and our oceanview room was incredible! Unfortunately, we went when a million conventions were going on and reconstruction so we were unable to secure an oceanview suite. However, there are two problems with this resort. If you don't have a car or familiar with this part of Puerto Rico you are stuck on the resort. In fact the entrance to the resort is maybe a good 8 miles away so forget about walking into the main street. As such, you are stuck and can depend on only there cuisine which was mostly Italian ironically. The one resturant with Spanish cuisine (El Caribe) the food wasn't very good. The food overrall is very expensive and not worth the price although we did enjoy the breakfast buffet at Las Brisas. Again, expensive as you have to pay full price even for a child (my son is 3 and eats like a bird.) The second problem is lack of communication or training of the employees. We specifically went to visit Vieques and Culebra which is very close. We were told throughout our trip the only way to reach these islands was to rent a private boat for $2,000.00 for the day! On our very last day we learned for $20.00 we could have taken a cab to a ferry that would take us to these islands. They actually had a flyer that they never submitted to us although we asked the Consieur's desk about this, marina activities, bellhops, waitresses, etc.... This was our biggest pet peeve. They really didn't promote outside activities with other vendors and it was difficult to obtain this information even when you asked for it. I think the biggest problem at this hotel is the Consieur's desk where all traveler's really depend on. My father stated he felt like he was in prison.

As another poster put it, this resort is way past its prime. It's a good thing they're remodeling. Very few things were noticably good. Lots were bad. Here is my list, starting with the good: My main complaint was the food and drink prices. I guess when you go to a resort, you are taking yourself out of the free market where competition drives prices down and you kind of expect it. But at the El Con, they've gone mad. A 2-person meal with wine was well over $100 (at all restaurants -- there were no bargain places). Small drinks by the pool and private island were $8 each. There was no escape other than to purchase an over-priced bottle of liquor or wine and make your own drinks. Good luck doing that on the beach (the only one is on the private island). We attempted to order pizza from dominoes and Pizza Hut, but they said that El Con security prevents delivery. Breakfast was $25 each... does that give you an idea of how bad this place was? As for the room, there were chips and stains all over including couch, lampshades, walls, floors, etc. It was small and there was mildew in shower. TV and _jambox_ (circa 1995) were awful. On one particular outing to find ice, I found that the 5th floor ice machine was broken... as was the one on the 4th floor. Finally I found ice on the third floor but couldn't help but notice that the stairwell light was out (and dangerous) and all three ice machines were completely different. A nitpick? Yes. But this is supposed to be a 5-star resort. When trying to rent a car one night (to get the hell out of there) we found that the car rental guy had skipped out 15 minutes early... dooming us to another night trapped at the resort. We later found out all rentals had to be 24 hours and were at least $80 for an economy... not worth it. The service was not really too bad except for an incident where we waited 30-45 minutes for a corkscrew and two wine glasses (after asking two separate workers) and finally I had to go get them myself from a bar near the casino. Took me 5 minutes. There was no wireless internet which, for a technophile like myself, was a major pain. There was wired internet in the hotel room, but that prevented sitting on the balcony with my laptop. Internet was $15 per day. The gift shops were overpriced and pretty crappy. Most of them looked like mostly empty shelves with a few dusty, random items placed on the shelves. On two separate occassions, I noticed that the cigar humidor doors were sitting wide open which dries out the cigars. Bring your own. The activities were there, but all expensive. Frankly, I didn't trust the hotel enough to provide me with a good value for the money, so I cancelled a scuba diving session. The private island was cool, I guess, and the ferries over there were prompt and fast (a recent improvement, I learned). However, the horseback riders went by at one point and I noticed... they weren't on the beach and they were walking slowly in a controlled single-file line. If you think you're going to ride a horse freely on the beach, forget it. Also, the beach was nasty with seaweed and jagged coral and rocks pretty much anywhere you attempted to walk. Hardly anybody was in the water. The casino was small and had no Texas Hold-em poker. Just mindless games of chance. All the gift shops and restaurants took paper records of all purchases. What was the point of the swipable card they gave us if not to charge things to the room? By the way, the cards had our names printed in black on a black background, so all the waiters and service people had to ask my last name. Again, a nitpick, but a further demonstration of the lack of attention to detail. When you added them all up, they got annoying when you're supposed to be having a good time. The final straw of this place's suckiness was the unexpected $132 charge for two people for shuttle service to and from the airport. There's nothing worse I hate than completely unexplained, unanticipated charges, especially ones that are an obvious money-grab. The best part of the resort was the infinity pool which is, technically, off limits to El Con guests. It's for the Las Casitas people only (the golf villas on site). But as you'd expect from the El Con staff, nobody cared or noticed that we just walked right in. That was the only part that was actually good. The bottom line is, by choosing this resort, you are submitting to the price gouging and crappiness. My travelling companion and I both agreed that Puerto Rico is probably best done in a 5 star hotel near San Juan. That way, the competitive forces of being able to walk down the street to a twice-as-nice, half-as-expensive steakhouse (not to mention other things like rainforest tours, scuba, etc) start to have a positive effect.

The Palomino Beach was easy to get to - new boats go faster so it is only 10 minutes. Once you are there, a unbrella or cover is needed, the sun is so strong. The rental of floats, jet skis and snorkle equipment made it more enjoyable, but the water was clear and easy to spend the day in.

A 1-star review is: A) a competitor B) an angry employee C) someone who had an experience sitcoms are made of. You'll see by my \"middle of the road\" 3-star rating this hotel is not run by uncaring people, nor is it a slice of hotel utopia. GOOD: Location, location, location - native Puerto Ricans (myself included) will attest to the beauty of the resort's grounds and views. Puerto Rico is beautiful and the hotel frames it well. Size - at a reported 80% capacity I did not find myself waiting for anything (with one exception under the \"neutral\" section). Service- service was pleasant and generally fast; this included check-in/out and wait staff. Activities - plenty to do as long as it involves a pool, a beach, gambling, drinking, or eating americanized food. Speaking of the food, it was good to excellent depending on where you ate. BAD: Prices - Food seems to have come down from the criminal rates some have mentioned, but it is by no means a bargain. Doubt it ever will be either, but one can hope. Personal sized pizza and beer = $24 then add tip and tax. Add-on fees - you will be charged daily for housekeeping and bell service ($3 each). I'd like to be told upfront; perhaps there was some fine print I didn't read. Expect fees for late checkout ($65 - $100) or adjusting your stay - I left early (but gave 48hr notice), a fee was quoted over the phone ($75.00) but not charged. (Thanks). I can't really blame them, but wanted to mention it. Rooms- They could step up the cleaning a notch. It isn't horrible, but my wife got bit by bugs while sleeping. The pool by the Marina rooms is definitely flea and mosquito infested at night. NEUTRAL: Location - This hotel is just about it in the area. You'll need a car or shuttle to get to the rainforest, cheaper dining, or local flavor. Remodeling - yep they are doing it now in several areas. I stayed in the Marina village. To get there it is a walk, then an elevator, than a walk, then a Funicular (cable car), then a walk. Now remove 1 Funicular line (of 2) and 1 elevator (of 2) due to repairs and add 1 boatload of people returning from the island. Needless to say you have a very long line full of sweaty tired people late for whatever they have to do in the main building. I will say that the hotel adjusted quickly by running a shuttle bus up from the bottom to keep it from happening often. You may wish to request a room in Las Brisas wing (rooms here are main building and remodled). My room was not a remodeled room (I saw one, very modern), my room was decorated in 80's resort and had withstood the test of time. Beds were comfy, sheets good, bed spread nasty. My room had a patio on the marina - very nice and the reason I stayed there rather than move. I also new my wife would go to the island more than the hotel, so it was a plus. The gym closed while I was there for remodeling, again the hotel adjusted offering use of the facilities in the high dollar condos next door. I can report that they were VERY nice. Bottom line: The hotel is clean but not pristine, this is usually what I find at resort hotels of this size and age. The remodeling did not disturb me specifically, but it did others. I'd say go now, or wait until 2008 to see the finished product.

We had a one bedroom suite on the fourth floor adjacent to the Golden Door Spa. Our room was beautiful and spacious and if you can afford it, I highly recommend the bigger room when staying with children. The main entrance to the suite was awe inspiring. We just said \"WOW!\". To the left of the open foyer was the bar. It had a marble countertop, two cushioned bar stools w/ backs, two refrigerators under the sink/countertop. The dining room had a six seating table, the living room had several wicker chairs w/ cushions a nice sofa and a full sized bed that you pulled out of the wall. The view of the ocean and Palomino Island was breathtaking. Down the hall was the bathroom with shower, safe and toilet room (yes the toilet is in it's own room). The master bedroom had a king sized bed, walk-in closet, master bath with whirlpool, shower and toilet room. It also had a wet bar with mini bar fridge under the sink. It had a beautiful entertainment cabinet with a tv, dvd player and Sony Playstation. You have to rent the games though. There was a small living room off of the master bedroom with a single pull-out sofa bed with tv & the works as well. The suite was beautifully decorated with a sort of \"Island Pottery Barn\" look. The food was spectacular at every restauarant we went to. It is VERY expensive though. It's about $17 for a salad or hamburger and at the restaurants everything is ala carte, ie: $9 for a baked potato. But we did not have one bad meal. The service is also very good. Taking the funicular down to the marina was a bit of a project. You couldn't just walk down and go to the beach. You had to take the funicular down to the marina and wait for the ferry to take you to the private island where the beach was. The ferry ran every 1/2 hr and only took about 8 minutes to get there, but we just missed the ferry and had to sit and wait for the next one so from the time we left our room it was about 45 minutes until we got to the beach. But when you get there it is worth the wait. We were on vacation and in no hurry to do anything. Once we got to the island it was paradise. You can rent innertubes or floats (about $10 for the day each). There is also jet skiing, snorkeling, etc. For a fee of course. Don't expect ANYTHING to be included. They charge you for everything. If I had one complaint to make about our stay it would be the problem w/ our shower. We rarely ever had hot water and everytime I called for help they told me they're having problems with the steam. One day we had no hot water at all.

I was a bit concerned after reading the mixed reviews. After visiting I also have mixed reviews over the property. On the positive side, our room, which was not technically ocean front or ocean view had an amazing view of the golf course, El Yunque (the Rain Forest) and a distant view of the water. Definitely better than expected. The grounds were exceptionally beautiful and the private island was great. Although it took about 20 minutes to reach the island, it was worth the trip. (Later this month they should begin using the new high-speed ferry which will cut the trip down to about 8 minutes) Great, uncrowded beaches (although I travelled off-peak during the week). There was a great variety of things to see and do and the beaches were great (much calmer, clearer and warmer than San Juan). On the island we saw roosters, hens, rabbits, iguanas and even a stray hermit crab roaming the beach. The island also has horseback riding, jet-skiing, snorkeling trips and rafts available for rent (at a cost of course). Now for the negatives. While the room had a beautiful room, it was quite filthy. The bed cover on one of the beds had huge fresh blood stains all over it (on the inside facing the bed) and was covered in hair. When we called to complain we were told that we just shouldn't use the cover for sleeping as it was only decorative. After arguing with housekeeping for a while they finally removed it and promised to bring a fresh bed cover later in the day. During our three days, we never saw one brought in. They just made the beds with the sheet. Not a huge problem but certainly shows a lack of care espeically considering this is considered a \"luxury\" resort. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the mattresses definitely need replacing now. The hotel is in the middle of renovations and we did not get a newly renovated room (not sure if any are available yet) so hopefully the problem will be fixed eventually. In the meantime get ready for an uncomfortable night's sleep. The hotel also recently installed an energy saving sensor that controls the air conditioning unit. This sensor is supposed register when you leave the room and automatically turn down the air conditioning until you return. The problem (and one that appeared to be shared by many due to numerous loud door slams we heard each night) is that it is not very good at sensing when you are in the room. Each night it took several tries of opening/closing the door before it would actually register us as in the room and keep the room at a comfortable temperature. Unfortunately it took us one night of roasting to figure this out. They should have some sort of bypass feature that allows this system to turn on when you manually adjust the air conditioner (as obviously you must be in the room to turn it on). Finally, like many other people indicated the restaurants were mostly overpriced for average food. Especially noteworthy was the $16 basic cheeseburger at Palomino Island and the $8 mixed drinks served in tiny, tiny cups. This hotel was ok although the pools and the rooms desperately need some updating. If you have a bad back or have trouble getting around this place is not for you. The beds will exacerbate back problems and navigating the hotel requires a lot of walking and climbing. If you can get a really, really good deal on the place and don't mind outdated, dirty rooms and overpriced food, then you'll this hotel is fine. The island was fantastic and for the most part the staff was nice (with the exception of the person who answered the phone at housekeeping). If not, I drove by the Westin and it seemed to be quite nice and was fairly close by. Even better it's right on the beach. If you go, I definitely recommend renting a car. A 3 day rental of a compact car cost $73 for 3 days including taxes. Driving was easy (the drivers aren't as crazy as in San Juan) and it provides you with a great deal of convenience. It is also significantly cheaper than the hotel's shuttle or a taxi. There are some great restaurants not too far from the hotel property. I highly recommend the Anchor Inn (take a left when you leave the hotel gates and it will be about a mile down on your right). Great food and service! Also, Cafe Caribe in the hotel had decent breakfast at a reasonable price (about $8 a person). They also had passable Puerto Rican food at reasonable prices for lunch and dinner.", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cJust Average\u201d", "Author": "tokkilee", "ReviewID": "UR6576513", "Content": "We won a trip to the El Con for a week. The shuttle from the airport was comfortable. I would complain about the $45 cost per person for the one way shuttle trip if we had to pay for it. When we arrived, the wait at the check in counter took almost 30 minutes even though we were next in line. The staff member who checked us in was kind. We arrived two hours before check in and our room was not ready. I thought they would put us in another room since the hotel was almost empty but we had to wait for our room to be cleaned and to make it up they bought us lunch, probably because we were contest winners. When we got to the room, the water was not working. They told us that the pipes were being worked on and that the water would come back on at 4pm. The guy who helped us check in wanted to move us to another room in the Marina area but his supervisor told him not to because they would just have to move us back after the water is turned on. We took a nap and the water was on as they promised at 4pm. But the next morning we slept in cause we were on Pacific Standard Time and the water was not working again. So we called the front desk and asked how many days will they be working on the pipes. In a flash, the lady moved our room to the Marina. The Marina area was nice but the bed was not comfortable. Also for the hot tub you have to go the main level which is a tram ride up, then walk past shops, and an elevator ride to the pool level. All the rooms at the El Con are really outdated and old. The Marina rooms are a little cleaner. But the beds and maids are not as good. The restaurants are pricey and decent. The pool is not heated but opened 24 hours. The beach was okay, to us it was a little dirty so we only went to the island once and didn't swim. The ferry ride takes a long time. The casino was fun, I won the jackpot on a penny slot. The Avis Rental Cars are expensive. We paid $70 a day for a midsize with liability insurance. Parking costs $15 a day and there is a shuttle to the parking lot. I think we spent more on tips more than anything else. One of the things we really wanted to do in Puerto Rico was the Bioilluminescent Bay. Go to the one in Fajardo, it's great! I heard the one in Vieques has a lot of jellyfish. The hotel has a kayaking tour with Eco Action Tours for $65, including a ride from the hotel and back. We called them and booked the tour for $40 but had to walk to the place, less than 5 minutes from the Marina part of the El Con.

Around every corner there is another shop, cafe, or bar. This is good because you can usually get in anywhere to eat. The food is pricey but we enjoyed every meal.

Outside of the great weather and the relatively short flight from the States (about 4-5 hours from Chicago), the place has pretty much everything I'd want to do on vacation. The golf course is really nice, and I've probably eaten at 10 different restaurants on the property. One of the restaurants has a huge buffet in the morning. The hotel also has an island just off the coast where you can lay on the beach, ride horses, rent jetskis, etc. The Spa is one of the better ones I've been to--a therapist named Christie gave me the best deep tissue massage I've ever had last time I went...which says a lot, because I had just returned from a rugby tour in Spain. The resort is giant and pretty awesome, but there's a ton of stuff to do around town as well. I found a couple good restaurants in Fajardo, and hiking in El Yunque (a nearby rainforest) was great. I also did kayaking through a mangrove system that opened into a huge bioluminescent bay. I think you can also charter a boat to go deep sea fishing--a couple guys golfing there caught an absolutely gigantic marlin off the coast. I'm probably forgetting something, but the concierge pretty much sets everything up. One of the better things about the place is that the staff is super nice, and they all speak English. People seem like they are happy to work there...I guess I would be too if I lived in 80 degree weather all the time. The other guests at the hotel are usually couples or families, although there was a large tournament last time I went that brought in a bunch of golfers. People are always friendly, and there are enough spots on the property that I can find peace and quiet (or a party, depending what you're into).

The forts, run with the usual excellence by the National Park Service, are a must. Eat with the locals at El Jibarito on Calle Sol.

We went to El Conquistador December 26 - Jan 1. Our experience was remarkably different from most overall, but consistent in some areas.... We do Christmas week in the Caribbean every year and have somehow become accustomed to overpaying for our hotel, but this is always the best time for us to travel with our 7-year old who is in school. We had a GREAT time! The resort was PACKED with families, many from the Northeast. The vibe during the whole week was very enthusiastically holiday, and fun. Here are some specifics: --- Our hotel room was great, actually. They upgraded us from garden view to partial oceaan view. Yes, they are renovating, but they are doing one entire wing at one time, which is not seen by those stayin at the hotel. A new wing is being consteucted, but it does not get in the way of any view or walking path in the entire resort. Our room was clean, well taken care of by housekeeping. Many new room amenities - coffee maker, refrigerators, blowdryers, sound system, etc. Little things, but they are definitely trying to update the rooms as quickly as possible. It appeared that all our towels and bedding (down comforters and duvet) were brand new. --- They brought us Happy Holiday gift basket the first night with lots of local treats and snacks, it was very nice. --- On the first day at Palomino Island, we did need to wait for about 25 minutes for a ferry, but it was because the line for transport to the island was so long, and they limit the number of passengers on each ferry. The ferry consistently ran every 20 - 30 minutes, and we watched as they tested new 8-minute ferry boats which will be used soon. --- Palomino Island was gorgeous, and quite busy each day. The first two days after Christmas were packed - not many available chairs (and there are hundreds) but after that, the crowds slimmed down. They had wait staff bringing lunch and drinks to your chairs, had bands, and organized volleyballs games, even a sand castle contest for the kids on our last day. We even rented a car to try out other local beaches (Loquillo) and the rain forest. We left and went back to Palomino. --- There was only one time one of the funiculars going down to the marina area was broken and it was fixed within 15 minutes. If you have thousands of people taking anything up and down or back and forth 24/7 there will be problems. And the staff quickly fixed it. --- We agreed with everyone else that the restaurants were just ridiculously over-priced. Just outrageous. Food was OK. We went to Otello's (Just OK), Stingray (our best meal there) and Strip House (OK). We're lucky to live in a city with great restaurants and have pretty high standards. So we were disappointed by the food for the price, but we took another reviews advice and bought food for snacks and breakfast. They should have kids' meals at kids' pricing. $12 for buttered bow tie pasta is just manslaughter. Yes, I am embarassed to say that we paid that but sometimes on vacation you are irrational and say what the hell. Some nights we just ordered a pizza. We ate outside the resort and the hotel has a list for you to try. We ate at Con Pepe (I think that's the name) near the entrance ot the Westin and it was amazing, and much more reasonable. --- In general, the pricing for snacks, candy and drinks, even at the convenience store there, was about 4 times what you would expect to pay, even at the local stores ($3.99 for a bag of Lays Chips already marked as $1.39. $ 3.89 for USA Today. That kind of thing) --- The pools and grounds were beautiful. --- Our daughter did not do the Kids' Club, but we heard glowing reviews and the first few days there were about 20 kids in teh Club participating in activities. Each night they had movies and other games to keep kids busy. We were lucky to hook up with parents who had kids of similar ages, so making friends while there was not a problem for our 7-year old. --- Transportation from the airport was timely, nice, with drinks on board, but very expensive ($178 round trip for 3). --- We dive and snorkel, and had a good experience with Casa Del Mar, the Padi group on site. --- Staff for baggage was just waiting to please. Falling over themselves. It was great. We called on night for packs of coffee, not really expecting someone in housekeeping to have 3 packs at our door within 10 minutes. They had turn down service each evening and were exceedingly polite with every request we made. I hope to post some images as soon as I get the time to download our cameras.

We got a good deal ($500 pp for RT air and 3 nights), and I would consider staying at the El Conquistador again if we got a similarly good deal. However, if the economics were similar or even a bit more expensive, I would stay at the Westin (much easier access to a beach of equal quality and a shorter trip from the airport), the Numero Uno guest house (quaint and close to San Juan) or give the Ritz a try before I returned to the El Conquistador.", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turlock, California", "Title": "\u201cParadise Views, Amazing Time for FREE!\u201d", "Author": "SLAH_Rachel", "ReviewID": "UR6447275", "Content": "It was my first trip to PR and will not be my last.

We were amazed at its ranking and can only presume that it may impress people who are not frequent travellers and don't know how things ought to be. They have ads up around the hotel indicating that they are going to be undergoing major renovations, I can assure you that they need them. First of all - while they are not clear about this on their site, I will be - They DO NOT have a beach right at the property!! As they say, there is a beach on Palamino Island, and they have a boat which takes you there... BUT: you can't go at will, the boat takes approx. 20 minutes to get there, and, by the way - it really is not a 'private island'. (In Puerto Rico the 'shores belong to the people.' As such there are many local who take boats over to the island and hang out along the beach in front of their boats.) The boat leaves every 30-60 minutes, beginning at 9am and leaves the island before sunset. So much for hanging out on the beach!! When I go to a resort I like to be able to walk on the beach at will. You will not be able to do that here. They also have two little coves on the other side of the 'island' - but they explained to us that it's a 40ish minute hike. The island has a small mountainous middle, no shade along the way, and you can't swim once you get there as that side of the island is very rough and rocky. There is also no service on that side of the island. The only reason some people may venture over is curiousity, and/or the fact that one of the coves allows nude bathing. We didn't go to that part of island once they gave us all the facts. Most importantly it's much too hot to be stuck there without any service and without much shade. If you are beach lovers, as we are, the main beach on the island leaves much to be desired. You can walk the length of the beach in approx. 7 minutes. It's not a deep beach, so you're walking past people's chairs. We were terribly dissapointed. The hotel itself is quite rundown, and our room was really quite dirty. We called housekeeping and requested that they clean it properly the following day, but that didn't provide results. We gave details as to places which had most certainly not been dusted for many months, and the dust remained for the 6 days we stayed. After 6 days we realized that we were just so unhappy that it was silly to stay there any longer. We decided to move to a hotel we'd been to before, only a few minutes away, which has a very beautiful property and very lovely beach. (The Westin Rio Mar) The hotel is also not at all friendly to people with any type of mobility impairment. It is a huge complex with stairs all over. To get to the boat which takes you to the island you must get down to the base of the property on the water. While there are some ramps around, they fail to mark them with signs, so finding them requires extra walking, and that still doesn't ensure that you find an accessible route. The casino is extremely tacky and draws in many locals who seem to sit all day playing the 1 cent slots, and many chain smoke as they do so. The penny slots are on the edge of the casino alongside the lobby, so you must pass by them to get to other places. If you decide to go anyway, make sure to go to the small infinity pool at the casitas - there's a sign that it's only for guests at the casitas, but they don't mind. It's a semi-circular infinity pool at the top of a cliff and is the only place with padded pool chairs. Quite lovely... You can also request that they give you a ride back to the main hotel at the end of the day, and they'll pick you up in a golf cart type vehicle. One of the nicest places on the property is at the very bottom, beyond where the boat leaves to go to the island. There's a large grassy area with a few chairs (and a basketball court at the end of it) and it is on the edge of the water. As busy as the hotel was, nobody was there when we were. We'd go sit there after dinner, and it is very pretty and peaceful. They discourage you from staying at the rooms down there, as they say that you are 'too far' from the rest of the hotel. Frankly, you'd be right by the boat to the island, there are restaurants and a waterside bar and if you wish to go to the pool or the main hotel, you take the funicular up, instead of having to take it down to get to the aforementioned places. It's worth having a look at the photos posted by another recent traveller to the hotel - as we saw the same things - A lot of mold, dirt and disrepair. Once they renovate it will be much nicer, I hope, but there will never be a real beach for those of you seeking a 'beach' vacation.", "Date": "December 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgie", "Title": "\u201cNot so Honeymoon!!\u201d", "Author": "MrLuckie", "ReviewID": "UR6362528", "Content": "Where to start ..... When we arrived and self parked the car no one was on hand to help with off loading luggage. When checking in the front desk was very nice, but did not even tell us there was a bell hop service or even offered to get someone to help us with our bags. We had to trek them all across the resort and down the tram to marina where we were staying, and this is no small walk at all. When we get to our room the carpet is coming up and there is was a clothes iron mark in the carpet. We called them and asked to change rooms, and talked about sending a bell hop this time. After about a half hour wait the bell hop change us to another room, which was just as dirty as the one we had just left. Then again..... we changed rooms. The next one that we stayed at air conditioning was constantly making a LOUD ticking noise. So after the 4th move to the upper part of the resort and into a smaller room we finally gave up and stayed there. They only had one tram working the entire time we were there and made it a packed ride getting up and down to the marina to get to the beach. At one point both trams were down and we had to get a shuttle back around to the hotel. We rented a car from the hotel and drove to the resort. You have to pay $15 a day for parking and then there is this older van that shuttles you to and from the resort. The seats in the van are ripped and coming apart and the door is held on by a nylon rope that you have to pull to close. The gentleman who drove the van was great and enjoyed talking to him. There constantly adding on the size of this resort, and it shows that they already have too much to take care of. The resort is beautiful and there is all most more stuff to see there then on the island. Palamino Island was great .... loved the beach! Food was great .... never had a bad meal. Casino was a great place to play at in the evenings. Would I stay at this resort again .... more then likely not.

The hotel is fine but in no way is it luxury except for the view. I have stayed at Ritz Carlton hotels before and I know what luxury is. This hotel is more on par with a Beaches resort which I have also stayed at. It's very big and from afar seems like heaven but when you get up close you see that the hotel is run down and in need of a paint job for starters. The furniture is worn and chipped. There are no a/c vents in the bathroom so it's a bit warm in there. The mini fridge is old and a bit smelly. Ask to stay in a room near the main building not near the marina. This is where everything (restaurants, casino, shops, pools, arcade, convenience store) is located except for one restaurant and one pool. You need to take a funicular to get to the rooms down by the marina. I stayed in a garden-view room which was fine. The view was of the nice tennis courts and the golf course. Very green and pretty. There is no need to get an ocean view room. If you have the extra money to spend, stay at a nicer hotel. The pools were nice as was Palomino Island (the private island where the beach is located). You take a ferry to the island. Once on the island there is a restaurant and a store. Palomino island is not to be missed. No need to bring towels. They are supplied once you get to the island. The last ferry returns to the hotel at 4:30 pm. I ate only at the casual restaurants. The food was mediocre but the prices were high. There are nicer restaurants but I am from NY and knew the food would not compare so I didn't bother to try them. I went on two days trips. A shopping trip to Old San Juan. It's approx. $50 per person and all it is is transporation to and from the town. You leave the hotel at 9 am and leave Old San Juan at 3 pm. You are on your own between 9 and 3 to go sightseeing (El Morro, Pigeon Park, etc.) and shopping. This trip is worth the money because it costs $100 just to take a taxi to Old San Juan one way. The other trip I went on is to El Yunque, the rain forrest. This is a must see. You leave the hotel at 9 am and return to the hotel at 1 pm. The tourguide Edwin is hilarious and very knowledgeable. He should have his own travel tv show. The first stop is at a waterfall just to look at, not to go in. It's beautiful. The second stop is at a tower. You can climb up the tower to the top (approx 90 steps). You can go at your own pace. The view of the three peaks of the rain forrest is stunning. The last stop is a hike. The first part of the hike is uphill and a bit tough if you're not in shape but then it's downhill and easy. Lots of things to see. Bring a bottle of water. Wear sneakers. No bathing suits necessary. People who can't walk unassisted should not go on this trip. This is not a place to go if you are travelling alone unless you like solitude.

I think it was about $1500 combined. We were in need of a 4day/3night get-away without our 3 young children for some relaxed down-time and sunshine and this fit the bill with a direct flight to San Juan. We normally stay at much smaller, more exclusive resorts and have been spoiled by those (Cap Juluca on Anguilla, renting a house on Anguilla, Las Ventanas in Cabo San Lucas, Caneel Bay on St. John). We read all the reviews and while a little nervous about what we were to find upon arrival, we ended up having a great time and the resort pretty much to ourselves due to this still being the \"off\"-season. I'm sure it would have been a very different experience in \"high season\" if the resort had been chock full of people, chaises in demand, elbow-to-elbow on the island, and full rates for average accomodations...would not have liked it with those factors. The positives of the \"off season\" is that we got the peace and quiet we were looking for...no problem getting your choice of chaises by any of the pools and on the island. We didn't have to wait in line for anything and nothing was crowded. We were upgraded to a full ocean view room on the 4th floor of the Vista wing. We were overlooking the maze green garden out to the ocean, so had no problem with privacy or noise from the pool/lobby as another reviewer mentioned. We were closer to the Golden Door Spa than the lobby. We were the only ones playing tennis on their courts. ($10 fee to borrow a raquet, $6 for can of balls and $35 for an hour on the court) The negative to the \"off\" season and renovation that's underway is that more than a few of the restaurants were closed for renovation. We ended up eating dinner at the asian restaurant in the hotel for 2 of the nights...one night at the yakatori/Benihana-type grill in the restaurant which was good and the other night in the Chinese part of the restaurant and had delicious peking duck (pricey, but tasty). Dinner out the other night was just down the road from the hotel at Pasion...a local spot...we were craving \"real\" authentic puerto rican cuisine and this was a nice change of pace. THe concierge recommended Pasion and it was easy to get to. Overall, food prices were on the high side, but that's what you generally expect at a resort. Although, breakfast was quite reasonable at the Cafe Caribe...about $8.95 for an entree. We liked the menu for lunch/drinks down by the marina the best...the bar along the water. Also, spent a couple of hours one morning in some chaises on the lawn by the water in front of Las Olas village...peaceful and away from the big resort. The views from the hotel are quite beautiful. It's set up high on a cliff and you feel as if you're in a plane...looking out onto Palomina Island, Vieques, Culebra and St. Thomas in the distance. The golf course, gardens and grounds are all well-kept. We enjoyed the boat ride out to the hotel's island...a nice change from the pool experience...to sit in a chaise and listen to the waves lap against the beach. To be picky about the island...it needed a good raking to clean up the seaweed and garbage that naturally floats ashore (plastic bottles,etc) and the menu could have been upgraded at the one and only cafe. Our room was fine...we were prepared for the worst based on some of the reviews that we read...and we called ahead to see what they could do about a room because we had read such horrible reviews. They upgraded us and while the tiles were chipped, the bathroom was in need of new grout and a fresh paint job, the furniture was tired...we were okay with what we ended up with. If we had to pay full season rates, it would have been another story! Luxury it is not, but it was perfectly fine considering what we were paying and the fact that we were \"away.\" It was clean and the maid service seemed more on the ball in our room than in some of the other reviewer's rooms. Service was very friendly and welcoming. Again, we're not big resort kind of people, but it worked for us for this quick get-away and El Conquistador served its purpose. Call for an upgraded room before you go...I just saw some photos of the room a recent reviewer ended up in and it looked horrible (mold, etc)!

We read all the reviews prior to taking our trip so alot of it was expected. I think in general, all the reviews are accurate. Weather - Near the end of Hurricane season, we were somewhat worried about the weather, but it was 85-90 each day partly cloudy. When the sun was out, it was hot, there was a breeze by the pool and also on the island. Food - the food is expensive. $10-15 for a burger, $25-45 for a dinner entree. However, the food is good quality. Actually the breakfast at the Caribe Cafe was priced pretty well $6-9 for entrees, and the coffee shops had bagels, muffins that we priced ok. So you could start the day off with a good meal and a good price. We didn't do the buffett at Las Brisas, as it was closed (I think it was $20 a person anyhow). We found the Ballyhoo Bar and Grill at the marina to have the best lunch menu and moderate prices. The burgers, sandwiches and quesadillas were all good. The main grill on Palomino was closed and the secondary grill was ok, but the prices were higher. Alot of people have said good things about the Pizza at the pool, but we didn't think it was too good. Dinner at Otellos (italian) was very good. Dinner at Blossoms (Chinese) was ok. I think if they just lowered some of their prices $5-$10, they'd have no complaints. Hotel - As with others at this time, we were in the La Vistas section, we originally had a garden view, but they gave us a free upgrade to an ocean view, which overlooked the main pool/ocean and with a nice balcony. The sunrise comes up on this side. The room itself was in need of an upgrade. Just older stuff, it would be a nice room with renovations. They are doing major renovations to other parts of the hotel (Bristas wing) so I assume, they'll upgrade this one once the other is done. Renovations of rooms and a waterpark are said to be completed in 2006-2007. They are also updating their boats. In the offseason, it definately is a much more laid back hotel. It's like you have it to yourself, so it's quiet. Some of the restaurants are closed, since there aren't that many people but there are still plenty of choices. We spent a day by the main pool and that was nice, as we were close to our hotel room, and also close to the pool bar and servers. We also found the infinity pool in the Casitas, and that was a great view as well. I could see how these would be crowded in the main season. I thought it was pretty easy to get around with the funicular (tram) to take you to the marina section and the boat to take you to Palomino Island. We enjoyed the boat ride. We spent a couple days out at Palomino Island. It's definately pretty cool to have your own island. We took the first 9AM ride out in the morning and along with a couple other people had the island to ourselves. THere are plenty of towels/chairs/umbrellas to use on the island. It's set up pretty well. The water does have coral in it, so at times the bottom is rocky. We did find a nice patch further out that became smooth sand again. So try to go past the 1st section. If it's hot and you want a breeze, go right when getting off the boat (best beach also). But if the wind picks up and it get's cloudy, stay on the left side or close to the dock (less wind). Spa - My wife loved the spa. She said it was very worth the money. She got a 60 minute massage. She highly recommends the services there. She said the massage was great and the setting was perfect. Golf - I guess on tues/thurs during the offseason they have discounted rates on golf after 1PM. So it was $70 to play 18. (they are in the processes of building a 9 hole course). The golf course is really nice and all the tee boxes are positioned high, so alot of your drives will go quite a bit further 100-150 yards. It's pretty interesting. The course was very well taken care of. The fairways are pretty straight and open, so it's an easy course to play. Lots of iguanas roaming the fairways which goes along with the views of the mountains. All in all, this hotel is a good choice. I think once the renovations are completed, it may be a great hotel. In the offseason it's a good choice for relaxing and water sports. I would not recommend it for night life if that's what your looking for or for socializing, as there aren't many people there (I'm speaking about the offseason). But for a getaway of sun, surf, pools, golf, spa and food, it's a good choice. Also, the staff at the hotel was very friendly and attentive. **ps, if you connect in NY at JFK for Jetblue, the San Juan connection is in terminal 4, you have to take a shuttle train which can take time**", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "webeckah", "ReviewID": "UR5938508", "Content": "It was beautiful.

The hotel is amazing! The main hotel is 300 feet above sea level, with incredible views from everywhere! We stayed in the La Vista wing, which was off the main hotel. We had a garden view room, which was less expensive, but we had a view of the mountains and the ocean was still off in the distance. A huge plus was that we could watch a beautiful sunset from our back porch every night. The las castias village was also a beautiful part of the hotel, they seemed more like colorful Caribbean condos then hotel rooms. And that part had the most amazing infinity pool 300 feet above sea level. (we wern't supposed to go there since it was specifically for Las Castias, but in Sept. it is so quite that we were the only ones there most of the time. By far our favorite part of the hotel. To get to Las Olas village and the marina, you had to take a funicular, which is like a tram that goes up and down the cliff. It works like an elevator, and seems almost like a nice trolley car inside. The trip down is not even a hassle with the amazing views, but you have to go at the right time because even in the off season there could be a wait. Unfortunately there is no beach on the premises, but from the marina you can take a 20 minute boat ride (which they are now working on a faster ferry that will only take 8 minutes) to their private island which is worth going to. The only thing for the budget conscious is the food and beverage. A burger at the grill is $18.00, and if you go to a nice restaurant, an entree will run you $22-45 depending on where you go. Also, a beer is $6. But the food is wonderful, 5 stars no matter where you go. We solved the price issue by getting 2 muffins, 2 bananas, and 2 juices at the bakery (muffins were so good!) for $12. Then we would split a burger or sandwich with fries at the grill, and when we did that they would give us plenty of extra fries and it was more then enough. Then for dinner we would splurge, because quite honestly, we're on vacation! (and the food was worth it). As for booze, there is a liqueur store in the main hotel with six packs of beer, wine, and bottles of alcohol, so we would just get a couple six packs for the room. People treated us there like we had paid $500 a night (which is what you'd pay in winter months).

All other current improvements are hidden from the guests. Currently the Las Brisas wing is closed for renovations. They have plans of the renovations posted in the lobby. The new rooms are modern and luxurious. It is currently low season and we felt like we had the resort to ourselves.

The Bella Vista Caf\u00c3\u00a9 overlooking the pool and ocean has great pizza that can be shared by two. This made for a very reasonable lunch. For breakfast we ate at the Las Brisas buffet next to the pool or at Dave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cookies across from the casino. We went to the local supermarket for snacks and drinks. They do have these available on site if you do not want to venture off. If you want to venture off site I suggest renting a car at the airport and driving to the resort. It will take approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes to reach the resort. I highly recommend the Eco-Tour kayak trip to the bioluminescent bay and the Castillo catamaran snorkel tour. Both are a 5-10 minute drive from the resort. We also ventured off on our own to the rainforest. Having the car saved a considerable amount of money on hotel transfers/cab fare. You have the freedom to explore at your own pace. Yes the resort does charge $15 for self parking or $20 for valet parking. I suggest the valet since the self park lot is a distance from the main entrance and you need to take a shuttle to/from your car. My husband and I both enjoyed massages at the Golden Door Spa. The facility is beautiful and the staff is top notch. If you are looking for the nightlife and excitement of San Juan this hotel is not for you. If you want a laid back relaxing vacation far away from the hustle and bustle of town this is the resort you are looking for. A trip to the Casitas Village infinity pool is a must. This pool is for the private use of the Casitas guests but with the low resort attendance you will not be stopped.

As one of the recent reviews says, it seems to depend on where your room is as to whether you have a good experience or not. I stayed for two nights with my teenage godson at the end of August. I'd booked a garden view room, but was given an Ocean view room in Las Olas village ( I didn't ask why, but I was very happy with the \"upgrade\"). We arrived early, around 10am, and were allowed into our room immediately. The room was fantastic, huge, with two double beds, a walk-in closet, balcony. Spotlessly clean, and each day maid service did a great job in making sure it stayed that way. The view was an unexpected bonus, we overlooked the Marina and could see Palomino island in the distance. There was a gym very close by which we used each day. . The pools were great, although we only used them at night as we went each day to Palomino Island. What a paradise! Food in the hotel was great, obviously overpriced, but that detail you just have to deal with. We dined at Otellos and Cafe Caribe, and had the buffet breakfast by the pool.

I also must tell you that I am a discriminating traveler who fancies resorts such as the Four Seasons and One & Only Hotels. Due to the fact that the hotel is currently under construction (and they do not make that a secret when you book), you NEED to ask them for their best available sections so that you are not placed in a old room that has not been updated in years. The reservation agents & concierge just need to be made aware of your needs. I give them five stars on service..everyone was always so accommodating and friendly. We needed something that was reasonably priced, but provided great service, food and amenities. The Conquistador was everything and more! 10 of my family members went for 5 days (all adults) to celebrate my Dad's retirement. We all stayed on the 4th floor in the MARINA section of the hotel. As for cleanliness, our rooms were spacious & spotless with an incredible view....not to mention that the views from every part of the hotel are simply breathtaking as the Conquistador sits on a bluff. The pictures featured on the website are georgeous and do not even do this place justice! BEACH Yes, you have to take a short boat ride to the beach at Palomino Island, but its not inconvenient...it was actually FUN! Once you get to Palomino..everything is there for you. The water is so beautiful and the Pina Coladas are flowing (waitresses are on the beach). Palomino is pristine. It is so clean and there is so much to do. They have 2 great volleyball set-ups! POOLS We spent our days in the sun. All the pools are beautifully maintained and there are serveral hot tubs which was nice..all areas are illuminated by festive spanish music which made for a fun atmosphere! If you want quiet, there are other pools you can go to in the Marina, Las Olas or Las Casitas. DINING We ate so well each night. The FOOD WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! I highly reccomend Stingray's & Otellos. They were the best. We sat there for 3 hours each night..it was an event! The fish, particularly Sea Bass, was some of the best I have had in a long time! We also dined at a local authentic Puerto Rican restaurant called PASION DEL FAGON. It was incredible and should not be missed. We had a lovely meal there and the hotel concierge will get a cab to take you. I had an amazing lobster dish! Please do not be swayed by the negative reviews..you have to see for yourself and stay in the right section of the hotel (MARINA). It is unfortunate that perhaps the bad experiences were because the vacationers weren't well informed in advance of the modifications going on at the hotel.

We couldnt wait to post this review. The hotel is a study in contrasts. I have never had such an experience with a hotel before -on the one hand the grounds are immaculate, in excellent condition, and the views are absolutely beautiful. The lobby is as expected for a 4* hotel. However, once we stepped into the elevator to access the rooms, the beauty ended. The elevator was dingy, the corridor access and area just outside of the elevator was filthy -downright nasty, with baked in dirt and filth marks on the outside of the garbage receptacle just outside of the elevator. We noticed cigarette butts, dirt, significant dust bunnies (more like dust elephants, given the size) and stains all over the tiles. We felt like we were dirty by the time we got to our room. What was worse is that the dirt and filth remained for the duration of our stay -from Thursday to Sunday. And yes, the room was very dated. That by itself is not bad, but the bedspread was NEVER properly made up, and by the third day we became convinced that it was not that the maid was inefficient, but that the bedspread was old and too worn to ever look neat. The furniture was part rattan, part antique and part modern (they had a dvd player alonside a 1980's cd player), all in serious need of a brush of varnish/paint and repair. The views from the room -we stayed in the La Vista wing - was really special, except that you dont risk opening your doors much for the noise from the lobby and pool areas just below. Neither do you risk opening the shades for the view unless you dont mind flashing everyone in the pool and general activity area, as all the oceanview rooms are in full public view of everyone in the pool and activity areas. The less said on this subject the better. You can do much better going into Fajardo and buying at Sizzlers or Wendys. In fact you can do better just eating at a mall food court. Unless of course, you really enjoy bland overpriced food (my wife keeps reminding me that the food isnt awful, just tasteless, and that it could have been worse.) TRUE. The service was generally good. Puerto Rican hospitality is very positive and warm and the hotel was no exception. From the concierge to the bellhops, to the parking shuttle driver, the service was above par. And speaking of parking. You should drive, but remember that parking is a nice distance away and the wait on the parking shuttle to the lobby can be dreadfully delayed. Worse, Friday night we found ourselves driving around in circles for over 20 minutes in the parking lots just trying to find parking, which was non-existent. We noticed that they are now building a parking ramp building -which is well overdue as the resort is HUGE, like mad HUGE. This becomes a nightmare when you want to checkout and its a Sunday. Its like check-in day at a cruise terminal. Crowded. If you like massive resorts, you will like el Conquistador, especially after they complete their renovation, which the frontdesk staff tells me will be completed by this time next year. I for one will want to see if the hotel itself will match up to its grounds and views by then. If you like an intimate setting, it is NOT for you. Staying their is like a mini city on a hill which feels like a mega all-inclusive, but has worse tasting (and expensive) food.

Pleas do not believe all the negative hype on the site. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not true. We recently returned from an 8 night stay at the resort and found that it met or exceeded our expectations. We had a party of 7 (4 adults, 3 children ages 10, 13 and 14). We are from NJ and CT and have traveled to many locals with and with our children over the years. We can be picky but I must say everyone had an enjoyable time. Here's the deal- We arrived at the resort Tuesday July 25th. We rented a minivan which I would suggest doing. It gave us the freedom to explore and go off the resort to local restaurants for dinner. The hotel shuttle is about $66 R/T per person. Our two families split the rental which came to about $250 per family and we had use of a car all week long. They do charge daily for parking but I suggest when you depart you ask for some of that to be removed from the bill. We waited for our car from valet one night for about 45min. We mentioned that before we checked out and were only charged 3 nights for parking. The staff is very accommodating but you'll have to put in a little time and effort to get exactly what you want/except. Check-in was somewhat slow. The rooms we had been promised were booked (In the Las Brisas bldg). Apparently there was a large wedding taking place over the weekend and the entire building had been reserved. They put us in the Vista wing of the hotel overlooking the pool with a spectacular ocean view. These rooms were a bit smaller than what we had reserved. The told us they could move us on Thursday to a newer building adjacent to the vistas. This building had larger rooms (King bed with pull-out couch) and had 6 floors instead of 4 and a balcony. They put us on the 6th floor. I suggest this part of the resort or Las Brisas when traveling with kids. The resort is large and you will be in a central locale to all the resort has to offer. The rooms we were in were not falling apart. They were very clean; beds were comfortable and not really outdated. The bathroom was quite large and in great shape. AC worked well too. The resort has many restaurants. The prices tend to be somewhat expensive but no more than you would pay at any other resort. I must say that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one bad meal at the resort. The food was very good. You can do a casual meal outside on the patio overlooking the pool or a more formal one at Stingrays or Blossoms. Do yourself a favor. Get some food for the room like bagels, cereal etc if you want to save a bit of money. The room has a coffee machine. We also bought some rum and beer on hand to make drinks. The only issue I has was paying $5.50 for a bottle of beer. Go to the local supermarket and get a Styrofoam cooler for $2.00 and fill it up. Rooms also have small refrigerators too. The pools were clean and refreshing. There are 3 pools and a waterslide on the main level. I would also suggest going over to Las Casitas to swim in the infinity pool. Although it states that only guests of the Casitas can utilize the pool, we went several times and were handed towels from the staff. No one will bother you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful pool with a magnificent view. Palomino Island was also a favorite among our group. Taking the boat ride to the island is fun and enjoyable. Once you arrive on the beautiful island, everything you need is there. Food, drinks, lounge chairs, towels, snorkeling gear, jet skis etc etc. The beach is a bit rocky when entering the water but once you get into the beautiful Caribbean, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll forget all about it. The resort is going through a $95 million renovation. I will admit it does need some TLC here and there but you will not get the spectacular views, beautiful beaches and above average accommodations at another resort in Puerto Rico. We all enjoyed our vacation and all agreed it was well worth the money spent. PS- Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss out on the Bio Bay tour, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so close to the hotel.

We looked at several resorts before booking at the El Con and we're so glad we booked here! After reading some of the reviews I must say I was a little skeptical but came with an open mind to see for ourselves. Upon arrival at the airport we took one of the hotels shuttle buses since we didn't want to fight traffic with a rental car for a week nor did we want to get lost. It was a pleasant experience and it gave us time to unwind a little after our long flight from Chicago plus the bus provided refreshments which was completely upexpected and enjoyed by all. We looked into a taxi and heard they charge at least $100! Once at the resort we were greeted by the very friendly door staff which gave us a very good first impression of the resort. Check-in was efficient and was done in about 5 minutes then we were whisked away by a bellmen to our room who explained the facilities, etc. I wish I had gotten his name as he would say hello to us each time we saw him-nice touch. Our room overlooked the ocean and the pool which the children loved! We were able to watch the children from our balcony still enjoying the peace and serenity of our room. Though the room was a bit tired we found it clean, comfortable, spacious and with a large bathroom making it nice when we were getting ready to go out to Palomono Island or to dinner. We found out that the hotel is planning on renovating the rooms beginning late summer which will make this resort the crown jewel of the Caribbean. We just returned from a trip to New York and found the prices in the restaurants in line with the big cities. There is something for everyone, so when you read that the prices are outrageous then these people didn't find the places that we found. You can have a wonderful breakfast at several of the outlets to fit any budget from bagels and cofee to a full on buffet still cheaper than in NYC. Dinner........there are also several outlets to fit any budget or finicky eater for that matter. We found the best pizza at Bella Vista which is their outdoor restaurant overllooking the pool with grand views of the Caribbean. The pizza was so good that we ate there several times much to the delight of the children. We took the shuttle boat to Palomino Island which is their own private island to swim, snorkel, ride the wave runners and simply lay on the beach to soak up the sun. The lunch at Palomino Island is large enough to share, we ordered the fish and chips upon recommmendation of our server and the portions were huge. It's not your typical fish and chips either, they use the local red snapper which was moist and delicious! Even the kids tried it! Our final night we ate at Isabellas's and found the quality of our steak dinners better than that of Morton's and Tavern on Rush which we frequent often. We loved trying the Puerto Rican side dishes like Mofongo, Tostones and Amarillos which none of us even heard of before coming to the resort and again upon the recommendation of our server. We did rent a car to go to the rain forest and to do some exploring. The rain forest was fun, there's a lot of hiking involved but worth the trip. Save your money on car rental as we found the resort is the place to be! There isn't much in the town to see and the food is the same you would find on the mainland, McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's, etc. There isnt' any reason to leave the resort unless you want to take a tour of Old San Juan or to go to the Bacardi Factory. The Marina Activities desk offers light tackle fishing (which we did and had a ball!), deep sea fishing, scuba diving, snorkeling and the Bio-Luminescent Bay tour. The Bio Bay tour was great and we're glad we did it since there really isn't anywhere else you can experience this. Definately a must! Again, it's some work to paddle the kayak but we had a ball! We bumped into some people who went on a trip to Monkey Island. We got the phone number from the concierge, rented a car again and went to this little town called Naguabo about 15 mins. from the resort, easy to find. It was one of the most fun days we ever had. It's an island off of the coast that is the home to Rhesus Monkeys, the only people allowed onto the island are researchers so our tour guide anchored the boat just offshore and we got some great pic's of the monkeys. Then we went snorkeling to this old shipwreck near where we had anchored and saw the most maginficent fish. This trip is a must! After all of these days of hiking, snorkeling, kayaking I need some down time so I made an appointment at the Golden Door Spa! I've never experienced anything like this before! I left feeling rejuvenated and relaxed. I never took any of their work out classes but they looked and sounded like fun. From the menu they look like they all incorporated different elements like Yoga, Tai Chi, Pilates, the Bosu Ball, etc. which I think would make it different than anywhere else and keep it exciting. This also is a must! I had the most relaxing facial that I had to fight not to fall asleep. The only negative I can find is that it rained two afternoons but only for an hour which isn't the hotels fault. Thank goodness the hotel had some board games for the kids to play and a game room! While the kids were playing we browsed the numerous shops where you can find anything from shoes to jewelry to bathing suits to local artisan items to designer clothing! this had more shops than any hotel or resort we have ever stayed. All in all we had a wonderful time and can't wait to return, maybe next time without the kids!

There was a fridge in the room which we took advantage of by stopping at the grocery store to stock up on beer, soft drinks and snacks. Some friends who stayed in other parts of the hotel said they had great rooms but we never got a chance to see them. While the restaurant prices are very expensive, I didn't think they were that outrageous relative to other resorts. The food was generally decent but nothing special. However, they do nickel and dime you at ever turn. $15 for satelite parking, $5 for internet access, $2 to make a toll free phone call, $4 for water, expensive rental fees for beach toys even though they charge you a resort fee, etc... The biggest negative is the beach situation. There is no beach right at the resort so you have to take a ferry to their private island. It took exactly one hour to get to the beach from the time we left our room. The ferries supposedly leave every 1/2 hour but on our return we waited over 45 minutes for it to arrive. Some people in line waited over 30 minutes and didn't even make it on. God knows how long they waited for the next one. On top of that the beach is only average by Caribbean standards.

Yes, $3.50 for a 16 ounce bottle of water in the Palomino Island cafe is much but what about paying $3.25 for a Wall st Journal?Or $20 for a one way cab trip to a restaurant 7 minutes away from the resort? Not to mention Caribe restaurant(which my girlfriend named \"Jock strap cafe\")where the low qulity of food, high prices and terrible service make this place an ultimate no-no. The island's main beach is very loud and crowded I have to say that this place is not very romantic . There are so many people. So much noise and excitement. It seems like a perfect place for families. There is some exciting action for everybody. Even the cute grandmas that were left at the slot machines. They will charge you for everything and the markups of stuff like newspapers, water and other basic things are outrageous. The rooms need updating; my TV almost fell because the cabinet was so old. My toilet and shower gave me trouble on the first day(they did fix it right away) The spa is very good and the service is good as well. I would suggest a visit to El Con if you are staying at the village(which looked terrific) or if you want to go on vacation with you entire family.", "Date": "June 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockville, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cLoved this resort.

We loved every minute of our stay. We checked in a day before Southern Living group showed up so the check in took 5 minutes. United Airline had sent one of our suitcases to Chicage so the front desk sent us tooth brushes and tooth pastes as soon as we walked into our room. We had a deluxe ocean view room in Las Brisas only a floor down from the main lobby. That was a major plus since everything was very close by. The most important thing in this hotel is location of your room, cause it is so spread out that getting to the main lobby can be a pain if you are in the La Marine village and have to take the funicular. The staff was great and everyone that we came across was very helpfull and friendly. We had rented a car which I would definitely recommend. We drove to the rain forest and Old San Juan and had dinner at Old San Juan one night. As for everyone complaining about food prices, you have such a vast choice of restaurents in this hotel that you can eat any way your budget allows. There is David's Cafe in the main lobby with a cup of coffee for $2.00 and a Muffin for $2.75 or you can eat at Caribe Island ( 2 eggs, toast and coffee for $7.95, or french toach for $6.50) or the breakfast buffet for $20.00 per person. The restaurent by the main pool (cafe Bella Vista) makes the best Pizza, that I shared with my husband for $13.00 and we had 2 pieces left over. The restaurent at the beach is pricey but gives you big portions that most people were sharing a sandwich. One day I shared a chicken sandwhich ($16.00) with my daughters and they put them in 2 plates with plenty of fries and cole slow for each of us, another day we shared a club sandwich for $13.00. We didn't eat at the signature restaurents (Otello's, Blossom's, Isabellas). We went out for dinner couple of nights but had breakfast and lunch at the hotel everyday. Definitely go to the Palomino Island it is great. While sun bathing you will be seeing roosters (my son had never seen one so he was very excited) , chickens, rabbits, lizard, star fish, etc. Infinite pool in Las Casitas Village is a must see. Our room was spotless clean and apparently one of the nicer rooms so we had no complaints. We had stayed at the Omni resort in Orlando in our last vacation and we didn't know what to expect of this resort after reading some people's comments but we loved every minute of our stay. This is a beautiful resort and would love to go back. Once the renovation is completed it will be the jewel of Puerto Rico.

Weather was great. Their island is wonderful. They only take your room key on island and yes you have to take a boat over but they run both ways every 30 minutes. Was very concerned from reviews I had read before departure, but we did not have any problems with hotel staff or food. The rooms do need remodeling and that will began in 2007. They are currently adding an additional 200 rooms. The El Yunque Rain Forest was great. We did the hike and It was so much fun. Also rode horses at foot of the rain forest. My daughter did the bioluminescence excursion and said it was awesome but not for small children. Very dark and at times you have to hang onto the trees while others are passing your group and one never knows what is in the tree at the time you go to grab on! I passed on this one. Group leaves at 8pm and returns at 11pm and lots of hard work. Yes the food is expensive but hey your are on vacation-enjoy. The property was beautiful and grounds were well maintained. The Golden Spa was wonderful. My daughter and I had a great time. We went to have a good time and we did. Excursions were all worth the money. We booked on line in advance because they do sell out fast-so don't wait! Others with our group did complain about the trip into San Juan. It was 3 hours on the bus and they were rushed once they got there. This was our first time to Puerto Rico and we had a great time. The El Conquistador should be back up to high ratings once remodeling is complete. That end of the island was so beautiful we just enjoyed our trip.

I have to say that I was very nervous with all the bad reviews of this hotel but the trip was free so of course, we took the chance. The bus ride is a long one, but I caught a nap! Our check in was a little bit different since the resort was sold out for SLAH. Check in was not the greatest, we went to check in at 3:45 after standing in line for quite some time (again, due to 1100 people checking in that day) and was told that the room would be ready at 4pm. I had to stand in another line to see if my room was ready and finally it was at around 4:30ish. The bad thing is that while we waited for our room, there wasn't a single bar open. We went to the casino and the guy there was very nice and went back and got us 3 beers and a pina colada on the house and urged us to complain to the front desk. They ended up giving us an oceanview room so we were pleased. We found the staff to be very, very nice. If I would have paid their normal rate, I might have been a little disappointed in the room. I would say it was average. The room had a good amount of space with a nice balcony but it could use an update, but nothing appeared to be dirty and we didn't see any signs of mildew or anything else that others have complained about. The bathroom area is huge and there is a very large walk in closet with a safe. THe actual bathroom with the toilet and shower is small but there is a large dressing area that has a fridge and very big mirror and sink to get ready in. That was a definite plus! ONe thing I will warn you about is that the prices there are OUTRAGOUS! I almost passed out when I saw the menus! 18.00 for a hamburger, 16.00 for a hot dog, 9.00 for a glass of wine at one of the restaurants (for an average Pinot Grigio) and 7.00 for a Corona. We wised up pretty quickly and jumped in a cab the following morning to the closest grocery store. That ride cost us 40.00 but the rate is set by the govt. We stocked up on liquor, snacks and other stuff because we were not paying those prices! The Bally Hoo bar down by the marina had reasonable prices, 10.00 for quesadillas I didn't think was too bad and they were good! The only other place we ate at was at Stingray. The food was excellent and the prices not too out of line. Waiting for a taxi is an issue, we had to wait for an hour to get a taxi and found out later that we could have walked there (which we did on the way back). The conceriege didn't relay this info to us but we went to Ocean View. If you are looking for a quick dinner, you won't get it there but the food is great, it appears to be a hole in the wall that is family owned but again, you aren't there for the atmosphere! We all laughed about it later, I think we were there about 2 1/2 hours. They do the best the can and we were glad we went. There are definitely some negatives to this resort but some awesome positives. We had no problem at all taking the ferry over to the island, we did have to stand in line at times but we loved the island. There are wild rabbits there that are huge and they will walk right up to you and let you feed them. That was cool. The swimming was great, lots and lots of seaweed on one side. The other side is extremely breezy and the beach is rocky rather than seaweed. Lots of people were finding starfish in the water. Some idiots decided to take them home which we knew was illegal but they don't seem to realize that a living creature is inside the starfish. We played with our for awhile and swam around with it and it's awesome how gently it latches on to your hand and is very flexible in your palm, we of course put it back where we found it. We did spot several jellyfish so be careful and I got a great glimpse of a large stingray. We snorkeled of course, it's better snorkeling on the other side where it is breezy but be sure to bring your water shoes. Overall, great trip since it was free and the views are spectacular.

My family is actually rather picky about where we stay so the fact that we had an enjoyable time unlike others is pretty amazing. There was a shuttle waiting for us when we arrived. It was a very long shuttle ride especially since we arrived on a Saturday which is when apparently all of Puerto Rico goes to the beach. It took nearly two hours to get there because of traffic but there was nothing that could have prevented that. The entrance area of the hotel is really nice as is the lobby, with many areas available for lounging around. These areas came in handy when it rained later in the week because there was actually somewhere to go other than our room. Our room was in the main hotel yet it was still quite a hike from the casino and pool area. We had an oceanfront room which as everyone has said was pretty outdated. There was however a balcony which was great for reading and looking out over the ocean. It smelled rather moldy. There were several times when we needed something (a pillow, towels, etc.) and the front desk said they'd send someone as soon as possible but no one ever showed up and we didn't get what should have been in the room already. Going to the beach I have to admit was a pain. Several times one of the faniculars were broken so everyone had to wait for the one. Don't get me wrong, the island was great, but getting to and from the island required way too much planning for vacation! Since the boat only ran on the half hours if the fanicular took longer than expected you were inconvenienced. If we wanted to get to the island by 11:30am we typically had to leave our room by 10:30 to insure that we would get on the 11:00 boat. This didn't always happen as planned and as one could imagine it was irritating after a few days of only one working fanicular. It also rained once when we were on the island. The storm clouds grew in a matter of minutes and everyone started running for the boat line as it instantly began to pour. Obviously everyone didn't get on the boat (we did) and there wasn't enough head covering to protect everyone from getting soaked. Plus, the ride back to the hotel was REALLY choppy. The spa was great but not the best I've ever had. The food wasn't that exceptional given how much it cost but there were quite a few options which was nice. The pool was enjoyable but typically packed. Take advantage of the happy hours here! The casino was fun. However, one night someone won several hundred dollars on a slot machine and the following day that particular machine was removed! You really don't have to leave the hotel because there's enough at your footsteps to entertain you. The hotel also seems to be a place where many of the well off locals seem to go for long weekends. While I was there there we also a few Puerto Rican conferences which meant there were tons of kids around the pool. All in all I don't know if I'd stay here again. Our stay wasn't terrible but it's not entirely worth the money. I would probably stay here again if they updated the rooms.

It's an hour or more from the airport in modest traffic. If you take their transportation (big bus, why bother) it's $33 each way per person. Rent a car instead. 2. Check -in was miserable. Check in staff was not helpful nor friendly. Same was true of checkout. 3. Room are very tired. DON'T stay in the marina area. Our first room was large but had no AC. When we called to have it fixed they moved us. Second room was tiny and needed repairs. The third room was in the las brisas building on top of the hill which was much better. It was clean and had been refurbished. It's sad that it took that much work to get a decent room (and hours of our day). 4. Bell staff is miserable. 90 minutes to get luggage delivered shouldn't be tolerated. Take your own. 5. The marina village and las olas were very isolated and you had to take the train all the time (busy and a delay). It's ok if you want to go the beach but to have to take it for food, beverages, etc is tiring. 6. Everything is too expensive for what it is. 7. Food was decent but not great. We tried 4 restaurants -- all were not what we expected for the price. By the way -- they are in the process of tearing down one of the nicer garden areas and building a large waterpark.

The air circulation vents were covered with mold, meaning that when air was circulated, mold spores would also be circulated throughout the room and inhaled by the occupants - a health hazard, particularly for those with asthma or allergies.

The air conditioning and satellite television went out several days prior to our arrival and was not repaired during our stay. It was 100 degrees during the day and 85 degrees at night. We were in a room that was at the base of the cliff on the marina. The resort uses \"funiculars\" (elevators) to move guests from the base of the cliff to the other levels of the resort. There are only two of these and one was out of service, meaning that we waited outside in 100 degree heat for more than a half hour to catch one. Elevators were also chronically out of service. Positives: We found the staff to be the most courteous we have ever encounted. The private island is lovely. We were miserable. We left the resort several days early.

I was repeatedly met with eye rolls and one syllable answers when I aksed various hotel staff for directions or other assistance.

I'm not getting them unless you tell me who's gonna pay for it.\" Even if the drinks were not \"on the house\" because they weren't sitting at a table at the moment, she was ridiculously rude. One couple in our group had their camera stolen from the casino and security seemed as if they couldn't care less. They were told that although the security cameras caught the thief on video, there was nothing that could be done about it. The whole incident seemed fishy. Another person prebooked the shuttle bus back to the airport on her final day, only to arrive and be told that the bus was full and she'd have to wait an hour for the next one.

The fixtures, furniture, and clothes drawers were pre 1980. The handles fell off the drawers, even after a resort maintenance employee spent several hours attempting to fix them.

The Arthur HIlls design was difficult from the back tees, though subtle and negoiatable for my wife, who played from the ladies tees. The fee was rather high at $165.00 per guest! The food no doubt is grossly overpriced. The casino provided just one Texas Holdum table which was surprising considering the three nights i played, potential players left frustrated that vacant seats never became vacant.

We rented a car which was good to get provisions to save on cokes etc (there is a fridge in room), but we didn;t use it otherwise because parking (which is 15/day, another legitimate criticism) is pretty far from the main area so its not convenient. The wedding was held on a spectacular cliff and they do a very good job of this.

There are also 3 pool bar/marina bar type places for burger/beer and dinner for two there (burger and beers for two) $80. Also food was rather bland and boring at all places 4.

Construction going on around the mid level pools and constant boat engine noise at lower pools....There is an infinity pool in Las Casitas section that is really nice, but was told this is only for people in Casitas section.

We spoke with other guests that left at the same time who had money, laptops, and jewelry stolen. The police was even called but Never responded. I had an mp3 player stolen from my room and my video camera from the banquet room it is very obvious that keys are used and nothing is forced. While the view is spectacular, our room was not. We were dissapointed to find the bathroom to be very worn with peeling toilet seats, cracked sink and mildew in the shower/tub. They even had VHS player instead of DVD.. that speaks to when the rooms were last updated. But this was just the begining. Our first experience with the wait staff was bordering on rude almost everywhere we went. Almost all the food was dry and rubbery and seems to be that boxed, frozen and fried foods from costco type companies.. nothing is very fresh at the pool and beach areas except the nicer restraunts that have decent service and are only open at night. I left the resort crying for real food with some actual nutritional value. There are no vegetables and you would think that fruit would be a big part of a tropical island but to my surprise they were stingy with the fruits and vegies all over the island. The El Conquistador has no real representation of Latin food so the Puerto Rican experience is non-existant here. We left the compound to get that. The beach was tiny and you have to go to Palomino Island to get to it, they have Reggaeton music blareing through a bad sound system the whole time so you cant enjoy the sound of the ocean. (It's also at poolside too, but that is a party atmosphere) the cocktail service at the beach was served to us by people who would rather be anywhere else, and usually were. The staff at the entrance of the hotel (bellmen , valet etc.. were very nice until our exit) You are held captive unless you want to rent a car at 100.00 a day to start. They told us not to go anywhere unless you take one of thier tours due to unsafe conditions around the island. So you can stay and keep using your room key to charge to. We did rent a car and enjoyed other parts of Puerto Rico which were amazing though.. I would stay somewhere.. almost anywhere else! We felt safer everywhere except at the El Conquistador. The Security presence is mostly at the entrance and exit areas and that is it. The hotel is still investigating our theft claim and I can only hope they will do something to make us feel like they care, but I am under the impression they are quite aware of this problem and have decided to do nothing about it, or ..... you fill in the blanks on that part... I did. We had the enjoyment of having a great Travel Agent who booked all the check in logisitcs for us so the the front desk issues were easy to handle.

Of course I am used to staying at nice hotels so I guess it depends on your frame of reference (recent hotels: Westin, JW Marriott, Atlantis, etc.). I found the rooms to be overpriced for the accommodations offered. I understand that some of the rooms have been somewhat renovated, but mine wasn't. I went for a friends wedding with a group rate of $275. My roommate was able to get the government rate so it didn't hit as hard $185. I still felt taken advantage of at this rate however. The rooms were comparable to a Holiday Inn. I felt the springs in the bed - not good (I really missed my Heavenly Bed). Also, there couldn't be any insultation between rooms because I could hear conversations in the next room. The rooms are just plain old. The hotel was recently purchased and there are plans to renovate the entire resort I'm told. I would probably consider this property again after the renovation if I wanted to be isolated. The resort is at least 1 hour from the airport, which depending on your origination city could be a pain. Also, you will spend a lot of time and money if you want to see anything else that PR has to offer. The food was extremely expensive -- $18 for a personal pizza and $3.00 for morning orange juice. The view is spectacular as is the Golden Door Spa. Only thing is that they add a 20% gratuity for you without your knowledge. I asked to add a gratuity upon departure and they told me it was done already which put me off a little b/c what if I wanted to leave more or even worse what if I didn't enjoy my massage? My friend that was married stayed at a villa at Las Casitas which runs from $600-800 a night. Again overpriced. While the villa is much nicer than the regular rooms it still lacked the luxury touch in furnishings and overall ambiance. The view is spectacular however. At that rate, one should walk in and say WOW, but it was a letdown. The staff is great -- very friendly and helpful. Outside of the view, the staff is the best asset at the Conquistador. They also had a kids club which seemed to have plenty of activities for the children. The pools were plentiful and although I didn't have time to make it to the island EVERYONE agreed that it was fantastic. It takes 30 minutes to get there by boat. There is no beach access at the hotel, but there is beautiful scenery. My trip was fine because it was short (4 nights) and purposeful. I lowered my standards in order to celebrate with my friend. Under different circumstances, I would have switched to another hotel. My last visit to PR we stayed at the Intercontinental.

After reading some reviews we were a little nervous. But, everyone has an opinion, so here is mine with a few tips. We took the Bus(they supplied us with transportion from the airport to the resort for a total cost of$132.00(includes return) Sit in the front so you check in first. The bus had drinks and a short movie. We arrived early, but I was told the later you arrive, traffic is a little crazy and adds time getting to the resort. If you have kids, or are looking to save some money the food and drinks may be a little high at the resort for you, so rent a car(Little over $200.00 for the week). Driving around is not bad. You can eat at some of the local places near the resort(sizzlers, Ponderosa, Mcdonalds) and shop for snacks and drinks at WalMart. You can also tour the attractions, Old San Juan, the rain forest, etc. You can also rent a car for the day at the resort, it cost us $109.00 for the day. The tours from the resort cost about 50 per person. We arrived at the resort, checked in and was escorted to our room with bags. On the way we were given a tour. We stayed in Las Brisas. I recommend this part of the resort, you are near the main building, main pool and close to the funiculars to go down to the marina. Our room was very nice. The room and bathroom were clean. Our room was cleaned everyday. Where to eat. We ate breakfast at the Las Brisas grill. It cost us about $15.00 a day. The food was great. We also ate at the Sea food place down in the marina, drinks, appitizers, meal cost with tip around $189.00. The food was great. Yes a little high, but I am on vacation. We also ate at the italian(othello's). It was fantastic, our bill was about $149.00. I was full after this place and I can eat. Where to Swim. If you have kids they will enjoy the main pool. water slide, games, and other kids. If you are alone no kids, go to the second level, or even better go to the pool located near the marina, these were very peaceful. The private island is very nice. We paid 30 for lunch that was delivered to us on the beach. I highly recommend that you get down to the marina around 8:30am so you are on the first boat to the island. They were running 2 boats, and it takes 20 minutes to get to the island. You can be waiting at least up to a hour for a ride to the island if both boats leave at the same time. If your room has a mini bar, drink the soda and beer in it. Soda was around $1.50 from the mini bar and $3.00 everywhere else on the resort. Not really to much to do after 6pm. They had a show a few nights, and the casino gets packed. Not much for the Kids to do at night, so you may want to bring some games for them.

Our rooms (we had adjoining for my husband and I and two children, 13 and 9) were fine. Although they could certainly use a facelift, overall clean. Problem was that in the marina, you are away from the main resort up top and have to take the trolley car up. Advantage - one step closer to the ferry for the beach (lines do get long). Disadvantage - boats start motoring up at around 6:30 a.m. so if you're a light sleeper and want to sleep in, this is not the location for you. Next, the pools. Not sure here what everyone loved about them. The pool by the marina was truly dirty. The main pool was very crowded and in need of uplift. I didn't see one pool that went deeper than 3 1/2 feet or so which didn't thrill my kids. The beach - very nice but very shallow with coral and seaweed everywhere. You have to be careful. And yes, it could be cleaner in the sandy areas. We did the horseback riding which was fun and we rented wave runners which the kids also enjoyed. The staff - very nice and pleasant. No complaints there. Restaurants - just OK. Very, Very expensive. I originally come from NY where I am somewhat used to seeing high prices. The resort's prices beat that. Drinks were ridiculous. So either bring your wallet and credit cards and suck it up, or decide to go on your diet during the vacation. We went to Old San Juan one day which was terrific! The forts were amazing (even my kids enjoyed it), views beautiful and then we walked around the town and had lunch in one of the many restaurants there. We rented a car for the day which seemed to be the most economical way to go. (We were told that a cab ride was $115 each way, and unfortunately, the concierge didn't have any tours going the day we wanted to go. Renting a Dodge durango cost $110 for the day.)

However, as past \"reviewers\" have remarked, the rooms are in sad shape and the service is touch-and-go depending on who you get. With respect to the rooms: Upon our arrival, although we had reserved a garden view room, they had upgraded us to a ocean view room, which was a very nice room but for what my husband labeled the \"dinginess factor\"...cracks in the tile, rust in the tub - stuff that happens in a bathroom used everyday for like 15 years...we weren't thrilled. When we walked around the grounds and took the Funicular down to La Marina Village (a sea-level village at the bottom of the funiclar) we decided they looked newer. We went back up to the front desk and requested a room change - which they accommodated with no problem. There are many, MANY children at this resort and it is utter chaos up at the main hotel all the time so if you want something a little quieter, check out the Marina Village. Another \"plus\" is that its steps away from boat guests take to the private beach island the El Con uses...Be forwarned, however, if you like to have a cup of coffee on your balcony first thing in the morning - its not that easy to do from Marina Village. There is no place to get any breakfast stuff without going up the funicular - which sometimes has a line of guests from the main hotel going down to the boat for the beach... but that's your preference The food: The food at this resort is grossly overpriced for the level of quality - plain and simple...(and that's coming from a new york city resident where EVERYTHING is overpriced). We had the breakfast buffet on our first morning there and yes, it was good, but we didn't go back b/c, personally, i don't eat $40 worth of breakfast any day, nevermind EVERYday. We would grab a muffin and a cup of coffee and head to the beach. One day we rented a car and busted out of \"the compound\" (as we affectionately called the hotel) and drove to Old San Juan and ate in a great place there - the Parrot Club. Another night we took a cab about five minutes away to another local place which was good also. Be warned, though b/c a cab for about 5 miles cost twenty dollars EACH WAY! (they don't want you to leave the compound ;) Overall, I'd say that since the weather and our relaxation was more important than the food (to us) it was all palatable...but if you're looking for gourmet - you won't find it here. The service was inconsistent. Like the gentleman at the front desk our first night who was helpful and friendly, the service was nice. However, we encountered a woman at concierge that really irked me. We went to make three reservations for dinner for the week. and on the paper where she wrote them down, she had the day of the week with the wrong numerical date - so when we asked her for which date the reservations were, she was blantatly annoyed we corrected her-excuse me? like, how dare us ask her to fix it. and, for the record, she had effed up all the reservations and made them on all the wrong days...i wasn't asking for her to apologize, it was a simple mistake, but to be overtly angry at me for asking her to change it? unprofessional and unappreicated...we were deciding b/w the Ritz in San Juan and the El Con before our trip and, based on past Ritz experience, you can bet your a$% that the concierge there wouldn't have treated us that way. On a separate occassion, however, a different woman at the conceirge desk was very nice - so, like i said, inconsistent. The wait-staff appeared overwhelmed most of the time, but friendly, so i felt bad for them more than annoyed that they were slow..plus, its vacation - we didn't wear watches so who knew how long we waited for stuff ;) The Good News: According to an employee at the El Con, next month will begin a $75 million overhaul of the property with about $35,000 designated for each room - the renderings of the new rooms, etc., were in the lobby and looked very nice...we will certainly go back at some point to see how it turned out...but not until then. If you've got a vacation planned - no worries, we had a great time...the views are great and its nice to be way outside the city - feels sort of off the beaten path...

From the moment we arrived to the maginficent open air entrance we were treated like royalty. We took the shuttle bus that the hotel offered and we were glad we did as we considered renting a car just to do some exploring. But, with all the activities the hotel offered we were happy as clams to just stay at the resort. We were there for nearly a week and never felt that we needed to leave for anything, there was always more than enough to do. The kids loved taking the 15 minute boat ride to the hotels private island which was a blast in itself! Where can you go now a days to a place that has a private island with a beautiful beach which has snorkeling, wave runners, kayaking, hiking, horseback riding, etc.? My husband and I played golf one day and the course was absolutely gorgeous. We have played courses all over the country and this is beyond compare to any we have played. It was challenging with it's slopes and traps but layed out well enough where the gal's wouldn't feel intimidated. We also visited the famous Golden Door Spa on several occasions and each visit was better than the last. I would highly recommend the Spirit of Life if your limited in doing one treatment. I walked out of there feeling like a noodle! The studio a the Golden Door also offered daily fusion classes such as Tai Chi, Pilates, Yo Chi (Yoga and Tai Chi), cycling, water fusion and so much more. I'm not much into working out but I did manage to take a few classes and all were well worth the experience. I took away from each class something that I have incorporated into my life such as breathing techniques, stretching and to learning basic yogi, tai chi and pilates. There were enough pools to please everyone and never had to look for a chair as there were always plenty available plus they had the nicest plushest pool towels I have ever seen at a resort. Not like those skimpy towels you get at other resorts. My one pet peeve is to go to a resort where the people go out early and reserve chairs only to see them sit empty half the day! It doesn't happen here! There were too many restaurants to choose anywhere from Pizza, Sushi, Tepan Yaki, Steak, Seafood, the best burgers at Virgin Burger from which you can see the Virgin Islands to fine dining so all of us were very happy. The prices were similar to those of other resorts we have stayed and the quality and presentation was better than I could have ever expected. Though we're not tennis players the courts looked very inviting. We did have time to do the evening Bio Luminescent Jelly Fish Tour which is located just around the corner from the hotel. What a fun experience and I would highly recommend it to everyone. We were all novice kayakers and got the hang of it within a short time. The staff went out of their way to please not only us but other guests as well which was very refreshing to see. The staff all seemed very happy and very willing to answer any of our questions or requests, they even remembered our names on many occasions, how often does that happen anywhere else? The views from the hotel are maginifent with the water being as blue as you can imagine.

At the end of our stay, I felt that those who left negative reviews did us a slight disservice, as we found the criticisms exaggerrated or simply wrong. That doesn't mean that we might not have changed one or two things, but had we done so we'd probably have complained about something else. Here are the main areas of concern we had that were misleading: 1) Restaurants gouge: the resort has many restaurants, some of which are expensive, but there is also a 'family' restaurant, not unlike a Denny's, where we ate breakfast. The food was a cut above a Denny's, I thought, and the prices were perhaps a dollar more. It was never that crowded. If you want to enjoy a beach at the resort, you'll have to go to its private, nearby island, Palomino. There is an outdoor restaurant here that charges about $15 for a sandwich, which was a bit high, but we brought snacks, split a sandwich, and got around their high alcohol prices by slipping a small cooler into my backpack. Because we thought we would spend so much on food, we rented a car, and left the resort each night to eat in local restaurants. We ended up thinking this was not economical, since we could have eaten reasonably at El-Con, but we so enjoyed eating at small, roadside, authentic Puerto Rican places, and meeting local people, that we were grateful to have been misled. 2. You'll be gouged for local tourist activities. This probably is true if you go through the concierge at the hotel. They take a cut, of course, and it is quite high. We also found the concierge to give misleading information. (she called a bioluminescent bay tour company and quoted us a price that the association of tour operators had recently agreed on for all tours. She failed to mention that when she translated the Spanish into English she added in the resort's cut of the fare, which we avoided by driving ourselves to the docks where all the companies operate each night). Two reminders: 1) There is no beach at the hotel. Repeat, no beach. Thus no sunrise or sunset strolls along the beach; no spontaneous decision to jog before dinner; etc. To get to the beach, you have to take a boat ride to the hotel's private island. The island closes a little before sunset. Plenty to do on the island - horseback rides, lots of rentable water sports equipment, volleyball, snorkling, trails, drinking - but you have to get there first, which takes about half an hour. In the end, we also found that we liked leaving the resort for the island each day. It gives you a greater feeling of 'getting away,' and, as many have said here, it is absolutely lovely. We scratched our plans to go to Culebra since we concluded it would be pretty similar to the Palomino. 2) Swimming in many areas of the island is difficult. This is due to two reasons: the water is very shallow for at least a hundred yard out to sea in most places; and there is some sort of coral-like growth on the shallow seabed. Whatever these creatures are, they are very painful to step on. I had water shoes, but my girlfriend did not. Upshot of story: Take water shoes. We got a great deal for this place on priceline ($120 a night), and couldn't have been happier with the hotel. Oh, even the non-beach rooms are facing the water as the hotel is on a peninsula. The pictures you'll see of the place are no exaggeration. The staff, with the exception of the concierge mentioned above, was very helpful, polite - and numerous. Folks who leave negative reviews of this hotel seemed to us to have done a disservice to us and to the hotel - though perhaps, by lowering our expectations, they made us happier since the reality so exceeded them.", "Date": "April 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brookline Ma", "Title": "\u201cA Letter to my travel agent: Tell Customers To Skip PR and ElCon\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4939283", "Content": "HI Paulette, after enjoying old San Juan for a day, I went to the El Conquistador and I was really disappointed. The pictures on the Web made it look like it was a five star hotel one of the best in the world, but at best its a three star. The rooms decor was a bit tired, the food (even bar snacks) was absurdly expensive and mediocre, the beach was a ten minute water taxi away, and the golf course booked up with convention delegates. Once you left the resort, you might as well have been driving around a place like Lynn Mass or Lowell; Strip malls and Burgher Kings, Dollar Stores lots of traffic, not much to do except a walk in the Rain Forest. So knowing that my temper and frustration level would rise quickly, no matter how much I tried to make the best of things at El Con, I left PR after one day for Saint Thomas and St John where I spent an enjoyable three days at the Westin hotel, a great place, thats extremely well designed, and run. I bar hopped. visited the incredibly picturesque island on motor scooter, rented a Zodiak inflatable boat and went snorkelling.

After landing and heading to the shuttle bus, we anticipated a short ride from the airport to the resort(30 miles per the website). No where did it mention that 30 miles in San Juan translates into a 2 1/2 hour drive during heavy traffic drive times. After a 4 plus hour flight (from Dallas) being stuck in a shuttle for another 2 1/2 hours was draining to say the least. The driver did his best to make us feel comfortable on the ride (rum was included), but it did not make up for the unanticipated delay in reaching our destination. When we arrived at the resort, we were made to stand in a long check-in line with only one hotel employee working the front desk. Surely they could have radioed ahead during the 2 1/2 hour drive to let them know that we were on our way. There were only three couples on the shuttle bus....how nice would it have been to arrive to an efficient check-in process that would allow us to get to our rooms and decompress after the long travel day?! No such luck! We were shown to our rooms and were immediately disappointed at the overall lack of cleanliness as well as the shabbiness of the furniture in the room. Sections of the curtains had fallen off of the rods and the ceiling was covered in mold (from the humidity). Upon entering the bathroom, the smell of urine hit us in the face. Fortunately, we had brought spray disinfectant with us so we were able to eliminate the smell, but the general \"icky\" - this place needs a good cleaning - feeling prevailed. The floors did not look like they had been vacuumed recently and the walls desperately needed new paint. It is important to note that we stayed in the rooms that were considered some of the nicest on the property. They were water front and were approxiately $400 per night. For this rate, we were expecting very nice accommodations. Not so in this case. On a positive note, the resort has a very comprehensive list of amenities - golf, spa, numerous restaurants, casino, disco, etc. The convenience of not having to leave the resort to eat and play was a big plus. Shopping at the resort was varied and fairly resonably priced as resort shopping goes. The food was above average with only one meal being a disappointment - a steak dinner at the Sting Ray restaurant. The steak was overcooked and overpriced. And, the wait staff was hurried and not very attentive. But, I'm happy to say that the rest of the resort restaurants provided fairly tasty food at a decent price. Another bright spot was the island shuttle service, restaurant and facilities. Guests are shuttled from the resort to a private island for beach time (no beach is available at the resort itself) and the commute is a pleasant, 20 minute boat ride. The island itself is lovely and clean - with beautiful beaches and water views. There are plenty of lounge chairs for guests and the drink/food service on the beach and in the restaurant is friendly and prompt. A real treat are the island bathrooms. They are spotless! In fact, much cleaner than the bathrooms at the main resort. Kudos to the maids who keep those sparkling!!! Overall, my travel companion and I were disappointed in our stay at the El Conquistador. For the price, we expected more luxurious accomodations and employees who were more focused on customer service. I think a face lift (room renovations) and training for the resort staff in better customer service (the island staff should be exempt - they do a great job!) would go a long way in improving the experience for vacationers at the resort.", "Date": "April 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort\u201d", "Author": "lisareneeo", "ReviewID": "UR4831722", "Content": "We are a family of four. 2 adults and 2 children ages 7 &10.

The resort is beautiful with awesome views. It was very clean and tons of shops, restaurants and a game room. We visited the beach several times. It was a great beach with a soft bottom in the water. We rented rafts/tubes every day ($10.00 for the day) for the kids. We also played volleyball and hiked up a trail to the top of the mountain. We rented wave runners one day as well and had a blast. There is plenty to do on the island. We never had a problem finding a spot to hang out and always got a \"thatched umbrella\" Just a note.... you must charge food/drinks,wave runners,etc. to your room. The island does not accept cash. This was not a problem for us. It did take some time to get to the beach. You had to get to the marina level then take a boat to the private island. We do like being closer to the beach but the beach was awesome once you got there. We also visited the pools and hot tubs several times on our trip. The towels they lend you at the beach and pool are very nice. By the pool they have a place where you can borrow board games and cards if you are looking for something to do. There are several hot tubs and a nice water slide for the kids. There was also a volleyball net to play in the pool which was a lot of fun.

The El Conquistador did not meet our expectations in terms of their rooms and amenities. So if you are expecting luxurious rooms-read on...we were booked for five nights but ended up staying only three...switched to the Westin in Rio Grande which I highly recommend-they've just been through an extensive renovation. (This is something the ElCon will be doing but it will take a few years-it used to be a Wyndham resort-and was just bought by Blackstone Real Estate Group). The ElCon did not tell us that mid-way through our stay that they had booked a HUGE broadcasting convention-and that WBLS radio station (in NY) would be broadcasting shows and blaring music until 12:30-1AM right outside our window for a few nights! The whole point of the trip is that we had wanted to escape New York City and all its sounds. When we first got to the resort-we ended up switching rooms 3 times (something I've never done) but worth the effort. First two rooms had broken lamps and shower rods and the bathrooms had dirty floors and showers with mildew stains on tiles and curtains. The third room was in La Vista area/wing of resort (near spa)-had a great view of Palomino island but no amenities of any kind. No bathrobes or turn down service and the beds honestly felt like cots. At $359 a night for an ocean view room-I would DEFINITELY like amenities! (Also-very important, that does not include the extra $89.75 in resort tax and tariff fees they bill you at the end! Comes out to a whopping $448.75 a night. For that you get a great view w/terrace-but not a great room. Food left little to be desired-very over priced and not that good overall. OK, there are the negatives-here are the positives: Palomino island-private island with breathtaking views and good beach (free ferry shuttle from resort). Golf-excellent Arthur Hills golf course (again VERY expensive for a round and rented clubs-and I think you should get AT LEAST free bottled water-which you don't) but one of the most beautiful courses I've ever played. Stingray restaurant (down in Marina area)-expensive but worth it: great food, great atmosphere and view. Golden Door Spa-my friend said the deep tissue massage was intense and that they had a relaxing waterfall hot tub in the indoor spa area. Rainforest day tour (not hiking one)-get Edwin as your tour guide and have a fun, lively trip (roughly $99 for two people). Oh, one note-the ElCon Bioluminescence Kayaking Tour at night ($133 for two people)-is the one at Laguna Grande NOT Vieques. Most of your time is spent paddling through the mangrove trees to get to the bay in complete darkness-and its rather difficult paddling against the current going back. Not for first time kayakers at all. We own kayaks and found this trip challenging (mostly because it was very difficult to see anything in the pitch black). Also, the time spent at the bioluminescence bay itself is roughly ten minutes. Very cool once you're there to see the water light up around you. The trip to Vieques is the one most often highlighted in tour books but I don't believe the ElCon offers that particular trip-or at least they didn't when we were there. Ok-back to the positives: DEFINITELY go to the infinity pool by the casitas village at the resort. Go out to eat in Fajardo--either to Lolita's (good mexican restaurant in Fajardo/Luquillos area) or Passyons (great local spot with authentic PR cuisine nearby). Also, check out the ElCon web site-as they do have promotions available with certain bookings that will save some money in the long run... But if you want to save $120 a night-I personally think the Westin is the way to go. It has ocean view rooms w/terraces-a private mile stretch of beach (right off resort-no ferry service) good room amenities (Westin Heavenly beds and robes)-2 golf courses (Rio Mar CC) and like ElCon they had many different restaurants and a casino at the hotel. Also-there were no extra room tax and tariff rates and the rate INCLUDED breakfast (comparable if not better than the $50 buffet breakfast for two you got at ElCon). Again, skip some of the restaurants at the Westin (Palio was over priced and had just OK food) and go to ones outside the resort. We went to Antojito's (right outside resort and down hill to the left)-good local spot-w/good food-\"mofangos\"-reasonable and very friendly staff. One downside of the resort is that their shuttle service to the golf area or tennis area was not reliable-no one seemed too concerned to get us to our tee time in time. But at the Westin you have breathtaking views of the rainforest and good views of the Atlantic ocean and you are that much closer to Old San Juan if you want to take a day (or night) trip there.

The service was horrible for the amount of money we were spending there...waiting for food in restaurants was anywhere from 1 - 1 1/2 hours. The rooms were less than stellar (mine actually had mold coming out of the vents). Arrived at the airport on the El Conquistador shuttle to go home and they didn't put our luggage on the bus. We barely made our flight after much yelling at resort manager on duty. The only nice aspect was the weather! Low 80s and sunny every day. The resort is no longer owned by wyndham and going through a trasition phase, and this is extremely obvious to those staying there.", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, NC", "Title": "\u201cOverall a Great Trip\u201d", "Author": "Jimmywfs", "ReviewID": "UR4623343", "Content": "We just got back from El Con. Overall it was a great place. Positives: 1. We had good service overall. 2. The views are spectacular. 3. It is a huge resort, but they have a lot of pools and Palimino Island so it never really feels crowded. 4. My wife went to the spa and said that it was wonderful. 5. Grounds are in good shape. 6. Staff was friendly. Ok. Here are the negatives: 1. Room was somewhat dated, but very comfortable. 2. Elevators are slow and sometimes they don't work. 3. A lot of hidden fees. They charged a $37.00 \"resort fee\" and the sales tax on the rooms is 25%. Expect to pay about a $100 per day in fees on top of your quoted room rate. I was very upset about this. They said that the resort fee is to run the boat and to run the funiculars. My comment was they should have given me a credit on my room since I had to use the stairs on more than one occasion to get to my room. They wouldn't do anything about it. 4. Don't go off of the resort unless you have your own car. It was $40 round trip to go about 5 minutes away. The concierge said that the cab fare wouldn't be \"too bad\" when we asked him what it would be. He knew that it was $40 because we asked another concierge about it the next day and they said that this was always the far. Cab driver said that they have to give a kickback to the resort. I felt like I was taken advantage of and it ruined a good night for us. 5. Food in the resort is average at best and where we ate for dinner off of the resort wasn't much better. It was called Passion. On the way in from San Juan the cab driver stopped at place on the side of the road and we had great conch and shrimp salad. By far the best food we had on the trip and it was $12 for both. After saying all of this, I would go back. I now know what to expect. The views were great and the weather was perfect.

Renting a car, btw, is the way to go; Fajardo is quite a ways from the San Juan airport. The rainforest is nearby, as are a number of grocery stores and fast food restaurants. The reason I mention the latter is because food and drinks at the hotel are a lil on the pricey side, but very good. But honestly, it's no more expensive than if you went on a cruise or anything like that; you get what you pay for (for the most part). We had a wonderful room in the main part of the hotel (upper level), with a great view and a large iguana that lived in the palm tree outside of our balcony.

Based on the wide range of prior reviews, I was a bit anxious about the place but can now heartily recommend this resort to those seeking magnificent scenery and a relaxed atmosphere. Overall, we found the accommodations to be comfortable, clean, and spacious. We were initially booked into an ocean view room in La Vistas overlooking the pool area which was adequate. However, the hotel staff were very accommodating in moving us upon request to Las Brisas wing to a more spacious room with a balcony providing a better view and secluded feel. Las Brisas is very convenient to the main hotel area with pools, casino, restaurants, as well as to the funicular to access the marina. Yes, the furniture is a bit dated and there were just a few stains on the carpet, but easily overlooked in comparison to the positives. In terms of service, the staff were helpful, polite, and efficient...but you do have to account for island time and not put yourself on a tight schedule. We had better luck with face-to-face requests versus trying to get staff on the phone. We opted to rent a jeep at the airport and were very glad we did as it gave us flexibility to sightsee, tour El Yunque Rain Forest on our time table (this sight is a must for nature lovers), and cut down on eating expenses by purchasing drinks, wine, and snacks at a nearby grocery store. One warning, driving in Puerto Rico is not for the faint-hearted. The jeep came in very handy given the road conditions. If you can get off property, I would highly recommend the food and service of El Pasions Restaurant located just down the road. Be prepared to pay resort prices for all food on site. We did enjoy a superb seafood meal at Stingrays (at the Marina)...the atmosphere, food quality, and service were well worth the price. The beach at Palomino Island was very enjoyable and well cared for. If you decide to snorkle, I would suggest going on the morning excursion as the afternoon anchored at only one site. Again, if you slow down and enjoy, you will not consider the boat ride over to the island or the funicular to be an \"inconvenience\".

Great tip--skip dinner one night and book a tour by kayak or boat to the bioluminescent bay in Las Croabas. This was one of the most amazing experiences we have ever had.

We used the hotel kitchen to store some of our own food. As soon as we arrived we were met by someone from room service who took the food to the hotel kitchen. It was warmed up and delivered to us on time and was always nicely presented. There was one night when they forgot to warm up and deliver our food. Room service was so apologetic, and when they did deliver our dinner, they did so at no charge. In terms of the resort itself, the place is magnificent. There are six pools, so if one pool is a little crowded there is bound to be one with fewer people. And since some of the pools cater specifically to children (with a water slide, volleyball net, etc.) those are the pools with most of the kids. The other pools are generally quieter. Going to the beach was a little bit of an ordeal. You have to take the funicular down to the marina and from there the ferry takes you to the island. The ferry comes every \u00c2\u00bd hour (although when we went it was a bit late). The island is really nice: there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a restaurant, clean rest rooms, and there are a range of water activities. There is some seaweed in the ocean, but the water is nice and clear. One thing to note: Make sure to look over your hotel bill upon checking out. We noticed a charge that was not ours; we also noticed that the hotel neglected to charge us for a few things. They rectified the situation immediately and were very good about it. We had wonderful experiences with the concierge. We wanted to rent a car one day, and as we were a little last minute there were no cars left at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rental company.

We were hopeful seeing the website pictures, etc. but leery due to some of the reviews we read. We decided on the resort also because most of the nicer resorts in San Juan were booked. When we arrived early Friday afternoon in Puerto Rico we were excited to see a bus awaiting to sweep us away to our Carribbean resort. We waited for approximately 45 minutes before our bus ride left the airport. The complimentary drinks on the bus were picked over and not even worth the bother. The bus ride took nearly two hours because we later found out we were in \"rush hour\" traffic. It seemed as if we would never get there and the bus ride twists and turns and is slightly nauseating. Upon arrival and check-in we were a little exhausted by the trip on the bus and then navigating around the resort and finally reaching our room. The staff seemed very pleasant at the check-in desk and the bellhop was very helpful and delightful. We settled into our room which was average in appearance and fair to average as far as cleanliness. We dined at the Stingray Cafe and the fish entrees we had were delicious and the service was beyond amazing! We were warm and muggy much of the time during the night, the air would not adjust to cooler. My husband did a minor bathroom sink repair. On Saturday morning we awoke to discover the sheets twisted because there was a regular flat sheet instead of a fitted sheet on the bed. Saturday we rode the ferry over to the Palomino Island. We hiked the entire island and we were a little disppointed in the majority of the island. Over much of the terrain near the populated beach it looked as though they were in the process of landscaping because there were tractor/bulldozer tracks. We ate lunch at the outdoor Iguana's Cafe and were a little preturbed at the constant pestering the roaming chickens gave us. The food was average for cafe food. The water at the main beach area and the surrounding ocean scenery was quite peaceful and beautiful. The ferry ride to and from makes for a fun trip but slightly annoying when you think about it - why not just have a beach right at the resort area? Also, the Palomino Island is apparently not a \"private\" beach but rather has quite a crowd of locals with loud music and large boats anchored right at the ferry drop off area. We did not elect to do the horse back riding - I'm not sure where all you could have ridden the horses, after scoping out the island it seems as though you would have had a medicore dirt trail ride with a short time on the beachfront. We had some appetizer foods mid-afternoon at the Bally-Hoo Bar and Grill, food was good and the nice flat screen t.v.'s were nice for viewing the basketball games. We ate at Blossoms that night and the food was good, pricey though. We elected for room service for breakfast and the food was average but the price was a bit much. The food was fresh but you could tell the long journey from the main resort area to our room mid-way down to the ocean was a long and tolling journey. We returned back to the Palomino Island and enjoyed another day in the sun! One of the definite highlights was the beautiful weather all four days we were there. The pool areas were average, although at the end of the day they looked pretty well beaten. Definitely not quite as crystal clear and dreamy as the pictures on the internet made it appear. It seemed as though the El Conquistador is trying to hard to be good at to many things and is left with being fair to average on most points. On Monday we left the hotel and check-out was more than depressing! We found out just how much we were nickel and dimed and just how pricey it was. There was a good bit of confusion on getting onto the bus...one of our bags was almost left behind! We toured around Monday in San Juan and we thought it was beautiful and wished we had stayed in the San Juan area (which is right at the airport). San Juan looked more historic and charming whereas the El Conquistador Resort looked outdated and way to pricey for what you get.

We had stopped at a supermarket and picked up a few things as we were not interested in \"3 squares\" every day. This resort is more expansive than any I have ever stayed at, by an order of magnitude. I played a round of golf - a little pricey at $165 including cart - but coming from the cold northeast worth the price for a round of \"winter golf\". The course is carved out of the hills and with nearly every tee box elevated to nosebleed heights spectacular views are the norm. Tip: Lower the bar of expectations when traveling in the Caribbean and don't sweat the small stuff.

We checked in to a nightmare of a room,my parents an I were given adjoining rooms, mine was a room for the handicapped, which only had a shower. We had no air conditioner for the first three days we were there on the second day i let housekeeping know that the room was very hot and humid making our clothes and our bedsheets very moist and musty, it was so humid on the second night i actually had an asthma attack, i went down to the front desk and it took them till the third day to fix the problem.The worst part was the shower , since it was a room for the handicapped it had an open shower which allowed the water to flood the bathroom everytime you tried to shower it got so bad that the water was actually seeping out in to the hallway, making it a very dangerous situation. Again i told housekeeping and the only thing i got was a bunch of rolled up towels along the floor to soak up water again they never reported the problem. On the third day i slipped and fell injurying my right knee when i hit the floor, also the water reached the closet in the bathroom and all our shoes were soaking wet the maid helped me put them out on the balcony to dryI was in tears. At that point i went to the front desk to complain only to be given the run around, it took 25 min of waiting before anyone would actually come out to speak with me, i would think that if someone got hurt at a major hotel someone would be out in 2 seconds to handle the problem, Well i lost it and demanded to speak with the Hotel manager, which by the way we never saw, they sent the room director who basically said they didn't have another room to give us at that time, and who never reported the fall i took in the bathroom no incident report was ever filed by Mr Angelo Perez. I was appalled at how insensitive this whole situation was treated. We arrived there on Feb 5th and were not offered a room change until Feb 10th which we turned down since they would not move my parents with us. He did offer us a complimentary dinner at what he said was their best restaurant,to which we were told we would have to pay for our own drinks, at the restaurant we were seated at a table in a corner near the kitchen, making us feel like bad children, it was a lackluster meal at best and we felt like we were being punished. My husband conveyed this entiment to the Room director on Feb 11th, he called us back and said that they wanted to move us to one of the casitas, in their haste they deactivated our room keys with all our things still in our rooms, i lost it and went back to the front desk and told them to let us back in our rooms and that with 2 days left in our stay we would not be moving there really was no point . On Feb 12th Mr perez ask my husband to meet with him,we were offered a 1000.00 refund for our trouble and 2 free nights, only to find out that out of the 1000.00 credit they were deducting the 2 free nights and the complimentary dinner they had given us on friday night, when i asked about that the response i got was well we have to pay the restaurant for the meal somehow, it was awful. They also over charged us for the transfer from the airport to the hotel which they had to review and take off and. The fact that i fell in their hotel bathroom, or had an asthma attack directly related to the hot , humid room or that i had to wear wet shoes to the so-called complimentary dinner and the attitude we recieved from the staff, seem to have no effect on them at all. It was shameful and humiliating for us,My expierience at this hotel will never be forgotten, but the worst part is that in beingan Ocuupational therapist and my husband a physician we made it clear that if that bathroom was a hazard for us imagine how dangerous it would be for truly physically disabled person, to which the response was what would you like us to do? If you plan to stay there, make sure you are told everything, the hidden housekeeping charge of 3.00 per day the charge for the bellman as well as a resort tariff, whatever that is. The rooms were dusty and dirty, plates removed from our room were left in front of our door all day with flies buzzing around it was disgusting i had to finally take the plates away myself and put them in the ice room, also the ice machines on our floor were broken, and the worst was having to push dirty wet towels around on the floor used to soak up the water on the bathroom floor after showers, they did send up someone to unclog the drain, but the water still flooded the floor, so we resorted to taking showers in my parents room, which had a tub. The food is very expensive and and not very good at all, which we elected to eat outside of the hotel.It was an awful hotel and made for a very bad vacation , so i caution anyone before choosing this place.", "Date": "February 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pisgah Forest, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cFantastic time\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4457724", "Content": "Having just returned from visiting the El Conquistador with my husband and another couple (all close to 60 years old), I must say that all 4 of us were very impressed with the resort and had a terrific time. I read every previous review before leaving and was extremely apprehensive about what we may encounter. From pick-up at the airport until we were dropped back off there 8 days later, our experience was fantastic. Having traveled extensively and stayed at other great resorts over the years, I feel I have some basis for comparison. Service was prompt, friendly, and efficient; the grounds were well-maintained and very lovely; the rooms were clean and, while somewhat dated, offered lovely views in comfortable surroundings. I was prepared to ask for an updated and quiet room based on other reviews I read here. At check-in, before I could make my request, we were told that we had been upgraded automatically and had a very nice room...which certainly was true. We stayed in room 4436 in the La Vista section and had a fantastic view of El Yunque and the golf course with the ocean in the background...and beautiful sunsets. We rented a car from Avis ahead of time to be picked up at the resort. It was considerably cheaper to do this prior to arrival and we found it cost the same to rent for 5 days or 8 days so got a car for the entire 8 days. The driving was fairly easy and not a problem to get around as in some Caribbean countries. The food was good at the resort, with a nice mix of prices. We really enjoyed the private beach and found the food and drinks over on Palomino Island to be very reasonable and quite good. David's muffins (especially carrot raisin) were a hit with all of us as were the ice cream cones near the casino. Highlights were kayaking on the bioluminescent bay (a must), ferry to Culebra Island (fantastic beach), horseback riding on Palomino Island, and hiking through El Yunque. Oh, also the Golden Door Spa...a somewhat rainy day was made very special by the Caribbean Escape package getaway! It looked like there had been lots of recent painting and repairs to the exterior.

I've been in the hotel business for many years and done a lot of traveling to various places and various types of properties. Overall, it was a very enjoyable trip. The facility is beautiful (grounds, pools, island etc.) It is older, but pretty well kept up, not perfect, but certainly very nice. The only real complaint for our two families that visited were the guest rooms. They were \"tired\". Not dirty, just older. Bedspreads and carpt were fine. But, when tile and furnishings get older, they are hard to keep looking \"fresh\". We had one room with ocean view in the Las Vistas building and one overlooking the marina in that section. Both just need some \"perking up\" and new furnishings. The bathrooms need new tile etc. When you pay these prices...you do want to have a very plush room to go along with it. The nicer restaurants were expensive, but you have other options at all times. We enjoyed Blossoms (Asian), Isabelas (steakhouse) and Stingray (seafood). Anyone that says that there were no other options, didn't take the time to look for them. If you didn't want to spend the money on the finer dining restaurants in the evening, then you certainly could have enjoyed Bella Vista (over the pool), the cafe, or the marina restaurant. If you didn't want to have the breakfast buffet, there is a cafe or a couple of different places to get \"quick things\". We thought lunch on the island was fantastic! Probably the best fish and chips I ever had! Prices were a bit high...but not for resort standards. We didn't get a chance to enjoy the burger place at the main pool...but heard it was great! The childrens menus were very reasonable everywhere. It was high season, but we never had trouble getting chairs, umbrellas, or towels. We found the workers very nice. Service is slow...again, pretty standard for that area. But, everyone was very pleasant. We were not charged for anything that we didn't order and felt completely safe everywhere we went. The property is undergoing a lot of renovation over the next couple of years and will be very fun to visit again when it is complete.

The food is expensive, but that is to be expected in my opinion. We did get breakfast from the little cafe by the golf course for less than $7.00. The pools are absolutely beautiful, the island to die for and the shops I thought were very reasonable. I had read that the staff was rude, but I didn't find that to be true in our case at all. Everywhere we went, whenever we passed an employee, they always gave us a smile and said hello to us. We did rent a car for $70 to go to San Juan and to the rain forest.

I thought I would post my experience since I read all reviews good and bad about the El Conquistador. First of all the rooms...We stayed at La Castitas. The room was mediocre, roomy, but dated, and kind of dirty. Big deck and one of the best pools I have ever seen. We knew people staying in the Marina and in La Vistas (I think that is the name of the wing). The Marina is really loud, we hung out at a bar one night right across from the rooms. Our friends who were there complained the whole time about the commute up to the main area of the resort, and going down to the bar took pretty long. Our friends at La Vistas had no complaints, and this definitely would be the area I would stay in if I had a choice (of course second to Las Casitas). The location is the best for location to the main pool, the spa, golf etc. If you are going with kids, this is definitely where I would stay. The spa is unbelievable. Great massage, clean and beautiful interior. The fitness room was well equipped and they offered tons of classes, but they were beyond my budget. Dont miss out on the spa. The food was just okay. Isabellas was overrated ($30 entrees). Davids cookies had a good latte and good selection for breakfast. The best at the entire resort was a restaurant bar overlooking the main pool, I think it was called Bella Vista. Hands down, one of the best pizzas I have had (it was around 18.00, but between two people we never finished it). Yes the food was expensive, but you can find what you suits you on the resort. If it deters you, I would weigh out the costs of a suite with a kitchen versus what it would cost your group to eat out every night. If you do get a suite, you can rent a car and drive to the resort, pick up groceries on the way (lots of places) and drop off your car once you arrive to the resort. In Las Casitas they offer grocery shopping for a fee of $25. no matter how much you buy. I am not sure if they offer this to all of the guests. SPeaking of the drive from the airport, it was pretty bad. Soooooo long. About 1 hour 15 min. to the resort and 1 hour and 30 min to the airport. The casino was a great time. I won two nights! As far as the employees and service, it wasn't 5 star, but I had good experience with the employees. Very friendly and helpful for the most part.

Spent sometime reading about the place on this site before we went. Truth is, I was a little skeptical. However, if you have not been there, it is worth going. To start off, I always like to qualify the source. My wife and I are in our mid 30's, with no kids. We travel extensively yet had not been to Puerto Rico. We are not budget travelers so cost was not a main concern. It was a direct flight from Boston so it was convenient. We booked the Romance package that included breakfast and some other amenities. TIP Always call or email the concierge ahead of time to ask questions. I was concerned about the rooms and they told me that the people that book room packages through the hotel get the best rooms. Also, I had requested some flowers be delivery to the room (we never got them) however we were somehow elevated to VIP status when we checked in. We arrived on Friday afternoon and ended up taking the hotel bus which was included in the package. TIP Sit on the left side so you can see the water. It took about an hour to get to the hotel. It was a nice drive and you got to see some of the outlining areas of eastern Puerto Rico. Got to the hotel and we were all ushered to the front desk. TIP Sit in front of the bus or go directly to the front desk once you get off. Some poor people did not follow the line and ended up way behind in the check in line. It did take over 30 minutes to check in because they were not as fast as what we are used to here in Boston. The people in the back must have taken over an hour to get through. Bad timing. We got a nice room on the top floor, 4th floor in the Las Vistas wing. No balcony but ocean view. The view was great. Weather was perfect upon check in. Rooms: The room was nice. King bed, nice bathroom and clean. It seemed they had renovated this because I did not see the complaints listed from the other readers. The hotel complex is rather large. We stayed on the property and did not rent a car. We went to the private island every day and eat at three locations (hotel, marina, island). Food: First thing, we are foodies so right off the bat we were not thrilled with the food however it was decent. Typical costs, breakfast was $50 including tip for 2, lunch was about $40 and dinner ran from $100-$150 depending on where we ate. Overall the food was average but I would have liked to see some local food restaurant represented. The Italian place was good but the portions were very small. Our best experience was at the Sting Ray cafe. Good seafood and the best service at the hotel. The island restaurant was good and convenient. There is a quiet little bar on the Las Olas level that was empty when we had a drink on the balcony under a full moon. Really nice. Service: Overall decent. They were friendly and most spoke English. Rather mechanical at times. We tried to warm up to them but it was not until my wife spoke some Spanish did they open up. Finally, some advice. Try to upgrade to the Las Vistas side. It has a great view. We did not get a deal because we booked this last minute and paid $500 a night for the room. Our package did include a 30 minute massage at the Golden Door Spa (GDS). That was great. It was $55 but you got to use the facility all day. For those that like to work out, they charge $25 a day to use the GDS gym which is a lot nicer than the free one on the Las Olas level. Try to arrange for a package deal. The round trip ride from the airport is about $50 a person and with the breakfast running $50 a couple it is well worth trying to book a package. We are not gamblers so we did not go to the casino. We had a drink at Drakes bar upstairs. It was nice until we saw the bill. A Martini and a port were $20 a piece. Nothing special. Also, check your bill. That was a great tip from a previous review. They had made 2 mistakes. We were charged for 2 things our package included. Golf and tennis facilities looked great as well. I would recommend people to go see the resort but I am not sure if we would go back again. Do not think it is for the budget conscious. We ended up spending $2200 for 3 nights and did not go crazy, not including the flights. One more thing, we got fruit and a bottle of champagne delivered to the room. We never opened the champagne but placed the plates by the door and not outside the door. Needless to say, the ants loved the fruit scraps.

On the way there, it was very hard for me to feel good about the resort because of the reviews on here as well as the fact that only two weeks before I was at a fabulous all-inclusive in the Dominican Republic. I knew I would be comparing my experience with everyone on here as well as my trip to DR! Luckily, I am an open-minded person and I was able to separate the paradise I had been in, for the new paradise of the Elcon. I also never believe a critic until I experience it for myself. I am giving the truth here....you can trust me. I am totally honest. I'm not one of those boorish travelers either. I don't complain and am faily easy-going. So I won't be complaining about dust bunnies-not that I like them, but I can live with them. When we arrived we were not sure where to stay. The place is huge-so many places to be. We met up with a bellman-Angel Torres. He was a huge help. He showed us different rooms throughout the resort and told us everything else we needed to know about the place. He must have spent a whole hour with us! We decided to be in Las Brisas Wing-closer to the lobby and pool. The Marina is pretty, but the boats are noisy in the morning and the Funiculars-while fun and a quick ride- would have been a pain to constantly be up and down on. If you are lobby-goers and like to be around the casino and restaurants, internet cafe etc, then the Marina will be too far for you. At first we thought that we should be in the Marina because it's so much closer to the boat to take to Palomino Island (the private island of the resort), but the ride on the funicular down was not that long and we only went to Palomino once anyway. Everything inside the resort is outdated. It is still pretty, but old. Keep that in mind. You will see wear and tear everywhere, but while we were there they were painting, cleaning..so they make attempts to keep it nice. It is pretty inside....definitely....but if you want polish, perfection and new, this is not the place for you. The rooms are definitely not the best. They are old. The carpet needs to be changed and the tiles on the bathroom floor and walls are cracking. The room is not as clean as it could be either. It's not filthy or grimy or anything, but there are dust bunnies, stains on the carpets. The hardware is old. I am good at letting that stuff go because there is so much beauty around the resort that you hardly notice that it is antiquated. The views are spectacular. I did not know this before I went, but you are so high up (where we stayed) that you have a panoramic view of the Caribe as well as the Atlantic. It's breathtaking. That alone makes Elcon awesome. The food is excellent...all over the resort. The Caribe Cafe was great. The best Banana Smoothie I have ever had. The ice cream was delicious too. All the restaurants were incredible. You must have Pizza outside-forget the name of the place. DELICIOUS. It is all expensive though indeed. However, that's the way it usually is at resorts. We skipped breakfast, had cookies or muffins at David's one day and went out for lunch outside the resort one day. We went to Metropol, a Cuban place. That was delicious too. It is definitely wise to skip a meal if you can once or twice to save a little-if you are concerned about money. Palmomino Island: It was okay, nothing to write home about. A small island...calm waters, great for the kids. Sand was a little rocky and not as white as I expected. This is where I got into trouble because if being in DR two weeks before. That was a beach with waves and a lot of sand.....we were right on the Caribe there-out in the middle of nowhere. If you want that kind of beach, then you will need to travel to area beaches while at Elcon. Just keep in mind this is a small island, so it's different. Still, it's nice.....but it's simple. Nothing to ooohh and awww about. I liked the boat ride though.....no matter what kind of boat, I love it! The Spa was the best part. Best massage and body treatment I have ever had. I live in New York and I have been to the best spas in the city-world renowned places that people die to get into. Golden Door has them beat as far as I am concerned. Prices were reasonable too. I was impressed. We hired our own driver to see El Yungue-the rainforest and Old San Juan. We did it for about 4 hours each. El Yunque cost us about $180 plus $30 for optional tip. Old San Juan cost us $210. We tipped again on that trip, but I forget how much...maybe an extra $30-40. Not cheap.....but worth it because we wanted to go on our own time and at our own pace. The hotel offers group tours for just a tiny bit less, but if they do not have enough people, they cancel......and you go for the whole day and possibly lose pool/island time. Alberto Soler was our driver/guide. He was great. Request him and you will not be disappointed. He is worth every penny. When you go to the Old City, go down San Francisco street and have lunch at Mallorca. It is a local place. We were the only tourists in there. The food was great and so were the pastries. If you are like me and believe \"when in Rome......,\" then you want to be here and not in the Puerto Rico Cafe down the road where you will be stepping over tourists. Anyway, I am already writing too much. It is expensive, but most vacations are. Truth be told, we spent what we spent on the all-inclusive....maybe we spent a couple hundred more, but in the end, it was pretty close. Vacations are not cheap, but in the end, it's always worth the expenditure......even when it puts us into debt. One thing I will complain about-something I think is aboslutely stupid is that the resort will charge you for the airport transfers. Come on Manangement-we are already paying enough-some things need to be complimentary. Looking forward to returning someday. The hotel is not owned by Whyndam (SP?)anymore. Blackstone bought it and is going to begin remodels soon. It will be nice to return when it is all finished. They know they are sitting on a huge nest egg because of the views. The food is great as well as the casino too.....I can see this resort being in the top ten once it updates. As old as it was-it is one of the best places to stay on the Island. The experience would have s----- if we stayed at the Ritz like we originally planned. So we were pretty pleased. If anyone has any questions you can email me, ----.

No serious complaints\u201d", "Author": "BB_5", "ReviewID": "UR4335085", "Content": "We stayed at the El Con from Nov 30 - Dec 5, 2005. We were originally going to stay at an all-inclusive Iberostar near Cancun, but due to hurricane Wilma, had to change our plans at the last minute. (Kudos to Sunburst Vacations for working with us!) This was a family vacation: husband, wife, 8 and 10 year-old boys. We had a deluxe ocean view room not far off the main lobby and casino area. We were given a free upgrade from our garden view room without asking (admittedly, the fellow checking us in took a shine to the boys, and was very helpful.) The room was reasonable. It was clean and in decent shape. Having read so many negative reviews, I looked about with a negative eye, and I could see where some may complain -- definitely some signs of wear and tear, and perhaps a tad of mildew in a corner near the ceiling in the bath. But as a frequent traveller who typically stays at Marriotts while on business, I found this place to be on par. People of the \"glass is half full\" mindset will likely have no complaints. As noted by most, the food is expensive. We had one very expensive meal at the steakhouse. Great service. Our waitress even went next door and ordered Chinese carry out for my picky-eater son, and brought it along with the rest of our meals. We controlled our food costs by going to the grocery store our first day. (An interesting experience. We also went to Walmart -- so familiar, yet not.) There was a refrigerator in the room for milk and yogurt and Coronas and juices/sodas and snacks. We started every morning eating our grocery store breakfast on the balcony overlooking the beautiful ocean while reading and talking. Slow, relaxing, perfect! By saving money at breakfast and lunch and on snacks, spending poolside and at dinner was manageable. We rented a car at the airport for $129 for the week. We visited El Yunque, Old San Juan, and kayaked the biobay. We also had dinner in Fajardo. Traffic is horrible -- makes Washington DC look reasonable! It's not difficult, it just takes patience and a lot more time than you'd think. We never had any problems or complaints about the funiculars. The kids loved them. Las Olas free health club was fine when we poked around. Palomino Island was gorgeous. Plenty of lounge chairs. We snorkeled right off the beach and the kids found hermit crabs around the trees. Ferry service was predictable and reasonable. There was a change in service one day, and they used computer generated messages to all of the rooms letting us know. We had one extra charge on our bill when checking out (one too many snorkel rentals). It took about five minutes for the desk clerk to clear it with the Palomino Island people, then they removed it. No one charged our credit card in advance. They may have done a temporary authorization, but the only actual charge we ever had was the final charge at check out. We had the kids with us, so we never ventured to the casino or searched for any nightlife besides letting the boys swim at night. Bottom line, we'd go back without hesitation. We travel frequently and tend to take things in stride, so had no serious complaints. Picky, demanding people who look for the negatives will probably find them at the El Conquistador (pricey, a bit worn down, nuisance ferry, etc.) But we didn't.", "Date": "January 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cIt was okay.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4332788", "Content": "We went to El Conquistador from 12/20-12/22 even though we had read some mixed reviews about it. We still wanted to go because it's a very well known resort and also one of the largest in PR. We should have gone somewhere else. We saved some money because we had a special winter rate for $149 a night. But then we spent a lot on food and drink. Everything at the resort is really, super duper expensive. The beach at Palomino Island was okay. There was alot of algae in the water. Bring your own water equipment if you can. Rentals are expensive. One night we drove out to Luquillo and ate at a restaurant called King Seafood. The food was great and much cheaper than the resort. And the wait staff spoke English. So it's a good idea to have a car if you want to travel outside of Fajardo. Our room was big but had a broken standing lamp, a missing desk lamp, and a missing chair. We had 3 rooms reserved so we were able to figure out what was missing from our room. We asked several times to get the lamp fixed, but it never did get fixed and half the room remained dark at night. The rooms look old and worn out. We stayed in the old part of the resort. Maybe the newer rooms are nicer. And don't bother calling the front desk, or the guest services line, or the restaurant reservations from your room. No one picks up the phone. And it took 5 phone calls to get the internet to work. And check in, parking validation and parking itself took a long time. If you arrive at night, there are so few lights that you will have no idea where you are supposed to go. There is a van that goes around picking people up from the lot, but it's so dark, you won't know where to go to get picked up. Don't forget to bring mosquito repellant. Puerto Rico is beautiful.

At the time we made our reservations the hotel was advertised as a Wyndham Resort; however, upon arrival and check-in, we were told that the hotel had been sold 6 months earlier and it would not honor any Wyndham \"rewards or specials\" such as Wyndham By Request, etc. Interestly enough, EVERYTHING in the hotel (pens, menus, guides, soap, shampoo, writing paper, etc.) still has the Wyndham name and logo on it! In fact, if you go to the Wyndham website, it still lists the ElCon as one of its hotels. Nevertheless, the hotel will make no effort to accommodate those who are under this false impression--an impression which they (the current owners) have done nothing to change. Additionally, although our room was completely prepaid, at check-in we were also told that we MUST give them our credit card, which would be charged a minimum of $1,000 up front for any \"incidentals\" we might incur. (FYI: Should you decide NOT to charge anything to your room account, your card is still charged, you do NOT get a refund at the end of your stay, but rather, the hotel will refund your credit card approximately 2-3 weeks after your departure!!!) It has always been my experience that hotels keep your credit card on file as a sort of quasi deposit until check-out--at which time YOU can chose whether to have that card charged or pay in cash, or whatever for any such incidentals. Perhaps this charge is common in the \"resort\" hotels, but again, I have never experienced it anywhere else. In any case, when I refused to give them my credit card for that purpose, they insisted I leave cash in lieu of the card. Again, $1,000+. Nowhere in any literature about the hotel, on the website, or at the time of my reservation was there any \"small print\" or mention of this \"charge\". After much back and forth, we agreed to leave $400 for possible \"incidentals\". (Be sure to get a receipt, because even though they have all the information on their computer, they will NOT refund your money without your receipt!) After all of this, when we did try to charge our breakfast to the room, we were told we could not--that we were on a \"cash only\" basis. We then would have to go to the front desk and go through the whole process again with whomever was on duty. I will say that for the most part, the staff was very polite and even apologetic throughout; however, the management was quite the opposite. As others have mentioned, the hotel discourages you from leaving the property unless you go through the hotel for car rentals, tours, etc. Essentially, you are in resort prison. We asked one of the concierges about \"getting out\" (to the town of Fajardo), and were told it was a 5-10 min drive or 20 min walk. We chose to walk and found out that the 20 min was more than an hour to get to nowhere! But we figured okay, we would just take a taxi back. What we later found out and what she had neglected to tell us was that Fajardo is closed on Sundays and there is NO taxi service! About the only thing open (besides church) was a Subway shop. So we got a sandwich and headed back (on foot) to the resort. About a half hour into our walk we were fortunate enough to get a ride from a woman returning from church, who informed us that we were lucky we hadn't gotten robbed (or worse) as we were walking through a really horrible part of town! (The road, by the way, the concierage suggested we take.) Our next trip out we rented a car from Avis, which is located in the lobby of the hotel. However, do NOT rent a car through the hotel! If you rent a car through the hotel, you will pay about $100/day. We went to the Avis site online (from our room) and got the same car for $59.95/day. And forget about the tours the hotel offers. Besides being overpriced, they also cancel the tour if there aren't 6 or more people booked. Lastly, on our final day, we checked out and brought our luggage to the front of the hotel to meet the hotel's airport shuttle. We were told our luggage was safe, and so we left it there and went to one of the shops in the lobby to pick up a few gift items. We later found out (at the airport) that wasn't so. Our (very expensive) laptop was now missing. We called the hotel, were transferred all around the hotel--to shops, front desk, and finally security. They couldn't have been any less interested. We called several times, and finally reached someone who said they would look at the security videotapes and get back to us. It has been weeks. We have heard from no one. Our calls do not get answered or returned. Having said all that, on the brighter side of things, the weather was, for the most part, very pleasant. We stayed down at the Marina, which was private, quiet, and had a beautiful view of the ocean. Of course, the only way up to the hotel is by the funicular/cable car, which is nice when working. (For a few days, one of the two cars was out of commission.) It would be smart for the hotel to put in a staircase, if for no other reason than for emergencies when the power is out and so are cable cars. Anyway, it didn't much affect us, but there were many times when guests from up top missed the boat to the island because there was only one car in service. And although the boat to the island is supposed to run every half hour, it was randomly changed to every hour. Being down in the Marina, we were able to \"escape\" the resort and walk to a less \"glamorous\" part of town and get some good local food at reasonable prices. We found a little bodega, and were able to get some snacks and cervezas for less than the $100 we would have paid at the hotel! Our room was clean and comfortable enough; although the decor was like something out of the 80's. The bathroom was huge, lots of marble, and spotless. The maid sersvice was fine, although it took three days to get a coffeemaker that worked. Having visited Puerto Rico before and all the usual sites, we weren't looking to be entertained this trip, just relaxed. So, staying down at the Marina satisfied that desire. When we wanted to go somewhere like San Juan or Old San Juan, we rented a car. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this hotel at this point in time. One would think that as new owners, Management would do everything possible to make their guests' stays great and memorable. Instead Management treats the guests as though they are doing them (the guests) a favor by letting them stay there! So rather than having a great and memorable stay, one leaves with just a memorable one--and an unfavorably memorable one at that.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201camazing property but....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4324895", "Content": "We stayed at the Conquistador from the 26th until the 31st.

I will first start with the positives as there are many. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Lobby, pool area, views, shops, and the beach especially. The staff I found to be very helpful and pleasant on all occasions. I needed a few things from housekeeping and they were promptly brought to my door within 10 minutes. The water taxi to and from the beach is very enjoyable as well. It takes about 15 minutes and it has beautiful views of the hotel and surrounding areas in the beautiful blue water. We actually ate at every restaurant in the main hotel. I found the food to be very good. The Italian restaurant Otellos was the one I liked most. We traveled with our 8 year old son who has autism and everyone was friendly and accomodating to his tastes in restaurants. In two instances they made me something not on the menu for him. The casino while small was very nice as well. We didn't actually gamble this time but it was clean and lively and open aired. Not smokey or crowded in any way. The pools were clean. There is a main pool with a slide and a volleyball net. Then there is another pool with a water platform and a swim up bar. Both areas had food and drinks to be delivered pool side or sit at a table. There was a game room for kids, and two ice cream shops with access to the internet if you needed it. It was 4.95 per hour for usage. I took advantage of the shuttle service provided by the hotel. While it was not cheap (60 rt per adult and 40 rt per child) it was convenient and direct. Took just over an hour from San Juan airport. Check in was quick and it was the holiday week. I never saw a line at the counter at all. That goes for the boat to the beach or any restaurant seating. The beach is on a beautiful private island with nice sand and the water is warm and aqua. Some days there was a little seaweed but others there was none. There were plenty of lounge chairs and towels were provided as soon as you got off the boat. There was drink service on the beach as well as delivery of lunch if you wanted it. We chose to eat at the tables in the small beach restaurant each day and there was never a wait for a table either. Again, keep in mind it is Christmas week. Still no wait. They had jet ski, snorkle rental equiptment, etc right on the beach. There was also horse back riding I believe. Now all that being said.. What I was not happy with while it would not prevent me from returning again I was on a ground level room with a garden view in the La Vista wing. The room was in need of a major renovation. Carpets a bit dingy, no ventilation in the bathroom and pitted fixtures in the bathroom as well. The linens were clean but old and in need of a replacement. This hotel was recently sold so I know they are about to do a major renovation. I did pay the lowest rate available for my room and they went up several levels from my rate which was 375.00. All the rooms are the same size. Very big. 575 sq feet and I knew I would have no ocean view which i didn't care about. Actually my view was of the golf course and garden and was quite nice. As I said the complaint was on the run downness of the room. It was a little musty too. I had brought a scented candle with me and was glad that I did. There is an 11% tax rate and also a 11% resort fee which I believe is going up to 15%. It brought the room up to 450.00 and I don't believe that for that price I should be unhappy with the room in any way but I was not thrilled. Secondly, there were children's menu's in each of the restaurants which was great. The food otherwise was a little pricey but something I'm used to living in New York. What was really pricey was the cost of soft drinks and juices. When two eggs, and toast cost 6.50 in the coffee shop and a juice cost 3.00. I thought that to be a little high. Nothing that can't be fixed with bringing in juice boxes for my son. I did not use the spa so I can't comment on it. My husband golfed twice and while not cheap he loved the course and did well on it. Golfing at any resort is not cheap so we expected that cost. 165.00 per round. We love this place and will return again. I suppose had I made a fuss I could have switched my room but I didn't. Maybe next time I'll specificy before I actually get to it and settle in.

We got a fairly good deal on the air+hotel package, so despite all the reviews I read here we decided to take a chance. Overall, we had a very pleasant five day trip to PR. GROUNDS + POOLS + BEACH: The resort grounds are indeed beautiful. Well maintained and groomed. They impressed both my parents and me. The pools (three in the main complex) are nice and my kids loved them. My six year old loved the slide (open 10-5) and all the pool toys (we got them for free at the pool desk). We had some minor problems getting towels after 5pm. The staff I spoke about this with complained too many guests left their towels behind so they, the staff, had to go around collecting them the morning after?! Palomino island beach is beautiful! My kids both liked the short boat ride (10min) and enjoyed the beach. The beach got busy each day around 11 or noon and you had to search a bit longer for the right spot in the shade. My three year old does not like to wear a swimsuit but we were a bit looked upon, as she played naked on the beach. That was a bit of a surprise to me. ROOMS: We opted for the garden-view rooms, as they were closest to the restaurants and the pools. The view was nice, overlooking the golf course with a partial view of the distant Luquillo beach. I was happy with the room size and cleanliness. I had a king size bed which was enough for my two kids and me. My parents had two full beds, in the room of similar configuration. The bathrooms were spacious and clean. Keep in mind that this resort is probably about 20-30 years old. We had and used the in-room fridge and occasionally watched TV. There was a VCR there as well which we did not test. Both rooms were made before noon on each day of our stay. FOOD: The food is the weakest point of this resort. First of all, it is expensive. Hot dogs for $10, cocktails $8, small pizza for $19. We ended up eating at Cafe Caribe one night and had breakfast at David's Cookies. The dinner for 5 (3 adults + 2 kids) ran about $90 but was nothing special. Breakfast was about $25 for five of us (croissants + coffee). I would not mind the prices that much if the food quality was exceptional. Unfortunately, it was mediocre. For instance, the hot dogs were small and the buns were of the worst kind (very dry)---something you get at a local fair from a girl scouts' stand for $1.50. We loved the fish and chips at Palomino island, but the prices were even higher there than in the rest of the resort. We took advice from another TripAdvisor review and ate outside most of the nights (we had a rental car for the stay). There is a number of restaurants in the vicinity of the resort. We ate at the Anchor Inn one night (5 min drive). They had decent seafood and local specialties. We also went to the Metropolis restaurant that serves good Cuban food (about 10 min drive). Both nights we paid about $80-$90, but the food was much better than what we got at the resort. Finally, on the last day of our stay we went to the Luquillo food stands for lunch. This is a strip with 20+ food stands near Rt.3, next to Luquillo beach, that serves local food. Be forewarned: it is mostly deep-fried but very tasty! We spent about $20 on drinks and a small lunch for five. ACTIVITIES: Beach and pool were the two places where we spent most of our time. One day we went to San Juan to explore the Old City. It was drizzling all day but we still enjoyed the fortress and walking around the narrow streets. We also spent an afternoon in the El Yunke rainforest. It is about 30min drive from the resort but well worth it. The view of the island from Yokahu tower is stunning. Given the kids age I decided not to hike a lot, but there are certainly many trails for those inclined to explore the forest, waterfalls and many streams. GENERAL: Before embarking on this trip I bought a Lonely Planet guide to Puerto Rico. I always found these guides useful and this one was no exception. CAR RENTAL: We decided to rent a car for the five days we spent in PR. This gave us the freedom to explore beyond the tours offered by the resort. It also proved useful for eating out. Self parking in the resort is $15/day, $20 for valet. Our total rental from Budget was about $250 for five days, plus about $40 for gas. Probably slightly more than the airport shuttle for five, but well worth it. However, be ready for some traffic in PR! It took us about 1.5h for the 35 or so miles from the airport to the resort, around 3 in the afternoon. Rt.3 is particularly bad, with frequent traffic lights. On our second trip from San Juan to the resort we decided to try a different route, suggested by Lonely Planet (52 south, 30 west, 53 north). What a mistake! It was a rush hour and despite all the roads being limited access (toll+freeway) it took us 2 hours to get back. A part of this was because of the traffic signs, rather the lack of those.

We were originally placed in Las Olas. When we arrived there with our 14 suitcases and a double stroller, we found that there was no elevator. We called the front desk before unloading our bags and even attempting to enter our room and we were greeted by a very helpful staff member who immediately changed our rooms to the la Vista Bldg. We stayed in las Brisas last year and found La Vista nicer, more conveniently located and newer. We had a beautiful view of El Yunque and a gorgeous sunset every night. Each room had excellent air conditioning and a functional refrigerator which was essential for us with our young children. We were on the \"Four For Free\" package which I highly recommend as this includes your transfers from SJU on an air conditioned motor coach and breakfast daily for two people per room. This makes the financial pinch of the stay much more tolerable. Though not in plain site, there are ramps everywhere (other than in Las Olas) to make access to all parts of the hotel easy. The place is a city and you really don't need to leave the resort. Yes, Yes, the food is expensive. I said this in my review from last year. We spent between $140 - $180 for dinner each night. That is the price you pay for convenience. Blossoms is as good as any Hibachi-teppan yaki Japanese restaurant and Otello has very good Italian fare. I had a very good steak at Isabella's and the fish is very decent at Stingray. The food at Cafe Caribe is not very good but is good enough for the young kids if Mom and Dad want to have dinner alone. Cafe Caribe is also pretty reasonably priced. The best meal of the day, however is breakfast. The buffet in Las Brisas is very nice. The restaurant is newly remodeled since last year and the food is great. They have a secret for making oatmeal that is not to be believed. The pools are beautiful and Palomino Island is magnificent. The boat ride over and back is very enjoyable. Our weather was the best we have had in Puerto Rico. Sunny and warm with highs of 85 -87 degrees each day. When it is 5 below 0 in Chicago how could you possibly go wrong? Furthermore, PR is easy access from the states. There is no immigration or customs and if you can get a direct nonstop flight which we had, the travel is not that bad, even with young children. Overall, the EC is a wonderful hotel for families traveling with children who want a sprawling resort with all amenities from pool to spa, tennis and golf and a casino where you can still find $5.00 tables. The service is accomodating with a great wait staff. Perfect, no....but they do really try hard to help. After our problem at check-in which was quickly remedied we did not have another glich for the remainder of our stay. We are two time veterans of the EC and 7 time vets of PR.

Minor problems we encountered were corrected immediately, we were provided with two complementary breakfasts and a bottle of wine for minor delays. Examples were a minor delay at reception and a minor delay bringing our meal. Reception staff went out of their way to ensure we were satisfied with our room. We were allowed to view numerous rooms before picking a 4th floor Marina room with huge bathroom, large balcony, French glass doors and 12 ft high sloped ceiling (room 1425). The large resort is in excellent and clean condition, gardens beautiful, broken items are seen to be fixed immediately.Tips. - There is a must see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infinity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd style pool in the Castries portion of the resort that is not shown on their map. - Consider staying in the Marina, it is newer than other resort areas. The Marina has one of the best pools, quiet with large grassy areas, volleyball and basket ball courts. - There are two funiculars, one is a top to bottom express and the other stops half way up. There is no alternative to get up the hill e.g. there are no top to bottom stairs or elevators. - Locate all the elevators at both the top and bottom of the hill so you can save a few minutes when going up and down. - Trip to the island will take at least an hour to get there and back. Best beach on the island is immediately on your left when you get off the ferry. During the week it is practically deserted. - There is a seedy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant (Oceanview) accessible from the Marina. Turn left out of the resort, past the security guard and walk 10 minutes along the shoreline to a nice park area. On weekends there are booths selling great burritos and chicken. Kayaks depart from this location to tour the bioluminescent lagoon at night.", "Date": "December 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Petersburg, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFABULOUS RESORT!!!\u201d", "Author": "compassquest", "ReviewID": "UR4254582", "Content": "I read trip advisor frequently and also travel much.....business and pleasure. I became a bit skeptical after my husband and I had booked an unbelievably cheap deal for 5 nights at the El Con. After reading many of the terrible reviews, we decided not to expect alot.

MY hubby says I could strike up a conversation with a tree! We rented a car and drove from the airport...traffic the entire way. When we got here...heaven! Upon checkin, I sucked up to the front desk person. I asked him if he was the \"Alex\" I had read about who was so nice. Funniest thing......both front desk people named ALEX! After laughing, I said it would be wonderful to have a king bed with coeanfront view. He said that was possible, but an extra $70/night. I slipped him a $20, and he went in the back, returned a moment later, and said we would get a special private upgrade from the hotel. Bellman takes us to our room in the Las Brisas wing....and my husband's jaw drops! Magnificent view and very nice newly decorated room. Very large dressing area, sunken tub, walk-in closet. Separate sitting area. GREAT COMFORTABLE BED! Had a massage this morning at The Golden Door Spa....a must do! I had the 50 minute Golden Door massage...best ever. We have eaten at Caribe Cafe twice and it has been fine. Also ate lunch at the Green Iguana on Palimino Island....very good.

We just wanted a sunny get-away for 5 nights, something easy to get to & child friendly - as we have an 11 month old. The Agent totally sold us on this place, and a room with a \"Deluxe Ocean View\" and it sounded expensive, but great. Then we stared to read the postings on this board and on news groups and started to panic - we called the travel agent who assured us that this place was not a dump with rude staff & rats in the halls.... So we went! Our package included transfers and at the airport, the bus was prompt, the staff friendly - and there was a \"help yourself\" free bar in the back of the bus. Already things were beyond our expectations. We arrived on a Tuesday. There was no line to check in - and every employee was friendly. The lobby was impressive, with birds in cages & lush plants. Our room was fine. A normal mid-size hotel room. In my opinion, not worth the $200+ per night we paid for it. In addition, it was missing some of the basics: it had no fridge, no hairdryer, no info binder (with hotel info, menus, etc) and no clock radio. A few calls and all those things were brought up to the room - no problem. BUT, this was indicative of odd bubbles in the service that just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit such an expensive place. One positive note- the room had a DVD player, which I wish we had know about, as we would have brought some DVDs (the hotel neither sells or rents them). Our room was in the Las Brisas Wing, facing the back, the view was great but there's a service road beneath the rooms that was somewhat noisy. We got the idea that the rooms on the other side of the wing were the nicer ones. The pool was great! There were three pools, all in great shape, with piles of towels. Great pool for little kids. The drinks: I expect to pay a fortune for drinks while on vacation; my problem is that the drinks were inconsistent. Some good, some weak, and different at every hour of the day & bar. Again, for $8.00 there should be some booze in the drinks. The first night we ate in the hotel at Cafe Carib, which is basically a coffee shop with a few local dishes on the menu. The prices a tad high, but not insane. Breakfast can be had for under $10.00. NOTE: there is an ice-cream window and the cone I had (praline) was amazing @ $3.50. We did check out the other restaurants and there is normal food to be had around the pool, but otherwise all the stories you read here are true, there are $40 entrees that we heard aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that good at the fine dining restaurants. No thanks. NOTE: There are restaurants in walking distance! If you take the funicular down and walk about 10 minutes (through a dark/scary parking lot/service road), you have to leave the grounds through a check point, there is a public beach/park with a bunch of shack-like restaurants - popular with the hotel employees. Most are not open at night, but some are and we ate a fine meal one night at one. Ask the guys who help load the ferry for info. After dinner, I gambled a bit in the nearly empty casino and the friendly dealer told me that the hotel was only 23% full. Hearing this my wife decided to ask if we could get a better room. And the desk clerk said we could change the next day. Our 2nd room had a much nicer view. We rented a car ($201 for 3 days), which we used to: visit the rain forest (where we went for a swim at the falls), visited Old San Juan (where it took us an hour to park our car on a Wed!) and go out to dinner every night. Valet parking is up to $20 - but we ended up never getting charged for it - or the drinks we had on the island. Palimino Island was lovely, and almost empty most of the time we were there. The food there is indeed a rip off. A hot dog is $9.00, and it is just a hot dog - not encrusted with jewels or anything. The boat trip to the island ranged from 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the choppiness of the sea, and which of the three boats you were on. WARNING: one day the ferries left every 1/2 hour, the next day every hour - leaving a lot of folks waiting - the Hotel's inability to communicate this change was typical of lost opportunities to improve service here - but nobody cares enough, or nobody is looking at the big picture. We did hear over and over that when the hotel is full (we were there the 1st week in December) that the place is a mad house. Not enough chairs on the island, not enough seats on the boat, etc... I can only imagine that it would make things less pleasant here if it was pakced with ripped off and under served feeling patrons. KID NOTE: EVERYONE in Puerto Rico seems to LOVE babies. And we were made to feel welcome - which was very nice. The hotel gave us a crib for no charge. Overall I got the impression that this place is for folks who are really rich and want to use the spa, play golf & eat really overpriced food in a lovely atmosphere, and not see Puerto Rico at all - or people attending conferences on an expense account. The staff all talked about improvements that were coming for 2007, and there were some architect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans on display in the lobby.

We had a two-for-one deal I took full advantage of and loved the services I received (Golden Door Massage and a heavenly reflexology treatment)! The grounds were well maintained and inviting. The casino was not particularly busy, allowing my husband to try his hand at all of the games he never tries on our trips to AC and Vegas! The food was so-so at best and the prices were quite high. Living in NYC we are accustomed to high prices, but here even a meal of 2 sandwiches and sodas ran us close to $40. The beach was beautiful, it felt like we were on our own private island. If you are a beach person, the 25 minute ferry ride might seem a pain, we really enjoyed it and found it to be relaxing. Overall, if you can get a deal like the one we got (2-for-1 on spa services, water sports, transfers and golf) and go during an off week, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

When the plane landed we were greeted promptly and courteously by the hotel shuttle bus and were taken to the hotel. The ride wasn't bad and there were plenty of cold drinks on board. The entrance to the hotel grounds are beautiful and the golf course is absolutely lush. The lobby was clean, inviting and tropical and we checked in with no problems. Like many have said, we too found our room to be on the dirty side. A few lightbulbs weren't working, the shower walls were filthy and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a very long while. Although I made coffee with the complimenatary coffee pot on the first day, the grinds lay in the basket even after we checked out - not cleaned once during our stay. In terms of the room, use the safe. Someone who entered our room stole $57 that I had tucked into a zippered compartment of our suitcase. It was casino winnings from the night before - easy come, easy go. Also, our maid shut our door while cleaning our room which goes against most hotel policies. And, like others, housekeepers often didn't show up until well past four in the afternoon - after a call to housekeeping requesting service. I had my two children (6,4) with me and they spent nearly every day at the Kids Klub. The two counselors were very warm, friendly and responsible. Everyday, the kids did something like snorkling, a trip to the beach, playtime in the pool, etc. When it rained, they had x-box and playstation. They really showed my kids a great time and that was one of the best parts of the trip. Having them in camp, I got to enjoy relaxing by one of the three pools. They were all cleaned and well maintained but the kiddie pool and cliffside jaccuzzis looked murky and in need of cleaning. One day it rained and the hotel didn't offer towels between 12 and 4. The restaurant food was fair to good but very, very pricey. The cheapest entrees I noticed were $28. We did enjoy our dinner at Stingrays and I'd recommend the Tilapia dish. It rained two days we were there and I got to use the Golden Door Spa facilities and everything was great. I enjoyed the clean healthclub and thought it was one of the better hotel fitness facilities I've been to. The hotel is under new management and there was a lot of talk about the improvements they plan to make. One of the waiters told me that December - May is really the height of their season and when you can expect the most traffic and activity.

Booked the \"Our getaways by request\" package through the hotel's own web site. It was a great deal: 4th night free, and 2nd room at half price; also buy-one-get-one-free spa treatments, golf, tennis, and water sports. I was happily surprised that they met my request for connecting non-smoking rooms, one with king and other with doubles (so the kids could have their own room). Yes, the food is over-priced and of so-so quality (this is common at most mega-resorts, not just El Conquistador), so you have 2 choices: 1). go in knowing this, budget for it, and enjoy this fabulous resort anyway; 2). do what we did: rent a car, and get supplies at one of the many local supermarkets. The rooms have fridges, so you can keep breakfast and lunch foods in the room, then take your car into town for dinner. Use the in-room coffee maker to heat water and have oatmeal in your coffee cup. Our favorite Fajardo restaurants: Edy's seafood (humble establishment - very good, reasonably-priced) and the Metropole (very nice, good value - try the Festival Cubana!). For a cheap meal, get take-out and have dinner on your balcony - you probably will have a better view than any restaurant. Ask the concierge for directions to the bakery in town that serves breakfast (I can't remember the name) - the 4 of us had a very nice breakfast there for under $20. The public spaces are stunning and in pretty good repair. The rooms are showing their age - I could list a dozen little problems, but they are minor compared with all that is great about this resort. Palomino island is wonderful. We sailed - preferring the Hobie Cat over the Sunfish, and jet-skied. We found the staff and the guests to be quite friendly. Three of us started a volleyball game, and within 10 minutes five other folks asked to join in, and we had a great time playing 4-on-4. Yes you are a captive audience so again, the prices are high. But it's all about attitude: we just mentally \"budgeted\" $100 for over-paying on drinks and food - in the end, we didn't even spend that much, so we ended up ahead of the game. The spa is very nice and the treatments are reasonably priced. One point of confusion is that they have one policy that you must be at least 18. Yet they offer a \"teen special\" with a minimum age of 14. Well, my daughter took the special and loved it. The price list on your in-room phone says that local calls are a dollar or two, but be aware that calls to a cell phone can be expensive. We made one call to a local number that turned out to be a cell phone - we were charged $26.00! (The front desk reversed it.) The hotel is very convenient to the El Yunke rain forest, which is a must-see. The trails are easy to navigate for anyone in reasonable shape. After a strenuous hike, go down to the falls - it's an easy 15-minute walk down a paved trail, and you can jump into the stream, and even stand right under the waterfall - fantastic! The bioluminescent tour is nice. As you'd expect, the hotel's tour company costs twice as much as the in-town companies. So again, we took the rental car into town and went with a company called Yokahu - they were fine. We rented with Budget, but there may be some advantage to going with Avis, since there's an Avis office right in the resort. Self-parking is $15/day. We did get lost a couple times driving in Puerto Rico - but it's not much different than driving in Boston. Nearly everyone speaks at least some English, so getting directions was easy. Biggest complaint is that slow drivers like to putt in the left lanes, so there's a lot of lane switching.

It is not the place for someone with disabilities or who has trouble walking. If your room happens to be in the marina area it can take 15 - 20 minutes to get up to activities or resturants on the upper level. Staying at El Conquistador is not really a Puerto Rico experience. It is a luxury resort and you are isolated from any sort of local experience, good or bad. The feeling there, for me, was of a tropical playground that could have been anywhere. Some people are comfortable and may actually prefer this but more adventurous travelers may miss exposure to local flavor. In summary, El Conquitador is a beautiful, complete and expensive resort.

We had read the reviews here before we went, so we weren't expecting much in terms of service,but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the resort was virtually empty the first 3-4 days we were there, ensuring that we received plenty of attention. I will mention, however, that we noticed a distinct difference in the quality of service once the hotel began to fill up towards the end of our stay. For example, our room wasn't cleaned until after 4:00 PM on our last full day there, where it had been serviced by noon at the latest every other day. We were surprised by this, since the hotel was still certainly far less than full, so I can only imagine what it would be like during \"busy season.\" We stayed in Las Casitas, the supposed luxury part of the resort, and while our suite was certainly spacious, the furnishings and the mattress were nothing exciting, and I've certainly experienced better in much less expensive accomodations at other resorts and hotels (I travel several times per year on business). Also, beware of the in-room movie system: Once you start a film, there is no way to pause or rewind it. I didn't discover this until after I had ordered (because that's when the message comes up on the screen) and I wasn't expecting it, because every other hotel I've stayed in recently with an in-room movie system has the same control options you would have if you were watching a moie on your VCR at home. As for the food, it's quality was better than I expected, in light of the poor reviews here. However, given the incredibly high prices, I don't know that I would have eaten dinner at the resort more than once if I was paying for it myself. My sister and I especially enjoyed both Le Bistro and Isabellas. Note: If you decide to go to Palomino Island, bring snacks or something to have for lunch, because a chicken sandwich, a burger, and one Mai Tai cost us $50! I can see the point of paying more for gourmet food in attractive surroundings, but for a burger at a plastic table, $50 is over the top. The spa was fabulous and (relatively) reasonably priced. I had 3 treatments, and they were all wonderful: Hydrotherapy, the Golden Door massage, and a Pineapple Body Polish. None more than $115. The therapists were skilled and friendly. Go, if you get the chance. Finally, about the office staff and our butler at Casitas, no one could figure out exactly what was covered by our travel award certificate, despite several emails before we arrived and numerous conversations afterwards (although everything did work out fine in the end). We also had to call to more than once to request bath amenities, coffee supplies, and a grocery list (which we found was useless, because it had no prices listed and they won't buy any beverages for you). Oh, and the Infinity Pool: It really is as magical as they say it is. If you're not staying in Casitas, still try to sneak over and see it.

The bathroom is enormous, but the tub was a little worn. I didn't pay for the room, but my company paid $169 - not a bad deal for a Carribbean resort. I should note the celing appeared to have a couple of stains on it, couldn't tell if it was water damage or mold. Only big downside to the room. The pools are phenomenal, and they were empty -- November is low season, near the end of the hurricanes (not one in sight) - and it was bliss. The spa is also something to write home about, I was treated to something called a shiohara ayeurvedic spa treatment, and it was great. I didn't get a chance to go, but the rainforest is right near the hotel, so I'd like to go back with my family and explore the terrain. Also, seems like it would be a great place for kids. Food - if I wasn't being reimbursed by my company I'd be a little shocked at how expensive it is -- something like $25 for a pasta dish at lunch, and $22 for the breakfast buffet -- but hey, you're at a resort in the tropics, so it kind of comes with the territory. Overall, a beautiful place, one where I'd come back, pay for a more expensive room in one of the other villages and do some exploring in the forest.", "Date": "November 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronxville, NY", "Title": "\u201cIt's a bad as they say!\u201d", "Author": "LisaE9", "ReviewID": "UR4039792", "Content": "We just returned from staying here four nights for a convention. The majority of what has been written about this hotel is true. Our first room was a disaster: 1st floor over a service road with trucks doing landscaping, delivery, etc. Room very tired & worn, no key for the safe, missing lightbulbs in 3 of the lamps so this already dark room was like a pit. Room was fairly clean but with a musty smell. To the hotel's credit, they sent someone fairly promptly to fix the problems. We asked to change rooms the next day & the woman at the front desk was very pleasant, understanding & helpful They moved us to a higher floor on the opposite wing. It was just as run-down looking but much brighter & everything worked. Be aware: even though this was the wing off the front of the building, there is still a long walk to get to the main bulding for meetings, restaurants, etc. Try not to leave anything in your room. The spa is excellent-enjoyed several services there. There is an excellent fitness center in the spa but it costs $25 per day to use if you're not having a treatment. The hotel's fitness center(free) is very small but has sufficient equipment, It's down the hill so you need to take the funiclar to get there. In fact, getting anywhere in this hotel requires lots of walking or elevator/funicular combination. Not a good choice for anyone with mobility problems. But the worst part of the experience was how expensive everything is! I live near New York City & am used to high restaurant prices but this was outrageous! All the restaurants are horribly overpriced & the food is mediocre at best, $28.95 for pasta at Othello's for example. I wouldn't mind paying if the food was outstanding but it's not. Breakfast in the Cafe Caribe was horrible. The buffet breakfast in the retaurant is $22 but they don't tell you that you can have just the cold buffet for $17 or that you can order a la carte. An earlier review mentioned the nickle & diming & it certainly is true. However, I was able to pay cash for coffee at David's Cookies & in the shop. You are charged a $24.95 per day Resort Tarriff & a $24.95 per day Resort Tax on top of your room rate plus $3.00 for maid service. Palomino Island is beautiful & well equipped but a huge pain to get there. On a positive note, we found the staff to be helpful & for the most part friendly. The grounds are gorgeous & the views are lovely. The Blackstone Group has bought the hotel but they have a huge task ahead to make it into a 4 or 5 star property.

Flaws: -OVERpriced food (22$ chicken and cashew nuts at Blossoms; 8$ for fried plantains - 4 pieces- plaintains sell 4 for a dollar down the street so they just made 7.87 on you; 15$ fruit platter; steaks run over 35$) -Jaccuzzi's dirty, chipped and cracked; only half full with luke cold water (same temp as the pool); there were dozens of centipedes in one of them -front desk staff- snooty and rude; he made me feel cheap by saying very loudy in front of others that I get less-of-a-room b/c I booked on orbitz- he also continuously called me by my last name only even though I corrected him to say miss or call me by my first; he did not instruct me how to get to the room; -NO activities when it rained. No shows, or coordinated activities; the only pool table we found was in the cigar bar; my friend and i resorted to playing air hockey in the very cramped children's game room- even the casino was small and pricey since they no longer take coins- you end up spending more than you want to; -bed was very uncomfortable; - a/c went out during the storm and didn't go back on- they're response was that \"it's the tropics, this happens\" -the tours they offer are extremely overpriced- El Yunque is free; horseback riding is 20$ half a day down the road; old san juan is an hour drive (cheaper to rent the car for the day and drive there) This is a resort, a place to re-sort and not worry about anything; not think just do- and this wasn't the case. The conceriege was the only helpful person around (she pointed me to my room and gave me maps to el yunque and san juan). I strongly urge you to not choose this hotel, and if you did change it. We stayed when it rained a great deal so it is possible that I'm jaded but still their should be more for your money. If you do go here, I urge you to rent your own car; bring your own games/activities; eat out often (el mason down the street is great for breakfast and lunch; the loquitto kiosks are good for lunch and dinner; we found a nice restaurant in don pepe on 3 west and el ranchero); if you drink- bring it in. the gas station on the corner of avenue conquistador and rt. 3 sells beers, liquor and wine (not a huge selection though) or buy it in the duty free shop at the airport.

My husband and I went to this resort for our second honeymoon. We couldn't have asked for anything nicer. The one huge WARNING I would give people is that they do not recommend using cash on this resort. Everything is charged to your account unless you ask to pay cash but they never have any on hand and if you don't have exact change you will wait forever for change. The account thing is VERY convenient but if not careful it can really add up quick, so if you plan on paying with cash then remember to bring a lot of change. We stayed in The Casitas and they were fabulous! The villas are gorgeous and the service was spectacular. You also recieve a few perks like free contintenal breakfast, free internet service and a 24 hr butler at your beck and call. The infinity pool at The Casitas was the best one by far. It was overlooking the water on the cliff and the view was breath taking. You also have a full kitchen and if you have the oppoitunity to shop and keep stuff to eat and drink, this would really cut back on cost. The one thing that really stands out in our mind was when we were getting ready to check out, it was pouring rain. We called our butler and he brought us the bill to our villa, carried out our bags to the shuttle and left an open umbrellas at our doorstep for us when we were ready to go. The restaurants are good but they were expensive. I would compare the prices to amusement park prices. The drinks were what we found to be most costly. Two drinks and a tip would cost us a twenty spot. A few rounds definitely added up. We liked the Ballyhoo bar & grill at the marina. They were friendly, food was good and they had a TV. Definelty go to the burger & shakes grill by the pool. Their menu was interesting. Try the sloppy joe wrap! We had dinner at one of the dress code restaurants called Isabellas. This was a steak/seafood restaurant that was very good but again very pricey. Everything is a la carte and the side dishes are big so you can share one of those. After dinner we went over to Drake's cigar lounge. There is a pool table, couches and after dinner drinks. That was my husbands favorite. Palomina Island is everything they say...gorgeous! When I think of the Carribean, this is what I picture, palm trees, horseback riding on the beach, crystal blue water, white sand and tiki huts. Try the Dirty Banana drink, it is very yummy! The only two complaints that we had was that we wanted to be away and relax and everyone at that resort had constant cell phones ringing that drove us nuts and the elevators did breakdown a lot, but in the big realm of things it was better for us to walk. Otherwise everything was very enjoyable, but I feel our opinion may be different than those that stayed in the hotel because that's where most of the complaints came from, so we definitely recommend The Casitas.", "Date": "October 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBad experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3985082", "Content": "We stayed at the Wyndham for a convention.

He gave us his cell phone number, but conviently never answered, and I don't mean unreasonable hours, I am talking 2pm. We were told that if we got our grocery list in by 12pm we would get our groceries the same day. We wrote a grocery list at 9am. My sister called and told them she would bring it down, she was told that someone would come to get it. I went to some meetings and came backat 2pm, the list was never picked up. I called and was told we would still get our groceries the same day. Needless to say we got our groceries 2 days later with no explanation as to why items were missing. The hotel food is expensive and horrible. I spent $40 on a seafood pasta that I only ate 2 bites of. From that point on we cooked our own hamburgers and hotdogs. The establishment is so far away from everything a cab ride to the closest restaurants runs you about $20-$40 for a 15 minute ride. They have one club in the hotel. It is tiny and the music is not pleasant. This resort is designed for those who want to stay beside the pool and at the hotel 24/7. Once at the hotel you are stuck, because the closest city is San Juan and it an hour away(just imagine the price. If you are young and active this is not the place for you. If you are a food lover, this is not the place for you. On the last day, we were told to call someone to get our luggage 15 minutes before our departure time. The las casitas are not in good walking vicinity of the main hotel which means you need a bellman to help with your luggage. I called 1 hour and 15 minutes before our check out time. After waiting an hour we started lugging our luggage in the hot sun to the hotel. After about 5 minutes we were helped. We missed the main shuttle to the airport and had to plead to get on a secondary shuttle. The airport is an hour away, and we almost missed our flight because of their tardiness.

Once we arrived at the check in desk, we were told that it would be at least two hours before we could check in as it was check out time and rooms would need to be cleaned.

So while I ate my 40 lunch consisting of a cheeseburger and fries and kids chicken fingers I got enjoy looking at someone else's tomatoes and lettuce on the floor. Finally our room was ready. The accomodations at Las Olas appeared pleasant. However, as we were unpacking hair appeared on the floor near the refrigerator. (we were women and children traveling). The hair was also noted on the shower stall walls and on the bathroom floor. In addition , it was spotted in folded towels. I have never been so repulsed. Never once did we walk in our room our shower without shoes after that. Clearly, the room had not been vacuumed or cleaned after the last guest left. Not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Other complaints were the ambivalence of the staff. I would not say they were rude, basically they ignored or humored you. Called for more towels, and they never came. Asked where I could buy bandaids and was assured security would bring them right down and never came Finally the unclean pools and lack of policies at the pools needs improvement. We were swimming at the pool one evening when a guest allowed her infant to swim diaperless in the pool. No rules posted prohibiting this but we got out and did not return.

WYNDHAM BY REQUEST MEMBER- If you are planning on staying here, enroll in this program. It's free and you get to set some preferences on your room and get a complimentary snack and beverage at arrival. ARRIVAL FROM AIRPORT- The hotel provides a shuttle, we rented a car at the airport. It is very easy to get to the hotel and it is only about a 45 minute ride. You get there via a major road (rpute 3) with MANY shops and restauratns. It's a good opportunity to scope out the area for places to eat since it is very expensive to eat at the resort. CAR RENTAL- Highly recommend. Yes, expect to pay $10/day for self park or $15/day for valet (we did this) but the fact that you are able to got out to eat and get snacks at Walmart instead of eating at the resort makes up for the cost. ROOM- We were happy with our rooms. We reserved run of the house and so were a bit nervous about where we would be assigned. The Wyndham by request members benefit allows you to select the type of floor you want to stay in. We selected higher ground floor and so we got the top- floor #6 on the Vistas wing off the main lobby. Absolutely stunning! We had room #4627 overlooking the cliff,, palomino island, Las Casitas and the ocean. Wonderful breeze and breathtaking sunrises. My parents were accross from us in #4639, also breathtaking views of the golf course, mountains and El Yunque RAinforest, stunning sunsets and beautiful at night. The rooms were cleaner than when we stayed the first time. Pleasantly surprised with the size, separate toilet area, huge closet in bathroom, vanity and sink and tub. Our room had 2 double beds, with a table and desk and patio also with table overlooking the ocean. Room had snack bar and an additional refrigereator in the bathroom. THIS IS WHERE RENTING A CAR COMES IN HANDY! There is a Walmart and Walgreens about a 10 minute ride from the hotel. We stocked up on soda and snacks and packed them in our fridge. Prices are outrageous at the resort. If you are on a budget, recommend you go out on your own to eat and also sightseeing. SERVICE- Mixed emotions about this one. Very slow pace in Puerto Rico, prepare to wait! We called housekeeping for towels and have yet to get them. Expect to wait 5-15 minutes for valet. Keep in mind we went in September which is slow season. Called the concierge desk, phone rang and rang, no one ever answered. Tried to rent a movie, system was down and had to call the front desk after 3 attempts and about 10 minutes later we got through. Really, not efficient service. We arrived early and waited in line to check in- we were told to come back to get the keys which is fine but we had to wait in line again. Had some money to change and were told they could only change $50.00 for us. The Bell services is great, seems this is the only area in the hotel that is efficient and quick. Overall, everyone is pleasant. RESTAURANTS- Cafe Caribe is affordable and they are the only ones to offer authentic Puerto Rican food. Dinner for 3 including something to drink was $66.00 with the tip. David's Cookies is a good place to get snacks and coffee. Ordered room service on one day, delivery was pretty quick and the burger was very good. Paid $15.00 for a burger and fries. For breakfast, we did not want to pay $20/person for the buffet (we did last time and were dissapointed; flies on the food). So we went to David's and got a huge croissant, ham and cheese sandwich for $3.75, this was very reasonable for us. The rest of the time we went out to eat. Metropol Restaurant at the plaza offers great Cuban food. ANCHOR'S INN is a must- owner Pedro is a great guy. We go here whenever we stay in PR. To get here, leave the hotel and at the main entrance/exit take a left. Follow the road for about 1/2 a mile, Anchor's inn will be on your right side. The Camarones al Ajillo or shrimp scampi is very tasty. The best entree was the Chillo (Red Snapper) cooked to your liking, we had it fried. Remember, food is prepared fresh so there will be a wait. For breakfast there is also the local panaderias or bakeries. For $7.00 four of us bought, sandwiches a la plancha (ham and cheese on bread flattened on the grill; like panini), a loaf of bread and butter, 4 coffees and 2 juices. YOU WILL NOT GO HUNGY IN PR- there is food everywhere and vendors line up the streets. Luquillo Beach, right after El Yunque has the famous Kioskos (Kiosks that line up the beach). Here for $15.00 4 of us ate chicken on the grill, fried plantain, 2 empanadillas, green bananas, and drinks. PALOMINO- This is the hotels private island. We cold have stayed here all week. It is very relaxing and convenient. Only about a 25 minute boat ride from the hotel. There is a restaurant that offers food and drink. Lunch for 4 was $66 for chicken tenders, fish and 2 chicken sandwiches- very different from our lunch at Luquillo beach, A beer and 3 pina coladas totaled $26.00. Two years ago when we went we bought a cooler at Walmart and packed in drinks and snacks. The resort seems to be more money hungry and now prohibit coolers. We still packed snacks and warm soda and water in our back packs and asked for ice at the restaurant. BRING YOUR WATER/ROCK SHOES. Some of the beach areas are rocky. SIGHTSEEING- Do it on your own! We were shocked to see that the hotel charges about $65.00 for the El Yunque rainforest excursion. We went there for free. Just drive down route 3 for about 20-25 minutes and drive through the forest. We went to Viequez for a day. The ferry leaves the Fajardo marina which is about 10 minutes from the hotel at 9:30 (there are other schedules but if you want to spend time on the bech, you have to get there early in order not to miss the ferry back; the last one leaves Viequez at 6:00 pm). Tickets are only $2.00 per person, ferries are big with some areas airconditioned. Takes about 1 1/2 to get to Viequez. When you dock there will be taxies waiting for you. Ask for Fernando from El Ardillo Fast Driving. Nice guy with lots of knowledge of the island. Showed us 2 beaches so we could pick which one we wanted to stay in. We were pressed for time so we went to the only beach with public toilets and showers and a small snack bar. Fernando asked us for a pick up time and came and picked us up. We went to Sun Bay beach or as they know it SOMBE; half moon beach lined with palm trees and wild horses. WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE! The water is rougher than Luquillo and definately Palomino and get's deep only after a few feet so stay close to shore as there are no life guards and in our case, no one around. Viequez is very relaxing and the peopl are very laid back. Very small and everyone know each other. Economy is suffering because of the removal of the US Naval base. You can also get to Viequezs via a car Ferry that takes about 2 hours. ADVICE- If you can, check the internet for hours of operations on places you want to visit. Many places are closed on Monday and Tuesdays like Luquillo beach. Remember thought that unlike the US, all beaches in PR are public it's just a matter of whether you can get in. We went to Luqillo on Monday the gate was closed but we parked where the Kiosks are and just walked down the beach. Some places I tried calling nver answered there phones and some published schedules had changes. Just ask the locals.

However, seeing the look in my wife eyes as she enjoyed her dinner and fine wine was well worth the price. If you plan on eating at the better resturants be prepared to zip the numbers off your credit card. We spent $150 at the stingray and about $200 at Isabella's, including the tip. For those who do not like to spend money on pricey food I would suggest the Carribe Cafe next to the casino. They have great local food with the kind of prices you would pay at IHOP or a TGIFridays.

I just wanted to add my 2 cents as I have family that regularly stays in the Casitas area of the resort and let me in on some information that any new guests should know. First, this is no longer a Wyndham property it has been bought by a company called Blackstone (I am not familiar with them at all) and the resort is going through a major transition. Please keep this in mind when making your reservations. I made my reservations for this resort back in May as an American Express promotional; through the Wyndham reservations hotline and had a difficult time with Wyndham customer service once I checked into the resort. I had reserved an oceanview room and upon check in I had a lovely view of the tennis courts, also once the luggage was delivered to the room there was white paint on one of the pieces and to put the icing on the cake I did not get the Wyndham by request amenities in the room as promised. I tried to resolve these issues with the management of the hotel but I got a frustrating run around ultimately only being able to leave a voicemail to a generic voice mail box as the resort manager could not be found. Once I ran into the brick wall of no customer service or satisfaction - I called the Wyndham 800 number directly and receieved no help and I mean nothing! I was told since the resort had been transferred to new owners only 2 days prior to my arrival they would not be able to do anything for me. This made me extremely angry since this was not communicated to me at anytime prior to arrival to this resort. Wyndham gladly took my money for these reservations (I had to put down a 2 day deposit via my credit card) and kindly said I was SOL . I will never stay at another Wyndham property because of this - I will gladly put my money towards other chains in the future. Not to bore you with the details - it all eventually worked out once security got involved to help me with my problem with the paint on my suitcase. The security manager saw how upset I was (and I was also on the phone with American Express to try to stay at another hotel) moved me to an oceanview room and cleaned up my bag - thanks again Felipe! Once I actually got a manager I even got my Wyndham by Request amenities but this was a day later. I hope that the new owners will restore this property to the glory that it once was because this truly is a lovely location for a resort.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for wedding\u201d", "Author": "travelchica", "ReviewID": "UR3802084", "Content": "It was a great place for a wedding back in 2004. From recent reviews if appears that maybe things are going downhill. I had heard that another hotel management company bought it...not sure if that is contributing. We asked friends and family to join us for a vacation wedding week at the El Conquistador. Aside from the pains of planning a wedding from the states, the wedding part was wonderful. It is the best setting I have seen for a wedding in a tropical location (I could be a little biased!). It has a cliff-side with different levels, so we chose to get married on the lower level, near the ocean and then have our ceremony at the top cliff (not the very top...the Las Casitas Village is one more level up). There is a beautiful terrace that overlooks the pools, the hotel, down to the ocean from the terrace. And we were fortunate to have beautiful weather in June. I requested that the hotel arrange for all of our guest to stay together in the rooms in the Marina Level. I am glad we did as the rooms seemed to be in good shape. The rooms that are in newer buildings are a bit nicer than the rooms that are in the original Marina buildings. There is a pool that not too many people know about at that level with a drink bar. BallyHoos the outside bar/restaurant by the boats is also on the level, as is a seafood restaurant. (ok food). It is fun to take the funicular up and down to get to and from the Marina Level to the other levels. And the other bonus is that you are RIGHT there at the ferry which takes you to Palomina island for the beaches. THe other area that I would recommend, if not staying in the Marina village is Las Vistas wing...the wing that is closest to the Golden Door Spa, Golf course and Las Casitas. Of course, Las Casitas is nice but that is a different price range. I am attaching some photos of the hotel....a few thrown in there of the wedding.

Despite just some of the many issues we had with the hotel; rats in the hallways, cockroaches and gnats in the rooms, over-priced food, dirty swimming pools, strange aromas adrift in the hallways and rooms, the hour and a half wait for a ferry ride to the private island beach (the only beach nearby), the three hour $60 hotel shuttle ride from the airport to the \"resort\" (which rendered our suitcases and clothing wet), the $75 charge the hotel wanted to charge us to check out an hour late (even though they had a 50% occupancy at that point), our lost dry-cleaning (which was eventually found), and erroneous charges on the bill... The biggest concern is that the staff is, for the most part, extremely rude, shows no urgency to meet your needs, and is very inconsistent in what they tell you. A few examples: The main ATM the hotel has is in the lobby. A few folks from our party had tried to use the ATM but it was not dispensing any cash. They had asked the front desk if something was wrong with it, but got no response. After a few more tries they gave up. A day later, one of the people in our party was checking their bank account, and $500 was shown as being withdrawn at the ATM. Other folks checked and sure enough money was missing from their account as well. When folks approached the hotel front desk about this concern they were told that it wasn't their issue and it had to be addressed directly with the bank. We had taken a Dive Trip on the second day we arrived. We had a great time and three other folks in our party were convinced to take the Resort Certification and do a dive trip with the resort Dive Shop a few days later. One of the dive masters, which we hadn't had on the trip before, was completely rude, sarcastic, and impatient with the new divers, which is undoubtedly a dangerous situation. When these folks had submerged below water, things got much worse to the point that one of the people we were with had decided not to take the second dive. They were ignored and at some points felt in danger. Besides this, at one point, there was a child snorkeling without a life vest who had gone a ways to far who was having trouble breathing. Since our dive master was too busy doing her own thing, one of the people in our party had to swim out to get this child. We had called to inquire on the time the airport shuttle left the hotel for the aiport on our way home. We were told that there was a shuttle every 20 minutes. When we arrived to the lobby, we were surprised to learn that the shuttle actually leaves every hour, which put us in jeopardy of missing our flight. When I had told the person at the front desk that I was told every 20 minutes, she was very confrontative and combatitive about who I had asked and that no one would tell me that at the hotel. The issues don't stop at the trip. Good luck calling to get another copy of your detailed bill. When we called in for this invoice, we were put on hold for at least 30 minutes because no one wanted to help us with this. We had to call in again and were promised the bill within 10 minutes, to which we have yet to receive. Again, if you have heard the El Conquistador is the way to go, don't do it!

Sometimes it took 15 minutes to get the funicula back to the main hotel. It also took awhile to get to the beach- funicula ride plus water taxi that only runs every half hour. The beach is beautiful but the bottom is rocky in parts. Service is relaxed to say the least. We frequently had to ask multiple times to get things but on the other hand you can sit in the casino bar and watch the Yankee game and no one will hassle you to buy drinks.

We went as an incentive trip for my company and everyone enjoyed themselves for the most part. Food was expensive and service was slow some times but the food was good and filled you up.

If you couldn't get an umbrella there were definitely plenty of trees to lay under for shade and all the chairs were comfortable.

As always the energy is great during the night, the water and pools were great. I would certainly go agin, any time. The only complaint i had was that each day during our trip when we went ot hte pool, we heard most people speaking in Spanish, while at first i thought nothing of it, i later discoverd that there must have been a special of the year as the place was filled with locals, and the pool was crowded that at 10:00 am you were lucky to get a place to settle. During our stay our sink started to leak, we called the engineer and they came to fix it right away. The weather was sposse to be crappy, but we took a chance, and the weather was absolutly great!!! we could not ask for better. All in all, we had a mega good time, and we look forward going again soon. A few tips. 1. take the furnicular down to the middle level, over there you do not have to give a card to get a towel rather there are towels laid out on every seat. Also, it is cleaner and quieter. the pool is very nice, and you can even go into the gym/fitness room [that was just moved there from the top floor] and get some ice cold wet washcloths sitting in the fridge, for an instant cool off. 2. get a room that overlooks the ocean, and NOT the golf course, the extra money is well worth it. [for the sea breaze alone.] 3. bring a darn good camera. 4. bring a mini cooler. We brought a mini cooler, filled it up with cold soda beer, and snacks, and took it for the day trip to the palamino island. At first they gave us beef they wanted us to leave it behind, so that we should buy expensive hotel drinks, at the island. I talked may way into bringing the cooler on onto the island thus enabling me to have what i need without haveing to keep buying drinkds from the hotel just to stay hydrated. Our first day there we took our rented car to the main road[ 7 minutes frin the hotel, ] and went to the super market, called pueblo x, and got everything as if we were in a normal ameriacan store. As we bought, wine, juice, soda, bread, the most delicias fruits, the mangos were honey. We empteed our mini bar and put in our drinks instead. obviousy the prices are much better when you buy it localy at the supermarket, instead of buying it form the hotel. [in case you were never in puerto rico, i must tell you, that driving down the highway you would think you are in any american city, walmarts walgreens, sams clubs, to name a few.] makes it easy in the event that you want to take a $5 taxi from the hotel into town. Again before the first time i went to the el con, most people told us, dont go, it is far out, and it takes 40 minutes to get there. Do not listen to them as once you get to the hotel, you have no reason to leave, on the contrary, you hope to never have to leave. [keeping in mind that this hotel was originaly built as a grand hare krishna ashram.] this place is really heaven on earth. Also, you wa much closer to the el yunke rain forest [only 15 minutes by car] then if you stayed in San Juan. My last peice of advice is that if you want ot rent a car, call a local company called L & M they have no fril cars for no frill prices, yet all the cars are new and clean, and the prices are $24.00 a day, not only are they nice it is my second time using them and never had a problem. if you would like more about my trip and need some more tips feel free to contact me at; mholtzberg@hpnyc.com PS. as we keep Kosher we were able to find kosher food both in the supermarket, as well as being able to pre-order kosher food for shabbat, at chabadpuertorico --> tourist information link.", "Date": "July 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cDissapointment\u201d", "Author": "jujubeez", "ReviewID": "UR3699167", "Content": "We checked in on May 11th, and left on the 14th.

If you want to be adventurous and try some local flavor outside the resort then they charge $20 each way in a cab company that they own, oh yeah the ride is only about 4 minutes each way too. The beach is cool the first time you go there, but after that it is a pain to have a 15 minute boat ride to and from with screaming foriegn kids. Also, the town of Fajardo is not the safest town either. My wife I walekd down to a public pier and felt very unsafe. I would warn you to look elsewhere on the island.

The van left a little past 1:30. This is the damper of our vacation: we arrived at the hotel at 3:45. We were registered as Wyndham by Request members, which can be done on the internet and I highly recommend doing so. At the hotel check in for members we were met by an extremely unfriendly, cold employee and were instructed to return at 4:00 when our room would be ready. We had requested a garden view. At 4:15 we returned and the room was not ready yet. Some helpful gentleman helped us out and called up. We got to our room and I was upset to see a view of the golf course and tennis court and found the room not meeting our expectations in cleanliness. My wife returned to the front desk (not the same employee as before), and requested an upgrade and the cost for an oceanview. We were upgraded to the Club floor facing Palomino Island complimentary since we were Wynhdam By Request Members. This was quite an improvement. By the time we got our luggage and resettled it was 5:35. We started out from Newark at 8:40. I could have been in Europe. The hotels architecture is beautiful, with choices in pools, and Palomino Island was a short ferry ride away which we loved.wherethe food there was the best and most reasonably priced. Palomino Island has beautiful turquoise waters, very shallow with some coral and ok snorkeling. If you have kids bring water shoes. Also, while snorkeling I found a few sea urchins on the reefs so be careful. The hotel food was very expensive.(Blossoms was very good and you can get a pizza by the pool bar which is open for dinner). I found the dining much more expensive in comparison to NYC which I frequent quite often. The hotel was very clean in the lobby etc. Everyone we met felt room cleanliness(bathrooms) was a bit of a problem, we certainly did. The staff was very helpful and sweet when approached with questions. We have traveled to almost all of the Caribbean and stayed at the Hyatt Dorado last visit to Puerto Rico in 1990. All in all this was a restful vacation at a beautiful hotel. Unfortunately, the long trip to the hotel and leaving early for our return trip to the airport (it was only 1:15 min) created a lost day. They are supposed to be building a new highway this September which should shorten the 35 mile trip considerably. By the way, there were conventions going on while we were there and one of the pools closed down at 3:00 and we were requested to go to another pool and Palomino Island had a function one day and we were asked to leave by 4:30 instead of 5:30. This was quite disappointing since I enjoyed every minute there. I doubt I would return to this hotel for vacation, but think it might be more enjoyable for families. P.S.

They checked us in and the bellman came to take our luggage to the room. We went down the funicular and went into the Las Olas Village. While walking through to halls, I noticed it was quite dirty with dust and bits of paper all over. The bellman opened our guestroom door and we walked in. In the middle of the room there was a huge red stain on the carpet. (It looked like someone spilled a pitcher of Hawaiian punch on the carpet and let it dry). The toilet had tissue paper sitting in the bottom of the bowl; there was long black hair all over the bathroom floor. We opened up the curtains and about 15 feet from our window was the pool. (Not to mention the first site we saw was a big fat hairy backed man jumping in the pool) There was dust on the furniture. I picked up the phone to ask if there was another room they could move us to and there was a \"curly black hair\" stuck to the phone. The phone didn't even have a dial tone. We finally got a hold of the front desk to see if there was another room available. After a few minutes of describing the condition of the room, they moved us up to a room in the grand hotel level. Everything else was good in terms of the room and service. My friend and I went to the beach (which is a 25 min ferry ride) or the pool each day and had fabulous weather. There were a lot of kids running around everywhere. Not a really relaxing environment, but I guess good for families. We ate in the restaurants for each meal but were not over indulgent, at the end of the 6 nights the bill on the room was close to $1200.00 just for food and drinks. It was really over priced, however, the service in the restaurants was good. The last night my friend and I ate at the French restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Le Bistro\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Everything you could possibly want is located right on the property, so there is no need to leave. Even though it was a holiday weekend and the hotel was fully booked, it did not seem crowded at all. The service was excellent. The staff went out of their way to greet us with a smile and catered to our every need. There are many wonderful restaurants at the resort. Blossoms (a Teppanyaki Grill) was our favorite, and the Stingray Cafe was a very close runner-up. Meals were on the pricey-side, but definitely worth it. The preparations were fresh, creative, and delicious! They featured many local ingredients. Palomino Island, the El Conquistador's private beach is just a water taxi ride away. The taxis ran frequently and there were shops, a restaurant and bar located on the island. There were plenty of beach chairs, umbrellas, and water activities/sports for guests to enjoy. The spa was fabulous! Try the Golden Door's signature massage. The menu of spa treatments is endless! A very classy operation. Try your luck at the casino located near the lobby of the main hotel. During the evenings live Salsa and Merengue bands were featured in the lobby adjacent to the casino and many guests danced the night away! Go for the Romance Package which includes champagne and fresh tropical fruits upon arrival, a complementary breakfast buffet at Las Brisas every morning (the best breakfast we've ever had), dinner for two at Isabella's, a spa treatment, and free golf on a beautiful course. The setting at Isabella's was beautiful and although the food was good, it was similar to many other steak houses we have been to elsewhere. Try the other restaurants instead for a more unique dining experience. The only sore point was the long shuttle ride to and from the airport. The El Conquistador staff made every effort to make the trip a pleasant one by providing cold drinks and friendly service. This was not a big deal given all of the positive aspects of our trip. We cannot wait to return as this paradise has become a family favorite! You must visit there!

Breakfast was sub-par pretty much everywhere, but Isabella's Steakhouse and the Mexican Restaurant at Las Olas were fantastic. We ordered an appetizer of Nachos at the mexican restaurant and ended up cancelling our dinner, there was so much food! One thing that's very annoying is that you cannot use cash at most of the resort, or on the beach, so everything has to be charged to your room.

Some are friendlier than others, but you will find that anywhere! The grounds and views are truly lovely and it is way worth a second visit. Maybe next time the sun will actually be out!

I must admit that after booking my stay, I read negative reviews on Tripadviser, Frommers and Foders- they all said about the same thing- bad service, bad and overpriced food, Holiday Inn or lower sleeping rooms. I wanted to cancel my hotel and find another but I would have lost money so I decided to hang in there. The travel agent called hotel to alert them to my concerns and I also called- gave them my Wyndham By Request # and expressed my concerns. They reassured me that all would be well and told my travel agent I would be upgraded to an ocean-view room. Expecting the worse, I was pleasantly surprised by the nice folks that greeting me when I arrived from the airport. The ride to the hotel was long, but I was warned of that by other travelers who wrote reviews. We rode through very depressed areas- that was an incentive for me to stay on hotel property. When I arrived on Friday afternoon, there were no long lines at check-in and everything went smoothly. The property is absolutely gorgeous (exterior). The views are spectacular. The ocean view from room was a dream. The room itself was very average- or for a resort, below average (I stayed in Las Brisas off main bldg). Mattress was soft and bedspreads, clean but cheap. (rooms look just like the plain, dated rooms on the Internet). At least the room was clean and I did not have any of the problems the others experienced (mildew/dirty carpet, etc.). Tub required a step down. Would not have been good for an elderly person. Food is pricey! I had 1 very good meal at Stingray (Tuna). They kindly substituted potatoes for spinach. Fresh, hot and good. $30. Meals at other restaurants were not much of a value, but to catch a cab to other local restaurants when I was traveling alone did not seem like a good idea. Went to Cantina (horrible chicken fajitas- $22!!), Blossoms (avg Chinese food- very fresh vegetable soup), Belle Vista- (mediterrean salad was good, but skimpy on feta and olives)- later I learned the brick-oven pizzas were a hit)- Had Eggbeaters at Caribe Cafe- okay. The best thing to do is to bring your own food for in between-- if you are bringing kids and not on the kids eat free family getaway plan, you should bring your own snacks. If you forget- they are cheaper in the airport than they are in the hotel! I saw folks bringing their own food- sandwhich meat, bread, junk food, boxed juices, etc. like they were going on a picnic or going camping. (-: All rooms have refrigerators. On the drive from the airport to hotel there is a Walmart and Walgreens- if you are driving- it is worth a stop for last minute needs. Fitness Ctr in Las Olas was nice and clean. Fresh towels and water cooler- nice view of the ocean while on cardio equip. Also has \"Life Circuit\" weight centers. More equip is at the Golden Door Spa, but for $20 and no view, I thought Las Olas was just fine. You will do alot of walking- most resorts are spread out- it is just that since this is on a cliff, you cannot ride a golf cart up and down the steep hill! The funiculars were clean and operated well unlike what some previous reviewers experienced. The 5-star neighboring Las Casitas is lovely. The Infinity pool is not as large as photos make it seem, but absolutely gorgeous and worth a walk or golf cart ride over there. The pools were all nice and well-maintained. Everyone in the hotel were so friendly and helpful. Ran into one lady with a bad attitude at Caribe Cafe. I asked for oatmeal with no sugar and of course when I got it she told me it was pre-mixed- with what I wondered- and sure enough it had sugar. She had an attitude about taking it back, though she said, \"no problem\" her tone was different. Otherwise, every single staff person I ran into was really nice! Palamino Island was nice- I found a chaise with no problem- did some kayaking- that was fun. The beach was beautiful and crystal clear (though not as large as I imagined, but very sufficient) Very casual resort. Night life sorta lacking outside of the casino. Maybe if there is a big group in town, the dance floor gets jumping, but it never jumped any of the nights I was there unless that happened after midnight. I guess I stayed at a good time- all was well. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. I had a very nice experience. If I had paid top dollar, I would have been disappointed- I am very particular about bedding. But haven gotten a really great deal and knowing that it was not the Ritz, I was overall pleasantly surprised and pleased. Last note- the Gen. Mgr has made himself very accessible so if you have any problems, you should contact him immediately.

I have two sons ages 12 and 8. We've been to Disney twice (stayed at the Polynesian) and Atlantis in the Bahamas last year - all large, family resorts. The place did not seem to be too crowded. The only day we had trouble getting into a better restaurant without a reservation was on the weekend. We paid $260 a night, which I thought was a good price. The kids meals were free if they ate off the children's menu, we had 2 for one watersports, and we could use the fitness cetner at the spa for free - Family Getaways - By Request. I think opinions posted are often based on how crowded the place is at the time and how much you pay for a room. Some of the rooms are worn (ours was). We could have asked for an free upgrade the next day (the day we checked in was full) because we are Wyndham By Request members but we stayed because the location was convenient (we were in Las Vistas) - close to the Main Lobby and restaurants and the view of the golf course and harbor in the distance was beautiful. We were also away from the noisy pools. Most of the staff were wonderful, a few were not (mostly on the island). The food was actually pretty good, but you won't be wowed. We had a light breakfast at David's every morning, juice, tea, bagels, pastires. We had most lunches at the resort on the island at Iguana's, the only place to eat there. Lunch adds up since everything on the menu is around $12 + $3 for a soda or $8 for a tropical drink. They do have a kid's menu at most places but they don't automatically bring it (grilled cheese, PBJ's, chicken fingers, all about $5). Ask for it. I think we spent the most money on the island because we kept getting ice waters and drinks. We ate at Stingrays which was good, La Cantina, very basic Mexcican food but the kids liked it since they were starving at got chips and salsa right away. Otello's was good but the Japanese grill and sushi were very good. These meals were much less expensive than Atlantis and there were many other more casual places to eat during the evening at this resort (burgers, pizza,...) Some folks bring over little cooler (hidden in their bags) with water or their own rum and mix. We just decided we were on vacation and didn't want to work too hard. Do ask for a couple of cups of ice with your bottled water because it gets warm so fast. The kids loved the private island. We kayaked to the smaller island near by and had it all to ourselves. The water was warm and crystal clear. We saw stingrays on our ride over. They jet skied with their dad and rented floats. They also enoyed seeing the large iguanas which were in the little field right behind the restaurant. If we didn't have the kids, we would have gone to the quiet beaches on the otehr side of the island. One of their highlights was seeing the Ba Ha Men perform for the Nextel group on the beach- even though we weren't part of that group. The Ba Ha men were great and signed autographs after the show. They also enjoyed the pool with the water slide, filled with children, loud, with music playing. I just got a pina coldada and read my book. Go to Las Olas or the Marina Pool which are basically empty if you want a quieter area. The grounds of the resort and views are beautiful. We enjoyed Old San Juan (rented a car) and El Yunque rain forest (about 15 minute drive away). Take the Las Minas trail to the waterfall in the rain forest and wear sneakers and bathing suits under your clothes. Many people take a dip into the pools near the falls. Don't pay any attention to the weather forecast on the internet. Yes, they predicted rain for every day of our trip. But it was sunny most of the day and we would get showers in the evening. Or it would be raining at the main hotel but the island would be beautiful and sunny (its only a 15 minute boat ride). We really loved Puerto Rico and hope you have a nice trip.

I am a 30 year old software sales executive from the New England area and travel very frequently on both business and pleaseure with my wife. We have been to places such as: Hyatt Kauai, Las Ventanas in Cabo San Lucas, various Ritz Carlton/Four Seasons, Sandals Negril, and now El Conquistador in Puerto Rico. In a nutshell, VERY disappointed. I will never return, nor recommend this resort to anyone. The hotel is dirty, not kept up, very expensive, poor service, and rude, apathetic employees. The two positives on El Conquistador is the private island has a beautiful beach/water and the rooms are large. I have have stayed in some of the best resorts in the world and have no problem paying top dollar for excellent quality and service. El COnquistador did not have either. Occasionally, we would encounter a waiter here or there that were far superior to the rest, but that was rare. Here are some of our experiances, and you can judge for yourselves: * It rained alot at night, and the hallways and elevators were flooded * 2 Days later, the stagnenet water from the flooding rains were still there and not cleaned up * The elevators and tram service to the main hotel frequently broke down, or were \"Under Repair\" as they called it * The water taxi was broken down on one of our days, so us and about 100 aother people had to wait 1 hour in line while they shuttled people 30 at a time on a much smaller boat. * We paid $250 for dinner one night at Le Bistro. Had to send back my steak, it was still mooing it was so raw. The service was horrible. They automatically add in 20% tip, so they don't care about working hard for their tip, they already are guarenteed 20%. The waiter sneezed over our table, walked in and out of the room laughing hysterically from some joke another waiter just told. - For a $250 meal, we should not have to have the service equivillant to Denny's. * One night our electronic door swipe reader (the key to get into the room) broke. It \"ran out of batteries\". We called MANY times and the manager waz rude. She made it seem to be my fault that the door reader was not working. My wife and I had to wait 1 hour in the hallway for them to send security to replace the batteries so it would work and let us into our room. - Did I mention, while we were waiting 1 hour, it was a tropical downpoour the whole time. When I spoke to the manager she gave me an attitude. I spoke with her manager and she was nice enough to waive our $110 transfer fee to/from the airport. * I'm in sales, so I am used to it, but there are about 3 \"President's Club\" sales trips going on at any given day. Corporate events are always going on where you will have hundreds of people from various companies all over the place. * Our room (in the Marina section) was nice, however, it had an ajoining door to the next room, which you could hear the people next door. Not a problem, until the locals checked in. The hotel offers local Puerto Ricans discounted rates to the hotel and many locals will check in on the weekend. - Our neighbors consisted of about eight people ranging from ages 25 and under. They partied all night, were very loud yelling in Spanish, and playing Spanish Music all night. They partied until 3am. We didn't call security because we shared an end unit with them and if security came, they would know it was us and we wanted to avoid any confrontations with the locals. * Can of Coors Lite = $5.50 * Mixed Drink= $8 - $10 Sorry for the bad review. If I had a great experiance, I'd post that too. I just wanted to let people know because I look to this site for advice when looking to book a vacation. If you haven't booked it yet, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else other that El Conquistador.

I was EXTREMELY nervous about this resort due to the many, upon many negative reviews, but felt that I was going to just go down with a positive attitude and come what may........The resort's views are breathtaking!!!! I live in southern Florida where it is pretty much paradise all the time, but I found myself just standing at a balcony just taking in the view for hours!!!!! It is really unimaginable how beautiful it is..... We traveled the back roads to the resort from the airport since it was rush traffic, and i have never seen such poverty and filth in my life on the island of Puerto Rico!!! Me and my partner agreed we were not going to venture out much outside the resort, but the complaints that it took a long time from the airport to the resort, I think is just people not patient and not willing to just sit back and relax...... Check-in was easy and the bellmen were right there waiting to help us to our room with our baggage. Now, being with a large group, I guess i cannot say if the treatment would have been the same. But honestly, I observed and watched everyone getting the same treatment! AGain, we were with a large group and pretty much had everything paid for.. But, we saw the receipts of some of the meals, etc. and it was absolutely outrageous. Breakfast buffet for two was $50; way too expensive!! Prices are outrageous! WE usually just split the meals that we were responsible for, but be prepared to show the cash!! The staff overall was very nice but I can see where people could partake them as being rude. We did have a few that we just shook our heads at but the ones that were nice and helpful went out of their way for us....But honestly in general, I believe that was the general attitude on the whole island.. The people even at the airport in San Juan were not very helpful and the language barrier can be very difficult if you do not know where you are going...and just as it can be here, money talks and if you are willing to tip for good service, we usually got it 99% of the time.... NOw some positives that I disagree with in some of the reviews, one night we had a major company party at the bottom of the cliff, so you are talking couple of hundred people needing to get to the bottom and it could not have gone any smoother. About 30 people can go in one car, and both cars were running and it went very smoothly. I have to disagree with people that the furnicular is such a hike. Remember, you are on the side of a cliff, so how do you expect to get from one level to another? If you are going to complain then stay home....The boat to the island was beautiful and again went smooth!!! I really cannot understand what people are complaining about. The view is breathtaking!!! Just sit back and relax. You are supposed to be on vacation! It took no longer than 15 minutes, which is really not long at all and the pictures you can get are worth it....The Palomino island was beautiful. We never encountered one rude person the several times we went over there. Everyone was gracious and helpful and whatever towels we needed, we were provided them.... Same at the hotel. Maid service was right on and gave us everything we needed....OUr room and bathroom were clean. Yes, it was worn some, but this is not New York! OUr only discomfort was the air conditioning in the room, which i heard several people complaining of. The rooms would not get cool and when you come in from being out at the pool or beach, you want some cool air!!!! But, they offered to change our room and we declined. I really think that this resort on a cliff and in the climate it is in just has problems with the temperature, but that is just my opinion. It was not unbearable though. we just kept the heavy curtains closed during the day when we were gone to keep the sun out... THe casino was great! We won at Blackjack most of the time. Everyone was having a great time. On friday night, the place was packed and tables were cheering and it was a general good feeling of people having fun! No, it is not Las Vegas big, but it was a blast! They also had a big salsa type Latin band in the hotel playing in the lobby right outside the casino on Friday and SAturday night. Everyone kind of gathered around and danced. The atmosphere was very fun and festive! The pool area was fantastic. Staff friendly. Pool was clean and towels were right there, all you had to do was go to the towel stand and check them out. I really just could not imagine why people were complaining of that.. It was very simple!!! The spa!! Oh my gosh! I again cannot understand what people were talking about. They were right on. I got a locker and the girl attending the showers was right there putting in fresh towels and you could get shower shoes and then sit in the tea room or just sit around and relax in your robe and read. It was very, very clean..... I inspected very closely let me tell you.... It was heaven!!!!! The girl who gave my massage was waiting for me when i got out of the shower and the massage was one of the best i have received. She was very professional and it was soo relaxing. But again, the price was high; $120 for a 50 minute massage.. This is a very honest opinion. I wanted to lay it out there because I know how i felt wondering....You need to remember you are not in Las Vegas or New York, and the resort shows that but it was still very clean and we had a great time. Just be prepared to shell out the cash. If you are on a tight budget, I would say this resort is not for you......I would be very nervous with little ones. There are too many stairs and pools and things for them to get hurt on and a stroller can be more work than actually being easy......If you decide to go, Relax and enjoy.

Although there were lovely things about this resort, I literally kissed the ground when we got back home. I don't want to repeat what others have written, I'll just \"ditto\" the slow service, mediocre food comments. I have a few additional problems to report that haven't been mentioned as far as I've read. First let me say that this website was extremely helpful to me in planning for this trip. I was able to really prepare and didn't feel lost when I got to the resort. Okay, first of all I am not a cheapskate. I am willing to pay for high quality service and goods. I had sticker shock at every turn in this place: $11.00 for two scrambled eggs with an unmelted slice of american cheese, $4.00 for a snack-size bag of goldfish crackers. I've always scoffed at people who do this, but I wish I had checked a suitcase full of snacks. Palomino Island was nice, but if you have kids with motion sickness, give them dramamine before the water taxi. This next issue is really important. We had adjoining rooms in Las Brisas, with ocean views. We had our adjoining doors open the whole time. If the balcony door was open and someone came in the room's main door, the vacuum effect from the ocean breeze would slam the adjoining doors shut. I was caught by the door the first time this happened and I couldn't physically hold the door back from slamming on me, the force was so great. The next time it happened I was holding my baby in my arms, but I turned in time so I took the brunt of the hit. The next time, our 4 year old son got hit in the head, and went flying into the opposite wall. We called the front desk saying we wanted a doctor and they questioned us about whether we would be willing to pay for a doctor and did we know it would take 45 minutes for a doctor to arrive? If we wanted a doctor to call it would take just as long, but would cost $50.00. Unable to get past the billing process, we hung up and said we'd figure it out for ourselves. Someone from the Hotel came to check on us, he barely spoke English and used sign language to communicate with our son. He kept saying the hospital is 5 minutes away (we were so confused!). He left and we continued to monitor our son who recovered nicely and was left with only bruising on either side of his head. This left us feeling extremely vulnerable. We moved heavy furniture in front of the adjoining doors. The door design is really poor and they should at least post warnings about the \"vacuum effect\". Beware the gift shops! My husband touched a large wooden cat on a shelf in \"The Conversation Piece\" and the whole thing fell and several items broke. The two ladies working there got very upset, switching back and forth from English to Spanish. The instant this happened we said we would pay for anything that was broken, but they were still really mad and rude to us. They spread glue all over the broken things until I told them to stop. I had to say, \"I am buying these, they are mine now and I don't want you to try to fix them\". Before this happened we had already purchased two souvenirs worth over $100, so it's not like we were looky-loos or something. Overall, I wish we had saved the time and money and gone to a mainland resort.

Our check-in was marred by a double booking of our reservation, and it took hours to straighten this out. However, to the credit of the hotel, the manager did offer us compensation for the delay we were subjected to. We went as a family of five with 3 single, adult daughters. Everyone had a wonderful time. The girls loved the spa and its treatments, and enjoyed their classes there. My husband loved the pool, and swimming laps. I loved the boat ride daily to Palomino Island. I never had a problem finding a chair on the island, nor did I have any difficulty getting drinks or food brought to me on the beach from the Palomino restaurant. We all enjoyed our meals there. Our favorite restaurant in the hotel proper was definitely Blossoms, in the table section in the rear. The manager there was very friendly and accommodating. Restaurants in the hotel are pricey, but that was to be expected. The kayak trip was great fun, and we had our own adventure when we took a small plane to Culebra to satisfy our daughter's desire for exploration. It was a great day, but for me, Palomino Island was so lovely, there was really no need to go to Culebra. One of the best tips I have is to register for the VIP Club room. This made it very easy to eat and relax and not have to go to a restaurant first thing in the morning. The staff here could not have been nicer or more accommodating. It was great to have computer access in the VIP lounge and to watch large screen TV, use the library, and help yourself to refreshments throughout the day, in addition to the hors d'oeurves and appetizers in the evening. Our room was in Las Brisas, oceanfront, and the view was magnificent. The rooms need refurbishing and decorating, but they were always clean and the maid service was attentive and considerate. Everyone I met through the 8 days I was there was helpful and kind and friendly. My only regret was that there was really no nightlife available for my single daughters. The supposed nightclub/disco/bar was empty every night. And it really is too far to go into San Juan for the evening. But, we had such full days, that really the lack of nightlife was not a major problem. The grounds were spectacular. The flowers, the water views, the public areas were all beautiful, and the best part of our stay here was just the sheer physical beauty of this spot. The weather was perfect the whole time. We stayed at the Hyatt Dorado Beach last year, and that was lovely, too, but more understated, and quieter. The rooms there were also in need of refurbishing. But, overall, I would say that the El Conquistador provides a memorable vacation, and I would highly recommend it. Tip: Become a Wyndham by Request member and get take advantage of any special deals they offer, e.g. stay 3 nights, get the 4th night free. If you don't want to join the VIP lounge option, then stay in the Marina, in a higher floor, in the area facing the Marina pool. This is a pretty, peaceful, serene area, which allows you to go to the beach daily without taking the funicular.", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNever come here!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3352932", "Content": "We went to this motel (yes motel) on business in April - three words - the staff suxs!!

My partner was part of a rewards/recognition trip for a world-wide organization. We have traveled extensively and have been fortunate enough to be able to stay at the top brands including Four Seasons, Rosewood, Mandarin Oriental and Ritz Carlton so this will give you the basis for my review (see my reviews at those properties). The property is positioned on the top of a cliff with the most amazing views of where the Atlantic meets the Carribean Sea. It is quite dramatic with very lush and beautiful grounds. The facility is huge, megaresort as mentioned in a previous review, with many different \"villages\" based on the location of the rooms with many activities for families to enjoy. All are centered around their own pools and are either at the top of the bluff, mid-way down the bluff or at sea level. We stayed in the Marina Village by the water. For a 3 star property is was very nice with some interesting pieces of artwork all trying to give you a sense of Spanish Colonial. Overall nice, but it was in the details which limits the quality of the hotel. The facility was a bit worn with small things like paint chipping, cracks in the corners, stains in the carpets and rugs and things which were not quite pristine, which you would never find a 5 star property. As for the room, it was large with a nice size bathroom and a beautiful view of the marina and ocean. If you are on the ground floor, you will have people looking in as you front the major walkway which overlooks the marina. The sheets were stained, the bathroom only had one sink and although the furniture was tired, it was comfortable. I found the service to be good especially considering the massive size of our group, but could see that if you weren't part of the group, it could be problematic and slow. The only real incident I had was with dry cleaning which after 48 hours never made it to the dry cleaning and had to be sent back unfinished as I had to leave the following day. The spa treatments were wonderful, facial and massage, but again the facility itself was not quite top notch. For example there was carpeting in the men's locker room and waiting area which I found a bit unsanitary. The showers did not seem quite clean and the treatment rooms did not give you that sense of cleanliness you would want in that setting. The staff were very polite but it was a bit nerve-wracking in that they did not instill a sense of calm in the facility. For example, the staff would yell to each other from the 3 floors of the lobby rather than call or come down to each other. I found this to break the sense of serenity a spa should be instilling. The restaurants and bars were nice but average. I particularly enjoyed the Ballyhoo bar and grill located in the Marina Village. The outdoor setting by the water was wonderful, the staff attentive, the drinks potent but the food avergage. We ddid not have a chance to try room service so I can't comment on that. We did venture to the Island for the beach but for a private party. What I saw was quite pretty and the boat ride itself was nice. It gave you a nice perspective to look back at Puerto Rico. All in all, if you have a family to entertain and are looking for a 3 star property you will not be disappointed.

We were very disappointed to find that we were in the Las Vistas wing on the first floor on the other side of the resort. For the price, the rooms should be beautiful, but they are tired and need redecorating. The patio was filthy, the table chipped and dirty, and there was only one chair out there. The same was true of our daughter's room. There was very little privacy, as the tennis courts were right outside our doors. When I talked to the young women at Wyndham By Request about a different room, she basically laughed at me. Apparently, the hotel was very overbooked for Easter weekend. Which caused many of the problems we had. The funicular kept breaking down, We had to wait in line to get on the boat for the beach---in fact, on Saturday, it took my daughter and me a full hour to get from our room to the beach. From Friday through Monday morning, I made sure to get up very early, skip breakfast with my husband, and get on the earliest boat to Palomino Island in an effort to secure chairs and towels for my family. On Friday, they stopped bringing people over because the island was over-ful, and on Saturday, an announcement was made at around 1:00 that they would continue bringing people over to the island, but that there were no chairs left. The main three pools on the lobby level were also extremely crowded, and looked dirty. I would not set foot in them. We did have one delightful day at the pool on the middle level---but the bar service there was awful---there was no wait staff to accomodate us. I waited at that bar for more than ten minutes to get drinks---there was only one girl working the bar. The drinks were extremely expensive and contained not nearly a full shot of alcohol. Since there was not enough wait staff available, my daughters went to various dining establishments to eat lunch---and routinely waited for an hour for service. The same was true at Palomino Island. The food at the restaurants was always good, but not good enough to warrant the prices. My husband and oldest daughter had to go home on Tuesday, and I moved into room 4041 with my two younger daughters until we left on Friday. My husband left very disappointed in his vacation.

We requested another room and reluctantly were given one in the same section but overlooking the golf course. It was much bigger and had a large patio and the moldy smell was not there. The two main concerns we had with this resort was the service (or lack of) and pricey food, regardless of which restaurant you went to.

One and then both funiculars broke down over the time we were there and the staff made little or no effort communicate this to us or provide alternate transportation until repeatedly asked. It took us an hour to get from our room to the restaurant for our dinner reservation that evening. We felt as if we were a nuisance in this situation and many others.

It is true that you are held captive there as to get to a grocery/liquor store is $30 return by taxi.

The trip took approximately 1 hour 15 mins, and there were no problems. Upon arrival, because we signed up for Wyndham by request online, we walked right up to the desk and were checked in right away. Everyone else on the bus had to wait in a long line. We paid for a sunset room, and we were upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View room in Las Brisas wing. The room was extremely clean, spacious, and the view was breathtaking. Palomino Island was very nice, and boat ride over was fun. We went to the beaches on the other side of the beach area the first day (Not the Nude beach), and we were all alone until about 1:00. Beautiful views, and we didn't have to worry about kids kicking sand on us. The only improvement I would like to see them make would be to clean the water up a bit. There is very little swimmable beach b/c of coral and seaweed. The pools and hot tubs were great, and happy hour at the main pool was welcomed on our end (5-6 pm). There is something about a 3 dollar Dacquiri that makes it taste better than an 8 dollar one! We really felt that service at this resort was wonderful. Everyone was so nice and accommodating to us. I am shocked to see some of the other reviews on here, and how other people felt about the service. My feeling is that you get what you give. If you want people to be nice to you, be nice to them.

(We packed a couple 12 packs of pop in our suitcases and saved lots of money!) We brought our own drinks over to Palomino Island and no one ever said anything. 2. Bring some snacks. 3. Split meals. (Most of the restaurants serve a big enough portion that you can split an entree) 4. Use the Free fitness center at Las Olas. (You have to pay $25 to use the fitness center at Golden door spa, and it's not much better) 5. Massage your significant other!! ($150 in the spa!) I know I'm too cheap! 6. Rent a car. We did not but several people did, and were able to save a ton of money. 7. Eat pastries from David's cookies for breakfast. The buffet is $22, and a pastry is like 2 or 3 bucks.

The hotel is best described as HUGE, with close to 1,000 rooms. We were there during a peak week, and it was quite crowded. If you are staying on top of the cliff, you are required to ride a funincular to the bottom and ride a ferry to the beach at Palomino Island (22 minutes each way). The beach was great, with OK snorkling (great water, not too many fish). The staff was very friendly and helpful, but ran out of gear (umbrellas, floats, etc) pretty quick. One day they closed the beach around 1PM, saying that it was at capactity and did not allow my buddy to come over and meet us after he fiinished his golf round. There is a clothing optional beach on the othr side of the island, but we did not go there!!! The food in the various restauants quality wise is OK, with our favorities, in order, Stingray(seafood, down by the marina), Othello, (italian), Isabellas (steaks), Las Olas (Mexican) and last and least, The Chinese place. It was not good at all, way over priced and sucky food.(We did not do the teppan Yaki or sit at the sushi bar, just had a table) In all restaurants,the food is extremely expensive. The wine lists are extensive, with few bargains, and the some of the better wines at a \"fair\" (compared to the $396 bottles that would be $55 elsewhere) they were out of.

To traverse the property takes some time, it is huge, and you spend some time waiting for the fununcular, but not too bad. We stayed down below right by the marina, and would reccomend those rooms.

This was a group trip so I'm writing this on behalf of many of us with the same experience. Overall the resort is beautiful, with lots of activities for singles, couples or families. What was disappointing is the room. Dirty and outdated. Carpets, walls, bathrooms not the cleaniness you would expect for a resort of this caliber. Since the rooms are not great, be sure you get a water view room that extends over the pool area out to Palimino Island. This is the best view. Make sure you stay in the wing that is attached to the main lobby area. Any other location is a hike to get to the pool area or food/coffee. The Golden Door Spa is overrated. It was very busy, but that is no excuse for cleaniness. I did not feel pampered in he least bit. They ran out of massage therapist, so I was forced to have my massage by a male therapist. He wouldn't listen to me when I said he was pressing too hard, and I ended up with brusing on my legs and back. Food was okay, but a little overpriced for the quality. Service.....low marks for service. No one went out of their way to make you feel like you were important. Every request from a glass of water to a beverage refill...just seemed like we were offending them or making them work too hard. All in all, my husband and I have been to many resorts in the carribean, try any other island before chosing PR. It is a city with a beach. It is very hard to feel like your on vacation and to receive the pampering you wish to have while on vacation. We never felt like we were on vacation...it just seemed like NY City with a beach with average service. Based on feedback from other guests...if your going to stay in PR than this is the resort.

NOTE: Do not arrive during the week between 3-5 pm. Traffic is always btb then--3 hrs. and 20 mins. for the normal 1 hr and 15 min ride to the hotel (on comfortable a/c'd hotel bus). The reviews we read here are mostly accurate. Five stars for appearance, grounds and amenities. The rooms are initially attractive but a second look reveals a definite and overdue need for refurbishing. Everything is clean, just VERY worn, stained, or broken. The cost of food ran $75 for lunch and $150 for dinner on avg for two with no alcohol. We ate in all restaurants/cafes except Mexican and food was very good with better than avg portion sizes. Resort personnel were always helpful, attentive and friendly; some privately owned shop employees weren't. We stayed in both the Grand Hotel (golf view) and Las Brisas (ocean view) and both were the same: unbelievably noisy with doors routinely slamming, all-night whistling frogs, 24-hr funicular cranking up and down the cliff, all day pool side volleyball competition with loudspeaker and loud music 9-3 for two days, flushing toilets, deck chairs raking across patios, fighting guests, lots of stroller-sized children crying and running everywhere...only sleeping pills and dead sleepers will survive. As one review correctly noted, the guests were something else. Most often interactions revealed demanding, rude, impatient attitudes. We visited the spa, paid $280 for a very basic manicure/pedicure--not worth it. The grounds of the resort are clean, beautiful, and offer lots of places for privacy, fun and quiet. The hotel was booked to capacity this week, but we never felt crowded or had to wait for anything. Palimino Island is best to visit first couple boat rides or last trip over at 2:30ish as roped swimming area is small.

We were in a room in the main hotel with a gorgeous view of the water, with access to a VIP lounge (a very nicely appointed room, with big couches, internet access, a widescreen TV tuned to CNN, and breakfast -- muffins, cereal, fruit -- and hors d'oeuves daily). We found the housekeeping service to be excellent; our room was sparkling clean, and any requests for extra towels were immediately fulfilled. My only complaints are s-l-o-w service at the restaurants (not a problem if you're not travelling with antsy kids!), and construction noise from the rehab of Las Brezas restaurant. SOME POINTERS: 1) Get up early and reserve a chaise by the pool, particularly if you want shade. Ignore the signs saying that you're not allowed to do this -- everyone does. I suggest putting more than a towel; leave a magazine and flip-flops or a t-shirt. Then go have breakfast and come back later. 2) On nice days, it's also smart to rent tubes/rafts early as well -- once they're gone, they're gone. This is particularly true on the island. 3) Skip the food by the pool. It's ridiculously overpriced (a $10 hotdog!) and not very good. Except the fries. 4) The restaurant above the pool (Bella Vista) has very, very good pizza, and you can go there in your swimsuits. Service there for dinner, though, can be VERY slow. 5) Blossoms is fun for kids, and worth the money. Make sure you reserve a table by the hibachi. Again, VERY slow service. 6) There's a buffet dinner right near Otello's -- can't remember the name of the place. The food's not fabulous, but it's good enough, and it's a nice option if you have antsy kids. 7) The restaurant on Palomino Island is fine (I liked the grilled chicken sandwich), and fun because the occasional chicken or lizard will run under your chair. 8) I suggest beach shoes for swimming at the island, unless you have tough soles. 9) I had a great time at the Spa (though I don't have much experience to compare it to). Had the Isla Bonita Body Scrub, which was wonderful. And the gym there is nice. You can pay $25 for a day pass to the spa, and use the gym, the showers, the jacuzzi (which I thought was lovely), and relax in the lounge. Worth it. (If you pay for a treatment -- the body scrub was $115 -- you can use the spa all day.) 10) The snorkling trip was fun, but don't expect to see a whole lot....some colorful fish, some sea urchins, and maybe a turtle. But dolphins swam right by our boat on the way over! 11) The nighttime kayak trip to the bioluminiscent bay was GREAT. Be prepared -- it's a 30 ride (with two of you in a kayak, going in a line with the other people) up a mangrove channel in darkness -- very cool. I was with my 8-year-old, so it was hard work. But worth it! Then you hear an interesting talk, and if you want, jump in and swim for a few minutes. Look down at yourself -- you'll look like you're covered in pixie dust. Memorable. 12) There's a place to rent DVDs and videos to watch in your room--right by David's cookies. 13) We highly recommend the mint chocolate chip at Cafe Caribe! (And the arroz con pollo.)

I have read many, many reviews of this resort and specifically looked for all the negative aspects which were mentioned and I found \"NONE\" to hold true. Simply stated... the staff/personnel were all very, very friendly and helpful. In fact, one of the maids offered to go get us ice. When she returned we were going to tip her, and she refused to accept it. How nice is that? Our room was immaculate and had a spectacular view of the ocean and Palomino island. Despite what others have said, the funnicular never broke down and it was quite a fun way to get down the cliff. There were no mosquitos, and the beach on Palomino Island was NOT rocky or hard on the feet. The restaurants were plentiful and had a total realm of price ranges to meet just about all budgets. Sure there were very expensive restaurants there (ranging about $35 per entree), but there were also places you get a sandwich, pasta, pizza or a chicken ceaser salad for much, much less. AND, we found \"ALL\" the food that we had there to be very, very good. Stingray was a pricey restaurant but, very very good as was Isabella's (we had the petite filet mignon)... excellent service and great tasting. But we also budgeted ourselves and had pizza one night outdoors by the pool... it was great as was the spagetti and meatballs. We also ate at Ballyhoo's down by the marina and we had a chicken ceaser wrap which was about $9... terrific. The only negative thing we encountered was that initially the Conceirge desk made it seem that only the very expensive restaurants were available, and they suggested we make reservations for them all ahead of time since they book up fast. But after doing a little research on our own, we discovered that there were about 5 other restaurants to go for meals on the resort which were much more affordable. It helps to be resourceful! The views and setting of this resort were outstanding in every way. Many flowers and greenery everywhere! The pools were beautiful! Great place for kids. They showed a movie outdoors by the pool one night for all the kids! How nice is that?? Also, there were many activities for kids to do there.. including a wonderful waterslide. Staff was constantly cleaning and maintaining the resort.. which shows their interest in preserving the quality. The boat over to Palomino Island was so much fun! We even saw a 35 foot whale next to our boat, since it was mating season!! The staff on the boat are very careful and adhere to safety at all times! Palomino Island was simply beautiful... a true carribean island... You must go up to the trails and see the Igaunas! We must have seen 50 of them during the week... some as large as 5 feet long. They are so interesting yet harmless. Taking photos of them was a real challenge since they run fast. All in all, this is a highly recommended resort... not for singles, but for families and couples. Would definitely go back. Please read all negative reviews with a grain of salt (or sand... whatever the case may be). Please go there and enjoy!!!!!

Wow, what a difference. The place was SO CROWDED the first few days with all the kids off from school (our travel agent had warned us) but I wasn't anticipating not being able to get dinner reservations within the hotel nor did I think we'd have such a hard time getting a chair at the pool/beach! Also, both the pool and the beach are packed, packed, packed with lounge chairs that are so close together and line up in so many rows, you can barely walk around them to get anywhere. I kept waiting for someone to fall into the pool as they slithered by the edge just to get to the bathroom. Here's the deal. Even without the crowding, this place is on a beautiful cliff overlooking the ocean. The weather and the view were spectacular, however, the pools are a bit funky and need a good cleaning as could the rooms use. When we checked in, there was dark hair in our shower and on the floor (my family is all blonde) which led me to believe they don't clean very well. That hair remained there for several days and my husband finally called and asked the bathroom be recleaned. On the last few days of our stay, the hotel was fixing, hammering, and powerwashing making it extremely noisy and took away from our 'relaxing' vacation. The men were powerwashing at 11:00 am with people all around the pool and the gas fumes were gross as I sat and watched all of the debri from the grout going INTO the pool where my kids were swimming. We took them out and went and had another overpriced, mediocre lunch. The workers were replacing a roof the entire time were there and the casino had jackhammers running during the day as it looked like they were ripping up some pipes. I wondered why they would do all of this work during the busy season and can only attrribute it to poor planning/management. To get to the beach, you need to take a 20 minute boat ride across the ocean and it can be very bumpy so if you are a person who doesn't like boats, don't go here because there is NO BEACH at this hotel, which is a bummer if you like early morning walks on the beach or running as my husband does. Can't do it here. There were days my kids wanted to stay at the pool which was very noisy and I wanted to go to the beach and read a book quietly, but there is not much quiet here and that option was not available since it is such a haul back/forth to the beach. The food is okay (Blossom's the Japanese place actually had very good food) but the prices are truly a joke. $40 for a steak and everything else alacart $8 for baked potato, $3 for small coffee, $15 for salad, $10-12 for drinks. My husband ended up taking a taxi into town just to get some snacks and juice boxes for the kids. We were then told we weren't allowed to take our small cooler to the pool or beach. It also annoyed me how they nickel and dimed us to death. They don't have kids menus at most restaurants, so they have to order a 1/2 dinner. My 3 kids each had a bowl of pasta without even a meatball in it for $10 each and it was the smallest plate I have ever seen. My 4 year old was still hungry. We live in an expensive area and are not usually shocked at how expensive things are, but this place is truly outrageous, and it's simply not wonderful enough to warrant it. We've taken several trips to Cancun and Jamaica with our kids and have found this place to be the LEAST kid friendly. It has 'activities' listed, however whenever we showed up at one, i.e. Beach Volleyball, Sand Art, etc. no body was there. We hit the volleyball in the pool around ourselves and that was that. They did have a kids program, (extra $$$ of course) but we didn't feel comfortable with the fact that they would be taking our kids , 10, 7, 4 on the boat to the island. At other resorts, the kids programs are typically included and they were always close by so we didn't worry. Forget about massges, and/or golf unless you are willing to pay 3 X more than you should. My husband wanted to play a round of golf but when he found out it was $165 PLUS club rental PLUS cart rental he passed. I won't even go into the price of the massages. We've had them at other resorts and the price wasn't even close. We wanted to get a sitter one night so we could have dinner alone and hit the casino, and were willing to pay the $16 per hour (minimum 3 hours required) but when they handed my a 5 page disclaimer telling me the hotel was in no way responsible for any injury to my child and that they were not responsible for the 'actions' of the sitter, we passed. Again, other places we've stayed have these people fully screened and we didn't worry. There is a finuclar which is like a cable car that rides you up and down the cliff to get to some of the pools, restaurants and boat ride. This thing broke down while we were there and my husband was waiting 45 minutes for me to get back up to the room. There are no stairs or any means to get back up, which I found unbelievable in the case of emergency. Also, this resort is HUGE. 900 rooms and very disorganized. The reservations system at the front desk was either down or slow and the restaurants always had all kinds of mistakes and/or people waiting very long and becoming irrate. If you are someone who wants a more intimate or romantic setting, don't stay here. It's mainly families and lots of corporations having business meetings. Did I mention that the pool near our room was CLOSED for 2 full days because of a company convention? When we got there later around 5:00, many of the men were drunk and lound and talking obscenities in front of my kids. Overall, I'd have to say I was very happy to get away from the cold weather in New York and got myself a nice tan. But I would not stay at this resort again. There are too many other beautiful islands with better deals and better managed. I was torn between giving the hotel a 2 or a 3 star rating. I'd like to say 2 1/2 would be just right. Only because of the view and the pretty beach did I give it a 3.", "Date": "March 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time for All\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3230208", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews on this website I was a little nervous.

The walls of the room are clearly showing signs of humidity and mildew. The bathroom was dirty and old.

I spent 5 nights in this hotel, in Marina Village. The resort is huge and has many buildings, oldest ones must be from the 1950's. The Marina Village was very nice, like a small seaside village in Southern Europe. Las Casitas up in the hill looked like Positano in Amalfi Coast near Naples. The Marina Village area is perhaps 15-20 years old and some updating could be done. TV-set was old and not connected in a digital network - the picture was unclear. The room itself is spacious, beds are quite good, bathroom very nice and large, almost same size than average rooms in France! The room is equipped with VCR, CD and radio. We had a nice view to the Marina from a small balcony where the boat service to Palomino island departed. However, in this part of the hotel, aging was not a problem. The room was in a reasonable shape. All public areas were also quite nice. It was fun to see dozens of seniors being so concentrated in the Casino. That is quite exotic for a European traveller. They looked like kids playing video games. I have never felt safer than in el Conquistador, the hotel seems to be quite a substantial employer. The staff was very kind and helpful. Pools were nice but very shallow, only 1.00m (3.3f). I didn't see many waiters around, but 6$ + 18% for a 10fl oz beer won't make me thirsty. Palomino island is perhaps the best asset for this hotel. It was really a place to relax, surprisingly not very good for swimming. The transport is free, the only thing in the resort - in fact the cost is included in the resort fee. If you want to have a plastic kayak, it costs you 35$ per hour! My Toyota Corolla was around the same for 24 hours. I can recommend this resort if you get a good deal. At least half of the guests seemed to be in a conference or other business related trip. For them the cost issue is quite irrelevant.

My room rate was discounted around 70% - at that cost I felt it was very good value in Puerto Rican standards.

The staff are either very nice or very nasty. Example: As I checked out, the receptionist, Rachel L. Rosa, glared at me from the start. Here I was, paying $1,400 for non-room charges (my total was more than $4,000) and she, unprovoked, is surly, demonstrating a marked attitude of being inconvenienced by a customer! Asking for a manager, I was given the classic predictable runaround. This is a busy, noisy property.

Yes... you take a free 15 minute ferry to Palomino island and if you take the first ferry at 9am, chances are you'll be alone on the beach! Horseback riding, jet skis, kayaks, tubes, etc. Amazing waters... shallow at first for kids play... minimal waves.

(Must get an ocean view!) 5) Roller coaster like \"elevator\" brings you down the side of the mountain to the marina... awesome. 6) People are so nice- not just the workers, but the class of guests. 7) Diverse food selection and delicious at that! (Japanese restaurant was decent, but then again, I'm a particular New Yorker :) ) 8) Bang for your buck.

We could hear people taking showers two floors above us. Doors constantly slamming--There is no room to rest - what a shame. Our second room--upon walking in, i found, leftover from the previous guests, a woman's razor on my pillow...no towels, half emptied toiletries and again thick gooey dust on the air vents. On top of it, we were situated in between five inconsiderate families with multiple kids each (all together). The parents allowed their kids to sing songs in the hallways and run back and forth slamming doors from 7a-10a everyday. When we contacted security--several times, they continued to say that somone was on their way. Finally, I got to speak with the security guard personally, and he said \"mam, I have been trying to call the room next door for the last half hour.\" What is that? How the heck are you going to solve a problem unless someone physically goes to the room and addresses it? Basically, I felt UNSAFE at this resort. I asked security, \"what if I was being raped?\" what are you going to do--call my room. The staff is LAZY!!!!!! When I asked the folks next door to control their kids and to keep the noise down, the woman said to me: \"Its not my fault your room is tucked between five our families.\" After getting NOWHERE with security, I called the front desk again. They told me: \"the good news is that the families are checking out tomorrow.\" What a consolation... I planned for my vacation for 9 months and saved all my pennies to have fun & relax in a \"luxury\" resort. We spent $2,000 bucks alone on food, beverage and massages--What a waste. It took 45 minutes to get a waitress at the pool. ONe day, I waited two hours for a corona. what a joke!!

It's about a 45 min. - 1 hour drive from the airport, but the sights and the cab driver's information about PR made it go by quickly. The resort itself is beautiful. The fact that it's on a cliff gives you the most magnificent scenery around! We stayed in the Las Brisas section with an oceanfront view. It was an amazing view! The resort itself is very tropical with a lot of foliage, very beautiful. The other great thing about the resort is Palimino Island. It's a great way to spend the day. We went horseback riding, snorkeling, and just enjoyed a great beach day. The spa was great as well. The staff at the resort and in PR were wonderful, very friendly, and very helpful. The food was okay and it was expensive, not quite worth it for the taste. Now, for the room. We stayed in the Las Brisas section. The oceanfront room was up high on the cliff, so it gave you the most AMAZING view. You can NEVER get tired of the view. The room was spacious enough. It had ample storage and a walk-in closet. However, on closer inspection, it needed to be really upgraded, especially the carpets and the lighting. Mostly, it didn't bother us because we enjoyed the rest of the resort and the view was so beautiful. However, the last day, we got the shock of our life. They give you a hamper in the walk-in closet. When I went to empty it to pack our clothes, I found a huge cockroach along with my clothes! That scared the life out of me, and I had to drag my showering husband to go hunt it down and kill it. When I told the staff, they really didn't do anything except to say that they were sorry! Since it was our last day, I didn't push the issue, but I doubt I would go back to this resort again.

Although pricey, we did not feel it was anymore so than other nega resorts. My husband and I were there for him to attend a conference so we had a reasonable room rate and it gave us a chance to visit the island. We hoped it might be a place we might like to return due to the proximity and easy flight from Tampa. We rented a car, visited San Juan and then, despite poor directions from Avis, eventually arrrived at the hotel. We were checked in promptly and told the room, although smaller than others, had a large balcony. We have traveled in Europe for 30 years and are used to looking at a room before checking in but were tired and wanted to get settled so we did just that. My initial concern was that the bath/shower was old and did not look very clean but then I decided it was just worn. We were assigned to Room 4109 in the building between La Casitas and the main building with a nice ocean and pool view. We ate, visited the casino and I returned to the room to shower and get to bed. First disappointment came when I unpacked & the small closet doors came off the runner but you could slide them although it was bothersome. Then, putting toiletries on the bath counter was a large clump of hair that the maid missed. Now I am getting concerned! But I wiped the counters and continued! Then, all ready for a relaxing shower, I discover the water control handle in the tub was totally broken so I could not shower! Now 11pm, I had to dress, call housekeeping and wait for repairmen. They arrived, oohed and awed and then left to get a piece to fix it. After the second trip I called the desk to advise them it looked grim and we wanted a room with running water in the shower to which the woman replied \"We have no rooms as we are 90% full\"! I responded that I expected to be moved into a room in the other 10% if the third attempt to fix the faucet failed! Indeed, at midnight they finally said it was not going to be fixed. It was apparent that my inital concern that the bath was not clean was correct. The maid might have wiped it down but it certainly was not scrubbed with water! Why this room was not taken out of inventory for rehab is beyond me. This separates the property, in our opinion, from deserving any more than 3 stars. No one should have to pay in the high hundreds or thousands to expect a clean, orderly, working room. At 12:30 am we were finally moved into a much nicer room in the main hotel building and were satisfied with that room. So, now, the prestigious Golden Door Spa, which I have enjoyed at the Venetian in Vegas. I had made appointments before leaving the US but it rained all one day so I decided to go spend the day, enjoying the facilities at a reasonable $25 fee and hoping for a massage apt. to open up. I went to the shower area and stall after stall was disgusting with hairs and stuff from the bottom of people's spa flip-flops. I settled on one that seemed the least dirty! I maneuvered the shower heads to spray the corners where there was a buildup of accumulated \"grunge\" and hair and felt I improved it a bit. I was there all day and a woman repeatedly mopped the area around the jacuzzi when her time could have been spent cleaning the stalls with a brush and cleanser. There was a lot of mildew, a problem I am familiar with having lived in Florida all my life. However, I also know that a simple spraying of Tilex or bleach on a regular basis eliminates that problemvery easily. It was apparent the stalls in the spa and our room had not been thoroughly cleaned in some time. I heard several people comment that the hot tub in the pool area was not clean either and they chose not to go in it. I did go in it but agree that more effort should be made to clean around the tile edges. We enjoyed the restaurants and the foliage and felt the property had great potential. Regretfully, we would not choose to go back there. There are equally as beautiful properties in Florida with higher standards of cleanliness but n one that have the combo of the island beauty and culture, the casino, and the nearby rain forest.

We also snorkeled from the Palomino island beach over to a smaller island about 1/4 mile offshore, which was fun. We also jet skiied. The restuarant on Palomino island has a friendly staff and pretty good food. Service was slow, however.

The pool areas, grounds, spa and golf courses are all first rate. There are a couple of hot spas near the main pool that are relaxing to soak in, but you need to bring a towel after sunset.

The drive from the airport can be as short as 45 minutes and as long as 80 minutes depending on traffic. We encountered alot of traffic around noon on a weekday when we arrived.

The Spa........hmmmmmmm how to begin I'm not a spa person but I decided to give it a shot since I was given a complimentary message worth $110. It was OK but I wouldn't waste my money. My therapist decided to discuss politics with me which just stressed me out....so much for relaxing. My kids (13 and 16) found it OK but no big deal as well. I guess we missed out on the spa genes in our family. The Roman Jacquizzi/hot tub/whatever you call it, was a hot 104 degrees...to hot for my tootsies so I by passed boiling in water and turning into a lobster. Saturday (12/17) was an off day for the Spa people. The manicurist was just down right rude to my daughter and I really wanted to stiff her on a tip. But, when I went to pay, the receoptionist asked me in a very loud voice if I wanted to give the standard 20% tip. I cracked under the pressure and consented! Palamino Island is just wonderful for the kids, you can rent innertubes, noodles, jetskies, kayaks....yada yada. The beach is bueatiful and the water warm. Note to parents...the kids have to be 18 to rent a jetski. Bottom line, the Casatas are wonderful, flaws and all and I would go back in a newyork heatbeat! I loved it! My husband will be playing in the Golf Tournment next year and we plan on booking an extra day. Oh yeah, tips for sightseeing... Hire a private driver for the Rainforest and make sure for the 45 minute walk, he drops you off on top so you walk down. Most of the tours drop you off at the bottom and the walk up hill is very strenuous if you aren't in good shape. Ask for Carlos..he is a great tour guide. For three people it cost us $150 but it would have cost the same if we had gone on the bus tour with a bunch of strangers. The private tour is the way to go. We also had limited time but we did go to Old San Juan for the shopping. Typical tourist shopping. We had dinner at the Parrot Club which I highly recommend. Brenda was one of the best waitresses I've ever been served by. Again, it's an hour drive to Old San Juan and we had no choice but to hire a private car or rent a car. We chose the private car. It picked us up at 3:30 (warning: many of the stores close at 5:30) and got back around 9:30 pm. The price (sit down) $350 which included a tip. For those on a budget...don't bother going to this resort. It's not cheap! Excluding drinks I'd say the average lunch bill for myself and my two kids ran about 40 dollars. Can't tell you about Breakfast or Dinners since ours were compted by Travel and Leasure Mag. We ate Breakfast at Isabels which was very good. One last note, Casita guests are given a comp breakfast at their private resteraunt. It looked good, fresh fruit, bake goods, coffee.... I hope this helps everyone out.

This was just about the most perfect vacation we have ever taken. After reading some of the \"horror stories\" posted on this site, we were more than a little concerned. Check-in was fairly smooth, especially given the number of guests checking in at the same time. Our room wasn't ready, so we went out to the terrace to have lunch. After lunch, we checked into a beautiful room, very clean with a wonderful view. The resort is extremely well maintained. The pool areas, especially the ones in the upper areas are fantastic. During the week of our stay ( when the hotel was very busy) we never had a problem getting a chair at any pool or the beach. Many days there was some form of live entertainment at the beach or pool. Towels were plentiful as well, and food and beverage service was extremely professional and pleasant. In fact, from the management staff to the housekeepers, every employee we dealt with was nice and seemed concerned that we have a nice stay. We stayed on the property the entire week and found the food to be very good, in general. The few times it wasn't to our liking it was replaced immmediately or removed from the check. In terms of food prices, they are high; however, there are a number of choices in restaurants ranging from bakeries to high end, fancier eating areas. Regardless of where we ate, food prices were in line with other upscale Caribbean resorts. The only exception was Isabella's steak house which was extremely expensive ($44 for a fair ala carte steak) with terrible service. Avoid it. Blossoms proved to be a great choice. We played in the casino every night and although we lost, the casino staff was helpful and pleasant. They only negative experience was some cash taken from our daughters' room.

I took my mother there for a Christmas gift. The reason I decided to go was because the Food and Beverage Director at this property was the former General Manager at The Martineau bay property where we had an excellent experience. We ran into this individual, who remembered us and he also seemed genuinely interested in our needs. He was also very appreciative of our loyalty. The room we stayed in had a lovely view of the ocean, and the beautiful, lush surroundings. We spent two of the days at the pool area, and one of the days on Palamino Island. The Pool areas were impeccably maintained, moreso than any other resort where I have stayed. I have read other postings about the island being a hassle to get to; I believe this is all a matter of where your head is. I considered it an adventure. Taking the transportation down to the dock is incredible. Whether in the elevator, or walking down the hallway, you are surrounded by incredible views. The fact that the elevator has glass windows really shows how much thought went into the design of this place. You have a beautiful view, no matter what you are doing. The 10 to 15 boat ride to the island was incredibly beautiful! The beaches there were white sandy beaches, with Clear, Clear water. What more could you want in a Carribean resort? The boat departs to/from the island every thirty minutes, so you never feel like you are stuck there. As far as the food being expensive; There are several different food/price options available, from moderate to expensive which affords everyone a wide range of choices. We had two appetizers at the bar from one of the restaurants which were incredible! They were also reasonably priced. The staff was pleasant and accomodating. At one point I had to deal with the Director of Security, who resolved a problem that we had almost immediately. He also seemed genuinely concerened about our stay at the property.

We had some reservations given the mixed reviews and found that both the good and the bad are both true. The good: Well kept and manicured grounds. Incredible views from the resort's location. Rooms are clean, spacious. Staff is friendly. Palomino Island, the resort's private island and therefore the only beach access through this resort is very pretty with plenty of space/chairs/cabanas for everyone. Stingray Cafe is above average food. Common areas of the resort are well maintained. Very easy to get to El Yunque from resort. The bad: Rooms are starting to show their age. Walls are thin so there is potential for sleepless nights if you have noisy neighbors. Funiculars are a bit of a pain to have to deal with. That was probably my least favorite aspect of our stay. We didn't mind the water taxis to get to Palamino Island as much as some. I thought it was kind of fun plus you're on no time constraints when you're on vacation so who cares if it takes a few minutes to get there.

Having read other trip advisor reviews before we left, we were somewhat prepared for both the negative and positive comments that have been made, and both are valid. We rented a car upon arrival, and true to what we read, traffic from San Juan is a nightmare. It is bumper to bumper on Highway 3 for at least 45 minutes. Plan on taking an hour and a half to get there. Also, the road to the El Conquistador is not well-marked (you follow these little blue signs that show a picture of a bed indicating a hotel) and the road winds around a lot - just when you think you are lost, you finally arrive at the resort. Upon arrival, we had no problem with check-in, unlike some others have reported. We arrived on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, and I would think that there would have been a big crowd arriving around that time, but again, no problems. We requested, and got, the La Vista wing, which is up the cliff in the main hotel section. I agree with the comments that the lobby and dining areas are beautiful, but that the rooms are functional at best. They are clean, but they are bland, somewhat outdated in appearance. The landscaping is beautiful, but the walkways outside the hotel rooms are drab, with older, chipped tiles. It's all worth it because the views and location of the hotel is spectacular. The water is gorgeous, and the rain forest is at the back of the hotel, providing beautiful views of the mountains and the storm clouds over them. Most of the restaurants overlook the water, and it was wonderful having breakfast each morning while looking at views of the sparkling water and the other islands. We did not have any problems with the staff. They were more than accomodating and friendly. We had to cancel one room at the last minute (the day before arrival) due to a family illness, and the front desk refunded the deposit even though the reservation expressly stated that cancellations needed to be made 3 days in advance. Several times when we ordered soft drinks for the kids at the bars at the beach or pool, the bartenders gave them to us for free. I didn't think the drink prices were any different than at other resorts in Hawaii, or Vegas. Food was pricey, but typical resort prices. I did think the quality was slightly lower than most other resort hotels, but again, we were in the Caribbean, so I somewhat expect that. There is a grocery store 10 minutes away, so we stocked up on some basics (each room has a refrigerator), and snacked in the room. We were on a plan where the adults got the breakfast buffet for free, so we ate there every morning, and it was good. The food at Blossoms (Chinese) was not. There is also lots of fast food choices (Wendy's, Ponderosa, Sizzler) just up the street if you are traveling with kids. The beach and private island were beautiful. On the first day, one of the funiculars was broken, and as other people have noted, it was a real pain. We had to wait half an hour to get back up the cliff after spending the day in the sun. When both of the funiculars were running, it wasn't too bad. The ferries run regularly. The beach is on a peninsula, and one side is sandier, with less coral, and the other side has more coral (and better snorkeling). There is also sand volleyball and a basketball court. Everyone had something to do. The food at Iguana's on the island was good and reasonably priced. Because we had heard that the drinks were not, we just brought our own in a beach bag. Even with it being a holiday week, we never had a problem getting a chair, and we aren't exactly early risers. Same goes for the pool. Having a rental car increased our options. We did the rain forest tour ourselves. It's only 15 minutes away, and we paid $3 per person to get into the visitors' center instead of $50 on a tour. The trails are well-marked. We hiked to a waterfall-I would definitely recommend it. We were unable to due the biobay tour due to the full moon, but I've heard it's awesome. We did book a snorkeling trip through the hotel and were not disappointed. Prices no different than elsewhere in the Caribbean or Hawaii for the snorkeling, and it was just as good as those places. A couple of the nights, the hotel had a \"dive in movie\" at the pool for the kids. They loved it, and hotel staff passed out popcorn and drinks. The adults sat at a restaurant on the terrace overlooking the pool, and had a relaxing dinner while the kids watched the movie. We did not bother trying the Kids Club or the Golden Door spa after reading other comments about the prices. I agree with others that I am not going to pay an additional $20 to get into the spa and use the nice workout room. The regular workout room just looked so-so. We were so busy, it didn't matter too much. Although there was some construction going on at a restaurant near the pool, it did not interfere with our stay at all. Maybe it was because of our room location. The walls are thin, so if you get noisy neighbors, you're screwed. We were pretty lucky there as well. I think that happens at a lot of hotels, though, so nothing unusual there. In conclusion, if you know what to expect before you go, you will not be disappointed.

Here is a snapshot of what we experienced: TO THE HOTEL -> The majority of the route to the hotel was on mutli-lane highways; traffic was no problem at all. It would have taken about 50 minutes to reach the hotel; however, I did have problems with the driving directions the hotel provided. After calling the concierge and getting better directions, we finally reached the hotel (lost about 20 minutes of driving multiple times past the turn-off point into what is a residential area. All told, I probably should have gotten more detailed directions before I left. CHECK-IN -> As a Wyndham By Request member, the express check-in took a total of 5 minutes, including time waiting in line. For a busy holiday weekend, I thought this was great! THE ROOM -> We booked a deluxe ocean view room w/balcony and requested either the Las Brisas or Las Vista wing so we could be close to the restaurants and pool. We got a room in Las Brisas on the 3rd floor - same level as the main pool area. The room condition and furnishings were okay, approaching 3 1/2 stars. This was more than compensated by the large bathroom, walk-in closet, and spacious balcony with outstanding views of Palomino Island. We reserved the family getaways by request special which gave us a 4th night free, 2 for 1 spa services, and free kid's meals (except for Isabela's below). RESTAURANTS -> Our first night, Thanksgiving Day, we ate the special holiday buffet at Isabela's. The food was well-prepared and the presentation was quite nice. We enjoyed the special Puerto Rican touches, such as tropical salsas and other spices that made it a little more than just a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. Very pricey ($55 for adults, $25 for our 5-year old). We ate lunch one day at Bella Vista, which overlooks the main pool. High quality food (I had a meatball sandwich on an extremely fresh baguette) and my wife had a chicken caesar salad. Lunch was about $45, including my son's pizza (which was free) and a large slice of tiramasu which we all shared. Breakfast at Cafe Caribe was less than adequate and for about $29, was completely lacking in value and quality. Another lunch was poolside, courtesy of Virgin and although the fare was standard (chicken fingers, tuna sandwich on pita bread, and fried), the quality was quite good. Our final dinner was at Blossom's, where we had the teppanyaki service. I had the filet mignon, my wife had scallops, and my son had a 1/2 order of shrimp (again free). Total cost was $93 and completely worth it, for both the quality and taste of the food as well as the entertaining preparation. PALOMINO ISLAND -> We went on the first full day around 10am in the morning. Taking the funicular down to La Marina was quick and efficient. In the four days we were at the hotel, both funiculars were in working order and we never waited more than 3-5 minutes in any direction. The ferry ride to Palomino took about 20 minutes, which is about the maximum I think we could tolerate. Once at the beach, it was easy to find an available palapa and relax beachside. I rented a pedal bike for me and my son for an hour ($30) and pedaled our way to a tiny atoll about 1/2 mile away from Palomino. It was a fun little open sea adventure and great exercise! POOL AREA -> My son went to the pool area every day and loved it. He particularly liked the kiddy slide and would spend an hour or more on this alone. We were always able to find deck chairs with tables and umbrellas, which allowed us to alternately sun and shade. GOLDEN DOOR SPA -> I had a 50 minute Golden Door massage ($110), which was just phenomenal. Of course, I've only had three massages in my lifetime, but nevertheless, this was the best. My wife had a facial for $115 and she said it was okay (not the best she's ever had), but worth the price, considering my massage was free of charge. OVERALL: I chose to rate the hotel as \"above average\" due to two factors: inconsistent restaurant quality and average room accommodations. Regardless, we will definitely visit again.

They play a good mix of music (meringue, pop, hip-hop, etc.) but is was basically empty every night we were there. There is also a casino for entertainment but the tables are defiantly over-crowded and the drinks do not come often (you actually have to pay for your own drinks if playing poker). The room was fine.

The property is in major need of maintenance and repair throughout: missing ceiling tiles throughout the lobby and main building, cracked walls in need of repair and painting and only one funicular was functioning during our entire stay. The staff was at best \"uninterested\" and at worst arrogant. The property has 5 or so restaurants...all extremely overpriced. A breakfast fruit plate was $12 and a bottled water was $4; dinners averaged $40+ not counting an appetizer or salad. If you go, I'd recommend renting a car and trying some of the local restaurants. They are small and quaint, but the food was much better, the people very friendly and you get more of a \"local\" feel. Also, I'd recommend bringing bug spray. We were covered in bites....both mosquitos and others that we were convinced came from the bedding. Bed bugs!!!???? Not something I expect from a supposedly top rated Wyndham. The private island was a nice touch, but be prepared for a $12 hamburger for lunch. If you want to use the spa work out room, it's a pricey $25 dollars a day....pretty steep for an hour of exercise.

Yes, the food is absolutely overpriced, but some of the restaurants are surprisingly good. (Le Bistro, however, was the ultimate ripoff. I do NOT recommend it.) The views are amazing and the rooms are surprisingly spacious. We love lounging and snorkeling around Palomino Island (bring your own snorkeling equipment and save a bundle). Bring beach shoes for walking on coral, and lots of high powered sunscreen. One really easy way to keep your costs down is not to buy any reservation \"packages\". When you calculate the \"a la carte\" cost of the things they include in the \"packages\" (like breakfast) there really is no savings. Moreover, you end up paying 30% in tariffs and taxes on your hotel rate, so if your hotel rate includes anything except the room, you're not getting a good deal. What made our most recent trip unpleasant was the way central reservations handled our reservation. When you book your reservation, you are sent a confirmation email which does not detail any promotions you might have purchased. In our case, we had booked a 5 night stay. The first four nights were under the \"Getaways By Request\" plan, which had a rate of $159/night and included the fourth night free (aka \"stay three nights get the fourth night free\"). The fifth night we had a triple A rate of $141. I made the mistake of not making sure to get the specifics of these promotions in writing immediately. When I called 3 weeks before our trip to confirm, they told me I had booked a completely different package, at a similar nightly rate ($158 for the first four nights, $141 for the last night) but instead of a free night, it had \"two for one\" deals on golf and spa treatments--the overall difference was more than $100 in their favor). When I insisted that this was not the package I had booked (we don't golf and we don't spa, plus the \"two for one\" package was a three day package, so why would we have wanted it for four nights when a cheaper AAA rate was available?) they refused to admit the mistake (implying that I was lying) and told me the package I wanted was sold out and there was nothing they could do about it. I asked them to produce \"quality assurance\" recordings of the phone conversation because I was completely sure they were wrong, but they said they couldn't. Only after many HOURS spent on the phone and computer (I eventually wised up and switched to email in order to generate a paper trail) did they give me the package they had initially sold me. Even then, they screwed up and I had to produce copies of this correspondence at check-out in order to get them to fix the bill. I considered complaining to the Better Business Bureau, but Wyndham already has bad BBB ratings so it wouldn't have done any good. I was getting ready to create a site at complaints when they finally told me they would change the reservation. All of this was the fault of Wyndham central reservations, NOT the staff at the Conquistador itself. The lesson I've learned: whenever booking on the phone with Wyndham, get the name of who you're talking to. Then get them to email a DETAILED WRITTEN CONFIRMATION. Make sure you bring hard copies of this, just in case. One additional thing about the hotel--I agree with another reviewer that it's insane that they include high powered stereos in all the rooms.

It is showing it's age in places, the food is pricey in some of the restaurants, and the service is not always impeccable. Nevertheless, it was stunning, I had a fabulous time there and would go back in a heartbeat. I just got back from 5 days at Las Casitas Village with my husband and 2 children ages 10 and 15. We had a one bedroom suite with a sofabed and rollaway for the 4 of us. There was a covered patio with a view of the distant ocean past the rolling hills of the golf course. It was lovely. Some of the casitas have more spectacular ocean views, but we had lots of privacy, and gorgeous sunsets. Las Casitas is the newest part of the resort so, if you're sensative to its age, go here. It is a substantial walk from Las Casitas to the main resort and the funicular. WE all enjoyed this walk! It's so beautiful, and there are so many things to see, that we discovered new things everytime we walked. There is a brand new infinity pool reserved for Las Casitas guests which is so spectacular that once there, we could hardly tear ourselves away. But I'm glad we did since Palomino Island is so wonderful. Again, we enjoyed the trip there...the shops along the way, the funicular, the marina, and the ferry ride. The island itself is a wonderful little oasis. We took advantage of the horseback riding, and jet skis as well as snorkeling and shell collecting. It was a thoroughly relaxing time, with something for everyone to do. While there, we took the resort's kayak tour of the bioluminescent bay, and would highly recommend that excursion. Our experience with scuba diving from the resort was less successful since they informed us upon arrival thet they did not have enough people to justify going out. When pressed however, they contacted another local company which had no problem taking just the 2 of us out, and the diving was excellent. WE also had a disappointing experience with the spa which messed up my massage appointment but gave me a free facial and a gift, to make up for it. This is a good example of what would happened in general. Service was not perfect, but it was always very fiendly and nice, and IF there was a mistake people were more that willing to correct it if possible, and even go a little further. The restaurants on at the resort were fine. We had a teriffic lunch at La Belle Vista Cafe overlooking the main pool, and a fun time at the hibachi table at Blossoms. Our only disappointment was Isabelas steakhouse where the service was so slow, and the portions as big as the prices. But, if what you want in Puerto Rico is a traditional steakhouse, then go there. We enjoyed the off resort restaurants that we drove to, more. One of these, Caliza, was only 5 minutes from the resort entrance. The other, King Seafood, was in Luquillo Beach, 10-15 minutes away. In both cases, we took the recommendation of our butler at Las Casitas, and we were not disappointed. You'll spend half as much at local restaurants as you would at the resort. I think a car is a must, unless you don't plan to leave the resort. Parking was free at Las CAsitas, and right by the rooms. WE had no trouble driving from the airport, and were then able to explore locally. In addition to the local restaurants at night, we also visited El Yunque rain forest, and spent some time at the local beach in Luquillo. It's a beauty, by the way.

On the positive side, the room was nice (I'm not sure if it was worth the price), the views were incredible, and everything seemed to be very clean. However, we were extremely disappointed by the quality and price of the food. On our first night, we ate at Cafe Caribe and ordered the chicken strips for 9.00. There were three of them. The next morning, we ate breakfast at Las Brisas - a buffet for 21.00 per person. It wasn't worth it. On our second night, we decided to try Blossoms. We tried to dress nicely for this dinner, since the hotel literature stressed the importance of \"maintaining ambiance after sunset.\" (We quickly discovered that this is basically a bunch of crap, and we wore jeans and flip flops the rest of the week.) At Blossoms, we told the hostess that we were interested in having sushi, so all she gave us was a piece of paper to write our order on when she sat us. No menus. When our server finally arrived, we had to ask him to bring us menus, and he sounded really surprised. When we informed him we would like to order sushi as an appetizer, he said, \"You better order it fast then, cause we only have one chef, and he's busy.\" Ok, then. We also each ordered entrees, which were worse than the worst Chinese takeout, I have ever eaten. Both entrees - one pork and one chicken - had been obviously frozen and simply reheated. My chicken, which was too tough to eat, was served on a bed of salad in a bag and covered in a pool of sauce. The service continued to be horrible, and we were only going to leave a 10% tip. Unfortunately, we didn't have a choice, since they thoughtfully included a 15% gratuity in the check. I understand this practice for large parties, but there were two of us. I was disappointed to find out that the only beach is a 20 minute boat ride away. Palomino island is ok...the boat ride gets old. If you want to escape the screaming children and go to a clothing optional beach, it's a 1.22 mile hike. We didn't feel like doing this, so I can't say if it's nice. If you eat at the restaurant on the island, there are chickens roaming around (I don't feel they qualify as Carribean ambiance), and their feces are all over the ground. The water is warm, but too shallow to swim, and the beaches are rocky. On the plus side, sitting on the beach is very relaxing and the views are beautiful. Alcohol prices are mind blowing. For example, beer costs 50 cents per oz, and the standard size of a beer is 10 oz. So, the cheapest beer at the hotel is 5.00 (available in your mini bar). A 6 pack at the hotel store is 30.00. Mixed drinks, with alcohol, are 8.00. The casino is a joke. We went there to kill some time, but we didn't stay very long. The dealers are surly and inexperienced. If you get a blackjack (3/2 odds), they keep the extra 1/2 and only pay it if you win your next hand. The slot machines do not pay out. I played between 35 and 40 times without a winning hand. The airport transportation is 30.00 per person unless you are a Wyndham member. I think they took us the (excruciatingly) long way to the hotel so they could play their informational video. The way back was much faster and on major roads. The pools were very nice, and the chairs were comfortable. If you don't want to be around children, this isn't the place to hang out. The food at Cafe Bella Vista, which overlooks the pool, actually tastes good, but is still overpriced. Basically, the resort is beautiful and decently maintained, but the overpricing and sub par quality of the food and services left a bad taste in our mouth.

Dinner for two for the cheapest on the menu no drinks, just coke and tea $88.00. The next morning we at the breakfast buffet. Yes the birds were flying around, but your in the Carribean, it's all about the atmosphere. We loved it. The breakfast buffet every morning cost us $42.00. The food is good, but way over priced. Our wedding was wonderful, the priest had the most romantic cerimony I have ever heard. The photographer was also great!! and not expensive. After the wedding our wedding party ate at Isabellas.

We picked that resort because there was a family wedding on July 31, and the bride and groom had picked that resort for their wedding ceremony and reception. First of all, we rented a car and became lost while driving from the airport to the hotel. There were signs for a lot of other resorts in the area, but not one single sign for the El Conquistador. The directions in the Frommer's travel guide were useless since most of the streets in Puerto Rico are unmarked. We finally met a wonderful gentleman who did not speak English but led us right to the entrance of the resort! When we finally reached the hotel and stopped our car in the front to drop off our luggage, the bell staff was hostile and immediately harassed us to move our car. There is a $10 parking charge per day at the resort, and the self-parking lot is a long walk from the hotel. If you opt to take the shuttle instead, you may have a long wait since they were unreliable. Every single time you leave the resort, you have to wait in line in your car for approximately five minutes to show your room ID and your parking ticket before they open the gate and permit you to exit! Therefore, just leaving the resort turns into a half-hour process! We arrived at the hotel at 2:00 p.m., but our room was not ready. So we had lunch consisting of a small pizza and two soft drinks by the pool, which cost us over $25! Our room was FINALLY ready at 4:30. The resort is very beautiful, and our room was in the marina section - gorgeous room facing the marina and Palomino Island (where the beach is located). Our room was very clean and the king sized bed was extremely comfortable. The maid service was EXCELLENT! However, the A/C did not work properly - we had to keep the thermostat set at 50 degrees to get the room temp down to 72! The television had terrible reception and the doors on the television armoire were broken. We didn't bother complaining since we were hardly in the room anyway. It took three days of complaints before we finally received our Wyndham By Request amenities. The service at the reception counter was extremely slow. We went to the only resort beach, which is located on Palomino Island, the next day with all of our family members, which exceeded 20 people. The general consensus in our family was that the beach was terrible. . . . the water was full of seaweed and rocks (you definitely need to wear water shoes), and the water was too shallow for swimming as it never seemed to get any deeper than your waist. Family members that did swim out far enough for the water to be deep got caught in a riptide and experienced difficulty swimming back to the beach. There were no lifeguards at the beach or at the pools. One family member was badly stung by a jellyfish while on Palomino Island, and when she went to the First Aid station, she was told she would have to wait a half hour for a medic to arrive from the mainland. The main pools at the top of the cliff were very crowded and by the end of the day they were dirty and had pieces of food floating in them. We all wound up hanging out at the Las Olas pool or the pool down in the marina section, as they were cleaner, less crowded, and more peaceful. Don't even bother eating at any of the resort's restaurants - we thought the food is horrible and grossly overpriced! The first night at the resort we all ate dinner at Otello's, the resort's Italian restaurant. The food was mediocre and very salty. The next night we ate at the rehearsal dinner and the quality of the food was also mediocre to poor. The following night the hor doerves at the wedding cocktail hour were horrendous. For example, the empanadas had no filling - they were just empty pieces of dough! The resort did not provide enough entrees at the wedding reception dinner - even though they were provided with an accurate guest count several weeks prior to the wedding! The wedding dinner consisted of either filet mignon/lobster or chicken/sea bass with a mound of disgusting potatoes and overcooked veggies. The meals were basically inedible. The wedding cake was terrible - the icing was like a full sheet of cardboard - no one could eat it! The coffee was served cold at both the rehearsal dinner and the wedding reception. For the remainder of our stay, we ate outside the resort and had delicious food every time for a LOT LESS MONEY! In order to reach the ferry to Palomino Island or the Las Olas and Las Marinas pools, you have to take a cable railway called a funicular to get up and down the cliff. There are two funiculars. Two days before we went home, the one funicular broke down and was out of service the rest of our stay. The other funicular happened to break down while we were in it (it was overcrowded since the other funicular was not operating) and halfway up the cliff and we were stuck in it for a while, which was a little unnerving to say the least! There is no other way to get up and down the cliff.

Also they dont have young waitress there, the one that serve us was mad looking and she didn't even offer water.they made us wait like to ours for our food and she wanted a $20 tip/ whatttttt you know people like that realy damage the whole hotel.", "Date": "August 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Joe, LA", "Title": "\u201cGreat 3 day get away\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2348041", "Content": "Great 3 day get away for my 17 year old and me from July 28-31.

I have to say, it was an amazing experience overall. We arrived around midnight, so we really didn't get a full appreciation for the amazing views until the next morning. With Wyndham By Request, we got a free upgrade to a deluxe ocean front room. I must admit I was dissapointed with the room that night- it was clean and comfortable, but not as nice as I would expect, and in need of an update. When I woke up the next morning and stepped out onto the balcony however, I was blown away by the breathtaking view of the ocean! It made me feel better about the room, and besides, when you're in a tropical paradise, does it really matter what color the carpet is or the pattern of the couch in your room??? We spent the first 2 days of the trip on Palomino Island. We took advantage of a 2 for 1 offer we had for watersports, and rented out a Waverunner for an hour. It started to storm about 15 minutes into our time, and we were called back onto the shore. As soon as the weather cleared (about 15 minutes) they let us back out, and gave us another full hour even though we had already used some of our time. Lots of fun!!! That afternoon, we took a horseback tour around the island, and up to the highest point of the hills. Gorgeous views, and also alot of fun. Next day was a discovery scuba diving excursion. I would highly recommend this if you would like a taste of scubadiving without going through the certification process. Every meal we ate at this resort was good to excellent, with the exception of the breakfast buffet at Las Brisas. THe buffet was overpriced, and the food was lousy. It was also overrun with blackbrids, who are not shy about flying up to your table and taking food from your plate! We ate at Blossoms twice, and loved the sushi and tepenyaki tables. Isabella's was a wonderful restaurant- very quiet and romantic, and the food was outstanding. I was thrilled with this hotel, and would love to go back!

Normally, I would have choose a smaller, more quaint hotel, but the Expedia package was reasonably priced. Yes, the food, shops, and parking is definitely expensive. I would recommend having a rental car (most tours only pickup from San Juan area hotels only). Compare prices before buying stuff in the hotel shops. Traffic between the hotel and San Juan is heavy, but not bad elsewhere (save your coins for toll roads, or use the right toll booths marked with a C (for change). Check with the concierge about dining specials if you do eat there. I was also told that if you rented an AVIS car (I don't think it needs to be from the hotel), there is no charge for parking (unfortunately I had Hertz and paid $10 day for self-park). You can easily avoid the crowds by swimming early in the morning or at night (pool is open 24hrs.) and going to private island on one of the first three boats (starts at 9:00a) and returning about 1:00p or so when it start to get crowded (no waiting at all). I found the staff reasonably friendly, maintenance and cleanliness acceptable. We tracked in alot of sand in our room (we had our own snorkel equipt. which saved $15 per person to rent) and they did a great job of cleaning our room each time. Don't miss the Bio Bay kayak night tour with Las Tortuga Tours (formerly Caribe Kayak - you can walk to the starting point) and I highly recommend a snorkel trip by Monkey Island on Frank Lopez's boat Pasedores in nearby Playa Naguabo.

After spending 5 nights (mid July) with my wife and two children (10 and 13) I now understand why. There are some excellent features that this resort has to offer, but there are many poor aspects that can turn people off. Depending on what bothers you or what pleases you, you will either love this resort or hate it. I will describe the negatives first. I booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four for free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package that included a fifth night free, free breakfast for two, and free round-trip transfers for two. The cost was $229 per night plus $50 in taxes that was clearly documented on the Wyndham website. Breakfast is an all you can eat buffet and normally $22 for adults, $10 for children. They charged us $80 for the kids transfers, and the kids either had a piece of fruit or cereal($2) for breakfast, so according to my calculations, my net cost per night was $243 (including breakfast and transfers). This I find to be a fair price, but almost everything else at this resort is excessively higher than the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair market value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and marginally higher than other resorts we have been to. For example, in San Juan, or NY, or Boston, a dinner entr\u00c3\u00a9e in a premium restaurant is $18-24. At the El Conquistador expect to pay $30-40. I looked in every night to find only 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 people in any of these restaurants (10% full). What is management thinking? Drop the price of an entr\u00c3\u00a9e by $10 and you will probably double your volume, make a nice profit and you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn people off. Also, the parking lot was full so I expect many of the guests eat outside the resort. Fortunately there are 5 caf\u00c3\u00a9 type restaurants in the resort at $15-20, but again the fair value for a caf\u00c3\u00a9 is $8-15. The cafes had about 10 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 20 people when we ate (30% full). At the El Conq., $3.50 for a stale kiddie cup of ice cream. A kiddie cup of ice-cream is $1.70 at my local Baskin Robbins. Bottled water is $2 at the resort, but $3 on Palomino island where you really need it. This island is part of the resort. The fact that they charge 50% more than they do at the main resort and 300% more than outside the resort is a real turn off. Also I paid three different prices for a Medallia beer ($4.50,$5,$6) depending on where I was. A martini was $10, a mudslide $7 or $8 depending where also. I think drink prices should be consistent throughout a resort. Use of the steamroom/sauna/spa/fitness center is $25 per day. I never had to pay for the use of these facilities at any other resort including the Wyndham Martineau. They do have a free fitness center, but the equipment is low quality and there is not even a single TV. A 50 minute massage is $110 (in NY $60-$90) and they assigned me a male therapist when I requested a female. Also the rain forest tour from the resort is $50 per person. This would cost me $200! An economy rental car from the resort is $70, but from Thrifty $40 (which is 10 minutes away and they pick you up and drop you off for free). We rented the car from Thrifty and toured the rainforest on our own for free! We stopped at Luqillo beach on the way back and had huge TACOS and Pina Coladas for $1 each. Other bad aspects I should point out is the lack of maintenance. Although the lobby is 5 star quality, as soon as you enter the Las Brisas wing you will notice chipped tiles, rusted metals, peeling and fading paint, and torn carpets everywhere. Also, being a large resort with many children, the pools need extra attention to keep clean. Again, this is poor management. Hire a full time maintenance crew! Believe me, they can afford it. They are pouring money into an expansion of the Las Casistas wing, but they neglect the rest of the resort. Noise is also a problem. You will have trouble sleeping, as all the doors need to be forced hard to close. The slamming of the doors in any of the rooms near yours causes your own room to shake! The doors are old and of poor quality, and offer no sound insulation. This would not be too much of a problem if people walking the halls late at night would whisper, but unfortunately many people are inconsiderate. Also, why in the world does Wyndham feature high powered stereos in the rooms? Management, please remove all the stereos! They also cause the walls to vibrate and unfortunately many people are inconsiderate playing the stereo loud late at night. The express check in (Wyndham By Request) offered no advantage. Although the line was smaller than the regular check in, there was only one person working express and five at the regular desk. I noticed a couple who arrived at the same time as me actually checked in faster at the regular check in. I waited 20 minutes for two people in front of me. If they had some kind of problem, an additional staffer should have been pulled off the regular check in. Again, management. Communication: Where are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chalk boards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd listing the daily events or specials? We stumbled upon a movie at the main pool. Missed the first half because there was no mention. Also no mention of happy hour (2-3pm)at the main pool bar. $3 pina coladas. Also from 5-7pm $5 margaritas at the Mexican restaurant with free chips and salsa. Only a small note in the window. Glad I saw it. The Mexican restaurant also has a HUGE plate of NACHOS for $10. This was my dinner one night, excellent! Noticed a live band playing in the lobby/bar one night during a late night walk. Would have liked to catch the earlier set, but again no mention. Management? Now the good part. Join Wyndham by request. You will need every advantage possible to override the negatives. We received a free upgrade to an ocean view with balcony, amazing views! In fact, the whole resort is built into a cliff and the views from the upper pool and caf\u00c3\u00a9 are also amazing! The welcome snack was a small bottle of wine and a bag of nuts. Probably cost Wyndham $3 but it hit the spot. The Mexican restaurant was a fair value. Palomino island is great with calm, but very salty waters for snorkeling (although fair visibility), excellent hiking trails (I saw a huge IGUANA), and amazing views from the top. If you are in shape, you can hike to some secluded beaches on the other side and have the whole place to yourself. Spa treatments are 20% off between 12-3pm and they waive the $25 fee if you book a treatment. Hint: book a 25 min treatment during this time and it will cost you only $40 and you can use the spa facilities (steam,sauna,jacuzzi,fitness,classes) all day. In conclusion, I do expect to pay a premium for food,drink, etc. at a resort, but not 100%. I expect a good nights sleep and well maintained grounds. The fantastic views are the only thing this resort has going for it. We stayed at all Wyndham properties during a 10 night trip. The El Conquistador during the first part (5 nights). \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Vieques(2 nights) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Old San Juan(3 nights) .

Plus, when we returned home (we went from July 6th to July 11th), she showed me the reviews of others, so I felt I had to set the record straight. This Hotel is beautiful. Period. Its not a 5 star hotel, but who cares. Its faults are for the most part meaningless (chipped paint here and there, etc.) and will not affect your enjoyment of the amenities and the facilities. It has everything you would want and expect on a trip to the Caribbean. However, if you only love the beach and are not a pool lover, you might be disappointed since the beach, although on a beautiful private island, is a 20 minute boat ride away, which I'll get to later. The staff was friendly and helpful, housekeeping was fine, and the Concierge was excellent - always willing to help, make reservations, etc. It does help to be a Wyndham by Request member as you get certain upgrades, a wlecome package, and no charge for local and calling card calls from the room, and other little perks. We stayed at the Las Brisas wing which I feel was the best location - close to the pool, funicular (tram like ride to the Marina discussed below), lobby, casino, etc. The room was fine (certainly larger than a standard hotel room), with 2 phones, TV, DVD player, a rather large bathroom, and a great balcony - at night you can hear the frogs. Although no location is bad, I personally would avoid the rooms down by the marina since you have to take the funicular to get to the main hotel, and although its reliable and only a short ride, it might get annoying over a 4 or 5 day vacation. However, if you want to avoid the main hotel the pool down by the marina was fine, there was food and shopping down there, and you are that much closer to the ferry to the beach. The main pool area, which is where we spent most of our time, was as nice as any hotel I have seen. We went to Hawaii for our Honeymoon and stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels, and this pool area was as nice an any of those, and the views were unquestionably the best. The Hotel is on a cliff with the pool area facing the ocean, and you can see crystal clear blue Caribbean as far as the eye can see, while sitting in the pool! The main pool area consisted of 3 large pools surrounded by tropical flowers and palm trees, with plenty of lounge chairs to go around, even on the weekend when it got crowded. One pool had a kiddie water slide and a volleyball net. There were jacuzzis all over in secluded little places, and the entire pool area is open 24 hours a day (no lifeguards though so if you go with kids be careful). The beach was on a private island that you had to get to by ferry (no charge). The boats run about every half hour and we had no problem despite what other reviewers said. Plenty of water sports to choose from (snorkeling, sailing, waverunners, scuba diving, etc.) but they were pricey, although not much more pricey than you would find at any other resort. The funicular that takes you from the main hotel down to the marina (its the only way to get there) was fine and again we encountered no problems despite what other reviews said. The golf course was beautiful and very well maintained, but very challenging. It was a hilly course, but keeping with the theme of the hotel - breathtaking views. I played twice, both times at 4:00 when it was only $55/round (including cart), which is inexpensive even by stateside public course standards. The fee before then is $160/round, which is about standard for resorts. The only downside to playing at 4:00 is that the course is a little slower than the morning since thats when the novices come out (because its cheaper I guess), but I was still able to get in a full round in under four hours (before sunset) both days. One advantage of the afternoon however, is that its not as hot as in the morning - I spoke to other golfers who said its very hot in the morning, and I did not find it that bad. While I golfed one day my wife went to the Golden Door Spa which was very pricey ($75 for a pedicure and $25 for a manicure, with a 20% required gratuity on top of that). She said it was fine but no better or worse than any spa state side. There is plenty of on-site shopping ranging from T-shirt and sundry shops to expensive jewelry stores. The casino was fine - it had plenty of slots and all the usual table games. Although I thought it was small at first glance, it never got crowded - even on Saturday night we easily got a seat at a $10 blackjack table and it would have only been a short wait for a $5 table. Any other time sitting at a $5 table was no problem. The restaurants were good but pricey, although again probably typical for Caribeean resorts. There were a lot of restaurants though so choice was not an issue. Definitely try to get the buffet breakfast included (which we did). The dinner portions were rather small and you never go away stuffed, except for when I had the Porterhouse at Isabella's. My wife had the salmon which was not good and although she sent it back it did not improve, and they did not take it off the bill, although they did offer to make her something else. But I bet if I pushed it they would have taken it off. Interestingly, one night in the ice cream shop they brought us chicken fingers instead of wings - they corrected the order and did not charge us for the wings. We did find the best lunch value to be at Cafe Bella Vista. All in all I highly recommend this resort to anyone looking to have a fun, relaxing, and enjoyable Caribbean vacation.

We were very nervous after having read all of the reviews, but we had a fabulous time! We did EXTENSIVELY read these reviews ahead of time, so I'm going to try to be as helpful as others were for us. Overall, the hotel is great. It is comperable to a 3 1/2-4 star hotel. Yes, it could have used paint here and there, the rooms could have been updated, and yes, it was occassionally dirty, but not enough to interfere with our enjoyment. My first bit of advice is to join Wyndham By Request. We got an upgraded room- \"deluxe ocean view\" in LaVista. It was a huge room with a fabulous view of Palomino Island. The bathroom was nice with a private toilet area. Our friends were in La Brista- their room was equally nice (it was almost identical to ours) with an even better view. Their advantage was that they were closer to everything, but we were quite pleased with our room. And many of the posts commented on a musty smell in the rooms- we never smelled it. The rooms weren't spotlessly clean, but they were certainly more than acceptable. Another advantage to Wyndham By Request is that 800# calls are free from your room. (they're normally $2.00/call). We bought a calling card at Costco for $20.00 for 670 minutes- we could talk to our kids easily that way! When we got there, there was water and fresh fruit (as we had requested) in the room along with extra pillows. So definitely join!! We found the service at the hotel to be quite excellent. Our room was made up every day by 1:00. They restocked shampoo, etc. every day as long as the old bottles were out of sight. There were waitresses walking around the pool areas asking if we wanted a drink. The concierce was very helpful. The pool area was beautiful- so lush and tropical!! We were there from a Tuesday-Sunday, and never had a problem finding chairs under an umbrella even! And no, we didn't get to the pool at 7:00 am- it was closer to 11 each day. By Saturday, it did get more crowded and there were a LOT more kids! (we did put our towels and books down before we had breakfast at 9:30, and they were there when we got to the pool by 11:30) But Wed-Fri. was very quiet at the pool- we found a little side area, and it almost felt like our private pool. We spent hours in the pool, not sitting in our chairs, and we never had a problem with someone taking them. Each day, we got an arm band identifing us as guests at the hotel- on the weekends, they really monitored them. I looked around, and every person I saw at the pool was wearing a band, so I can't imagine that it was open to the public (as I had read on earler posts). You have to hand in a towel card and they give you a towel. Every day, I asked for 2 towels- they always told me it was 1 towel per guest, but then they gave me 2 anyway. So ask! Drinks at the pool are expensive, but wait for 2:00-3:00 pm for Happy Hour- they're $3.00. The pool is open 24 hours- we went swimming one night- it was so fun! One day we were sitting under a roof, and by afternoon, it did smell musty. We didn't find that any other place at the pool area. The food was good. It was expensive and the portions were small, but overall we had a good experience. We ate at Isabella's-nice atmosphere- expensive but elegant. We loved our food and the quantity there was big, but our friend ordered salmon, and it wasn't cooked enough. She sent it back, and it still wasn't done, and they didn't do anything to make it right for her. We also ate at Otello's-delicious Italian food, another elegant restaurant, pricey, but smaller servings. We did the Mexican restaurant one night- it was empty. Again, decent food, ok portion size. We ate a dinner one night at the ice cream place- Cafe Caribe. Small portions but good food. This one is more reasonably priced, but it is an ice cream parlor. We tried a Puerto Rican dish- rice with chicken and spices- very good! And the ice cream was delicious! We ate at La Brista for lunch almost every day- good sandwiches and pasta salad- my friend and I split a sandwich each day, and it was the perfect size. We did eat at the Bally Hoo bar one day for lunch- good food (the conch fritters were excellent!). We were discussing different appetizers, and the waitress said we could get a sampler (it wasn't listed on the menu). She told us it was good for 4 people- we didn't find it big enough for 4 as our only lunch, but the food was good. For breakfast, our package included the buffet at Las Brisas- it was the same food for 5 days! The omlet station was SLOW every day (and worse on the weekends). There was a bit of a knat problem on our first morning (kind of disgusting, actually), but they must have done something, because it wasn't a problem the rest of the time. It is outdoor seating, so the birds are very agressive- but really, it's not a reflection on the hotel. The breakfast was fine. One thing to be aware of- the dress in the evenings is very fancy. Men are expected to wear pants and women are expected to dress up. And they did! We were expecting Caribbean casual (shorts and a nice shirt), but it wasn't. My husband had only brought 2 pair of pants, and he needed them every night. Palomino Island was beautiful! We had no problems with the ferry- it was nice taking a boat ride! The island itself was fun. We couldn't find an umbrella (we got there around 11:30), so we rented one for $10.00. They brought it over and set it up for us. The activities seemed expensive, but it is a resort. We rented a wave runner for an hour- split it between the 2 couples, and it was the perfect amount of time. The Caribbean was crystal clear, as expected. It was shelly, though- tough to walk in. I would suggest wearing flipflops that can get wet or water shoes. If you are die-hard beach peole, this hotel isn't for you, as you do have to work to get to the island. The casino lived up to the \"Caribbean Curse\"- we lost, as we have at every Caribbean casino we've been to. There were $5.00 tables, and we had no problems getting a spot. It's small and smokey but never crowded. There wasn't much else to do at night, particulary during the week. We went to the Magic Show- it was wonderful! I think it runs 2x per week- we really enjoyed that. There was dancing in the nightclub Casablana, but we never went and really didn't see anyone else in there. On Friday and Saturday, there were piano players throughout the lobby and a band. We did go on a sunset cruise one night- it was NOT worth $63.00pp- it was a small sailboat with minimal food and drink- we were soaking wet by the time we were done. We never had a problem with the funiculars as some people mentioned. They were in constant motion and we never saw them broken down. Many of the guests were Spanish-speaking. We were told that in the summer, tourism is down, so they run specials for the locals to stay there. It wasn't a problem- just odd to not hear English! One person told us that this is one of the premier resorts on the island and that many families come for their vacations here. Apparantly Mariah Carrey and Michael Jordan (and other basketball players) own places in Las Casitas. Shopping was good- a lot of touristy stuff- t-shirts, towels, etc. We did buy some Lladro- the prices seemed good (and there is not tax). I came home and checked the prices on line- they actually were very good. My husband bought a watch band for a Breitling he has- also priced well. Rum, however, was much cheaper at the San Juan airport. I spent an afternoon at the spa- it was very nice- good facial and reflexology. I've been to a number of high-quality spas, and this was one of the best. Our friend golfed- said it was a GREAT course. He'll probably write a review also, but he went 2 days after 4:00- very cheap and not as hot! We would absolutley recommend this hotel (unless you are true beach people- it takes awhile to get to the beach or true snobs that can't be happy unless you're only at a 5-star hotel). Several of my friends, when I returned home, asked me if my husband, who is used to travelling in really NICE places, was happy with the resort. He was. The food was expensive, but we expected that at any resort. The staff was helpful and courteous- especially in the restaurants. The rooms were bigger than normal rooms. The pool area is gorgeous- so tropical! And the views- AMAZING! Being on a cliff really makes this an elegant, beautiful resort. When it was first opened, it must have been truly magnificent- now it is just really, really nice.

It you self park your car- it is $10 per day- if you Valet- it is $15/day. The parking lot is a short walk away so be prepared to walk in the heat. Our room was in the La Vista wing. It was a very nice room with a King size bed and a queen size pull out sofa bed. The ceilings were high and we had a large outdoor room (terrace). The room was ocean front. The views were breathtaking. The bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels and the mini bar was nicely stocked as well.

This ride was convenient and quick. The beach itself was nothing to speak of. Lots of coral so the swimming is not so great. The sand is white but there is so much coral in it, it is not for lying or playing in. We ate lunch at Las Brisas restaurant. $66 for 2 adults and 1 child. The food was only ok.The virgin Pina Colada was to die for though! The grounds are gorgeous. The swimming pools are beautiful and clean. The hot-tubs need to be cleaned more often. Upon closer inspection, upper walls in the corridors were covered in mold! The resort definitly has its pros and cons and is not perfect. I do recommend going just for the experience. But go during the off season and get a low rate!", "Date": "July 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sayreville, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cA nice vacation, but was it worth the money?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2269532", "Content": "My family and I just returned from a one week stay at the El Conquistador (June 26-July 3, 2004). I read many of the reviews before we left, and, by and large, they were helpful. We stayed at the Atlantis last year and several 4/5 star hotels in Disney in prior years, so my comparisons are based on those experiences. Overall, the hotel does need a face lift. There is a lot of green mold on parts of the structure that should be sparkling white, which gives an overall shabby appearance. The staff was very nice and friendly, although their services, particularly housekeeping, were definitely not up to par. We are Wyndham By Request members, and we got the three rooms we asked for in the Las Vistas part of the hotel, which is reportedly the most recently renovated. It was quiet during the week, and very, very noisy on the weekends. Also, we found that if you do not keep the air conditioning on very high, the rooms smell musty. We were on the meal plan for four of the seven nites and dined at Stingrays, Otello (twice) and Isabela's. The first two were good (not great), the third (which is supposed to be the \"signature\" restaurant), was marginal, at best. My son had a dead fly on his salad plate. They took it away and bought us a round of drinks. The breakfast buffet at Las Brisas, although the same EVERY single day, was sufficient, although it costs $20 per head during the week and $21 on the weekend. The only difference is that they have someone carving ham on the weekend. She was totally disengaged and had to be asked several times if you wanted a bit more than the sliver of ham she offered. Also, the omelet line was so long on the weekend that you could easily spend twenty minutes waiting. Palomino Island was beautiful-- be sure to bring water shoes, your own snorkeling equipment and blow-up tubes. The rates for the banana boat and jet ski were exactly the same as I have seen at other resorts. The funicular and ferry service was fine. The casino is small, and it gets very crowded on the weekend. Nothing for the kids to do, except for an outdated game room which didn't have any games for a twelve year old (the games were geared toward younger children). The taxes and tariffs they add to the room rates are amazing....we wound up paying $320 a nite for rooms booked at $269 per nite. In short, although we had a very nice vacation,I wouldn't go back because I do not think we got anywhere near what we paid for, particularly given the fact that it is off-season.", "Date": "July 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNot good\u201d", "Author": "shellyewton", "ReviewID": "UR2249050", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here in Feb. of 2004.

I, like many, read numerous reviews of the hotel and was feeling very skeptical of my hotel choice. My only advice ... know what you are paying for! The rooms (at least in Las Brisas) were old, outdated and musty and the food was entirely too expensive. The funicular (similar to a cable car that transports guests to parts of the hotel at the bottom of the cliff) can be inconvenient and crowded. But ... the views are breathtaking. And Palimino Island is a MUST SEE! It is like having your own secluded beach. The water is crystal clear with varying shades of turquoise and blue that linger off into the distance. Be aware, there is a large reef/rock that surrounds much of the island (at least by the beach), therefore, there is not much room to do any swimming. But the hotel provides comfortable beach chairs, many of which are situated under grass roofed huts or swaying palm trees. If you are the kind of person that enjoys an emmaculate hotel room and feel you would dislike the inconvenince of traveling on the funicular or catching the ferry to Palimino Island, then this resort is not for you. But, if you are adventurous and enjoy beautiful grounds and are attracted by the idea of having your own secluded beach then you can't miss with the Wyndham El Conquistador. If you choose to stay at this hotel, I would recomend renting a car rather than taking the shuttle to the hotel. We were able to go out and pick up snacks and drinks to save on expenses. We also tried to take a travel size cooler to Palimino, but were told that coolers were not allowed. Quick fix - put all of your drinks in a bag or backpack and when you get to the island ask for a bucket of ice at the bar. They commonly hand these buckets out to guests that are buying bottles of beer. One last thing ... which left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth ... be aware that the resort tacks on additional tax and tariff charges. We ended up paying $40 extra per night in addition to our room rate. That sucked!! All this resort needs is a few extra dollars spent on remodeling the outdated hotel rooms and it would be close to perfect.

My biggest and only complaint is that we didn't book a longer stay. I almost cried when I left, which expresses how much I absolutely enjoyed everything. To start, we were greeted and bags were taken from us during check in. The woman who checked us in was very helpful, positive, and cheery. We felt very welcomed and appreciated. The room was neat and clean, not like some of the reviews stated as being old and could use upholstering. The only problem was that we received a room that wasn't to our likings. First off, the room was overlooking the marina, which could present a problem because of the noise from the boats, and secondly, the TV was not working properly. The repairman, who was already in our room trying to fix the problem made every attempt to accomodate us. He assured that he'd do everything possible to correct the problem at hand. Still all in all, we felt we needed to know what our options were. He referred us to specific rooms that not only were quieter but also more spacious with better views. When the front desk called our room to check on satisfaction, we told them of our dilemma at hand and they directed us to return to the front desk and all would be rectified. We asked for a room change, and the changes were made with no hassles or extra charges. The room that was referred to us by the repairman was situated at the far left end of the first marina area with huge terrace, view of pool, and oceanview directly to Palomino Island, and to our satisfaction no loud boats. Housekeeping changed our linens and supplies as requested everyday, unlike some of the reviews aforementioned. They also checked on us in the evening to see if we needed extra towels and supplies. Now if that isn't service, I don't know what is. We've both traveled to a few places together and separately as well, and we both agree that this was our best vacation. From the breathtaking views of the property, to the polite and knowlegeable staff, to the welcome basket of Merlot wine and platter of fruits and cheeses, we can say we were treated as royalty. If we both had time and money, we'd book another trip for next month. We need a minimum at best of six whole days to enjoy this place. We must admit, it does help to become a member of the Wyhndham by Request Preferred Member. After experiencing this majestic place for ourselves, we've concluded that some people just have to complain about everything or just in need of attention. Either they may be bored at home, or bitter about something because there is no need to have anything negative to utter about this resort. Its a 4-5 star hotel, you'd expect to pay a little more for food and the extras. Its a massive establishment, you'd expect to take elevators, funiculars, escalators, and long walks from your room to the lobby. Its location is in a country where the native tongue is Spanish, you'd expect for some to not understand everything you are saying. Speaking of service, we ate at Bella Casa. I had a chicken salad in which a fly landed on one of the leaves in my salad. Were there any problems in taking that off the bill? No problems no drama!!!! It was removed from the bill and our table with apologies. When our drinks were finished, there were always refills without even needing to signal the waiters/waitresses. Ultimately, we had to take the time to write this because if you are planning to make your vacation stay at this resort, you've made an excellent vacation choice and will enjoy yourselves as we did.

We decided that it would be worth our $$$ to stay at a Quality resort, boy was I totally wrong picking this place. Overall we were very dissatisfied with this place. First day there we arrived about 1:30pm to check in and they told us our room would not be ready till 4:00pm. I had also provided them with my membership card for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wyndham by Request\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd card, for early check in but it seem to do nothing for us. I would check every hour and our room was still not ready so we just hung around and explored the place. We used their main Jacuzzi and it was very dirty. I could feel sand at the bottom of the Jacuzzi floor and things were floating around the top, pretty gross! After being there three hours we finally went up again to the lobby to see if our room was ready and it finally was, but by this time it was way over 4pm. We headed for our room down in the Marina section. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 15-20 minute walk there and to get there you need to take a couple elevators and the funicular. It is a ways there. Once we got to our room it was like a mini suite, large high ceilings, a mini living room, a wet bar and a large master bathroom with a closet and a safe. There was also a nice balcony overlooking the marina with French doors (The window pane of the French door had a major crack in it). I loved the CD/stereo with large speakers. Overall a nice room. The bad thing was that Wyndham by Request had asked me for my favorite drinks and snacks before hand and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anything remotely close to what I had requested. It was as they totally ignored my request. Another bad thing about the rooms is that the walls are very thin and you could hear your neighbors next door. The resort is enormous and the only way to get to the main part of the hotel is by taking the funicular which can be a pain. Especially since one evening we were all dressed up to go to dinner and the funicular broke down on our way there. We were stuck in it for 30 minutes, which made us late for dinner. We had made reservations at Otello\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Word of caution, DON\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T order the steaks there, we had to take ours back twice because the steak was full of bristles and fat and for such an expensive piece of meat ($34 a plate) you would think they would have a decent cut. The service was good but the food was terrible! We were so upset by the bad food we walked out and the waiter chased us down to the concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk. The waiter ended up comp-ing us for our food which was nice thing he did for us. Also if you go to Palomino Island and if you plan to take your own food or drinks hide it all or they will stop you from taking it with you. We were unfortunate to find that out. We knew the food and drinks would be way over priced ($7) for a drink, so we took our own little cooler with water sodas and snacks. As we were getting ready to go on the ferry they stopped us and told us no coolers allowed on the island. Our little cooler looked like a regular bag, but of course they want you to spend on their expensive food and drinks since you are held captive on that island. Also the coffee in the room is awful, so one morning we went to their little caf\u00c3\u00a9 bakery place grab a regular cup of coffee on a Styrofoam cup which is only about 4 oz or coffee and they wanted $3.00 for that! We decided to rent a car for the most part another bad thing is that they charge you $10 to park your car in their parking lots even if you stay there you still have to pay for parking. Anyway, we would go to the local small marina town close to the hotel and we would have a wonderful full breakfast with coffee and all and even with orange juice and it would be under $6.00 for the both of us. That place was awesome, and you get to be with the real people of Puerto Rico. The place is called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Marina Bakery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they also serve lunch there and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next to a liquor store. That liquor store has happy hour after the locals get off of work. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blast. Very interesting for I have never seen a liquor store doing a happy hour. Only in Puerto Rico! The casino is okay, not very big and the tables really get packed on a weekend night. The tables are very expensive to play on. Most start at $10 and up. Only one night did I see $5 black jack tables and I believe that was on a Monday night. The shops are okay to look at but everything is so inflated. I seen a pair of flip flop sandals that I liked and they wanted $49 for them and I had seen the exact pair out here in the states for $19.99. Also their bikinis suits are insane. They wanted $40 for the bottom and $40 for the top. If you have that kind of money to blow then by all means. Overall the place is way overpriced and is sort of outdated. All the different building areas of the hotel were so different, nothing matched which led me to believe that at one time there were different hotels and the Wyndham bought them all out and just kept them the way they are. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a shame that they have outdone themselves in the quantity of the place but lost out in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd department. If you are expecting QUALITY at this place, you will sorely be disappointed. It just looks awesome when you first arrive but once your living there you realize that your were better off staying at a Motel 6, because you will get the same quality but for a lot less $$$$.

We had a really wonderful time. I did so much research before hand, especially this website, which was so helpful. I hope my recap helps... So... Everything you've written about this resort is true (good and bad). - (bad) Unless you are situated in Las Vistas or Las Casitas, expect a musty outdated room. We joined Wyndham by Request before arriving, and thank goodness we were upgrated to a beautiful, fantastic room with an ocean view. No complaints from us, but you should have seen the facilities on the lower levels. - (good) The spa was FANTASTIC! We went twice and had great experiences (massage, facial). They even gave us 20% off for messing up our reservation (worth the inconvenience of rescheduling since everthing at the spa is expensive). - (bad) And speaking of lower levels, the funiculars (two) were often broken down. One night after raining (they break down more often in the rain), we turned around and decided not to chance it because one or both were often out of order. - (good) The beach on Palomino Island is incredible. You feel like Gilligan himself. It is definitely worth the ferry ride! Do NOT miss the horseback ride. The views are spectacular, and the guides are super friendly (and knowledgable). - (bad) The staff is a little confused. I asked the CONCIERGE if I could purchase wine to bring back to my room. I was told no, then walked about 100 yards and found wine being sold in the lobby store! - (good) The shops were great. Don't miss the jewelery store on the way to the funicular. It just looks expensive. They have very reasonable items that make impressive gifts. Tell Robert Kelly from New York says hello! Great swimsuit stores, too, suits that you don't find in every department store. I wished I'd waited to swimsuit shop there (and comparably priced). - (bad) The food. Although the food at the fancy restaurants is great, and you feel it's worth the money ($25+up entrees), you just cannot get an inexpensive meal. The $13 salad from the Iguana Cafe was one of the blandest plates of lettuce I've ever eaten. After reading TripAdvisor, I had the foresight to bring a box of granola bars and some snacks for midday, so we got off easier than if we had to eat 3 meals, but even a quick lunch was ridiculously expensive ($12 hamburgers poolside). I'm accustomed to paying a lot for food, living in NY, but I actually felt taken advantage of paying this kind of money. - (good) Other than the staff being confused, they were all very, very nice and attentive. Any requests for service were met quickly (don't forget to tip). - (bad/good) Happy Hour was the best value around. 1/2 price drinks poolside from 2-3! Great value. But I do have a complaint about the drinks. Okay, Pina Coladas were supposedly invented in Puerto Rico. Yet, the drinks were made from prepackaged mixes, made here in the states! I felt sort of gyped, like it wasn't really an authentic Pina Colada. - (good) Great casino! The people could not be nicer, and they had plenty of $5 Blackjack tables. - (good) The airport transports were a breeze, but a little slow. Figure about an hour in transit from the airport, but the bus waits until it's full, so it might take up to 2 hours to finally arrive. Here's an extra tip: If you want an authentic Puerto Rican meal (you simply CANNOT find one at any of the restaurants at this resort!), here's what we did: On the day of our departure, we left early, checked into the airport about 4 hours before our flight, then took a 20 minute cabride to Old San Juan where we toured the forts and had a fantastic (authentic) lunch. We also had time to souvenior shop before jumping into a cab (lots available) back to the airport. Well, that's all I can think of for now. Hope this helps.

Before going, we read numerous reviews of the property on this site and others. As you will note, the reviews are incredibly inconsistent; either people greatly disliked it or loved it. Although the reviews were helpful, we did not feel they provided enough detail or hints to make our stay better. Therefore, we have spent the time to assemble this comprehensive review of the hotel, its restaurants, etc. and to provide help hints & advice. To put this review in perspective, we have stayed at a number of the most common and highly rated resorts in the mainland US (e.g. Phoenician, Ritz Laguna Nigiel), Hawaii (e.g. Hyatt Kauai, Hilton Waikoloa, Ritz Kapalua) and the Caribbean (e.g. Peter Island, Hyatt Aruba, Westin Grand Cayman). So I think we are able to put the hotel in perspective; at least for couples without kids (but I will try to provide advice for families as well). Flight & Transfers We flew into PRU on NWA, non-stop from Detroit. Arrived at around 2:45pm, waited 1 hour for our bags, hailed a cab around 4:00pm. Typical beat up minivan cab. It was Friday and we hit rush hour, so it took a solid 1 hour 15 minutes to get to the hotel, if not longer. The road to the Wyndham is always crowded, since it is not a freeway, so plan for at least 1 hour. The one-way trip cost $82, without tip (I was surprised how expensive, hotel tells you it will cost $65 for a taxi (they were wrong)). Advice: You should definitely factor in the taxi cost, when deciding whether to rent a car. We have been to PR many times, so we did not want to leave resort. But if you think you will use the car, then rent it. Savings on taxi will almost pay for it. (Note: Hotel charges self-park fee of $10 per day; unless you rent from Hotel Avis desk). Spoke to one lady who took Wyndham bus, since it was part of her package. Said it was normally $60 per person, round-trip. She said bus was old and bumby ride; but the buses we saw looked nice. Package We stayed on the four for free deal; paid $359 per night for a regular room, got the fourth night free. Nothing else was included. As an alternative (especially for families), the fifth night free deal sounded good b/c it included breakfast and transfers. Note: All of the packages are for regular rooms only. Also, there is a 21% tax per night. They said at time of booking that they would charge you the tax even on the free night. They made a mistake and charged me for all four nights, told them on check-out and they quickly corrected it. I think I lucked out, b/c when they removed the fourth night charge, they also removed the fourth night tax. Wyndham By Request You absolutely should sign up for Wyndham by request. You can sign-up via Wyndham.com. There is no cost. By signing up, you get a free upgrade and free food & drink amenity. When we arrived, we received an upgraded room (see below); 4 bottles of Dasani water; and four pieces of whole fruit. The website let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s you choose from a variety of food and drink. Advice: Go for the water, you can always drink that warm the next day (beer will do you no good warm), and you will always want water. Go for the whole fruit, especially if you have kids or if breakfast is not included in your package. They originally brought us two bottles of water and two cokes. I called and had the coke substituted. Advice: We drank tab water at lunch and dinner. It was fine and tasted normal. Villages and Wings I could not believe the inconsistent reviews with respect to rooms. I dismissed it as different people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taste and prior hotel experiences. But I have found out the truth, it depends upon which wing and which room you have. Below are comments about each area of the hotel, and we attempted to explore and peek into at least one room in each village of the hotel. Las Olas (Bad): Half way down the funicular (see below for description of funicular), couple stories tall. The only way to reach this level is via the funicular. Not many rooms, area is isolated and quiet, but do not accept a room in this village. The whole area is old and rusty. Granted, we did not look into a room, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care what the room looked like b/c the outside areas were similar to an old Holiday Inn. Las Brisas (Bad): This is on the upper level (main level). It is the East Wing of the hotel. I swear, this used to be a college dorm. It is old, paint outside exteriors is falling off in chunks. Had a dorm feel and smell. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept a room in this wing/village. Granted, this is probably the best location in the hotel to have a room. Right near the funicular, in the middle of everything you want. It also has a very nice garden/courtyard area. But it is worth the walk to stay somewhere else. Marina (Good): This is the lower level, in the marina area. There is about a 20 slip, active marina; this is where the boat to palomino island leaves from. The only way to reach this village is via the funicular. This area was very nice, colored-updated buildings. Rooms seemed nicely appointed and second best to Las Casitas (similar quality to Las Vista). Advice: If you get this wing, try to get a room as far inward from the Marina as you can. The ferry boats to Palomino havee very loud diesel engines. Las Casitas: Private wing of the hotel; on the main level; to the far West of the Lobby. Can get multiple bed room villas, expensive. This is of course the quietest and nicest area of the resort. I would say the interiors did not look appreciably better than Marina and Las Vistas, but somewhat better. Advice: Unlike the other villages, you can book yourself into the Casitas and guarantee yourself that you get into this village. But it is pricey. To me, it is not worth it unless you have a family or multiple families, and need the space and want more of a small condo feel. But if money is not an issue, of course you should stay here. They say John Travolta and other stars have stayed here, wow, I doubt it. Very nice, but not five stars. La Vista: On the main level. This is the West Wing of the hotel, off the Lobby. We stayed in a deluxe ocean view room, #4226, on the pool side. Basically, this wing either overlooks the ocean/pool or golf course. The package gave us a golf course view, and the Wyndham By Request gave us an upgrade to a ocean view. Deluxe doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean anything, it is a regular room. Advice: I emailed the By Request office at the hotel 3 days before arrival. I asked them to put me in an updated, quiet section of the hotel. They put me in La Vista. Based upon several people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, La Vista was the most recently renovated wing. Advice: The main pool is VERY LOUD; party because door wall has no sound insulation. I would not want one of the ocean/pool view rooms anywhere close to the main pool. We had an ocean/pool view room, but far to the West, near the entrance to Las Casitas. Even then, we could hear the kids at the pool. If they put you near the pool, ask for a downgrade to a golf course view, on other side of La Vista away from pool. Advice: This wing has a great garden/courtyard area. One of the best I have ever seen. But with the beauty comes coqui frogs. They make loud sounds all night long; hundreds of them. If you have problems sleeping with noise, do not get the La Vista wing (I think Las Brisas has the same issue). We slept fine, but wanted to note it, b/c it can get annoying. Rooms The room we had in the La Vista wing was a 3.5 to 4 star type room (using AAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s system as my baseline). The quality and cleanliness of the room was below all of the resorts I listed at the intro, but those are 4.5 to 5 star resorts and rooms. It was similar to a general room we had at Hilton Hawaiian village or other Hilton and older Marriott resorts. The good thing was the carpet and furnishings looked very new. But the bathroom was dated and somewhat dirty. Obviously what they did, and it is common in the hotel industry, is they redid the room without ripping anything out but the carpet. So they replaced carpet, furniture and paint, but did not change tub, tiles, sink, lighting fixtures, etc. The Marina rooms looked comparable but a better setting outside. The Las Casitas rooms looked the best, but still, I think they were a solid 4 star room, still not a Ritz, Four Seasons or a new Westin/Hyatt resort type room. Keep in mind that it is tough to keep the rooms looking sparkling clean in the Caribbean due to the humidity and high family use. All rooms had high speed internet access for $14.95 a day. It worked great. Also, all had coffee pots for morning coffee; never used it though. They also all have a VCR and radio system with tape deck (did not see CD player). TV has all major US channels and a movie rental systems with 50 plus movies; extensive choices for $12.95 per movie. Plenty of sitting room includes desk, two chairs and a love seat. Two chairs and table on balcony. All have balconies. Funiculars There is three levels to this hotel. Top, middle, bottom. Top includes (from West to East) Las Casitas, La Vista, Lobby (with most of the restaurants, shops and main pool), Las Brisas. Near Las Brisas, which is about a 7-10 minute walk from Las Casitas, you can board the funicular to take you down. Middle includes Las Olas, its pool and the Tex Mex Restaurant. Bottom includes Marina (Palomino island ferry), Marina Village rooms, some shops, Marina pool, Stingray restaurant and Ballyhoo bar. I never found the funiculars to be a problem. We waited, one time, 5 minutes. Most other times, you wait 1-2 minutes. There is no schedule, and there are two of them. One stops in the middle at Las Olas, the other is express between Top and Bottom. I will note that we were told that the hotel was only 65-70% full. Palomino Island and Ferry Catch ferry at Marina. Takes a solid 20 minutes to get to island; leaves every half hour. Pretty much everything is to the right, as you get off Ferry. There is Iguana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (lunch pavilion). Then about 500 hundred plus lounge chairs. This was impressive, there is always a chair. Also, they all have fancy cushions (looked like they were new); so they are very comfortable. The problem is that only a few have thatched huts to go with the chairs. If you want a thatched hut, you have to go early, probably on the 10am or earlier ferry. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a thatched hut, you can sit in the sun or find shade under a tree. Overall, this is a very nice island. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled, the main beach is almost not swimable. The beach is all coral formations. So cool for snorkeling, but not much for swimming. Also, beware of the snorkeling, because the water at times is only 1-2 foot deep. There are supposedly other beaches on the other side of the island, but you have to hike to them up a hill, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Advice: Definitely go to the Island at least once. It is a little bit of pain to worry about the ferry schedule, etc. But it is a very nice island. We kept walking till almost the end of the thatched huts. We thought it was a great spot, but almost all areas are 5-7 min. walk from restrooms (only ones are next to iguana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s). They have extensive water sports rentals on the island. Pools Notes: All pools have lounge chairs with nice, new cushions. All pools have towel huts. You do not have to give your name, just tell them how many towels you want. Every pool also has a bar nearby. All pools lack umbrellas. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why, but they must think us Northerners can handle sitting in the sun all day. It was actually ridiculous the number of umbrellas they had. Maybe 1 umbrella for every 20-30 chairs. There is a collection of 3-4 pools at the Main pool. One was an activity pool, one a lap pool, one with swim up bar. Also a Jacuzzi. Always pretty crowded and lots of kids. There was a small slide, mainly for kids. Pool is not heated and was a decent temperature but little cold. Air temp. was mid-80s, but it takes a lot of sun to heat a big pool. There were individual pools at Marina, Las Olas and Las Casitas. Advice: At the entrance to Las Casitas, it says only Las Casitas guests can enter the area. We ignored the sign. The Las Casitas pool is heated, like bath water. They also have a Jacuzzi (wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very hot). The second day, they saw us coming from the La Vista wing and asked where we were staying, so we got booted. But they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t typically do that, we just made it obvious. If you want to sit or try Las Casitas pool, simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk through the main entrance. Walk along the side a little, past the spa. Then turn into Las Casitas area and back-track to pool. Looks like you belong. They will not ask you at pool for room number or anything. Las Casitas pool does get a decent crowd of both adults and kids. Advice: The best day we had was at the Marina pool. There was only 8 people there, all day. It is right on the ocean (not swimable ocean). Also, it is right next to a lawn with plenty of palm trees. So although the Marina pool has little or no umbrellas, we just took our chairs out onto the lawn under the trees. Also, you will notice an individual cabana on the lawn. We used it one day, and no one ever said anything. The cabanas by the main pool are obviously rent only, this one had no signs and the pool attendant clearly saw us in it and did not say anything. Restaurants We were very happy with the food overall. Clearly, the quality of the food did not match the price, but it never does at fancy resorts!! So just convince yourself that the value proposition is never going to be good, just hope for good food. It was also very good service, at times outstanding. The staff is generally quite friendly and sometimes exceptional. For example, when you asked how to go somewhere or you looked lost, someone would walk with you and show you to your destination; even if it took 5 minutes. Tex Mex (Las Olas): Inside and outside seating, bar inside. This would be a good place for happy hour (they serve free chips, cheese and salsa during happy hour); unlike US Mex restaurants, they do not give you free chips and salsa with your meal. We had a very good meal here. We ordered the nachos and 1 order of fajitas. When the nachos came out, we cancelled the main course order of fajitas. The nachos were huge, easily filling both my wife and I for the whole dinner. The nachos were excellent and only cost $10!! So we had a whole dinner for $10 plus drinks. Not gourmet, but it was nice to sit outside and each normal food. Isabella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: Only inside seating, 4 star AAA rating. Fancy steakhouse, nice atmosphere. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat here this time, but did once before. We liked it, and it tends to get good reviews. Otello\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: Only inside seating. Fancy Italian. Again, very good meal, maybe the best we had. We split Tortellini; it was fantastic! I had soup of the day (very good) and wife started with Caesar salad (normal; lightly dressed which was good). Good atmosphere and excellent service. This is one way to save fat grams and to save $, split b/c the portions are ample at all restaurants. Blossoms: Only inside seating. This is two restaurants in one: Japanese tepenyaki (like BENIHAHA'S) and a Chinese restaurant. Also had sushi bar. We ate at Chinese restaurant and it was good and very similar to Americanized Chinese; one step up from your local Chinese restaurant, not as good as PF Changs. Good service. General Tao\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chicken and spring rolls were both good. Japanese restaurant looked crowded and since they seat in order at the tables, make a reservation. Stingray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (Marina): Inside and outside seating. Seafood mainly. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat here. Le Bistro (Las Casitas): Inside and outside seating. Upscale French, need reservation a couple days ahead, if for a weekend. Did not eat here. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Caribe: Inside seating. You can tell, this was newly renovated. It has a great atmosphere and a perfect menu for kids: burgers, chicken fingers, pizzas, ice cream, etc. For adults, it is the best ice cream place. Not only the take out area, but go sit on a bar stool and order a sundae; they are great. Chocolate chip ice cream was my favorite. Service is excellent. Overall, I found the service to be quite good, as compared to other Caribbean destinations. Puerto Rico is laid back compared to mainland US, but not as laid back as rest of Caribbean. Day Excursions Did not take any, since we have been to PR before. But Old San Juan and the Fort tours are good; shopping is extensive downtown. If you have a car, drive through rain forest. Nice, but not as nice as Hawaii. If you want to drive somewhere for dinner, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to eat locally or drive all the way back to San Juan, try the restaurants at the Westin Rio Mar. Large resort about 25-30 mins away. Note: Walgreens and Fast Foods are within 10 minutes of resort. Comparison to Hyatt and Westin The 3 main high-end beach resorts on PR are the Hyatt Dorado, Westin Rio Mar and Wyndham. I do not consider the Ritz a resort; small beach and next to airport. Hyatt used to be two hotels in one (Cerromar plus Dorado), but they are converting the Cerromar into timeshares. I would say they all have their pros and cons, and are all solid four star resorts. The Westin rooms are probably the nicest, then Hyatt, then Wyndham. There is no comparison with respect to size, design, etc.; Wyndham is larger and more grand. But the Hyatt, which gives you access to two resorts in one and the Westin which has a hotel and a timeshare, are both large properties with good size water areas and a large number of restaurants. Neither the Hyatt or Westin have an island like Palomino, but they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it b/c they are located on a swimable mainland beach. The Hyatt is probably the best for beach goers. They have two and three story structures about 30 yards for the beach. Full access right out your room. The Westin is more concentrated in one or two main structures, about 100 yards from the beach. Frankly, I have no clear favorite, but if I were going back to PR, I would probably choose the Westin. Nice rooms and relatively quiet; but my wife would choose the Hyatt b/c of the beach. In summary, I am glad I went to the Wyndham, we had a very good time. As long as you know what to expect, big resort, not great rooms but fantastic array of activities, unbelievably designed hotel, you will have a good time. Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay at the Wyndham, try to visit it during the day. It must have been something very special when it was first built; what they need is not a $10 million renovation, they need to shutdown and do a $100 million face lift. But with that said, you can clearly tell they have spent money over the years; Las Casitas and Marina look very new, and certain restaurants are modern.", "Date": "June 5, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWondeful\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2142649", "Content": "The hotel was wondeful.

The biggest piece of advice I would have is to check any reservation at the Golden Door Spa three of four times to be sure they have it. Pretty much every woman that was there had their reservation messed up. Once you get past that, the experience at the spa is phenomenal. Ladies, ask for Javier for your massage. My girlfriend had him, and she said afterwards: \"I'm not sure, but I think we are engaged now!\" Nothing inappropriate, just a handsome guy who gives thorough massages!

Both beautiful, worth visiting and not a difficult drive. Do some research.I think they should at least have a shuttle that gets you to and from town. (Fajardo or Luquillo beach) In case that you need to make purchases, such as pharmacy or the sort. Instead what they have is ferry trips to Palomillo and Culebra beach.The other problem is that they do not serve any food from the island, I found this was lacking in courtesy towards the culture and to the visitor.There is a nearby beach called Luquillo that offers traditional food in what they call \"kioskos\" (stands). The food is safe (we ate it and had no problem with it) .Also in Luquillo there is a small restaurant we found called Caribbean (----------------------, it only opens after 5 pm, but its very, very clean & the food (Mofongo w/Lobster) was superb.

The grounds are immense and if you happen to be located on the cliff side, below the main buildings, riding the funicular can become very taxing to a decent meal. The food is terribly overpriced - thought the steak house dinner was quite good quality. Although the main areas seem to have decent upkeep, a visit to any public restroom on the property will show you otherwise - a look behind the scenes.

After staying at the resort my husband and I have this conclusion. The hotel is very poorly managed. Most of the problems are procedural with improperly trained staff. It disguises itself as a high end resort (which it could be). But it really is a high priced mid range hotel. The driver of the shuttle was very welcoming but after a 1 hour drive you do not want to wait in a check in line that was about 45 minutes even with only 6-8 people in line and 4 people on staff behind the front desk. Then you have to go back to the shuttle get a bellman and then you get to go to your room. No high end Resort checks in this way . Someone should be waiting with your room assignment, they have all the flight and arrival information, you should not have to worry about you luggage again because it is brought directly to your room. The furniture on the balcony is shipped and with more paint flakes everyday. The bathroom had 12 inch holes cut in the ceiling. And the hallways smelled like glue. The maid service was excellent. The restaurant staff is not, and the food taste like your normal side of the highway rest stop. Even the 'nice' restaurants. Not once during our stay did staff answer phone calls not even at the Golden Door Spa. The funicular ride to the Marina is anything but fun. It is slow and one was constantly out of service. The staff would also hold elevators and the funicular so they could load carts and other maintenance equipment. These are not the signs of a high end hotel. Palomino Island is beautiful and we swam out to another small island just off shore. It was very relaxing. Tried to sit at the pool one day but only the upper pool was open and all the chairs were taken. The hot tubs were more like plunge pools. At check out our bill was overcharged by about 300.00 dollars and everyone else in line had the same problem. Heard mostly the same complaints from the other guests. Then had to argue for a good 15-20 minutes to get some of the charges corrected. Then the front desk agent would speak Spanish to agent next to them and you can imagine what was said. So no express check out here. If you are used to staying at luxury resorts this will not be the place for you.

There are many other hotels to choose from in the Caribbean and I suggest you pass on the El Conquistador for the following reasons: 1. Antiquated Moldy Rooms and Dilapidated Common Areas Our room was not ready until after 6 p.m. and when we entered, the room was completed in bloom with mold and furniture, fabrics that had seen better days. The bed was tantamount to a park bench and after being subjected to constant mold spore blasts by the A/C system, my wife and I began feeling nauseous and sick. If you are hell-bent on staying at this hotel, my suggestion is trying the new La Casita Section which boasts a five star rating as opposed to the primary hotel which is four stars. This is information that I could have used prior to my depressing visit. Furthermore, the pictures of the hotel are breathtaking but in reality the hotel is in need of a great deal of maintenance, restoration and cleaning. We were very disappointed with what we were sold vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the reality of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physical condition. 2. Exceedingly overpriced and unpalatable food The El Conquistador is home to the ten dollar hot dog and fourteen dollar cheeseburger\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthese are usually two low cost items that help demonstrate the overall prices at the hotel; almost like comparing the prices of the McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Big Mac to gauge inflation in countries around the world. Okay, you say the writer is being cheap however, having actually eaten real ten dollar hot dogs and real fourteen dollar cheeseburgers at finer hotels around the world, please make no mistake and do not be confused in any way, this low-grade dog food is not worth the money. In fact, I would price the overall food experience at one-quarter of its cost that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s if you did not experience the food poisoning as I did over a fish dish at the self-acclaimed French Restaurant--Le Bistro. The last morning of my stay while I sat eating breakfast, I could not help but becoming sickened with the birds flying above dropping excrement throughout the dinning room and upon my table (folks\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis was inside). Roaches were also widely present in and around the buffet line. The tables, chairs and floor were coated with bird excrement. Again, should you be hell-bent on staying at this hotel, walk off-property by the marina area and visit a local restaurant where you will find a good fish restaurant with superior food at a quarter of the price. If you do not have the opportunity to go off-site, I understand second hand that the Italian restaurant may be reasonably decent but could make not promise about the cleanliness of the kitchen. For two people, you should plan to spend an average of $50 on breakfast, $50-$60 for lunch and not less than $100.00 (without wine) for dinner unless you eat in the snack bar. I never mind spending money on good food, but unfortunately the food at the El Conquistador was overpriced commensurate with its overall poor quality. 3. Etcetera, Etcetera, Etcetera. The El Conquistador holds itself out as a four and five star resort but from my perspective, I would rate the El Conquistador 1 to 3.5 star depending on the service area notwithstanding Golf which I did not experience during my stay. In short, travelers beware before committing a stay at this hotel. Make sure you do your home work to ensure lackluster service, low-grade and overpriced food and second-rate accommodations does not mitigate your vacation enjoyment. Unfortunately for us, we bought into the embellished pictures and sleek marking material without reading the reviews. I should have known better than to stay at the El Conquistador when telephoned the night before to confirm our room and was disconnected a number of times before I was told in a curt way that rooms could not be reserved in advance.

Tuesday we took the ferry to Palamino Island and had soo much fun. The snorkeling there is awesome. This was our first time in PR so we were amazed at the beauty. We saw a baby sand shark and a jelly fish. My husband also rented the jet ski, which was $65 for a half hour but what the heck. The hotel was never crowded and the pools were awesome. Customer service was decent. Alexander from the front desk came to our room to give my husband's family directions from two towns over. He also sent us home with Pasteles (a puerto rican tamale, basically). El Yunke was awesome. We swam in the La Mina Falls and had a blast. It's about a 45 minute hike from Big Tree Trail. Old San Juan was nice. Definitely a whole day thing. We weren't too disappointed in the hotel cause we knew what we were going for. We only ate 3 out of 5 dinners there and they were at the Cafe Caribe and Cafe Bella Vista. Since we had the buffet we just wanted light dinners. The casion was decent never smokey but if you play black jack watch out cause the dealer doesn't play his second card until all the players are done and we watched the game for about a half hour and almost everytime, the dealer one. A lot of the slot machines were out but A LOT of the nickle slots were hitting all night. One guy won over $9,000 on one machine! We did pretty good too.

The pools were all very nice, my only complaint is that the jacuzzi's were not all that warm. I'm sure it is difficult to keep outdoor hot tubs at appropriate temperatures throughout the day though. Palamino Island (the private beach) was beautiful, but I'd recommend wearing sandals in the water (there is a corral reef just off shore and the broken off pieces of the corral are abundant in the sand). I would also recommend renting a car at the airport. It gives you much more freedom if you want to go out and explore the area. There are actually some great little restaurants within a mile or two of the property, and the prices are significantly lower than the property resorts. Plus, the hotel shuttle is $60/pp, so if you are traveling with a companion, it makes it just as cost effective.

Overall, place is incredible, didnt have one bad experience. I will say though that the beach sucked (reefs are way to close to shore so there is nowhere to just swin and hang out) and they are in desperate need of an adult pool.

Overall I liked the resort, it is beautiful, large and very well landscaped. The resort is on a cliff and is composed of at least 5 different hotels. We stayed at the Las brisas (sp?)hotel which has great ocean views and is about 3/4 up the hill from the marina. There are pools everywhere with 3 pools and 3 hot tubs at the main hotel, one pool and hot tub at the hotel near but not quite to the marina and another pool at the villas by the marina. The golf course and spa are near the main hotel. If you want action or people watching try to stay at the main hotel. The marina area seems to be the quietest ( except for the boats). Las brisas was somewhat in between, with easy access to both areas. The golf course was very pretty, in good shape and challenging enough but not absurdly difficult. Green fees were high($160) in the am but dropped to about $100 for early pm play and $70 for late pm play. I teed off at 2:30 and had time to finish before dark (~6:30). We rented a car at the desk in the hotel for 2 days and drove into Old San Juan and to the El Younque rain forest. Driving is easy, but there are almost no street signs to give you reference, so rely on landmarks. Both of these trips are easy to do on your own if you don't like tours. The rain forest is impressive and actually kind of cool temperature-wise. There were NO BUGS in the rainforest other than butterflies, I couldn't believe it. The diving was a dissapointment. Not so much for the quality of the dives, but for the inability to schedule trips. On three days when I wanted to go out, but there were not enough divers (6 is the minimum to take out the boats). The dive operation at Casa del Mar was well staffed and had two nice, new 42' dive boats. How they stay in business only going out once or twice a week is a mystery. They did have a daily snorkle/dive trip, but it is mainly for resort divers and was not a good experience when I tried it. The trip to Culebra island was good with good shallow(<50') reef dives, but it is all day for two one tank dives. The food at the resturants was good to very good and uniformly expensive with dinners for four (with minimal wine/alcoholic drinks) averaging $160-200. Our highest bill was $268 at Othello's. The breakfast buffet was a good deal and we usually ate well there and were too full for lunch. Palimino island was fun and there are hiking trails as well a fully staffed beach with food/drink and watersports rentals. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful as were people we met in San Juan and in the rainforest. My only complaints are the general prices of everything and that some areas are beginning to show a little wear and tear and need to be updated for a hotel of this caliber. In all, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the Wyndham El Conquistador for a nice family vacation with a little something for everyone to do.", "Date": "April 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent Island, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cIgnore the Complainers!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1777540", "Content": "Just returned from a 4 day stay at the El Conquistador (over Easter Weekend), with my husband and 2 kids (ages 12 and 14). Had a wonderful time at this gorgeous resort...Resort is the key word here. I have gotten so tired of reading negative reviews, I decided I needed to balance the ratings. The people who complain always say the same things: beautiful place , but over-priced....WHAT do you expect?? This is a resort...have you ever stayed at a 4 star, beautifully appointed, pampering, friendly hotel on a georgeous Caribbean Island that was NOT an expensive place to eat?? If you have, PLEASE give me the name so I can book a trip!!! My suggestion to those people is go to an all-inclusive resort, where everything is included (then you'll get an appreciation of sub-standard food!!) Anyway, We rented a car which is the way to go (hotel bus is $60 roundtrip, we got a deal on a car on Hotwire for $115 for our stay). The key here is no one from the hotel forced us to take the bus. We arrived early, 12:30pm, check in time was 4pm. My husband did a \"pre-check in\", was given the hotel charge card, our bags were stored, and the very helpful desk clerk told him to come back to the head of the line to get our room about 3....Very easy!! Pool areas are clean and beautiful...never waited for a clean towel, despite the busy holiday weekend. Lounge chairs are hard to come by mid-day.....BUT WHOSE FAULT IS THAT??? It is the ugly Americans who go to the pool at 7am, put towels on twice as many chairs as they need, and then go off to a 2 hour breakfast. I am quite sure if a resort policed the lounge chairs, people would complain about that too!!! Our room was lovely: King bed with pull out sofa. Very large bathroom area, and big balcony with table and chairs. There was a refrigerator in the room, which was great, another way TO SAVE ON THE FOOD SPENDING. (at no extra charge) Now on to food... we do not travel to focus on food, and generally look for cheaper opportunities to eat....there were plenty of reasonable options. The main swim-up pool bar serves a quick lunch (big chicken nuggets, hamburgers w/ fries, etc. plenty of food under $10) Also, the bar had \"happy hour\" in the afternoon ....cheaper drinks!!! We loved the terrace restaurant: Bella Vista: Great brick oven pizza $12 for a pizza big enough for 2. I had a great tomato and mozzerella sandwich. By the way.,.a spectacular view for no extra charge!!! We also ate at the marina bar/grill: Bally hoo: yummy wraps. Las Brisas has breakfast brunch: $20 for a nice assortment (no more than what we would spend at home) We brought juice and donuts for the kids and had most mornings on our balcony (coffee maker in the room) We also left the property for dinner one night. We did not eat at any of the expensive restaurants, but heard the steakhouse was great. Now on to the other major complaint: the funicular down to the marina, and then the ferry to Palomino Island. What is the problem people??? Easter weekend... we never waited longer for the funicular than we would have for an elevator in some hotels!!! And what fun, a cable car down the mountain, with a spectacular view (no charge!!)There are 2 cars and each holds 20 people easily. Then at the bottom you hop the ferry for the island, it runs constantly, definitely more than on the 1/2 hour. Again what a great ride!!! at no charge!! Yes it is a 15 to 20 minute trip, but you are on vacation, what is the hurry??? RELAX and enjoy the gorgeous scenery!!! The island is lovely, with plenty of lounge chairs and lots to do. Definitely rent snorkeling gear, lots of coral just off the beach with lots to look at (not expensive). The watersports rentals are not any more than anywhere else: $65 1/2 for jet ski and $100 for an hour. Finally, a fun activity in the evening is the drive in movie. They set up a big Screen next to the main pool and show family movies like \"Cat in the Hat\" You can float in the pool and watch or sit in a lounge chair. The swim up bar even has popcorn!!! We had a late flight, checked out in the am and requested a room to shower in the afternoon. We got one for 1/2 hour at 2, and our bags were checked for us. We went over to Palomino for the day, and at 1:45 got our room, showered, and were very sad to have to end this lovely vacation.

My husband and I were invited to be guest by his company at this resort. The Wyndham transportation bus picked us up(along with a couple hundred more people attending this convention) at the airport and transported us to the resort within an hour and a half. Once at the resort, we were handed a cup of fruit punch and our room keys. We gave the porter our room numbers and our luggage was delivered promptly. Our room was located in the Las Bristas building between the main hotel and the Marina area. The building is perched on a hillside over looking the ocean. We were in a corner room on floor 3, closest to the hotel. Although the room was slightly dated, we had a spectacular view of the ocean, Palomino Island, the marina, the hotel, pools, Las Casitas and the mountains! In all of our travels, we have never had such a beautiful view. Our complaints about the room were that there were double beds and no king sized bed. Also, the room connected to the next room and we could hear EVERYTHING said as I am sure they could hear us. The ice machine and elevators were outside of our room and they created a great deal of noise. We had a stereo and TV in the room and I was always able to find something to listen to on the stereo. Very nice touch! The bathroom was nice and roomy with the exception of the shower/toilet area. These tubs were sunken and the ceiling very low. Would be very awkward to bath a child in that tub. The closet was also a bit narrow as was the safe. The deck was nice and breezy. There were two chairs and a round table. The table needed to be replaced, but made do. I had breakfast on the deck two mornings. One morning, I was bothered by many black birds trying to get a bite. Music from the hotel pool drifted down and was quite pleasant to listen to. The Palomino island ferries were a bit noisy, but we got used to hearing them. We took the funiculars down to the marina a few times and they were very efficient. A bit scary however as they are on a cable run track. We loved Palomino island! We had a beach party one night as part of the convention and the food and entertainment were exceptional! Another day, we spent the day on the beach and saw iguana and rabbits. The lounge chairs were very nice and beach towels are given out when you enter the island. The hotel pool was very pretty with a swim up bar and many sunning areas. We had no problem finding a lounge chair and all were free (don't know what the previous poster meant?). The food in the hotel was out of this world. Larger than life portions and very tasty. ..some of the best we have ever had antwhere! I do agree that the food is a bit pricy at the resort, though. $30 for a room service eggs, bacon, potatoes, coffee, juice and toast. $14 plus for French toast...nothing else. My husband played the golf course twice and loved the course. He said that iguanas were all over the fairways. The casino was very disappointing. Very smoky (cigars are a popular item at this resort) and crowded. The slot machines were not well maintained and had ZERO payout. We fed $40 dollars worth of quarters in different machines over a four day period and received maybe 20 quarters in return...very boring! We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful, but hard to understand. All were professional and they were always cleaning somewhere in the hotel. One of our party did have pair of sunglass taken from his room. He notified the head housekeeper and a search was done of the maids cart. The RX sunglasses were found on the cart. We were very careful about keeping our valuables locked up or hidden from view. As much as we loved El Conquistador, I do not think that we would pay to come to this resort again. Because most of our trip was paid for by my husbands company, we were able to enjoy ourselves without having to worry about spending too much of our own money.

My husband and I both 32 wanted a calm relaxing getaway.As quick as I can here is what I thought:The shuttle which we took at night was ok. We made it there in about one hour and fifteen minutes. It had a refreshment bar which we were charged for at checkout. Had we known we would have stocked up a little more on the water! They show you a video on the resort and some footage from a Regis and Kelly show taped there. Once there, check-in was a snap and within 5 minutes we were done and off to our room.The funicular which became our daily best friend was not a bother. It was nice to look out through it during the day because the views from everywhere in the hotel are amazing! Other then the repetitive cd's playing in it it was ok. They always seemed to be playing the same songs.The biggest thing for us was that although the place is in an amazing location, the service and knowledge of the staff is NOT amazing. They all know different things and it does not seem like they are trained all together. While for the most part, everyone was nice there were some ridiculous things like not being allowed to sit in a booth that was literally 4 feet away because it was \"closed\", or not being able to book a cabana massage because one person said it was available first come first serve at the pool and the other said it was booked and the others had no idea what I was talking about although the sign was in front of them, expensive pi?a coladas for a little glass with no cherry, no pineapple and no coconut sprinkles! Now, I am from Miami and we have a ton of pi?a coladas here!We had massages at the spa and I would reccommend booking everything before your trip. They were booked on pretty much everything I wanted to do and I was only able to go once during my 4 day stay. The spa IS very nice and although the staff is a bit snobbish, I had a great experience.I had dinner at Blossoms which was not all that great. We had sushi for appetizer and figured we would share a meal. Big mistake. We had the Lovers Paradise Boat which was a tiny portion of lobster , shrimp and vegetables TINY. Now, at Otellos, I had the lobster entree and it was perfect. Perhaps the most delicious lobster I have ever had. My husband had the snapper which was also great. The cheesecake I ordered for dessert was not that good and when I told them (when they asked why I did not eat it) they took it off the bill no further questions asked. I suggest going to DAvid's Cookies cafe inthe morning for your cofee and breakfast. It's like a downsized/simpler version of Starbucks. Good coffee and great pastries. The buffet is 20.00 per person and just not all that worth it. Save your money for the spa! It is pricey but you cannot let that make you too upset while you are there because then you are going to be miserable just work around it!The reason I think everyone says there is a lot to do is because you walk so much to go everywhere so it takes up a lot of time. I did not think there was that much to do which was fine with us because that's what we were there to do NOTHING. But for some people that like to stay busy...not that much.There were kids in the pool but they did not bother anyone. The place is big enough. If you don't like the kids , there are 3 pools to go to. We stayed at the Marina in a deluxe ocean front room with a balcony which was really nice and it has it's own pool. We moved our chairs by the ocean on the grass and had a nice constant breeze.The ByRequest membership did nothing for me. I actually had to call and remind them that I was a member and then I got a message on our phone welcoming us and one prior to departing. Other then that, Saturday afternoon we got a fruit platter with a Merlot bottle compliments of the resort. I still don't know if it was ByRequest or my friend who knows someone at the staff.........Other then that. No perks.The club was empty the enitre time. We stayed at the bar right outside of it listening to the band (which was pretty good) and had some drinks. We did not go into the casino, it's just not our thing. It was just a simple casino and not as smoky as most.What I loved was to hear the Coqui's at night. That is the native tiny frog. At night you hear them make the sound that sounds like \"coqui\" over and over. IT was cute although my husband was annoyed. :)The mattress was pretty crappy but the sheets and towel service was fine. You just have to leave the towels on the floor if you want them changed and the card they give you on your bed for them to change the sheets if you want.The walls are thin and you can hear the toilets flushing at all hours and some times the conversations next door but we were not in the room too often.If I was to go back I would go to Las Casitas and to the the spa and never set foot on the resort (only to go to David's cafe)All in all we had a good relaxing time and came back with a tan!", "Date": "March 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hartford, CT", "Title": "\u201cLoved this place.\u201d", "Author": "Janewb57", "ReviewID": "UR1740653", "Content": "I loved this hotel. I was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews. I reserved the hotel through Hotwire, for which I paid $131 per night. Booking through Hotwire, I wasn?t sure if I could select a room or would be given something substandard. Upon check-in, there was no mention of this, but I was charged an $11 per day resort fee upon checkout. I had stayed the night before in San Juan, and arrived at the Wyndham at 10:30, not expecting to be able to check-in, but was able to. Note ? even if you cannot check-in they will allow you full use of the facilities. I asked for a room at the Marina level, but there was not one available at that time, but would be later in the day. They did have one available in Las Olas, which I took. I also had a partial ocean view. The room was huge, as I understand they all are. There were 2 full/queen beds, a small table and chairs, and an entertainment center. The bathroom was huge ? a large room with marble vanity and sink, and another vanity and stool. Off of that a small room with toilet and shower. There was also a large walk-in closet. Plenty of large, plush towels. It also had a ceiling fan and sliders to a balcony with a table and two chairs. As others have mentioned, the room could use some updating. The bedspreads looked kind of tired and it could use a fresh coat of paint. The room was supposed to have a refrigerator, which it didn?t. The bellman told me to use the fridge in the honor bar and to just take stuff out. I wasn?t comfortable doing that, so I called Guest Services. They said I could not use that fridge, but they would see if they could get another. They called back and said there were none available. I complained a bit, and they were able to find me one and it was at my room in a few minutes. TV received many stations, but no HBO. Also had a stereo system with cassette and CD. Could not get any radio channels to come in, but the Cable TV had some of the digital music stations. Climate control in the room was excellent ? not some noisy a/c. The grounds are beautiful everywhere on the property. The pool at Las Olas was very quiet and was never crowded. All the food we had was excellent. Some of the restaurants are very pricey ($17 omelette), but the Caf? Caribe had very good food (try the fruit plate) and was very reasonably priced. From Las Olas you can walk down to the Marina level or take an elevator from the back side of Las Olas, so you don?t have to wait for the funicular. I didn?t find it that inconvenient to be at the Las Olas level, but would make sure to plan ahead when ?going up?. Overall, I found the service to be very good, but did find whenever calling for something in the hotel, the phone rang a very long time, and one time while I was at the concierge desk, she let the phone ring a zillion times while she was helping me. There are numerous restaurants to choose from. It would be helpful to have a comprehensive directory of the restaurants and menus for each room. The concierge had a couple, but you had to look at them while at the desk. They will make photo copies for you and will make reservations for you. Make reservations as far ahead as you can for the more popular places so you?re not eating dinner at 9:00. I had a car, which I only used once to go to the Las Cabezas preserve. I thought I would use it more, but there was no reason to leave the hotel. Self-parking was $15 per day. Lot is not far from entrance, but there is a shuttle which goes back and forth and we barely had to wait for it. They offer several excursions, competively priced. Negatives: I couldn?t get the slider to the balcony to lock; it looked like the vanity in the bathroom at one time had a glass top which was never replaced; I put dirty towels in the hamper in the walk-in closet which were never picked up, but new towels were left; clean towels were not available at the Las Olas pool until about 9:30-10:00 in the morning.

Well, we were there last week and I all I can tell you is that the people that wrote the bad reviews on this place are either dumb and dont know any better or are such tight-asses that they have no business travelling and should just stay home. My husband and I have been to Puerto Rico about 6 times, but this was our first time staying at the El Conquistador. We truly found it to be one of the most beautiful, breathtaking resorts we have ever seen, and we have stayed in many beautiful resorts. Our room was in the Las Vistas wing and it was huge. My husband usually books suites when we travel but at the advice of my travel agent we booked an Ocean View Delux Room and it was by far the biggest room I have ever seen, with a couch and a sitting area and a large balcony with french doors. Also, since it was on a cliff, there was a good breeze constantly so we slept with the doors open at night and never even had to use the AC. Someone had complained about needing to leave the AC on at all times because of a \"musty odor in the rooms\"--we experienced none of that to tell you the truth our room was exceptionally clean, and you dont know my husband he has a little OCD when it comes to cleanliness. Someone had written that they \"rarely received maid service during their stay and that the towels were dirty\", well here's a tip--you have to leave the room and housekeeping comes to clean. If you leave the room late and housekeeping has already been by, pick up the phone and push the little button that says HOUSEKEEPING and let me them know you are going out and need the room cleaned. The deal with the towels is that if you want clean ones (and god I hope you do) make sure you leave the used ones in a pile on the floor or in the tub or something so that the maid doesnt assume you are going to re-use your towel after it dries. I gave then a call one day and asked for extra pillows and exra towels and not only were they prompt but also called me about an hour later to make sure everything was to my satisfaction. This brings me to another point--maybe we recieved such good service because we tipped them for their effort. Its really not how much you give but it just shows that you are appreciative of their service. I think that is a good part of the reason that some people had so much to complain about. But you wanna know what, they deserve to have that kind of trip if they expect the people who work in a resort of 1000 rooms to cater to them personally without giving them something for their time. I wonder if these people have ever even been to a restaurant before. And speaking of food--the food here was by far the best (and cheapest) than on any other island we have been to. Isabellas was great. Othellos was great, Cafe Caribe/ice cream parlor was really good--the ice cream cones were so addicting; once I had 4 in one day and now I know what you are thinking but no I am actually not a fat girl) and the biggest surprise was Blossoms. Who would think you can get good chinese food in Puerto Rico. But it was awesome, and that was take-out--I can only imagine how good it must be to actually eat dinner there. The only place I was not thrilled with was Las Brisas breakfast buffet. I found eating breakfast at Cafe Carib better or ordering room service and eating on the balcony. By the way, if anyone is a fan of Dominos Pizza, you can order to your room and its just like home :) Of course wherever you get a pina colada here its going to be the best you have ever had, but I think that is anywhere in Puerto Rico. The Cafe Bella Vista also has frozen lemonade which was non-alcohalic and tasted like a margarita. The best part of these restuarants is that they dont include gratuity on anything. So we were surprised but the reasonable prices. I am shocked at the people that have complained about the \"sky high prices for less-than average food\". Well I don't know where she lives but I would say that the prices are comparable to NYC restaurants and the quality of the food was even better than some, but I guess that could be because we are from NY and not some trailer park in the sticks. You have no business writing a review on food unless its a 7-Eleven hot dog. Okay enough about food because I am making myself hungry. Palomino Island--I can assure you that you have never seen anything like this. Please dont listen to the pain-in the ass people complaining about the funicular and the boat ride to get there. That was so much fun. The funicular is about as much as an inconveniece as a glass elevator. That is literally how long it takes to get to you after you push the button and get you down to the marina. The boat does not take 20 minutes to get there, its more like ten and it is a beautiful ride. Plus where are you in such a hurry to go? Just some advice though--even though the weather might be like 85-90 degrees, chances are you wont really feel the hot hot sun because of the breeze there. MAKE SURE YOU WEAR SUNBLOCK. I am sitting here peeling as I tell you so dont make my mistake. Even if you are tan--I went tanning before I went so that I wasn't too white...you need spf 15 or higher and yes you will leave with a tan. We didn't stay at the pools much although I will say that the main pool with the bar is the nicest and mainly adults. Not that it matters--if it bothers you that much that there are kids in the pool (as some people complained about) then you might consider using the money you will spent on this trip on a nice lengthy therapy session. Because really, thats not normal. Okay, the casino--now its not as big as we were used to, but then again, and it is sad to say, I have seen a smaller one and THAT was gross. But this casino was nowhere near gross. In fact you will find that the slot machines are completely uncomputerized which makes it easier for them to hit. They dont have cards that count your time and they dont rate you for rewards or anything. So its really just fun. Like an old-fashioned casino. We won on a $1 slot within like 20 minutes. I mean its not vegas, its not even Atlantic city but by no means should you listen to the lady that wrote \"yuck\" as she described it. She needs to get a grip on reality. Also about that same woman complaining about underage kids drinking at the club or whatever. Well we didnt go to the club but I can relate because that is what underage kids do--go away and drink at the resort clubs. HELLO, werent you ever like 17 or were you just born a cranky old lady? I feel bad for your husband, Mam. Maybe you should be at Foxwoods or something instead. I had planned on going to the spa while I was there but since I had so much fun getting sunburned on my first day there (!) I ended up only going in to buy a bottle of aloe. But it is beautiful and it will definitly be my first stop next time we go. We did go on the rainforest tour, since in all the times we have been to PR we have never seen the rainforest. Our tour guide was the nicest guy and he knew absolutely everything there was to know about not only the rainforest but puerto rico in general. If you are into plant-life and insects or if you like to hike then this is a perfect tour for you. If you are like us and not really that much into nature I would say you may not have a good time because that is all there is to see really. It was kind of like the bronx zoo without the animals. But we had a great time anyway. Anyway, all in all we had a great time and the worst part of our trip was leaving. I really can't wait to go back. This is an awesome hotel altogether.

From the moment we stepped into the beautiful and vast lobby, I realized this was a special resort. The setting is exceptional- three levels on a cliff overlooking the Caribbean. Whoever is in charge of the grounds deserves a special nod for they were impressive- fan palms, bougainvillea, royal palms, orchids, bird of paradise, etc. We stayed in a double room in the Las Brisas wing which overlooks the water and Palamino Island. We were treated each night to a fantastic sunset and a full moon. The Las Marinas section on the lowest level also looked very nice. Our friends were in the La Vista section which does not have as spectacular a view, but does have a Coqui frog serenade each evening which is magical. For those who can afford it, the Las Casitas village has a calm and serene perfection. For breakfast, I recommend the Cafe Caribe, especially the fruit plate or the Golf Grill. Also, you can get pastries and coffee at David's. For lunch, Ballyhoo's on the marina level has great quesadillas and Bella Vista (near pool) has good gyros and pizzas. For splashy (and expensive) dinners, I recommend Otelo's (includes a magician), the Japanese tappan yaki at Blossoms (you will love the chef), and the seafood at the atmospheric Stingray Cafe. For less pricey dinners, try pasta at Bella Vista or the Chinese at Blossoms. For drinks, try the Ballyhoo at Ballyhoo's or the Happy Hour at Las Cantina on the Middle (Las Olas) level. The Happy Hour includes free nachos. We gave a party one night in our room, and Blossoms delivered (on time) a tray of hors deouvres while Room Service provided the wine glasses. We bought the wine in town (Fajardo), but you can also get wine and rum in W.H.Smith in the lobby or through room service. For fun, we did the afternoon snorkeling cruise (special thanks to Angelie) and spent two days on Palamino Island, which we just loved. Take a right when you get off the ferry and go to the umbrella covered chairs at the turn of the island. There a nice waiter like Hector will take your food and drink orders. On Palamino, we rented floats, sunfish and hobie cats- great fun going over to Palaminito Island. My husband played golf three days. The course is dramatic, though the greens need a little work. To save money, play golf after 1:30. We also rented a car from Avis in the lobby and spent a day at the El Yunque Rain Forest.

The check-in process was quick, but the person checking us in was not very enthusiastic or helpful. No matter, we were in 85 degree weather! Our room was in the Alta Vista building with ocean view - 4th floor. The room was clean and updated, the view was breathtaking. However, after a few days, the pool noise became a little annoying -- the pool is popular with kids of course, because it's such a great area. On some nights, we were kept awake by some midnight / 3 a.m. drinkers in the pool area. The resort would do well if they had restricted pool area hours (like when most people are sleeping). I say this because the walls are paper thin. I was woken up in the middle of the night on our first night to the sound of our toilet flushing, only to realize it was the room next door. (I made note of that during my next bowel movement). The food was very expensive and I was complaining to my husband the first day until he put it into perspective for me: You had no trouble spending a couple thousand dollars on flight and hotel, and you're worrying about paying an extra $10 per plate? He was right -- and my advice to you is: you're on vacation, don't worry about the freakin' food prices! In the end were able to save some money by eating a large breakfast, skipping lunch, eating an afternoon snack (from the coffee shop), and eating dinner. We found the Mexican restaurant (take the tram down to Las Casitas Village) to be the best deal for food (quantity, quality, and price). I recommend the resort's Bio Luminescent Bay kayak tour (look in the services book in your room) -- even if you've never kayaked -- this tour is slow-paced and easy. It was also the highlight of the trip -- I won't give away the surprise of the tour, but trust me it's worth it, it's a magical experience. We also went on the resort sponsored trip to El Yunque Rainforest and that was a real letdown. The tour is mostly by bus through the forest and they let you get out and take pictures of the \"touristy\" stuff (which is usually never what you really want to see). They also take you on a walk through the forest. We were anticipating some neat tropical experience, yet what we got was a very slow stroll on a trail that looped around picnic pavillions - what should have only taken 15 minutes. Additionally, they charge $50 / person for this tour and \"tell\" you about the endangered parots and other wildlife which they have in the park's special exhibit...but they don't take you there to see it -- if you want to see the rainforest, rent your own car and do it without a tour guide. Later that day, we walked the resort golfcourse and saw more wildlife on the course than we did on the rainforest \"hike\". Palomino Island: I read the postings here before the trip and took some advice to bring surf/ kayak shoes because of the coral under the water near the edge of the beaches. We were sure glad we brought them. They offer any kind of water sport on the island, which we didn't take advantage of ($$) mostly because sipping pina coladas under a coconut palm tree was good enough for us! (they make really good pina coladas, too!) What we learned overall: The staff can be very nice, if you are nice to them first. They normally don't go the extra step when you communicate with them. For example, we were seated in a restaurant and I asked for an ashtray. The waiter told me there was no smoking in that part of the restaurant. Period. End of discussion. I had to take the extra step and ask where the smoking section was. Normally, service staff anywhere else would tell you there is no smoking in the section, but there was smoking in the bar area. Another example: At the David's Cookies shop, we found a pastry that they made frequently that we liked. One time we went in and there were none left. We asked if they had any more. No. Period. End of discussion. So, we asked when they might be making some more. She wasn't sure. Our advice: Never take a staff answer as the last answer. Be prepared to continue with your questions in order to get what you want -- but don't be obnoxious or rude about it. Oh yeah, we took a bunch of cash with us, but found that we didn't need it in the resort. They give you a \"credit card\" that you use to charge everything to your room -- food, activities, clothing, etc. We found this to be really convenient. Just be prepared when you check out so that you're not so surprised with how much you charged during your stay. One more thing that was helpful: The minibar in the room sells small bottles of water for $4. But, the canteen sells twice that size bottle of water for $3.95. Overall, we left feeling really glad we went and we both agreed we would come back -- but stay at the private condo village where it is much quieter and rent a car for at least a day to do some non-resort sponsored sightseeing.", "Date": "March 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Akron, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort, food overpriced\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1702069", "Content": "We stayed at El Conquistador the second week in February 2004. We did a 4 for free package which gave you the 5th night free, the breakfast buffet free, and room upgrade(if available). The ride from the airport is 45min to 1hr. long and bumpy. At check in we were upgraded to Las Casitas private portion of the resort. The check in staff was not very warm, nor did they explain anything about the resort or your package. You are on your own to ask for what is included in your package. Las Casitas is a beautiful portion of the resort and from talking to other guests the best maintained. Our room was actually a small condo with kitchen, dining room table, sitting area, large bathroom, spa tub, and balcony with partial ocean view. Las Casitas has a small village-like atmosphere with a private pool, free continential breakfast, concierge service with butlers, turn down service, etc. Our room was kept very clean and the staff was very attentive in this portion of the resort. I don't think I would feel I was getting a deal without this upgrade. The first morning we got the free bagels and fruit at Las Casitas confused with the free buffet breakfast at Las Brisas that was part of our package. We were surprised to find that the regular price of this breakfast buffet was $40 for two. We were surprised by the cost of dinner at this resort. They pretty much have you captive at their reservation suggested locales that average $30 a plate. The resort itself is beautiful spacious and relaxing. At night we were surprised by the lack of activities. They tend to want to herd you into the casino. There were also many conventions during our stay. When they had special events the resort seemed dead at night. My husband wanted to go deep sea fishing during our stay and was disappointed that the hotel could not arrange excurisons that did not require that you rent the entire boat for $700.

We stayed for 6 days during February. We arrived on a late flight, and had called ahead to make sure there would be a hotel shuttle. The ride took about 45 minutes, but it was a nice ride, offering drinks and video of the hotel to get you aquainted before arriving. Upon arrival, we had a quick check in (it was about 1 AM). We had a room in Las Olas, which is the village half way down the cliff. We found the room to be average with a large vanity, bathroom & closet area, which was nice. I would have been dissappointed, but had read previous reviews and did not expect an exceptional room - it was definitely dated & could use some renovations. We had signed up as Wyndham ByRequest members, and received an upgrade on the room (although I was not told this, I do know that I booked a \"mountain view\" room ($390 per night) and received a partial ocean view room). This room overlooked the pool at las olas and had the ocean in the background. We had a nice patio area, too. I really appreciated the serenity of this village & noticed that when going up to the main hotel area and pool area, it was much more crowded & noisy, although the views were great & it looked to be a great area for children to play. There is a swim-up bar at the main pool level, but there are also regular pool bars at the other pools. My husband and I have no children and are in our 30's, so we enjoyed staying at the pool in our village or going down to the marina village to use their pool, which was very beautiful, right on the ocean & peaceful. Palomino island is georgeous - I did not find the beach rocky, but instead sandy with beautiful clear water. The island has plenty of room and activities - you could either join in on beach volleyball games & use water sports, or you could continue down the beach to privacy & quiet. I thought that the options at the resort were great, where you could join in the fun or find your own peaceful quiet areas. As for eating - be ready to spend your money! My husband and I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the US, so we do not have a problem spending money on great food. However, most of the food is not great, only average or below average. You still need to be prepared to pay! Isabelas was our best dining experience. Otello's was a disaster (as much as you may like Italian food, it is not worth the many mistakes made in this restaurant). My husband & I really enjoyed Ballyhoo & La Cantina for drinks. We missed our reservations at the Japanese restaurant one night, so we ordered in take out from there (I thought that was a nice option offered). Our take out bill was $120. That included a bottle of wine, but I still think is a little pricy for nnodles, rice & dumplings! I think that if you are bringing a family, food could get quite expensive. We love casinos, but only spent about 15 minutes in this one (yuck). Also - the bar next to the casino with the dance club attached is gross & we nightly watched underaged teens drinking there! If you're looking for a nice after dinner bar for drinks, go to the cigar bar - it is much nicer and has a nicer crowd. Overall, my husband & I enjoyed our stay b/c we were there to relax & were not expecting a brand new resort. We could charge everything we did to the room, including food, drinks & shopping. We could not take in the beauty of the resort enough, as it is huge and beautiful. We most likely would not come back - I think that I would look for a resort with better restaurants and more up to date rooms, and also a more easily accessible beach. The other option would be to look into Las Casitas, as I believe that those are newer and may have nicer rooms/suites. If you have already booked a trip here - just keep in mind the 4 star resort criteria, and you should enjoy! The staff at the resort were very kind & helpful. Also - ignore the weather report on the Wyndham.com website - it forecasted rain every day for us, but we instead found blue sunny skies in the high 80's daily!", "Date": "February 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cNot sure what to expect after reading reviews\u201d", "Author": "snorklemom", "ReviewID": "UR1658763", "Content": "We just returned last night from our long weekend at El Conquistador. We have been to many resorts in the Caribbean with and without our children and are pretty realistic about what to expect on vacation. This time we took our two children (ages 8 and 4) and booked an ocean view room through expedia at a decent rate (wyndham guarantees the lowest rates on the internet, but we found that not to be true). I joined wyndham by request as suggested by so many reviewers, however, received notice that effectice Nov. 1, 2003, benefits are no longer available for reservations made on 3rd party travel web sites. We considered cancelling and rebooking through wyndham website so that we could be assured a nice room. (If anyone has the answer to this mystery, I'd like to hear it!) We were really concerned about some of the comments made about the rooms. I was not expecting the royal treatment since we booked through expedia, but we asked for an upgrade anyway upon arrival. It was one in the morning after a long delay by Delta from Atlanta. We were told we had been upgraded already. Our room was facing the back side of Las Brisas, along the service road on the back of the property with the ocean and small village in the distance. It was clean, but worn. We liked being close to the funicular and main lobby and main pools. All in all, a good location for us. One tip: Since there were four of us, we chose a taxi over the resort shuttle because we did not want to wait for everyone else to load up. The cost one way is $75 and the shuttle for the four of us would have cost more. Plus, we were able to grab our bags off the carousel and jump in a taxi before the shuttle was ready.Main impression: This is a large, spread out resort. Everything you need is there, but requires a hike and it will cost you. There was at least one large conference going on during this time. I would not consider this a honeymoon destination. My kids were right at home as we expected. I can't imagine why anyone coming here would NOT expect it to be well-suited for families. It is!Activities: Palomina Island is gorgeous! There is actually room for all those people getting off the ferry (without feeling crowded). The snorkeling is perfect for children; sandy bottom, no waves or currents. Go to the farthest end to your right when you get off the ferry for the best location! And visit the rain forest. The kids loved the hike to Las Minas Falls and learned a lot about conservation along the way. Of course, we couldn't keep them out of the pool.Restaurants: The breakfast buffet was fine, just like any buffet. If you like large quantities of food and lots of variety. We ate there once. We liked the Cafe off the lobby (a la carte) for the rest of our stay. Our dinner at Stingray was fantastico! Grilled dorado and tuna with mango salsas. Our kind waiter brought hamburgers over from Bayyhoos for the kids. Lunches on Palomina Island were great (anywhere that serves chicken fingers and fries is an A+ on our list). Dinner at Las Cantina de Las Olas was disappointing. We are Tex-Mex aficionados and this ain't it. Our final lunch at Ballyhoo's wasn't meant to be. We worked out our departure so that we could run down to the marina and have a grilled dorado sandwich only to be told \"we're out of dorado today\"! Had to settle for jerk chicken.Service: In response to all the commentary about service, we found EVERYONE who worked at the resort that we came into contact with during our stay to be professional, and extremely courteous. We tried to remember our \"buenas dias and gracias\" and it is truly appreciated.Overall, we felt that the value we received at the prices was on par, but we might have felt differently if we paid higher rates. Our goal was to get to a family friendly resort in the Caribbean on a non-stop flight from Atlanta with minimal transfers. For a long weekend, this trip was perfect for the four of us.

He walked us over to the El Conquistador desk.Airport transportation is $60 roundtrip per person. The hotel's shuttle is a van with a VCR (on the return we were shown old Hooneymooners episodes taped off television in the 1980s) and a bar (complimentary drinks). The van wasn't at the airport, so they had us wait for about 20 minutes while they gathered up some other folks coming in on AA and then stuck us in a shared cab. There was no break on price.Got to the hotel around midnight. The airport is about 30 miles from the hotel -- nearly an hour drive without traffic and far longer on the return which was midday. The hotel lobby was abuzz and several folks were in line ahead of me. The Byrequest checkin desk was unmanned, so I waited in line.The other folks on my shuttle were ahead of me and I saw they got placed in the main hotel. I saw one confirmation printed with a hotels.com logo. That person seemed to get a pretty standard room, assigned to them at checkin.I got to the front of the line and the clerk saw that I had been preblocked. He walked back into the office and came back out with a smile on his face. I was in a suite at the Marina level. It was a 10 minute walk and I returned to the entrance to retrieve my luggage and an staff member to help with it.We walked through the main hotel and to the funicular, the \"elevator\" on a track that takes you down from the main property (Las Vistas and Las Brisas) to the middle level (Las Olas) and down to the Marina. There are two funiculars -- one that's an express straight to the marina and one that stops at the Las Olas level.Once down at the marina we walked to the far end where we were shown a secluded room. The hotel is quite large -- about 970 rooms -- but I was at the very end of the property and it was quiet. The room was large. The bathroom was huge. There was a pool that was seldom used right next to the room. The bed was very comfortable.But the real benefit was the balcony. It was huge and had a direct ocean view, with the pool off to the right (and a mountain behind it). Absolutely stunning. My favorite part of my long weekend was just sitting out on the balcony and relaxing. There was pretty comfortable furniture out there, too.The ByRequest manager really took care of me and he called the next day to check on me. Believe me I thanked him profusely -- the room was more than I had hoped.It was nearly 1am by the time I was ready to turn in, but I was hungry. The room service menu said that service was until 1am, and I had 15 minutes left, but I called and the number just rang. I called the front desk and was told that room service at the marina level stops at midnight, and that the only food options were back in the main hotel (I later learned there was an all night option). So I snacked on the fruit left by ByRequest.In the morning I went to breakfast at the buffet restaurant. For a resort with so many food options (more than a dozen) they're really lacking at breakfast. There's the Cafe Caribe in the main hotel, the restaurant service a buffet (I forget its name) and more or less just room service as the other option. I was disappointed in breakfast, and on future days just popped up to the little bakery in the hotel first thing for a mocha and then ordered room service which I enjoyed out on the balcony.Next I went out to Palomino Island, the resort's leased private island which is the site of the beach. Plenty of chairs and shade and good bar/cafe service. The boat leaves every half hour from 9-3 and takes about 20 minutes to get there. Came back to the room and made dinner reservations at the seafood restaurant at the Marina. The menu wasn't all that exciting, and didn't live up to its billing as Carribean-influenced seafood. Everything was fairly plain and offered either with rice or truffled mashed potatos. So I made a meal of soup, two appetizers, and dessert which was excellent.The next night I had dinner at the teppan yaki restaurant, which is a bit of a factory and the whole affair was over in 45 minutes or so. That restaurant also offers sushi and chinese -- the chinese I ordered the following night as room service and enjoyed it on the balcony.The isn't a place that invests in all of the details. For instance, toilet paper is Scott tissue. Some of the furniture in the room was stained. Housekeeping never cleaned up out on the balcony, so anything I wanted taken away needed to be moved inside. Spa phone line rings off the hook... Including hold time I waited 20 minutes to schedule a massage. And the attendants at the spa were somewhat aloof.In the end, the resort had everything I wanted. The weather was perfect and I was perfectly located on the property. My balcony absolutely made the trip. The grounds are huge, and with such a large resort comes an enormous number of options. The place is really a self-contained city (there's even a sunglass hut franchise on the property, along with several other shops). It's far from anything else one would want to do or go to, but there's an Avis rent a car on property. I didn't leave the property during my stay.I would definitely go back if I could secure the same room.", "Date": "February 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dutchess County, New York", "Title": "\u201cParadise on the Carribean Sea\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1638195", "Content": "Just got back from the El Conquistador.

We had rooms at Las Olas which were not fancy but as the other person said it was great to have such a large amount of counter and closet space particularly in the bathroom. The terrace had a view of the pool and the ocean beyond even though we did not expect a view of the ocean. There was dining in various price categories more so than at other resorts. The fancier restaurants (particularly the one down by the boat dock!) were well worth the price. My husband and I are not big eaters and the staff happily accomodated us when we decided to split an entree one night at the outdoor restaurant by the pool and also at lunch on the Island. We watched the sun set over El Junque right from the golf course! The resort is quite large but there is so much to do that we never encountered any crowds of people in one place. No waiting on lines. The only problem we had was when we landed at the airport. The young man from the El Conquistador greeted us and told us where to get our bags and he told us he would wait for us there, but, by the time we returned he had left. We had to wait for an extra half hour and finally found that there was a desk for the hotel located ouside of the terminal. There were 7 of us stranded there and the hotel guy found us a taxi for 6 to take us to the hotel. (One unfortunate husband and wife had to share a seat all the way) and we were not charged any less for the lower class of service.

The first being the Conquistador in Fajardo. It's very lush and beautiful. They spend all their money on the grounds and the lobby areas. They could spruce up the rooms inside a bit. If you plan to go there, join Wyndham by Request. It's free from their website and it will get you free snacks and drinks upon arrival in your room and an upgrade if available. The parking is $10 per day self park and $15 valet. The self park is a short walk away and a van drives around to pick you up if they spot you. The bathrooms are a nice size. With kids, this is a plus. The pools were nothing to write home about. just average pools. We did get to use floaties and pool toys from the towel station. But not to be missed is the private island of Palomino. There are three nice ferry boats that run every half hour. It takes 15 minutes to get there. The last to take you there is three pm while the last to bring you back is 530 pm. Go even if you don't plan on staying just to tour the first day. It has all the amenities - restaurant, bathrooms, water sports, putt putt, lounge chairs, horse back riding. It is white sandy beaches with crystal waters. Definitely worth the stay. The Hyatt Dorado was nicely appointed but we had to request a change of rooms due to the musty smell again. The closeness to the beach was great but the rooms were very humid. They have hammocks everywhere and it is rather quiet. We rode to the Cerromar which was just five minutes away and the kids had a blast in the lazy river pool. This place is totally geared for kids. They have a great 18 hole putt putt and the beach right by the pool as well. There was a changing/shower/locker room which was very handy next to the shop. Parking at the Dorado is free but like all resorts, they have a resort fee. Next we went to the Copamarina resort in Guanica. All I can say about this place is dead. If you want to do nothing. Come here. They have a couple of pools. The one had a fountain in the middle and my youngest enjoyed it. But the best part was the trip to Gilligan's Island. You catch a ferry from Copamarina there - it's four dollars per person. You have to tell the dive shop and they call the small boat. It stops somewhere nearby for the locals and then comes over to Copamarina. It ran pretty much every hour. We found crystal clear waters and so much fish to look at. The dive shop is where you get towels too. The shop here didn't seem too outrageous in prices. The other thing is they have live music every night by the outdoor restaurant. They had a guitar player who was wonderful. Also, their hamburgers were delicious. The bugs were ferocious. Bring INSECT REPELLANT. Guests were running to their rooms to avoid being bitten. The rooms were colorful and beds comfortable. It's more casual, they didn't have room service either. And the parking here is free but if you get a room in building 5 which is the last one, it's a short walk. Last but not least, the Embassy Suites in Isla Verde. It is nearby many restaurants and shops. So you can walk to places. Try Mi Casita's or Metropol nearby for reasonable authentic meals. Embassy Suites charges $10 for self park and $14 for valet. But can't beat the free breakfast and the afternoon manager's reception. But it is close to the airport and you hear the planes. But we love the suites and two tv's. They have outback steakhouse downstairs along with the hotel restaurant. The pool here is very nice too. The kids always love it. All in all we wouldn't hop again but now I know what the hotels are like. And we always pick up a copy of Que Pasa Magazine which comes in very handy.

I must say I was speechless when I walked into the main lobby; it was breathtaking. We had a club room which included continental breakfast, hordorves in the evening, private concierge, and access to the VIP lounge in the Las Brisas wing. We had a stunning view of the ocean overlooking Palomino Island, and Vieques. We took the rainforest walking tour and our guide was knowledgeable, personable and made it very interesting. ( There is also a hiking tour of El Yunque that will take you to La Mina falls.) Contrary to another review there are tours to San Juan, one guided and the other a day of shopping in Old San Juan also to El Morro castle. This is where I shop as I have been to San Juan before. There is a few shops at the resort but the really interesting finds are in San Juan and it is nice to learn from the locals as Puerto Rico is friendly place and has a rich history. The hotel and the grounds are very well maintained and the staff very accomadating and professional. I have a degree in botany and the landscaping foreman was very knowledgeable and indulged my questions about the plantings, etc. The hotel staff were always very polite and helpful we found them to be a great source of local information and ideas for excursions offsite. I also used the dry cleaning service and my clothes were back in my room within a few hours clean and nicely pressed. The restaurants are pricey, and I found that the everyday food was pricier in comparison to the Stingray Cafe and Isabela's. It is true Cafe Caribe ( although the food was great) they have an $8 hot dog on the menu. With that said I recommend the crabmeat tostones. I agree if you want to relax and enjoy the sun it is great, but they do have rental cars and guided tours if you want to explore. Palomino Island was beautiful and the only complaint I have is the horseback riding. I found the stable area to be substandard and the resort needs to allocate more space. Also the horses were saddled all day: this is not entirely humane. I have three horses myself and would never keep them in such conditions. The horses were not groomed before being saddled. Needless to say I did not ride, but spoke to the stable manager. Paso Finos are noble Spanish horses and should be treated as such. I will get down from my soap box now. The boat ride to and from Palomino is very relaxing and enjoyable. I must say it was a great week and we had a wonderful time.

We opted to pay for the hotel transport to and from the airport. The price was $60 per person for round trip transportation. It was well worth it as the resort is difficult to find if you are not familiar with the area. We did not rent a car since we were planning to park ourselves on the beach for the entire trip. And what a wonderful beach is it! Palimino Island is a private island that is leased by the resort. A15 minute boat ride gets you there and the boat leaves every half hour from 9am to 3pm. After 3pm, only return trips from the island are available. The boat leaves the island every half hour from 3pm to 6pm. So, you could conceivably stay on the island from 9:30am to 6pm. The island has restrooms (flush toilets!), a restaurant/bar, a small shop, and beach rentals. There is plenty of room for everyone, lots of chairs and plenty of shade if you want it. The resort, itself, is gorgeous. We had a sunset vista room and it was as depicted on the Wyndham website. There are excellent pictures of the resort on travelocity. We were very satisfied with our accomodations. My only complaint is that there were a few small ants on the vanity when we arrived. Probably because someone had left something sweet there. Anyway, no big deal. We called the front desk and they took care of it immediately. We saw no more ants after that. The food at the resort is very good, but expensive. But of course, this is typical of secluded resorts and no big deal since we had gotten such a good deal to begin with. There are cafes and a bakery where you can get muffins, etc for breakfast. The drinks are expensive, $6 for a beer, $8 for a mixed drink. But, again, this is not atypical for this type of resort. There is a casino at the resort, it was busy. There is also a disco. No one went there. There is the funicular ride that you have to take to the marina to get the boat to Palimino. It's like one of those cable car type ski lifts, only it runs on a track on the ground. There are 2 of them. We never waited more than 5 minutes for one, well maybe 7-10 minutes when we returned from the beach late in the day. I didn't see this as a problem. The tennis courts are lovely. The golf course looked very nice (I'm not a golfer). The people who work at the resort are great. If you ask for directions, a staff member will actually walk you there! Some suggestions: Bring reef shoes. The beach, in the water, has coral. We brought ours and were glad we did! Bring your own snorkel gear, if you have it. The snorkeling is very good. You don't have to go beyond your waist to see fish. Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. I am one of those travelers who finds it difficult to sleep on the first night. I could hear doors shutting, showers running,, etc.--especially the first night when I was getting acclimated. I recently bought a travel alarm clock that has a white noise sound machine.

I have gone through all the possible reviews about this hotel before I arrived. Therefore, we only ate at the hotel a few times since it was pricy. Overall, the food was good, but again expensive!!! If you plan to eat at the hotels at all times, it's probably better to buy the meal plan. The private island is the best of all.

Simply jump in the water and you will enjoy the experience. My husband even saw a sting ray there. You must try the fries on the island.

Why?Well...first let me say that we had beautiful weather.So that being said and with the resort being on a mountain bluff with gorgeous views of the Atlantic ocean merging with the Carribean as well as viewing their own private Palamino Island ...other islands(believe St.Thomas and Viequs)....Utterly superb with excellent weather conditions! Also, my wife and I are pool/ beach people. We stayed in the main hotel wing...(Bresas) and found that to be convenient to mostly everything...pools,cafes,casino,restaurants,and the elevators/funnoculars to the marina level at the base of the cliff.The free boat ride to the island was a real treat...as at times we caught the speedier boat which brought us there in 20 minutes.Once there...it was paradise...horseback riding ,hiking trails, water sports, volleyball, outdoor cafe,tiki bar...The water was calm,clean and beautiful. You could see your feet. There were some rocks but I found that the sand in the water was much softer directly east of the tiki bar. We set up on comfortable lounge chairs provided by the hotel on that side of the beach(facing \"Little\" Palamino island)For those whom do not want too much sun, little tiki huts were spread out along the sand that could provide great coverage while lounging.Waiter service was available along the beach.The main pool area was cleaned every morning....swim up bar...with happy hour every day from 2:00-3:00 PM. Perhaps, the biggest \"secret\" we uncovered was the happy hour from 5:00-7:00 pm at the Mexican place, La Cantina which is one stop down on the funnocular to the Olas level.We had dinner there one night and the view was fantastic and We had some pretty decent chicken and steak fajitas. We ate in Isabellla's steak house one night and although it is a bit pricey, the food was pretty good in a comfortable setting and I guess what you would expect in a fine hotel like this one. The Italian restaurant looked like a great place to eat but pricey...$26. for Chicken parm.We ate offsite one night at a place not too far from the hotel grounds entrance...the Anchor Inn.The decor was just alright(not much of a bar area) but the prices were cheaper than the hotel and the food was very good. Our waiter/proprietor Pedro was very friendly and the meals were cooked to order... we found the shrimp and snapper to be very delicious... rice, beans,plaintains on the side and it hit the spot. Try the custard for dessert.As for night time entertainment....,outside of the casino, not much to do. There is a disco and small bar outside the casino but the Saturday night that I was there....not much happening. A band played a few sets in the small bar/lobby sitting area but the dance area was a bit awkward and never really got the crowd into it and finished way too early.Finally, we are Wyndham by request members, and with that we were upgraded to ocean view rooms (clean,walkin closet,pre bathroom area with sink, and bathroom)and free Coronas and chesse and crackers were sent up to our room after we checked in. Make sure you join prior to booking your trip as you also get late 2:00 pm check out.I believe the Wyndham chain is changing their policy on this for all internet bookings( outside of their own) after 11/1/2003.

This is easily the biggest and most beautiful resort I have ever been to. My wife and I returned yesterday from a 4 night stay and were blown away. The architecture is beautiful and the place is enormous and has everything you could ask for. However, the crowning feature of this resort is the view.You can get either the Ocean View (which we did), or the Garden/Rainforest view. Both are stunningly beautiful. On a clear day you can see right over to the USVI, and sometimes the BVI. There's a beautiful private island owned by the resort and a free water taxi every 30 minutes. That was reaaalll nice. Finally, the famous Golden Door Spa on the resort is spectacular, it was my first time having a spa treatment, and I went three days in a row. I didnt play golf this trip, but the course looks very very well manicured. In a nutshell, easily the best of all the Caribbean resorts I have been to. Ok. Of course there's always a few gripes, and here are mine: 1 - Everything will cost you an arm and a leg. Try $25 for the cheapest entree, and that can go up to $45. Beers and cocktails are in the typical $5-7 range, and there's NO caribbean or spanish restaurants! 2 - Some of the staff seem a little slow and not quite trained, but all were very pleasant. 3 - Its a long way from San Juan, not in miles, but in drive-time. Puerto Rico's road are horrendously overcrowded and poorly maintained. I suggest you pay the $60 roundtrip per person and ride on El Conquistador's luxurious coach which will pick you up right outside the baggage claim. 4 - Dont bother turning up early. Check in is not until 4pm, and they'll hold you to that time.We waited for 4 hours to check-in. Having said all that, I refuse to end on a negative note. Aside from the price of things on the resort, (which can be somewhat avoided by buying your gifts etc in Fajardo or San Juan, and if you want you can eat breakfast in the nice cafes on the resort like Las Brisas and Cafe Caribe), I loved this place.Its location on a cliff-side overlooking the Caribbean sea is unforgettable, the facilities are amazing, and the private island is breath-taking (evidenced by a visit from Anna Kournikova on our last day there - she was in for a photo shoot).

I was nervous about taking this trip and spending the money after having read some of the reviews posted here but when we got there all my worries were put to ease. The drive to the hotel takes about an hour from the airport, through San Juan and through many small, urban towns. Expect what you would expect in any city: litter, congestion, traffic and poorly-kept homes. Puerto Rico is a third world country, regardless of its association with the U.S. I was somewhat surprised to see the level of poverty, but it is what it is and people should expect to see that. When we got to the resort it was almost as if we stepped into a different country: immaculate grounds, and breath taking views of the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. We arrived at around 11am and were quickly checked-in, which was a definite plus. Most hotels won't do this. Our package (which we booked directly through Wyndham) included breakfast each day and a free upgrade to an ocean view room, which they honored with three different choices of rooms! We settled on one that directly faced Palomino Island, the resort's private beach (totally worth it!!). My husband and I woke to a glorious sunrise every morning. On occassion a passing shower would leave a brilliant rainbow in its wake (something every hopless romantic should witness during their \"second honeymoon\"!) :-). As I said, the grounds were immaculate, except for these annoying crow-like birds that harass guests (particularly at the Las Brisas restaurant, the resorts buffet breakfast spot.) The staff try to keep the birds out but it is an open air restaurant so it is almost impossible to do so. Just eat indorrs if you can't deal with the wildlife. The food is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE so be prepared to spend anywhere from $25 to $75 a day on food per person. I didn't like that we couldn't find a single decent caribbean-fare restaurant at the resort. It caters to the average American guest (burgers, fries, buffets, etc.) Las Cantinas Mexican restaurant was probably the best restaurant, with DELICIOUS burritos, a GORGEOUS view of the marina and ocean, and great margaritas. Moderately priced too. The beach was my only real big dissapointment. You have to take a ferry to the private island (Palomino Island) which was really nice. You get to see the views of the resort from the ocean and it is a very beautiful place. But we are beach bums and were hoping to enjoy smooth, white sand like you would find in the Bahamas and Jamaica (places we've been to before). The beach was very clean, well kept and they provide guests with towels and plenty of beach chairs, but it is extremely, extremely rocky. If you plan on swimming, bring water shoes (those sock things you can swim with. YOU WILL NEED THEM!) There are sharp rocks and coral in the water and it is very painful to cross barefoot. The water was very warm and very, very calm. Absolutely a dream. We even got to see a little, tiny tornado form in the clouds over the water one day! The staff wasn't worried about it since it was nowhere near touching land or sea, so we didn't worry. It was pretty cool to see it form. There are three main hotel pools, pretty but nothing much to do there. Drinks are pretty good (try the Puerto Rican Passion) but typical NY prices ($6 for beer, $8-10 for specialty drinks) They did offer happy hour, half-priced drinks at the pool from 2 to 3 pm everyday. This was a plus. The so called casino and club weren't anything special but something fun to pass the nights with while at the resort. Well, the casino anyway. The club sucked. (Very pretty, moroccan theme but very cheesy 70's and 80's music. If that's your thing, go knock yourself out. Otherwise skip the club.) As to other activities, rent a car. Don't bother with the tours. We rented a car for two days ($160) and went to Old San Juan (definitely a treat if you are a history and architecture buff like me) and to El Yunque National rainforest. Definitely worth it if you really want to see the island for what it is and not just the fantasy islsand resort. We found the staff at the hotel to be very helpful but the locals were even friendlier. Everyone is very willing to help if you \"get lost while driving\" :), and people will actually smile and say hi to you. (I'm from NY, this is a plus!) Overall, as I said, this was a dream vacation but pricey. I HIGHLY recommend it but just bring extra cash. Oh, if you are planning to bring home any liquor, don't buy Bacardi 151 proof rum; they won't let you board the plane with it since it is flammable. No one told us this until after we'd spent the $55 on it and were ready to come home with it. My husband ended up having to give it away.

Our marina room was right on the water, large and clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. The prices have no relation to reality. You feel as tho you are ripped-off every minute. Small drinks are $8, a 10oz beer $6. Use of snorkling equipment costs $16. A five minute taxi ride to town is $30 RT. If you rent a car, they charge $10 per day for parking. NOTHING is free or reasonably priced. I have stayed all over the world and have never experienced this level of anxiety about prices. We have the money, but there was something about the outrageousness of the prices that kept us from wanting to pay them. There are lovely local restaurants that are so much better. Definitely stop at the market and stock up on drinks and snacks before you arrive.", "Date": "May 18, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, VA", "Title": "\u201cOkay...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR991897", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I stayed at this hotel four years ago, so things may have improved.That said, I think this hotel has great potential...but they need to change some things. First of all, we arrived on time but had to wait over four hours for a room to be cleaned for us. They didn't offer us a temporary room until we had already been waiting for two hours. I saw a lot of families with small children trying to keep the kids from climbing the walls from boredom.On our second night we ordered pizza for dinner and ate it in bed while we were watching tv. I guess there were a few crumbs left behind because we woke up to red ant invasion. Our beds were covered with them! We were never warned that leaving food out might cause this so we kind of freaked out. We called room service and it took then quite awhile to get up to our room (we ended up \"cleaing up\" ourselves).This might not concern some people, but the towels all had tons of hair in them. I thought it was really gross and it was like that the entire time we were there.On the up-side, the hotel is gorgeous and the pool was really nice. If you're looking for a place that has TONS of activities, you should probably stay somewhere else. It was mainly all about relaxation.", "Date": "May 7, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "El Conquistador Resort, A Waldorf Astoria Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g612474-d148045-Reviews-El_Conquistador_Resort_A_Waldorf_Astoria_Resort-Fajardo_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$188 - $367*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1000 El Conquistador Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Fajardo</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00738</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "148045", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/34/91/3491de66396b77181cfb4d79f0cc79b54large.jpg"}}
