We had a warm welcome from Borish and settled well in to our clean, light and comfortable room. The bed was comfortable- not too soft, not too hard and the sheets were crisp and fresh. Bathroom lovely (although we had a temperamental hot water tap in the shower... either freezing or boiling... or you caught the 30 second switch over when the water was just right!), safe in the wardrobe etc- all the things you'll need. There was also a flashy looking TV in the room, but when you're in a city like Istanbul, who wants to watch TV?!! The breakfasts were, as I undersatnd it, traditionally Turkish. It was like a buffet of assorted breakfast items, with a few lunch items in there too! Jam, bread, eggs, olives, cheese rolls (homemade) and fresh coffee and juices. It is served from 8am until 11am, so get there not too late to not miss out! The first day we went to breakfast at 10am or so, and there was one bread roll left! The kitchen and dining room area is on the roof, which offers BRILLIANT views one way over the Bospherous (a great view to start the day), and Ayia Sophia the other way. Being on the roof also gives you a great opportunity to take in the higgledy-piggeldy rooflines of this city! Hanedan is ideally located for all the major sites. After the first day, we walked everywhere... no need to get trams and taxis etc (although public transport is very close and easy to use)- and walking is a great way to see Istanbul! There's a road next to Hanedan that has an assortment of bars and restaurants, which offer evening excitement if that's what you're looking for. We could hear it going on, but only on the Saturday evening- we stayed Weds-Sun, so it wasn't a big deal to hear noise in a city for one night only. Hanedan was great and we'd recommend it! My only suggestion for Hanedan is that the lady who sets up breakfast wear softer soled shoes and her clicking heels walking around woke us every morning at 630! But really, if that and the shower are my only downsides... it means this place is good!

During our stay, we had some cold days but even if you're inside, there are windows all around so you can enjoy the view. We never felt rushed at breakfast and there was always a place to sit. The manager of the hotel was always there and very helpful - he was the best part of the whole Hanedan experience. He suggested a traditional hamam that we thoroughly enjoyed and suggested itineraries for us - very helpful and it was appreciated. We emailed the hotel before our stay and always received prompt replies. We set up a ride from the airport through the hotel but when we arrived, no one was there to pick us up. We checked back three times but did not see anyone so took a taxi in. We found out when we arrived at the hotel that a driver was at the airport waiting for us. Perhaps he was late?

Room: the rooms are clean, spacious and nicely maintained. all the buildings in this part of town are aging but the staff does a good job of keeping the hotel fresh. i noticed a comment by another traveler who mentioned that a set of drawers would be helpful. i suspect that for a family that would be true but the free-standing closets in my rooms have had shelves which worked fine for me. Hospitality: as mentioned the staff is welcoming and accomodating. breakfast is served on the roof starting at 8:00 which works since sights don't open until 9:00 or later and you are close to all the major ones. how to get around town, what is worth going out of the way for, etc. are all topics the staff is up to date on.

We arrived on a Sunday and were put into the double room we booked. This is a small room and it is quite dark but it was very clean, had a small TV and would have done us perfectly for our entire stay. There is some noise from the breakfast terraces in the morning. However on the second night we got moved to the family room free of charge which was great, equally clean and well kept but lighter airier and to the front of the hotel so quieter as it is on a side street. Had we stayed in the original smaller and slightly noisier room for our whole 5 nights I may be saying to you try another hotel as there are plenty in this area, all family owned and some are slightly cheaper but I couldn't comment on them obviously and personally I can put up with those things if I know a place is in a good location and the staff are nice. The breakfast is perfectly fine, bread eggs meat cheese jams yoghurt olives.. typical Turkish style and the breakfast room and terrace has a lovely view over the Bosphorous and of the Aya Sofia. The staff are attentive polite and charming. The main thing this hotel has going for it though is it's location. A 10 min walk to all the major sites and 5 mins to the centre of Sultanahmet Square. Having walked around the other 'hotel areas' of Sultanahment, basically all the side streets off the main square in every direction, I think where we were was the nicest area, it had much less traffic than those on the other side of the Blue Mosque. The bar opposite is also really nice with cushions outside and lovely staff and reasonably priced beer for this close to the main sites at 6TL for a large Efes. If I had only one downside to this hotel it would be to say that they do lock their door at night.. I'm not entirely sure what time thsi was but we came home a few times at 1 or 2am after drinking over the road or in Beoglu and it was locked and we had to knock on the window to wake up the guy asleep on the couch in reception, he always seemed a little put out and I never worked out if this was ok or not! But that said, they never complained. A couple of random tips if you are travelling to Istanbul, get an akbil for 6TL and stick some money on it (the Istanbul equvalent of an Oyster Card) if you plan to leave the immediate area a lot... it's cheaper and easier than keep buying tokens and the metro and funicular are very good and very cheap at 1.50TL everywhere in the city. Boats are also cheap at between 2.50TL and 5TL out to the islands. Taxis are fine but since they became metered by law they often try to take you the long way to make extra money and the same journey three times cost me 6TL, 12 TL AND 15TL in the same week! Also change your money in Turkey (in Sutanahmet not the airport) you get a much better rate over there and there is a change office right in the main square.

Our room Commagene was fairly small but clean and fairly comfortable. My biggest criticism would be the noise. The first night was extremely quiet except for the sound of the local muezzin the following morning. However our sleep was interrupted the following night by what sounded like an air conditioning unit from an adjacent building, which produced an extremely annoying irregular clicking noise. Whilst we always like to sleep with the window open, this simply was not possible and we switched on the air conditioning unit in the room which was also very loud, but slightly the lesser of 2 evils. The third night (Saturday) brought with it some loud music from the bar behind the hotel, which was playing some very cheesy dance music at a loud volume. But the loud clicking noise continued and actually drowned out the dance music. By night four, we had purchased ear plugs. So sods law dictated that the air conditioning noise and the dance music had stopped. So all was as peaceful as the first night. We even slept through to the call to prayer. Nights 5 and 6 were also quiet. In defence of the hotel staff, I don't think there was anything they could have done, as the noise was coming from other buildings. So we didn't complain. However, I would advise taking ear plugs just in case. A room on the street side should also be quieter. Apart from the noise and the size of the room, we found the accommodation to be fairly good value for money. The bed is a four poster, the room has adequate lighting, and although noisy, the air conditioning can soon cool the room. There is also a safe. The bathroom was clean. Water pressure and temperature in the shower was variable. But I suspect this would be a problem in all Istanbul properties. The hotel is located on a busy street, packed with restaurants and bars. So you're right in the middle of the action in Sultanahmet with the Blue Mosque and Aya Sofya around 5 minutes walk away. We took the offer of the car from the airport (EUR 15), to make our arrival as simple as possible, and the owner converts this back to Turkish Lira using a published internet conversion rate (www.xe.com). However, once you get used to public transportation, you'll find it fairly easy and much cheaper to navigate your own way back to the airport. Service at the hotel was fairly good, with the reception staff always welcoming and chatty, the cleaning staff friendly and the breakfast staff also helpful. Breakfast on the roof of the hotel (indoors in summer) is a fairly simple continental affair, but does the job. The bread is lovely and fresh and there is a good selection of meats, cheeses, olives, jam and fruit. I particularly enjoyed the yogurt which you can put fruit on top. Overall, I would recommend Hanedan as a good cheap option in a great location close to all the main attractions. So it's an ideal base for a short trip to Istanbul.

One item needing improvement is towels. They were a bit frayed at the edges. We had an enjoyable stay until it came time to checkout. At checkout the bill was higher than it should have been. When we questioned our bill, we were told the triple room that we had reserved had not been available. Instead we were given a larger room so we were charged more. We felt this was wrong and that we should not have to pay the extra amount due to their mistake. It was apparent that management did not want to refund the charges & instead continued to give reasons hoping that we'd agree. Eventually after at least 10 min. of discussion (which at the time seemed much longer), we were refunded the difference. If the hotel had known of a room problem ahead of time, they could have emailed us. Then we could made the decision to stay or to find new lodging.

I was a little worried about what it might be like to travel as a woman alone so I purposely chose a smaller hotel. The Hanedan Hotel felt perfectly safe, although I was surprised to find it run by young people and not the multi-generational family I imagined. The hotel is located just underneath the Aya Sofia (about two blocks down a very steep hill towards the water). It is just off of a main tourist street, filled with tourist-friendly restaurants and shops, travel agencies for day trips, small grocery shops, etc. An ATM is located about 1.5 blocks away, as is a post office. The cooking school is on this street as well. The Four Seasons is right there too. It feels safe in the immediate neighborhood, although definitely touristy (but interestingly, the tourists were a very international mix, running the gamut from backpackers to families to high-end denizens of the Four Seasons.) Some of the shopkeepers are quite aggressive (in a mostly friendly but very persistent way). But for a first-time tourist, the neighborhood around this hotel was pretty great. The hotel itself has 3 floors of rooms, with a very steep and somewhat narrow staircase (thank goodness the desk clerk offered to take my luggage up to my 3rd floor room!). There are only a few rooms on each floor, and while I could hear the doors being opened and closed, this was definitely a quiet hotel guest-wise. The rooftop breakfast room/deck was amazing, with perfect views of the Bosphorus, the Marmara Sea, and over the shoulder, a lovely view of the Aya Sofia. To see the Blue Mosque (only about 4 blocks away) you have to crane your neck, but you can see all 6 minarets. My room was VERY clean, with marble tile in the bathroom and a refinished dark wood floor in the small entry hall and bedroom. Each room is named after a different historic period in Turkey, and while my room didn't have a good view (I saw into the building next door), the room was large enough for my queen size 4-poster bed, plus a desk and chair and plenty of room for yoga on the floor. Oddly, there were obviously supposed to be two traditional paintings on the wall, but one was missing. There was just the nail and some marks in the paint where it had been. It felt pretty discordant with the rest of my experience, but it also suggested a more casual and relaxed atmosphere (which fortunately did not extend to cleanliness, which was excellent!). There is free wireless internet (with a server on each floor so there is plenty of bandwidth and it was never slow while I was there). There was no TV in the room, but that was fine with me since I hadn't come to watch TV. The AC worked quickly and well. The shower had plenty of water pressure (and plenty of hot water). The desk, as I mentioned before, was run by younger men who all seemed friendly, although not all of them spoke English all that well (they just ran across the street to a sister hotel if there was a language issue and things got worked out quickly). They were all very friendly and polite. The breakfast was pretty good, BTW. There was fresh bread, thick Turkish yogurt, a selection of jams, honey, and butter, as well as olive spread and two different kinds of cheese and cold cuts. There were also hard-boiled eggs. There were fresh apricots every morning, and some mornings there were grapes or melon. The friendly young woman working there was quick to make tea or coffee to order. The view for breakfast was really amazing, and it added up to quite a pleasant experience. Overall, I found the hotel to be quiet and relaxed. It was not really fancy, and besides the lobby and the rooftop deck, there weren't public spaces. It was great to have the internet access, and it was great that everything was clean. Nothing was really fancy (for example, I could see on the next rooftop deck over, there were hammocks that people could use, and several other rooftop decks on neighboring hotels had bars and restaurants), but it was a good solid place to stay. And probably the lack of flashy tourist draws made this hotel a lot quieter, so it really works for people looking for a basic decent place that is near to the action but is pretty quiet and safe inside. I'd certainly stay there next time I go to Istanbul.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "bruxelles", "Title": "\u201cGood price for value, great location\u201d", "Author": "irmalaboule", "ReviewID": "UR36768671", "Content": "We stayed at Hanedan hotel for 7 nights with our 2 little girls.

These 3 main tourist sites are within walking distance (not even 5 minutes). Hanedan is perfectly located, quiet, beautiful, with abundant restaurants, shops and other budget hotels around. This area is the old part of Istanbul and thus appear so much exotic and full of characters. U can actually see the historic wall behind some of the houses here. The room is clean, beautiful and comfortable - albeit a bit small (not a problem for me). While i was doing my tour around Turkey (away from Istanbul), i just leave one of my luggage in the hotel store room (with permission of course) and thus travel with a much lighter backpacking. This is one major good thing i like abt this hotel - which unfortunately, i didnt know earlier. If i knew before i came, i would have brought a bigger bag to accommodate more souvenirs. The breakfast is healthy and nice and with the view, anything would taste better. The staff are all very helpful and friendly.

The room was not large, but very clean and tidy, there was always supply of hot water, even late at night. The room was cleaned and the towels were changed every day. We liked very much breakfasts on a sunny terrace, which were served from 8 to 11 a.m. and included boiled eggs, fresh bread, fruits, yogurt, cheese, jams and pastry. The view from the terrace was really breathtaking - the Sea of Marmara on the one side and Aya Sofya and Blue Mosque on the other. It was very romantic to sit on the terrace at night with a glass of wine observing chaotic movement of small and big ships on the sea surface, the beautifully illuminated Aya Sofya and the general view of Istanbul. Another pleasant thing about Hanedan is a possibility to connect to the Internet through free wi-fi, so we could use our laptop to check e-mails, chat with friends, etc. Suleyman and all hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, always answering our questions how to get to the places which we wanted to visit. The hotel has a perfect location, just 5 minutes walk to Aya Sofya, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace. The side-street where Hanedan is located is very quet and cosy. We never were disturbed by any noise. Around the hotel there are a lot of cafes and restaurants. The tram station located nearby is another advantage. The city tram makes it easy to get fast to Eminonu, Karakoy, Kabatas, Grand Bazaar, and other city districts.

Reception area nice and staff at desk welcoming and helpful. We had a nice room on first floor, wooden floors and four-poster bed.

Some of the other rooms looked very nice and more spacious. Only disappointment was the breakfast. It was the usual fare of cold meats, cheese, fruit and bread which was fine except that the two waiting staff seemed to spend most of their time sleeping at one of the tables on our first morning so it was difficult to get drinks or any additional food. On the second day the staff were nowhere to be seen and we ended up with a bread roll and no drink. Roof top terrace where you take breakfast is OK and includes a covered area for the chillier mornings, as it was when we were there.

Pros: Location. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about a five minute walk to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. Also great views of the Hagia Sophia and Sea of Marmara. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re route takes you past a corner convenience store where we stocked up on water and bottled pop for the day (and evening on the way back). Clean. We thought our room and bathroom were very clean. Price. I had booked a large double room months in advance and Suleyman honored my 55 euro rate (looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increased now), with an additional 10% discount for paying in cash. So came to around $75 or so. Breakfast. Great views of the Sea and the Hagia Sophia on the rooftop terrace. Quite a spread for breakfast. Great bread, yogurt, honey, cheese, olives,....The breakfast is probably worth $7-$10 a person if you were to buy it on your own. Airport transfer. This was an additional cost, but well worth it. The driver was ready and waiting on our arrival, as well as ready to go for our early morning return trip to the airport a few days later. Cons: A bit noisy. We were in the Seljuk room, a large double room, one floor above street level, on the street. There was quite a noisy bar next door that was blaring American rock music during the late evening/ early nighttime. Luckily we had some earplugs. Perhaps one of the rooms off the street would have less noise. Shower. Though clean, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get about 20 seconds of hot water, then 20 seconds of cold water, then maybe 10 seconds of really hot water. Luckily the shower had enough room to step away from the water, so you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caught in all the phases. Just kind of annoying. Bed. Bed was a little thin considering we could feel the springs in the mattress dig into my ribs when we slept. Our large room actually had a full/queen size bed and two twin sized beds as well. Each bed had a mattress pad type thing on them, so after the first night, we pulled the mattress pads from the other two twin beds and added them to our full/queen to provide some additional softness. That did the trick and after that, no complaints. Overall this place had some pros and cons, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great budget hotel with a great location. I think the combination of the pros, price, location, and breakfast outweigh the cons.

We've stayed in the Hanedan for five days in a wonderful spacious room, went on a trip to Gallipoli and came back for three more days. The second room was even more spacious, and absolutely gorgeous. Our friend stayed in a single room that she was happy with. The rooms are also quiet and comfortable, with both air conditioning and central heating. The Hanedan has only 10 rooms, is run by a small staff of friendly English-speakers, offers a tasty breakfast combining Western and Turkish food, has wireless Internet (although the connectivity should be improved - it didn't reach our second room so we had to use it from the lovely furnished foyer). Breakfast is served on the roof level with a clear and lovely view of Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, and the Sea of Marmara. Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, and the Topkapi Palace (the 3 main tourist destinations in Istanbul) are 5 minutes walking distance. The next street is full of restaurants. What made us come back to the Hanedan was its personal service. The staff, especially Mr Suleyman, went out of their way to help us around and organize trips. We really enjoyed the Hanedan.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cTerrific Place to Stay!\u201d", "Author": "MooseK", "ReviewID": "UR10351962", "Content": "We stayed at the Hanedan Hotel during our one week visit to Istanbul. Hanedan is located very close to all of the \"must see\" places in the Sultanahmet area. It has a terrific view of the Bosphorus, Blue Mosqe and Aya Sophia from the roof top, where you get your sumptous breakfast every morning. The rooms and bathrooms are especially spacious and very clean. The staff is very friendly and most importantly helpful. We would bug them very day about something or another and Suleyman and Hussein were just so helpful! I would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone traveling to Istanbul. - Ann", "Date": "October 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daegu", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful hotel with more beautiful people.\u201d", "Author": "smiletogether", "ReviewID": "UR10341959", "Content": "Last summer, My friends and I (4 girls) stayed at Hotel Hanedan. When we arrived, all things had been arranged-clean bed sheets, fresh towels, and it's provided daily. The rooms are great with antique furnitures and the air conditioner. The hotel's in a good location, walking distance to the Sultanahmet tram station, Blue mosque, Aya Sophia, and other beautiful places. Excellent restaurants nearby, travellers got together and drank beers till late at night in a good atmosphere. The staff at Hotel Hanedan and Hotel Peninsula were so kind and friendly, they said hello every time they saw us, smiling. On the first day at Hanedan, I was just complicated because I didn't know what to do, but those kind and professional staff told me what to do, what to avoid, and where to go. They gave me valuable informations about history of Turkey or public transportations and so on. Great turkish breakfast is included on terrace, during the breakfast hours, the staff made me comfortable and pleasant with all their jokes. I spent 4 days at Hotel Hanedan, and that is the happiest time I've ever had. I recommend you to choose this hotel if you also want to have great memories. yuri", "Date": "October 26, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hanedan", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d310380-Reviews-Hanedan-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$25 - $75*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Akbiyik Caddesi.
