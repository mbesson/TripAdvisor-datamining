{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved Nefatari If you want somewhere traditional and quiet (which I recommend) then pick here. The villas are far enough out of Ubud that you feel you are in another world but also close enough that you can go to Ubud whenever you want. There is always a car waiting to take you wherever you want to go. I would also recommend eating in the hotel. The food is just as good as any of the restaurants we came across and very good prices. All the staff want to help you and are just so friendly. Highly reommend here", "Date": "Jan 1, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR161822316", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MaireadB"}, {"Content": "wonderful hideaway       villa Mitir", "Date": "Oct 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR276153125", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Kanakira"}, {"Content": "Excellent service - Live like a King Stayed in a 2 bedroom villa with private Pool for 2 nights. Lived like a king for 3D2N. Food was brought to the villa for a private meal. After a great meal, had a great dip in the private pool with the family. Whenever we wanted to go to town, the hotel staff (who are absolutely great!) would send us there in their 7-seaters. When we are done in town, we only need to give a quick call to the hotel for a free pick-up! Only improvement area is the cleanliness of the rooms - it was alittle dusty when we reached on our 1st day (mabe due to off-peak season and the room was not occupied for sometime). 2nd day was a great improvement. Overall - had an absolutely GREAT time in the villa. My parents absolutely love it there compared to another 2 nights stay in another villa in town. Private, absolute relaxation, great service  great food!", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR154117608", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "CNChan"}, {"Content": "Perfect location for a getaway! Spot on Service! I was looking for a good Villa accomodation on my honeymoon trip Dec 2007  could only locate 2 reviews on Nefatari Villas  after delibration I still went ahead and booked it.Me  my Wife are in mid twenties  fell in love with the place. It was a perfect setting with the private pool and private location away from the city chaos in the middle of rice paddies. We recieved 5 start service all the way. It was a unique experience and a traditional setting, something we did not get at any other place during our trip that included 5 other countries in south east asia.Overall Bali itself should be a surprise for each first time visitor. I have been to Thailand and many other places where Guests are treated as Gods of sorts, I can tell you in Bali and Nefatari you will get that feeling for real.Thank you for making our time so wonderful there.Bharat - from India", "Date": "Mar 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR799421437", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Lovebt"}, {"Content": "Nefatari was Magical Our family stayed at the Nefatari for a week from Dec 25, 2007-Jan 1 2008.

Consists of 5 villas in total, we stayed in Villa Jepun. We loved the landscape , completely surrounded by nature. Loved the private pool , the open air concept bathroom, it's absolutely gorgeous. Every villa comes with breakfast  tea time which is served either at their dining or in the villa.
