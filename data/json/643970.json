I had figured I could use my daughter's shower if the shared bath was a problem, but the bathroom across the hall from my room was clean and there was plenty of hot water. Front desk staff was efficient and responsive, and the door men were very helpful and friendly.

The rooms are what you'd expect - very basic, with a set of bunk beds, lockers and a sink. Beds were comfortable enough. Bathrooms on the hall were satisfactory and while not pristine, fairly clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. What makes this a cut above some other hostels is the huge lounge area - with 3 flat screen TVs, comfy couches and a kitchen/food prep area with counter and tables. I nice place to hang out and read, chat, surf the web (free WiFi) or have a meal. (There are computers available, but the price is ridiculously high.) Two blocks from the subway and lots of restaurants nearby. For the price ($35 for a bunk in a double room) it can't be beat. There was one real con - the rooms have nothing besides the bed - no hooks, no chair or bench (ever try to put on shoes and socks standing up?) Putting a couple of folding chairs and a few hooks on the walls would not cost the hostel much and go a LONG way to making this place a 5-star NYC hostel. One note...on the 3rd floor, there is a \"permanent resident\" who leaves his door open and is not all that quiet...and his room smells of food and smoke.

As soon as I arrived at the location, my gut told me I had made the right choice. Firstly, the location of the hostel is simply excellent. A bus-ride from the airport dropped me off just four blocks away. A five minute walk later and I was standing at the front door. From the outside, the place oozes 'hotel' and comes complete with a concierge to open the door and kindly lift your baggage up the 3 steps. The ground floor consists of a check-in desk and lounge-area for residents. The staff at the check-in desk got me settled immediately and after paying a $5 returnable deposit for a room key, I was on my way. Being told my room was on the 2nd floor, I took the lift. BIG mistake. I would advise anyone never to take the lift, unless you have time to kill :-) Once on the 2nd floor, I saw three bathrooms (all EXCELLENTLY maintained and furnished... including a lovely clean smell which is always present due to the constant cleaning) and a small number of rooms. The room I stayed in was secure, clean, and nicely furnished - including a flat screen LCD TV on the wall. The bed was adequate for a hostel and the temperature was fine (especially considering I generally run cold and this was early December). Throughout my stay, the staff were available to give handy tourist tips (often saving me $$!) and were always friendly. The lounge area consists of several comfortable sofas and chairs, two large wall-mounted TVs, and a great sound system. A kitchen area is also available for guests to rustle up snacks or dinner. All-in-all, the 'hostel' was excellent and I have certainly stayed in worse hotels.

They were not able to control the heat though, so even though the room was chilly, they could not improve it. We had a snowstorm one day, and even then the heaters did not kick into a higher heat, but at least we had power. I heard all of the East coast lost power and thousands were without ANY heat, so I was grateful to have any heat and my six blankets. :-) I also like to be very warm when I sleep, so that's just me. The kitchen area has a microwave and sink, but no pots, pans, utensils, cups, etc. It's better for making simple things or heating up leftovers. There is a \"bar\" which serves breakfast and snacks throughout the day which I found helpful. The elevator is small and slow, so after you take the trip with your luggage, unless you are way high up or have an injury, it's probably better to take the stairs. The lounge area downstairs is cozy and great.

We got there and were meeted by helpful staff and were given our room key, we had the room with one queen size bed, the room was far better that I expected. We had everything we needed for the time we were there and the air conditioning and fan had alot of use cos of the hot weather. The bed was amazingly comfy especially after walking round New York for hours. I was personally worried about the bathroom, but on our floor the were 2 bathrooms, both with just one shower and toliet in so when you were in there it was just you, I have stayed in hostels before were its communal showers and I didnt like that. But hear it was fine, they were clean and nice to use. I was really impressed that a maid came and cleaned our room everyday, making the bed and taking out any rubbish, I honestly didnt expect this from a hostel, you could also see the bathrooms being cleaned on a daily basis. The reception area was nice with t.vs and computers, we paid $1.00 to use the computer everyday this was really helpful to check our money. On our first day we walked to the main part of Manhattan, this was quite a walk but we worked out how to use the subway and took that for the rest of our stay which saved us an hour a day in travel, the subway was 3 blocks up from the hostel and in 15 mintues we were at the subway in times square which was really handy for everything and it also took us straight to Battery Park for the Statue of Liberty. The only issue I had was the noise on a night, but our window did face the main street and it is New York. Plus I was too tired by the end of the day to notice. All in all this hostel was really good and well worth the money we paid, as there were no hidden or extra charges, what we were billed for is what we paid.

We were in a four bed dorm, right opposite the best bathroom on the floor, was perfectly acceptable. It seems to me that they are maybe trying to do a lot of work in making the hotel more up to date etc, because like I say the bathroom was perfect, all brand new etc. The room itself wasn't great, old tiling on the floor, radiator propped up with wood, bars on the window, but as your only using it as a place to sleep, doesn't really matter. The lift, yes it was slow, but we only used it when we were leaving with luggage. Wasn't impressed with one thing though. I'm pretty sure on one write up for the hotel there was mention of a kitchen. When we were there this wasn't the case, there was a mircowave, no cooking utensil's or cutlery or anything, so doesn't really qualify as a kitchen. They guy on the door, was very helpful and polite, always helped us with our bags, and arranged our taxi to the airport for us. Another plus was the 'Cheesy Pizza' across the road.

So keeping in mind that we reserved this hotel the day before, I can't complain. One thing I learned while shopping around for a hotel, is that NYC hotels have 2 different kinds of rooms: Either you get your own private bathroom or have to use a shared bathroom. This means that you have to use a public bathroom for the entire floor! So when I called to book my room, I requested 2 rooms with 2 double beds in each room. Either I'm confused as to the meaning on double beds, or NY considers double beds to be twin beds! After checking in, we were waiting a while for the elevator. Since it was taking too long, we opted to take the stairs. Boy was that the worst thing I could have done! It just put a sour taste in my mouth for this hotel! The stairway halls were very narrow, dark, and dirty! I kept praying that I stranger wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be waiting further up to rob me! I accidentally entered the wrong floor as the doors do not have a number to let you know which floor you are on. Boy what a mistake! I think I had entered the floor for people actually living here! It sort of reminded me of the hotel in the movie \"Coming to America!\" where it was filthy and had mice everywhere! (Not that I actually saw any-but can imagine just by the looks!) After hauling my luggage up to my room- I finally find the correct floor!! As I step into my room, I realize that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the rooms that I had booked. I look for a phone to call the lobby- but to my surprise- there were no phones in the room! Just my luck I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the hotel number programmed to my cell phone, plus why would I have to waste my minutes calling them?!?! I turn right back around and have to go right back down the filthy stairs! By then I was aggravated that no one had offered to help me carry my luggage to the third floor, and that I had to go all the way back down to inform them of the mistake. I tell the receptionist that she made a mistake. I had requested 2 rooms with 2 double beds in each since there were 4 people staying in each room. She then proceeded to tell me that those were double beds! I think I would have let it go under different circumstances, but I took her attitude as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already paid- now you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re screwed!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I asked if we can get 2 additional rooms at a discounted price then and they were not very accommodating! But she did offer to provide extra blankets and pillows for someone to sleep on the floor!! (Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that against fire code policy??) We ended up staying there since I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want the hassle of looking for another hotel on such short notice and the majority that I had previously looked up were already booked. We only needed the room to sleep and shower- and they did their purpose. In regards to the shower- either you need to get up extra early or wait until very late at night to take your shower as the hot water is very scarce here! All in All- it all just goes back to the saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You get what you pay for!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But I was just so aggravated that the pictures on their website made it seem like they were such a nicer hotel! I felt really bad with my extended family for choosing this hotel! So the big question is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would I stay there again? Definitely not!

I'd suggest they install a few just 'toilet' rooms on each floor, so if you are busting to go in the morning, you don't have to wait for the person to finish in the shower first. I second the suggestion that they introduced single-sex dorms. Although this wasn't an issue for me this time, I would have hated it if I had to share with a bunch of blokes if I was travelling alone. The smell of mens dirty socks would have driven me out into the street! The elevator is ancient and tiny, so taking the stairs was often quicker, especially on the way down. But this is New York, whaddya expect? The foyer area is very modern and boutique style which is nice, but doesn't really reflect the rest of the accomodation. It also gets very crowded especially after 3pm when everyone is trying to check in. Staff were pretty good, especially Brendan who went out of his way to help us. There's cheap internet access computers in the common area and free wi-fi available. The location is pretty good. About a 8 minute walk to the 103rd st subway station on the #1 line. The neighbourhood is fairly residential although there are lots of places to eat and drink near by. It's not in the tourist-trap area of Times Square, so it's mostly locals and independent travellers in the area. I can highly recommend the mushroom and swiss cheese omlette at the French cafe on Broadway towards 103rd. Soleil something. Just get there before 9am for the breakfast special prices! The Metro Diner on Broadway is also good for fast and furious NYC food. Try the gigantic spagetti and meatballs - in fact share them with a friend! There's a laudromat around the corner as well as a pharmacy/drugstore. I'd stay at the Broadway hotel again and would recommend it to all who aren't too precious about their hotel accomodation. On this trip I stayed at all types including a 5* star hotel. I'm there to experience the city and culture - not worry too much about the thread count of the sheets.", "Date": "November 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "trcres", "Title": "\u201cGood alternative to YMCA\u201d", "Author": "trcres", "ReviewID": "UR21591574", "Content": "I had a difficult time finding a private room during the New York marathon, and stumbled upon the Broadway Hotel and Hostel.

Bearing in mind we planned to stay in a hostel, it had everything we needed, but wasn't worth the extra money we'd paid expecting a more up market hostel, as it had nothing to back that up. The lobby area is lovely, really modernly presented, but as soon as you go up the stairs to your room, the carpet seems to run out as soon as you turn the corner from reception, and the great presentation of reception, is no more. this would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that the website makes the hostel appear to be more than it actually is. Our dorm was an 8 bed, and was pleasent enough, very basic which is what you'd expect from a hostel, but not what you'd expect from what the website shows!!! on our floor there were 3 bathrooms, between about 7/8 rooms (i'm not sure if they were all 8 bed though) which can be a hassle in the mornings with everyone trying to shower. also each bathroom is a shower, toilet and basin, there are no seperate toilets, which when everyone's showerring can me crossing your legs. we had the added problem on our floor that one of the bathrooms didn't have a lock, luckilly i have good friends though, so we'd read a magazine in the corridor while th others showered to avoid having to wait for one of the 2 working bathrooms. the only other downside would be that the staff aren't particularly helpful, they just didn;t seem that switched on. The doorman was lovely, but the actual reception staff were a little useless, they alwys said they's help with whatever you asked, but never seemed to deliver. from the moment we arrived we were asking for extra blamkets as the room got a little cold at night, they were always in the wash and would be brought to us in 10 minutes. the first 10 minutes lasted 3 days, we finally managed to get our extra blankets on our last night!!! all in all, i wouldn't say don't stay here, but i would say, don't go with the high expectations you may get from the fancy website.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trieste", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the price paid\u201d", "Author": "Dorisone47", "ReviewID": "UR20745455", "Content": "I stayed in the four people dorm 7 nights, checking in was really quick.

Short stroll to the subway station, longer walk to Central Park. My only criticism is that the rooms are all co-ed.
