The staff is friendly and all the areas are clean. This inn is very Eco friendly which is a big plus. It has a very nice park but only for toddlers. It has several hammocks, half a basketball court and a volleyball area. They also provide free and excellent coffee in the mornings and also a snack at 3:00pm that includes cookies, crackers, soda and coffee (NICE). The bad: They do not provide towels for the pool. The beach in front of the inn is dirty, very dirty (the beach is public so the municipal government is the one that needs to clean the beach but they don't). The bathrooms are tiny and it takes a while for the water to get hot. The ok: Our rate which is a good rate included breakfast and dinners with tips included. Not a great variety of dishes and the portions are average but very good flavor. It's worth it to get the all inclusive rate but do not expect an amazing culinary experience. The kids play area needs things for kids 3-12. The pool is a good size and it was always clean. This inn is nice but you get what you pay for. Yabucoa is a town where you can relax and read a good book by the pool or beach. I did not see one pub, bar or nice restaurant in the whole town so if you want an active night life this is not the place to go.

I made several phone calls to the front desk but no one answered so I looked up in the phone book the number for the police. I don't know if the police ever showed up but the noice subsided around 3 in the morning. In the morning I found out from the front desk clerk that they lock the entrance doors to the Inn at night and the Police would not be able to enter. Great security, but what if you need outside HELP. I then told the clerk that we were leaving because of concerns for our safety but they insisted on billing me for my 3 night reservation. It seems I made the mistake of initialling their check in sheet notifying me that under no circumstances they would credit me for an early check out, in other words (NO REFUNDS). It is three months later and they are still insisting I pay for 3 nights without regard for the horible time we had our first night there. Fromers gave them a decent recommendation and is the reason we made a reservation in the first place but all is not what it seems online.

The beach adjacent to this property should be for walking and sunbathing only as the currents and riptides are dangerous, it is nonetheless very picturesque, soothing and a relaxing place to vist. The only recommendation or drawback when traveling with children here is that the menu for the restaurant is somewhat limited for a childrens menu. If you have a rental car there are supermarkets and other \"Americanized restaurants\" close by to get you over that challenge!

Very very dirty beach - it is not swimable and you cannot lay down or walk on it.

Stayed three days - on the last day when I looked for my Nautica jacket I left in the closet -it was not in the room (unfortunately for me my wallet was in this jacket as well). Moral of this story - do not keep anything of value in the hotel rooms at this hotel since the cinchy key locks to the room or room service is not trustworthy.
