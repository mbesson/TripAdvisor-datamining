My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel during Valentine\u9225\u6a9a Day. When we arrived, the staff did not seem too interested in helping us to check-in - not that there are any other guests around to be served either. She must be having a bad day because she did not even greet us or smile at us - we certainly feel very 'special'.When we finally got to our room, we were very disappointed when we saw two single bed instead of the king size which we booked. We made a call and the person who answered the phone said someone will come to us to help us out.To our horror, a maid came up, pushed the two single beds together and put the bed linen overing the two beds \u9225?then that was it! The bed was not made properly either! We did try to see if we slept like that, will it feel good or not \u9225?It was not to our surprise that the gap between the two beds were not comfortable at all and we were not pleased - we went down to the lobby and asked to speak to the manager about it - the manager must have caught the bad-day bug as well - just like the lady who checked us in, she did not even apologise for their bedding mistake, although she did arrange a proper room for us after all \u9225?but it did appear as though she did not seem too interested in helping us out as well.The condition of our room was neat and clean, nice decor too \u9225?our booking came with a free buffet dinner - which was real delicious. There were photographers taking photos for couples during dinner (because it was Valentine's day) - however, although we gave them our details (email address, room number, contact number), we were never given the chance to find out how we can get hold of the photos taken!!I will not stay at this hotel again!", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR335736916", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "lady0421"}, {"Content": "Great rooms, remote location My family and I stayed here for 8 nights in March 2008. The location as others have mentioned is a bit far from the 'main' part of hong kong where all the shopping and nightlife are at. There are buses and shuttles from the hotel that can take you there, but it's about a 45 minute to 1 hour transit ride. However, our stay was very enjoyable (we didn't really go out drinking/clubbing as this was a family trip) so that wasn't an issue. The rooms were large. They had a full/queen sized bed and a sitting area to watch tv. the bathrooms were immaculate, and because of the low price and location farther from HK proper, there are lots of tour groups staying there. Ask to be put on a room on floor 23-28 because there's an express elevator exclusive to those floors.In response to what another reviewer mentioned about kids or 'urchins' lingering in the area between the two hotel towers, these were high school kids who posed no threat whatsoever. they were sitting down and smoking with their friends near the 7-11. the drunk tour groups staying at the hotel posed a bigger 'hostile threat' than these loitering kids. I've never felt threatened or in danger at any time around the hotel or the surrounding area as crime is extremely low in HK.There is also a park with basketball courts, a man made lake and a running track right behind the hotel. Also, the gym was very modern and the shopping center attached to the hotel had some good food options as well as a supermarket to pick up some snacks and drinks. Overall, this hotel is great for a trip to the new territories or a returning visitor who knows his/her way around hong kong. I wouldn't recommend it for first time travelers to HK.", "Date": "Mar 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR926026286", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "mca311"}, {"Content": "Gorgeous Apartments We only stayed here for one night only and we found the apartments to be of a very high standard.

My husband, myself and our two children aged 5 and 8 thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We had inteconnecting rooms and could not fault the hotel or the service. Part of the attraction was the fact that HPRC is away from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong. We got to explore many parts of Hong Kong and the New Territories and we used public transport to get everywhere. The kids loved the adventure of riding on the trains and even a trip to Mongkok for a lot of shopping at the markets was not a problem, we just jumped on a train when we were done. My kids lost a toy on our last day at the hotel and we searched everywhere for it. The staff were so obliging, taking our email details and informing us when the toy was found. They organised the toy to be sent to Australia at their cost and My children were very happy to be reunited with their toy.We will return to HPRC again.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR411605412", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Shellfe"}, {"Content": "Level of service left much to be desired This hotel came as a free stay with a Cathay Pacific air ticket. Even so, you would expect some degree of acceptable service becoming of most Hong Kong hotels.But when we got there, there was no porter, no bellhop, not even a doorman in sight. Everyone had to drag their bags into the lobby, then up to their rooms.When we checked in, we were told housekeeping would bring up an extra bed for us. That bed never came. We called three times. It finally arrived four hours later.Reception staff looked like they didn't want to be there. We never got a single smile. Not when we checked in, asked for directions or checked out.And again, porters were mysteriously missing then. The one thing the hotel got right was to provide a comfortable shuttle service to and back from Tsim Sha Tsui for HK$20 one way, although they could do well to extend that service beyond 9pm, since much of Hong Kong should be experienced after dark.If it wasn't for the fact that the hotel was a free stay, it really wouldn't make sense to stay here. It's a good 45 minutes from downtown, there are no attractions in the area and being in the boondocks doesn't mean it's a resort.", "Date": "Aug 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR666243505", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "TeenyToes"}, {"Content": "Great hotel with spacious and comfortable rooms I stayed at the Harbour Plaza Resort last year and thought it was a lovely hotel.

The rooms were spacious and comfortable with a separate lounge area and were cleaned on a daily basis.The only downside to the hotel is the location, as the buses stop running after 11.30pm but if you're not keen on nightlife and looking for somewhere to stay that is quiet, then look no further.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR204867855", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Anna_168"}, {"Content": "Great comfort away from the hustle and bustle Excellent hotel, I recommend.

However, the main attraction is the low price. Why is it so cheap? It is because the hotel is so far from anywhere. If you like night life or shopping, don't consider it. The hotel provides shuttle bus (not even hourly service) and finish after 11:00 pm. Taxi fare from city back to hotel is around US$40. From Hong Kong Island is at least 50$. There are 2 malls connected to the hotel but they are crappy. Actually the hotel is located at the poorest housing area of Hong Kong. I don't feel safe to walk out of the hotel in the night. You will find problems kids or urchins who linger in the area between the two hotel blocks. They don't have porters! The security guards have to carry the luggages for the guests. So you can imagine their unwillingness.If you don't mind to be trapped in your room, plus you can save some money from being over-charged by the downtown hotel, congratutations!

This hotel is in the New Territories so unless you know you way to the shopping district, better stay in Kowloon or Hong Kong Island.

The mall also has a couple dim sum restaurants, mcdonald's, western restaurants, a vietnamese and japanese restaurant, and a grocery store, etc. There is a 7-11 downstairs as well. Hotel also offers a state of the art gym. Staff are very helpful and efficient. Hotel offers a daily shuttle service to the shopping district, otherwise, public transportation is just outside the hotel. Bus, light rail, are all right outside of the hotel.

We are entirely pleased with our decision to stay at this hotel, although some forum members did advise against the hotel because of its location. But given the savings that you can get from staying here compared to elsewhere in the city at this time of the year when hotel prices are simply crazy, I think we have made a good choice. The hotel is modern, comfortable with nice decor, and is connected to two shopping malls with many restaurants where we had breakfast before proceeding into the city by the hotel shuttle. There is a bakery and 7-11 by the side of the hotel, so it is very convenient. I think even if you factor in the travel time on the hotel shuttle (40 mins) and cost (HKD18 one way, per person) it is still a bargain. You can also take the Light Rail/West Rail/MRT connection into the city but that is much hassle and slightly more costly. We are pleased with the hotel service - very prompt and very accommodating. The hotel staff went to the extent of disinfecting and dressing my husband's toe which was infected from an ingrown toe-nail, before pointing to the direction of a clinic.I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel if you do not need to keep popping back to the hotel during the day while sight-seeing or shopping. It was nice to come back to a nice, clean and comfortable hotel room at the end of the day, which was what we felt having been out at the Disney Land and Ocean Park for the first two days with our children.", "Date": "Nov 4, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR636840555", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ctmew"}, {"Content": "\u7ef2\u612d\ue750\u9287\u52e9\u4e9c\u9287\u0441\u4eda   showReview(19888787, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR359469996", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\u5fcb\u5157\u9289\u6129\u5157\u9286\u20ac\u9289\u693c\u5135\u9288\u8eb2\u20ac\u20ac\u9289\ue042\u5069\u9289\u7b3a\u5113\u9286\u20ac\u9288\u67ab\u5110\u9288\uff43\u20ac\u20ac\u68e3\u6b10\u8150   showReview(19885649, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR210084342", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u95ae\u3125\u773f\u9287\ue217\u68ca   showReview(19882643, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR360212618", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d302328-r23222972-Harbour_Plaza_Resort_City_Hong_Kong-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "302328", "Price": "$86"}}
