I immediately went back to reception and requested another room as a shower over a bath is too tricky for someone with a significant visual impairment. The young woman on the front desk was very helpful and courteous and arranged for us to move to another room. She did say that a superior room meeting our needs would not be available and my response was that a suitable bathroom with a shower recess was my priority. We were given the keys to a room on the 3rd floor with, what I was told, was a bathroom equipped for the disabled. The reality was that the bathroom had a shower and curtain over what was once a shower cubicle. The walls of the cubicle had been removed and tiles placed over the gap where the cubicle wall had once stood. This had been done in a very shoddy way and actually made a trip obstacle on the floor. The shower curtain was probably 30cms or more off the floor and the floor was not designed for the water to run down the drain, keeping the rest of the room dry. As a result the bathroom was very hazardous. The floor was wet and slippery everywhere. The basin was just that. There was nowhere to place any toiletries so an old lady had to bend down and reach for things on a slippery floor. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!! It was very disappointing as my husband, an Accor A Club member, booked the room. It was far from what we have come to expect from a Mercure and I will not return to this hotel.

Traveling around is easy and convenient. My room (Bay's View) was fairly spacious and comfortable, and everything in the room is well maintained and working properly. However, after dark the district is kind of complicated with bar and clubs around - which means people getting happy, drunk and noisy right in front of your door. You can enjoy the music together with them after the middle of the night with them even you are in the room. Request to stay on higher floors if you are sensitive sleepers. Also, during my stay due to whatever reason, the fire alarm was activated and all guests are requested to evacuate by a systematic voice - \"EMERGENCY, EVACUATE\" in the room. While later on it was found to be a false alarm. From a positive view, this unique experience suggested that the hotel indeed has a working fire alarm system. But I would expect somebody from the hotel explaining what was happening before a casual staff simply telling us to go back to our room in the fire staircase in the middle of my evacuations. Another thing worth mentioning is - if you are driving and planning to have your vehicle staying under the same roof in the hotel with you during the stay, make sure that you are skillful driver. The hotel underground parking lot is particularly compact and require a lot of attention and skill to move your vehicle into and out of it. I understand it is a very old building and probably it was not designed to cater modern cars. Overall this hotel score a passing mark - and I would probably stay again.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cNot too shabby\u201d", "Author": "paninamana", "ReviewID": "UR127890196", "Content": "Just returned from here. Not bad really but more of 3 stars than 4. Rooms are clean and tidy when I first got in. Furnishings are alright, minimal and practical.

I noticed that they aren't as thorough as they should be. Some hair left behind in the showers and beds not tucked in as nicely as it should be. I don't mind it but some others might. Also, on my second night, I noticed a large stain outside my room. Looked a bit like vomit or some sort of liquid stain. Didn't get cleaned up until I left which was 2 nights later. Details like this should be considered by the hotel. The hotel is located right in Kings Cross despite the name being Mercure Sydney Potts Points so I suggest that people with kids or anyone in general should be a little more careful there, given the rowdy nature of that area especially on weekend nights.

There is a Coles supermarket close by, and the hotel is literally right next to the Kings Cross subway station. On the down side, the rooms either face the Holiday Inn and harbour or Kings Cross, I had a room facing Kings Cross and there was a lot of noise. The other thing which is very misleading is that their advertising says that the hotel was completely refurbished in 2010. The room I was in looked like it hadnt been touched in 20 years. I noticed a room across the corridor being serviced and had a look in and it was completely different to mine - it was very modern and clearly had been recently refurbished. The room I was in would have been lucky to scrape to three stars, not the four stars claimed. I think management should amend their advertising to \"SOME rooms were refurbished in 2010\".

There is no rim to hold in the water, so when you shower, the water, and soap, runs amok all over the floor. You pull back the sad little curtain, and you are left standing in a pool of water, a lawsuit, waiting to happen.

If they claimed to be a three or even three & a half star, it would have met my expectations above and beyond, but it really falls short of the minimum I'd expect of a four star establishment. A few examples: I was upgraded to a \"Delux\" room (courtesy of my LeClub membership). If that room was Delux, then I cannot imagine what a basic room must be. The Delux was very cramped and tiny as too was its bathroom. It was a room for two, but only had seating for one. There was no porter / bell boy service.No-one to carry your bags up to your room or bring them back down when you leave. As I am mobility impaired and on a walking stick, this is one reason I stay in four star establishments and it is a service that any establishment claiming to be four star SHOULD have. Staff were not friendly. They weren't rude either, but none at any time made any special efforts, not even to ask \"How are you this morning, sir?\" at breakfast. Those points aside, in favour was that the entire establish has been recently refurbished to a high standard. Everything is perfectly clean and tidy, looking brand new, everything works. As I started this review by saying, if this place claimed to be 3 or even 3.5 star rated, it would have met my expectations and beyond. If what you are seeking is something in that 3 to 3.5 star range, I'd recommend this establishment.

Positives: Room and bed nice, ample variety of food both restaurant and takeaway outside the door; it's right next to the train station. My room had a nice panoramic view of the entire city from Centrepoint to the Harbour Bridge. Negatives: The hotel had an overseas tourist group in and I couldn't get a seat - nor a plate- when I went down for breakfast the first day. I ended up going outside the hotel for breakfast. ...a bit of an inconvenience as I had a time schedule to stick to due to business meetings. There was also no desk in my room so work and dinner had to be done on my bed. My room had no minibar, although when I stayed at the same hotel chain's inner city hotel, that room did. Go figure... Also water pressure for cold water in the hotel very poor, meaning a delicate balancing act between being scolded and frozen when taking a shower. Do yourself a favour and eat breakfast at Olivetto, just up the street in Bayswater Rd! Great Italian cafe with very friendly staff and great food. I have eaten here a few times now, and great for a quick and quality meal. I do feel that Sydney hotels are getting overpriced for what you get. I piad $260 for a Tuesday night at this hotel, a figure that gets me 5 star when I stay in other great cities around the region. Internet is on top at $29 per day.

On the other side, the hustle and bustle of King's Cross and Bada Bing, and an assortment of adult themed entertainment. The TV in my room did not work. Although I was barely in the room, it didn't really matter. The tap in the bathroom sink flew off and water spewed to the ceiling. However, I managed to screw the tap back in. It was an easy fix. The towels were not always changed when I threw them into a bathtub - a usual sign for most hotels that guests want their towels replaced. The breakfast selection seemed okay, but I didn't actually eat anything except the fruit. Service was slow. Tables were messy and dirty and weren't cleared away quickly. Internet access is not free. $10 an hour or use the public terminals. Across the road, above Coles supermarket, is another public internet service kiosk with much lower connection fees. However, I didn't use that. I used the data plan of my mobile phone. Twice I got the hotel to book the taxi, but they didn't arrive. Instead I had to flag one off the road.

Our room was on level 10 and I was kept awake until 4:00 am on morning. A tip for the hotel would be to supply your guests with ear plugs or even install double glazing because the noise outside is unbearable in the early hours of the morning. When you stay at a 4* hotel you expect the little extras like clean towels; most days out of our 5 we arrived home to damp towels. Reception staff at our check in was fine but it would have been nice to been notified of the hotels facilities, where the restaurant was and maybe been offered if they could help with any restaurant reservations esc. We had the manager check us out at 4:00 am he was friendly, helpful and efficient.

I could get over this exaggeration because of the convenience of being opposite Kings Cross station. However when we got there, we also found it is opposite an extremely popular all-night night club that had a noisy line-up half a block long to get in. Also, by \"new\" they meant a really old building with new (very dark) paint, carpet, and furniture. The dark furniture and furnishings, particularly in the hallway, gave it the seedy Kings Cross feel of yester-year. That said the rooms were clean, and a decent size.

The room itself is fairly basic, all the necessities expected for a hotel of this branding, and in good condition,but nothing extra special or flash - but that was Ok, I wasn't planning on spending a lot of time in there.

The floor I was on had a large 'No Smoking' sign outside the elevator, but I don't recall this being pointed out to me at check in, During the night, I was disturbed twice by the OVERWHELMING smell of cigarette smoke coming from the room next door.It seems the Korean gentlemen in that room had not been informed either regarding the no smoking floor or simply chose to ignore it.Just yuk - I had to bury my head under the sheets to get away from it. breakfast the next morning was cheapish - just under $20, but a really simple buffet with limited choices.I left straight after that -check out was a bit prolonged due to some early morning arrivals wondering why their rooms were not ready at 8.30am...... the hotel is only a few steps away from the railway station, so I was out and on the train very quickly. All in all, it was what I expected for a one night stay - If I was a tourist visiting Sydney for a longer stay, it would be OK, as long as you weren't planning on spending any 'down' time relaxing in your hotel room - it would be a bit boring I would think.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seoul, South Korea", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "felicia B", "ReviewID": "UR122075856", "Content": "We took three rooms at the Mercure for my mum & dad, son, and wife and myself for three days from 10 Dec. 2011.

When we arrived in Sydney we called the hotel from our shuttle bus just wanting to double check the address and were told that we didn't have a booking, they transferred us to the CBD Mecure and told us our booking must be with them, the CBD Mecure then transferred us back saying they also had no record of our booking. After being transferred back to the Potts Point Mecure, we were told \"Actually you did have a booking but you were meant' to arrive yesterday\", after I told them that there was no way I gave the incorrect date as I had already purchased flights before making the booking, she referred me to the manager on duty. She was extremely rude and changed the story again stating that our booking was for August, and that they did have the rooms available but not at the rate we had booked at, I said \" Look we are almost there now I'll discuss it with you when we arrive, to that she replied, \"You can do what if you want, but I'm telling you now you're not getting those rates\". When we arrived at the hotel we were referred straight to the manager, who again wouldn't budge on the rates and blamed us for the mix up, she informed us that her desicion was final, as were tired from our flight we reluctantly agreed to pay the higher rate however we did state that we didn't think it was entirely fair and informed her we intended on following it up with consumer affairs, to which she replied, \"Threats won't get you anywhere\". I was extremely surprised that in a company as large as Mercure, could allow a staff member to show such blatant disregard towards a customer complaint as well as a complaint against their company. The next day I read the reviews on trip advisor and contacted the division rooms manager, which in all honesty was great and showed the first bit of customer service we had encountered since arriving at the hotel, after reviewing the situation he agreed to honor the original rates as booked.

Staff are very friendly (especially Erin), beds are the most comfortable I slept in for this price range and parking costs are very reasonable at $25/night. However, both my experiences at the restauraunt have been terrible. After the first meal I stayed clear for 6 months but last week thought I'd give it another go with a different dish.

He just walked to the computer and started checking the computer and kept talking to the reception and looking at me now and then but no hello, no sorry, nothing! Couple minutes later, I guess after he has made sure that I was correct, he came to me saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am sorry but as you known that we are not responsible for the key card system and it seems there is something wrong with that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153glitch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?

Upon check-in the girl at reception had asked for a credit card, without any notice she'd tried to pre-authorize my card of $250 which I cannot understand as the room was $109 and bond on the card should only be $50-$100. Had the transaction not gone through I would not have been made aware of this. Was happy to pay in cash for room + bond in the end and she had asked for $3xx (sorry I can't recall exactly)..not only did we not get a receipt each time we extended our stay but nor did any of the receptionist had picked up that on our first night there our bill had been posted for 2 nights accommodation instead of the 1..hence why my partner had overpaid in cash on at least 3 separate occasions. Prior to myself booking a second night to extend I called reception to check if their internet rate would be better than extending directly with them, I spoke to a girl named Erin and she confirmed the internet rate is of more value and said if you do extend however you still have to check out of your room and check back in. I told her wouldn't they get a confirmation email for the booking straight away if I booked online now why would I have to do that? And she'd replied back with..\"We'll see.\" Glad that this hadn't happen as it makes no sense AT ALL. On check out what shocked me more that we were asked to pay an outstanding amount on the bill, it was then that they'd realized there was an extra night incorrectly added onto the bill. They tried to fix up the bill and we only got $200 from the bond back for 4 nights accommodation (bond is $100 a night and we didn't use room service, parking, etc)......... although the lady who checked us out tried to fix up the bill and the hotel had tried to investigate into this, I had a call back a day later saying they had over paid us $20 or so......how does this make sense and why am I asked to pay the same outstanding amount prior to them picking up the mistakes on the bill? Their explanation was that they checked the CCTV footage and can see what colour and how many notes were being counted by reception. Is this a joke? As I was extremely unhappy with their explanation the guy I spoke to said he will further investigate into it and give me a call back. Never happened. Very unhappy this has happened and wished I got a receipt on the first night so I could at least get some of the money back.... However, the room was of good value, clean and didn't find it noisy.

I called up on Thursday and asked if the receptionist was able to organise an early check in as I had a business conference call to make. She said they couldn't guarantee it but as the hotel was not fully booked on Thursday, it shouldn't be a problem. She asked what time I would arrive and when I said 11am, she said that should be fine. So we arrive on Friday at 11.45am. I went up to reception to check in and the girl behind the counter (not the same person from the phone the day before) was totally unwilling to help me. She kept saying 'those rooms are not ready' without even looking at my booking. I understand that early check in cannot be guaranteed but not even attempting to help put a bad taste in my mouth. We were able to finally check in at about 1pm (an hour early so I will give them that). We were in room 805 and initial impressions were pretty good. The room was large and modern. Upon further inspection though, it was very grubby. There were marks and stains on the walls that looked like they needed a good wipe and I found hairs that weren't ours in the bath. Two bathroom tiles came up during our stay. The whole 'revamp' is a bit shoddy. I also found it amusing that the shower curtain had a sticker on it saying 'Sydney Harbour Marriott'. So I am guessing that this hotel got the 'hand me downs'. Bed was comfortable and aircon was very good. I don't mind the street noise but the hallway noise was terrible - everything echoes and you can hear every conversation. I woke up 4 times during the first night and I am not a light sleeper. I guess the annoying people checked out because Saturday night was fine. One thing to beware of is the parking situation. The parking available is in a very tight two level space. We left the hotel at about 5 on Friday night and returned about 10pm and were able to get a space. On Saturday we left after lunch and when we returned just before midnight, the parking lot was full. This meant we had to drive around Kings X at the busiest time of night and ended up parking outside a strip club hehe. It was fine for us and actually probably safer than the Mercure car park which anyone can get into if the gate is open, but it might be a hassle or quite scary for international guests or elderly people. Just something to consider. They do tell you parking is limited but it's pretty ridiculous. Also, trying to charge us for parking for that night when we told them it was full is pretty bad form. Would we stay again? Yes, if the price was right. We paid a total of $220 for both nights. The location is good if you are looking for bars and restaurants but not good if you are looking for peace and quiet and non-dodgy people. But that's Kings Cross for you! I would rate this as a mid-3 star. It's a shame because with a bit of attention to detail and a good clean, it could be up there as a really good choice.

The hotel has undergone refurbishment & has improved considerably since my initial stay when it was the Crest Hotel (room was skin-crawlingly awful), & then with slight improvements since it was The Chifley. We were part of a group of 6 (staying in 3 separate rooms) who were staying in Kings Cross to attend a birthday party. Check-in was pleasant & efficient. And the decor was modern & funky. The concierge was super friendly & helpful (he had an American accent). Our only issue was that we were located on different floors (we had requested that we be located on the same floor if possible). Note: The Reception is located on Level 2. We came in via Victoria St & while there is a small unattended reception desk there it can be a little confusing (Perhaps better sign posting is required?) My partner & I stayed in Room 1305, a superior Queen harbour view room with a small but adequate bathroom (combined shower/tub). The room had great views of the city & harbour bridge/opera house (shame there weren't balconies or wall to wall windows to maximise the view). The other superior Queen room (1104) was much smaller, with a slightly bigger bathroom (no tub). The std twin room (913) had 2 single kings & faced toward Darlinghurst Road. I'm not sure exactly what was done during the refurb (or perhaps it's still taking place?) but I felt that the rooms could have done with a coat of paint or at least cleaned to remove all the scuff marks etc (unless they have deteriorated since they reopened in April?) to match the \"new\" modern decor. The location is fantastic for a night out in the Cross & the train station is located practically underneath the building if you want to get into the city cbd (Martin Place, Town Hall, Central) &/or to Bondi Junction. As we are members of Accor Advantage Plus we did get our room rate at a fantastic price (50% off during their March Madness Promo).. so value for money was great .. however I'd hv been somewhat disappointed if I'd have paid full rate (esp as the hotel is meant to be 4 star & I had expectations knowing it had undergone a refurb). Overall .. I'd consider staying here again if it were for a nite out in the city.. but probably would prefer to stay at a 4* CBD hotel with more amenities & pool if I was with family &/or on a vacation.

While the pillows were very comfortable to sit up and enjoy the view over the city, for sleeping, they were WAY too thick. Perhaps a couple of extra thinner pillows would easily solve this problem.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood Value!\u201d", "Author": "Azhkman", "ReviewID": "UR104758948", "Content": "We decided to extend our stay in Sydney by a day after staying a week at the Intercontinental while on business. For the last minute, the price of the Mercure was great comparable to other hotels, and a lot were booked too. Turned out to be a good decision. The staff were great, and the ground floor lobby and the check-in lobby really cool. The rooms and hallways on the room floors looked like they may have been from the original hotel. The bathrooms were clean, that's the important bit. They also had Nestle's chocolate in the room too! The neighborhood is pretty lively at night, and the botanical gardens and Paddington a short walk away. The real key is the value. Sydney is expensive anyways, but for the price the Mercure really delivered.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDecent and right in the middle of King's Cross\u201d", "Author": "derpde", "ReviewID": "UR104619618", "Content": "Cannot fault the location of this hotel if you're going to the King's Cross area. It is located next to the train station and across the road from the Holiday Inn, about 20m off the strip. The room rate we paid though was just over half the price of the Holiday Inn. The hotel has only just opened again after a renovation, I think it used to be a Chifley hotel. The lobby and rooms had new fittings and furnishings (should have spent more money on the painters though, they've done a shocking job, especially in the hallways). The room was clean and the bathroom was new also, with very average shower pressure. The room looked great anyway. I would recommend to improve the hotel, Mercure needs to provide an in room information book - I had no clue about the facilities of the hotel or the surrounding area and had to wait at reception to ask any questions. The only other gripe I had was that there were only 2 staff on for check out - when your check out time is 10am, everyone is going to appear at reception at once. I would hope they're better prepared for this in the future. Parking in case your wondering is very rare on the street and $35 under the hotel.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery Basic Amenities and poor cleaning\u201d", "Author": "RelentlessTraveller2", "ReviewID": "UR104431100", "Content": "The hotel is well positioned if you want to be in the middle of it all at Kings Cross and great for public transport and eating out. Don't stay here if you don't want stay in an area that has strip clubs, homeless people and suspect street activities. It is lively and quite safe but not for everyone's taste. I got the impression it has just been taken over as the staff seemed to be trying to work it all out. I stayed 3 nights in a twin room (two king single beds) with my 11 year old son. The room was adequate but in need of refurbishment. The beds were comfortable. But the hotel felt like it is cutting costs. Everything at a minimum supply: pillows, tea/coffee/shampoo etc very average. I was very surprised the hotel has NO INTERNET except in the lobby on a couple of PC's or plugging your laptop into a cable. No wireless anywhere and nothing in any rooms. They say it is being installed soon. Also no gym, no pool, a sad bar and completely uninhabited restaurant. The worst aspect was the room servicing/cleaning. On arrival the bathroom smelled bad like it hadn't been properly cleaned (And no I'm not a clean freak OCD). It had a strong urine smell. On the second day when we returned the towels had not been folded, the bathroom bench had not been wiped (toothpaste in the basin) and the toilet very obviously not not been cleaned and still the urine smell remained. When i mentioned this to reception they said they would ahve it seen to straight away but nothing happened. This was the way it was the whole time. I think the cleaners are too rushed perhaps. The beds got made but that was about it. The carpet was not vacuumed and the cups and glasses remained on the bench unwashed from the night before. Crumbs from biscuits still on the table tops. I would suggest considering the vast array of hotels in the area until this one lifts its game.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cUnless ur desperate...... for emergencies only.....\u201d", "Author": "sunshinechasers", "ReviewID": "UR104237271", "Content": "Room was ridiculously loud - even for the cross despite being on .

I paid $229 for a room with a harbour view. Upon checking in, I received a key to room 1302, and it ws quite small and really quite dirty. The walls were stained and it really looks like this hotel had done a very quick touch up job to open on time on what is a fairly rundown place. There was also no facility in the room to use a PC. I returned to reception and asked for a room where I could work and they reassigned me to 1505. This turned out to be the same style room on another floor, again without a desk or chair. The room was not exactly 4-star either. My third trip to recpetion entalied the duty manager takign over my compalint and searching for a room that had a chair and desk. I finally got a decent sized room where I could work. The room was more spacious but a bit scruffy for a newly opened hotel. One of the lampshades was cracked. As this whole procedure had added an hour, and I was hungry I thought I'd order some room service , but their all night dining menu was not available at 10.30pm! The chef had left for the evening. Man this place was becoming very frustrating. Howver, the bed was nice and the room was cool in a very humid Sydney. Breakfast proved a problem too. Firslty the attendant did not understand that Accor Advantage Plus memebrs get a 25% discount on hotel dining so I had to talk him thought it. Secondly, the range of breakfast items was far inferior to other hotesl I have stayed in worldwide, and service was lacking. Seemed every time I needed somethign at this hotel, it was'nt there. No bread for toasting, milk had run outm coffee machine failed. No plates, no glasses for juice and when they did arrive they were hot. Sounds like small annoyances but when they all add up, I was fed up. I mainly work in Potts Point when in Syndey but I stay at Mercure at Central and commute as there has not been an Accor hotel in Potts Point until this one opened at the beginning of March.
