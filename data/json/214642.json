The free wifi in the lobby came as a pleasant surprise. The payphone in the hotel was out of service and no alternative was offered after my mobile crashed and I had to contact someone urgently.

When we went to the reception with our booking information, the staff were rude, obnoxious (French), and refused to give us our correct room without charging us even though it was later found that the price difference between the two rooms was ZERO! We had to pay otherwise we would have had nowhere to stay, and trust me we tried elsewhere. The manager, Mike Chris (a Richard Branson wannabe judging by his self-grooming), was unprofessional, rude, and even walked away from us when we asked what he could do do help us. There were no lifts and they moved us to a room on the top floor with our suitcases and didn't even offer to help. Even when proved to have lied on their website and numerous complaints written we still haven't received our refund for the 'upgrade' that we are entitled to and the emails were going between us for months after. They have ignored me since August. The hotel ruined what was an otherwise excellent 4 days in London and the only thing I would recommend is you stay AWAY from this hotel and its rude, unprofessional, obnoxious and arrogant staff.

Did not sleep all night as people opened the main door and you could hear every conversation and the foot steps from people climbing the stairs. The shower was horrible, no hot water.

This was fine with me, although I booked a single room with facilities in the room. Off I went to enjoy a walk around Hyde Park only 5 minutes away.
