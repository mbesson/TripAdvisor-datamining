We stayed in a superior double (the green room pictured on the hotel's site), overlooking the old bridge and the square and I can imagine that in the high season it could be noisy. It was decorated to a high standard and linen was changed every two days and fresh towels daily. As is usual in Europe there were no coffee/tea making facilities but we had no problem with our travel kettle. Breakfast was served from 8.00 till 10.00 and the breakfast room is rather small with mainly tables for 2 as the hotel is not really suitable for children. The breakfast had, as is usual in Europe, a limited choice of cereals, fresh and tinned fruit, yogurts, cheese, meat, a selection of rolls and cake, fruit juice and an excellent coffee machine giving unlimited coffee of varying types. It had a hot water facility if tea was required. The staff were professional, efficient and friendly.

All in all, this hotel is in a perfect location to explore the city - you could not ask for a better location really! The only reason we did not score this a 5 out of 5 was due to two little random things that may not happen to anyone else. Firstly when we went down to breakfast, there were no tables and we had to wait until someone else left which left us feeling a little awkward hanging around! In fairness, as soon as a table became available the lady working in the breakfast room could not have been more helpful in clearing the table and making us feel at home. Secondly, the first night the TV randomly turned on at 5am! We turned it off and it turned itself back on a little while later (just as we were nodding off to sleep again!). Problem solved by pulling TV plug out of the socket to ensure it didn't happen again, but nonetheless annoying. Despite these little things, this was one of the best trips ever.

Below, workers unloaded produce and wine from their boats and couples glided past on morning gondola rides. The church bells ringing in the nearby bell tower were calming. The continental breakfast was served in a very lovely room and we looked forward each morning to those relaxing moments, knowing that the day ahead would often be filled with much touring and shopping.

A short stroll will get you to the S. Sofia traghetto crossing (by gondola- 0.50 Euro) of the Grand Canal which lets you off at the Mercato di Rialto. Just a few steps further is the Ca' d'Oro vaporetto stop. Piazza San Marco is a pleasant 15 minute walk from the Hotel Antico Doge. Both Manuela and Sara at the reception desk did fantastic jobs of graciously helping us with our dinner reservations, rebooking tours and scheduling a \"last minute\" water taxi ride on a very rainy day to Piazzale Roma and our rental car parked at the San Marco garage.

To enjoy any hotel in Venice, you must accept this and move on. Once you accept this, you will love the Antico Doge and find that it has a very reasonable price for a nice hotel in an excellent location. The best thing is the location. Some reviewers have suggested this hotel is \"right by\" Rialto (like this is a negative!). I would amend this comment to say that the hotel sits a perfect 2 to 3 blocks away (about a five minute walk). This means you can easily walk to Rialto without feeling like you are living in the middle of a tourist trap. The hotel is directly across from a canal and bridge and if you walk across the bridge away from Rialto, you will find yourself in a lovely and quieter residential area. So, in my opinion, this location offers the best of both worlds! The room was very lovely. yes, the actual room seems a bit worn, but I think this is partly because it is furnished in an old-timey way with antiques, etc. the bathroom, though small, is recently renovated and the shower is excellent! my family actually shared a superior deluxe room for two nights. this offered a bed in an upstairs loft and a downstairs bed. be warned that the downstairs bed is actually a sofa bed pulled out with an ornate headboard. this is NOT the most comfortable thing, but my husband and I did just fine on it. We paid 330E per night, but we stayed in October and this is one of the best prices we found! I thought the breakfast was lovely - definitely on par with other places we stayed in throughout Italy. The only draw back was the coffee. it was merely luke warm and the breakfast staff didn't seem to understand the concept of heating it up more when we asked. oh well. that's pretty much the worst I can think of to say about breakfast! The staff is extremely helpful and willing to recommend restaurants, etc. The hotel also offers a private boat service to and from the airport. As my husband and I were traveling with my parents and didn't want to risk getting lost, we booked the private car from the airport. it was insanely expensive, but such a nice private motor boat. We stood the whole way (through the sunroof) and absolutely love the beautiful view that greeted us.

I didn't feel it lived up to the high rating. The hotel is okay; there is nothing glaringly wrong, but it is not the special place that people here have raved about. First, the location: the entry is right on a very busy walkway/bridge in Cannaregio, near the ridiculously crowded Rialto Bridge. There's a constant stream of foot traffic along the walkway, which is dark and dank. It's not exactly ugly, but there are a multitude of more attractive (and more quiet) spots in the district. Second, the hotel has no lobby. To me, lobbies are important. I want a place to relax without having to necessarily go up to my room. Antico Doge only has a long corrider, a small check in desk, and then a stairway to climb. It does have a very classic-looking breakfast room, and that's a positive, but it's not the same as a lobby. This was the biggest disappointment for me. Third, it's a bit on the shabby side -- the carpets in the hallways were a tad worn and the carpet in my room had some small stains. A tacky touch, they have plastic flowers in the corridor. Fourth, the room itself was plain. I booked a standard room, but when I checked in they told me I was being \"upgraded\" to a \"deluxe\" room. But it wasn't deluxe -- it didn't have the hardwood floors and view that I expected; indeed, it had no view at all. To be fair, there were some positives: the staff was friendly, the room was larger than I expected (maybe the size is why it was deemed to be \"deluxe\")and it was extremely tidy and clean; the bathroom was new and modern; the breakfasts and espressos were delicious; and (I suspect) the actual \"deluxe\" room really do have hardwood floors and amazing views, if you're lucky enough to get one. I just expected more for the equivalent of $190 euros (about $280) per night. My girlfriend seemed satisfied with the place, but when she found out how much it cost, she said, \"For this?\" A tip: if you want to stay in this area, consider instead Hotel Giorgione -- it's a bit more expensive, but it's a far better value: it has a large, beautiful lobby, with real fresh flowers; the breakfast area is outside and inviting; and the location, though only a stone's throw from Antico Doge, is much quieter, on an old traditional Venice street.", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cLovely stay\u201d", "Author": "Ellense", "ReviewID": "UR21146097", "Content": "Lovely hotel in a great area.

The location was excellent, close to the Rialto and not far from St Mark's square. It's also an easy walk to get off the beaten path and explore the backstreets of Venice on the other, less touristy side of the Rialto (San Polo? area I believe). We stayed in a Junior Suite which was decorated beautifully in old Venice style. The bathroom was adequate and the air conditioning was great and definitely needed in Venice. There was a king sized sofa bed down stairs that was made up into a bed and two twin beds upstairs. I was immediately disappointed because I booked a room that stated 1 king and 2 twin beds. When I asked the receptionist she explained that all their king beds were the same and that our bed was NOT a sofa bed. Maybe Italy is different, but in America when you can fold a mattress with a frame back into a sofa, it is called a sofa bed. Additionally none of the beautiful king sized beds shown on their website appear to be sofa beds. For 330 euros a night (more than we paid anywhere in Italy, including Rome where we had a two bedroom apartment) it would seem reasonable to have had a comfortable bed to sleep in. Because Venice was so absolutely wonderful, we did not let a bed detract from our overall experience. We would definitely return to this beautiful city and possibly the hotel because of its excellent location. I would not stay in the junior suite again however. **Also... make sure you're aware of all charges when you eat out in Venice. When we ate at the canal side restaurant a few steps away from the hotel, they charged us 6 euros per person (24 euros total for table settings/linens, I believe they said).

The staff, while formal, is helpful and helped us make museum and opera reservations.

The room was clean but there is little to recommend the hotel generally. Reception is unfriendly. The breakfast is mediocre although service in the breakfast room was kind and courteous. Views of the canal can be had if one stands at the window. The canal is unattractive and there is a good deal of street noise.
