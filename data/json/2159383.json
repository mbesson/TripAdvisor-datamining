At first, our taxi driver could not find this place since there are hundreds of hotels in Sultanahmet area. But if you already know the area, this place is not hard to find actually, simply take the tram (T1) to Camberlitas, cross the street, walk down until you find Piyer Loti Caddesi (with Pierre Lotti hotel in the corner) and you turn right, follow the street. At the end of the road, turn right again and you'll find this hotel. And it's about 5 minutes walk to Blue Mosque, Ayasofya, and Basilica Cistern. The room is very nice, clean and modern and has a free wifi.The staffs are very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is not good though but there are many cafes and restaurants nearby anyway. And with the location in the middle of 2 tram station (Sultanahmet and Camberlitas), you could easily explore the city with the tram/metro.

The reception was welcoming and friendly. The reception staff speak English pretty well- and it can be quite fun to have misunderstandings- patience is rewarded-please remember fellow english speakers, that the rest of the world is not obligated to speak our language perfectly . The lobby is just fine with comfortable chairs for waiting or working. Nicely decorated. We had a triple room on the first floor. The room was nice and clean(including the bathroom). The beds were clean and comfortable, the mattresses were on the firm side. Good sleep. The weather during our stay was exceptionately cold( 3C below at night, 2C in the day, snowy), but we were provided with a portable heater that was more than adequate to keep our room warm and comfortable. The shower was great and hot water plentiful. The TV was good with BBC News 24, Spanish TVE, NBC International, TV France 24 and Al Jazeera English among others. There is free WiFi in the lobby, and in the rooms. Just ask reception for the pass code for the WiFi service for your room.The buffet breakfast was fine, with a nice selection of food including cereal, cold meats, bread and rolls, boiled eggs, tomatoes, cucumber, yoghurt, coffee and tea. The fruit on offer, however, mostly looked past its best. All of the staff, cleaning ladies included, provided friendly service with a smile. There is also a terrace on the 5th floor. It does not give a view of the Sutanahmet district, but there is a decent view of the sea with all the ships passing by, or at anchor. The hotel is right in the Sultanahmet district. All of the main sights of the district are no more than a few minutes walk, or a short ride on the excellent tram away. A single cash fare is 2TL. You buy tram tokens at the machines near the entrance to the tram stops. The tram stop at \u00c3\u2021emberlita\u00c5\u0178 is 5 minutes from the hotel. From this stop you can get to Taksim Square in about 30 minutes (you also need to use the modern Funicular Train which is at the Kabata\u00c5\u0178 end of the tram line). Also, one stop down from \u00c3\u2021emberlita\u00c5\u0178 at the Sultanahmet stop, the Sultan Ahmet(Blue) Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Hippodrome, and Basilica Cistern are all with easy walking distance. The Grand Bazaar, which has 4,000 or 5,000 stalls depending on who you are talking to, is 10 minutes from the hotel. There is also a post office in the Grand Bazaar from where you can post your post cards. Post offices are few and far between. But you can buy stamps in gift shops. International postage for a post card is 2TL(Turkish Lira) The hotel offers a transfer service to Attaturk Airport. On Saturday February 18, 2012, it was 25 Euros one way for up to 3 people , and 5 Euros extra each, for additional passengers. We booked the hotel through Expedia and the deal included return airfare from London, A triple room with breakfast for 5 nights. The cost was \u00c2\u00a3775. A good hotel at a good price.

Generally speaking, they have 3 different kinds of rooms. Standard, deluxe and superior room. Initially we booked deluxe double room and at our arrival, because they were having availability, they upgrated our room to superior room, without paying any extra. So we stayed in the room 504, in the last floor, with beautiful balcony and Marmara sea view. The hotel is brand new, including the furnitures and the room is very very confortable and warm, equipped with all the facilities you can need, including free wireless. Also the bathroom is very big, clean and new. The furnitures style is a mix between classic and modern, but sure the match is perfect. Absolutely can be considered a 4 stars hotel. Moreover, the cleanliness personnel is well mannered and polite. Also the rest of the staff, including the people who is working in the reception and the restaurant, they are very polite, helpfull and they can speak a good english. After staying the first four days, we left the hotel to go to Cappadocia for 3 days. Because after Cappadocia we were spending last our night in Istanbul, we decided to stay with our pleasure at Recital Hotel. So we booked thru the web site our last night and we asked for transportation service from the airport to the hotel. Even if we stayed just for one night they give as the transportation, and as far as I know they give you the transportation if you book for at least 3 nights. Talking about the location, it is really amazing. You can reach by max 10 min walking all the important places in Sultanahmet, like Aya Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazar, and the Metro Station Cemberlitas. To conclude my description, I absolutely reccomend and advice this hotel and Im sure that you will have a realy great time.

We went there and i realise it is a mistake by the entrance hall,,,old style and somehow dirty,,,looking negligent,,,anyway,,,we reach there at 15 pm and they were not having any room ready for us,.,they were saying that we must wait for 30 min for a clean room,,we insisted to give us a room, so they gave a terrible small room, without window! My boyfriend went to discuss with the receptionist about it,,and after he insisted, they offered a superior room, acceptable situated...the conditions were not too bad in the room, but the heat was not working properly and we have felt frozen that night,,,The worse moment was next morning, on breakfast,,,very poor,,,we were struggling to find something suitable to eat, but without succes...horrible coffee,,,nothing fresh,,,nothing sweet,,,not even a brioche,,,this is not acceptable in a 4 stars hotel, especially in Turkey,,We were irritated, especially because we have been before in Istanbul, in very nice hotels, cheaper and much much better than Recital,... So, the conclusion is that Recital is like 3 stars hotel, too expensive for what they offer,,and the breakfast is absolutely a disaster! We took our luggages after the first night and moved to Arden Hotel. We had a gourgeous treatment there, the rooms, the staff,,,the breakfast,,,we felt spoiled,,,they pampered us,,,and everything at the price of 55 euros, not 70 like in Recital's case! They even offered us a small present before leaving: a box with turkish delight! So,,,if you want a very nice hotel, go to Arden Hotel, you will simply love it! And i am giving you a nice tip for couples in love: go to have a romantic dinner to Panoramic Restaurant, it is situated right in front of Arden, on a roof. You will have a fantastic view of Ayasofia and Blue Mosque while you will take the dinner.

All of the directions that we had from the reception on how to reach points of interest were always (!) wrong. We asked them to book a cruize for us and they (or the cruize agency, but that's not my problem- they should have checked) misled us by saying the cruize was canceled due to bad weather (but we went on our own just fine- the weather was great). At breakfast, dishes and cups were very-very dirty (breadcrums, hair, stains etc). Towels in our room were dirty and they didn't change it the first two days. The triple room that we had booked was in fact a twin room with a sofa bed fit only for children. However, we had e-mailed them (and called them on the phone) to confirm that there would be three single beds in the room and they said OK. What's more, that's what they show in their official pictures- 3 single beds for the triple room! Despite their mistake they didn't even offer us a discount or something complimentary...

The location is perfect - on a sidestreet, just few minutes' walk from the Hippodrome, Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia. The building itself is exquisite. Our room had soft sheets, silk curtains, and a lovely, sizeable bathroom to wash away our travels when we arrived. Perfect! The staff are tremendously helpful, and ready to offer advice, or just a friendly cup of chay (tea). The entire building is incredibly restful. Someone (or lots of someones) have obviously put a huge amount of effort into getting the details right - and it shows. What else? Free wifi (hurrah!), aircon (double hurrah!) - oh, and it's scrupulously clean. We were delighted by the whole experience, and would happily have stayed longer (or return again).
