I had a fantastic holiday overall with my sister but must say that the O Hotel contributed massively to having such a great week. The hotel itself is a lovely boutique hotel with highlights including one of the most comfortable bed's I have ever slept in; access to Wifi; a hot, gorgeous shower and a lounge and bar area which were fab, but the staff - the staff went above and beyond. All of the staff were accommodating in particular Joel and Erin who not only provided standard maps, but tailor made suggestions of easiest routes of how to get about, places to see on arrival to some of our destinations along with print outs and other handy hints. The location was great for my sis and I who - shock horror- were in LA without a car and the staff made this otherwise frowned upon predicament easy as pie! If I could give 1/2 marks it would get 4.5 and if there was outside space (a roof garden or something it would get a 5).", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle Washington", "Title": "\u201cClose to action - the good and the bad!\u201d", "Author": "NWCN", "ReviewID": "UR126890551", "Content": "As I have mentioned in the past, I am a frequent business and personal traveler, but have have remained grounded enough to avoid any wild \"bias\" swings. With that said, I will say the O Hotel was clean and conveniently located to the Staples Center and the Nokia Theater. The staff is somewhat attentive, but the place feels more like an Internet Cafe than a hotel. The room I had was small to average size, but the bath/shower area was extremely dysfunctional with a wand-like shower head and an open style shower that made it difficult to avoid spraying water all over the place. Although I write this laughing, it was really a pain in the $$$ having to ask for another floor mat and towels every time I showered. The free breakfast was more like bagels and apples, but don't expect plenty of them. If breakfast is your thing, you can try IHop across. If you okay with their breakfast. get there early or else eat what is left over. However, the biggest disappointment were the loud noises coming from outside throughout the day. Screaming and yelling from people either whacked out on drugs or drunk, wasn't something I expected at $215 per night. In addition, if you're not the type of person who can physically handle yourself, this may not be the place for you. Although no one tried anything on me, I was on edge there more than any of the times I have been in NY on business, and this is coming from a guy who has stayed at a Howard Johnsons in Jamaica, NY (near JFK) more than a few times. Overall, and it all fairness, it was not a bad place to stay, but the Luxe Hotel or JW Marriott might be a much better choice at similar prices.

I have literally stayed everywhere, from motels in small towns to Holiday Inn's to the Ritz. I am not super picky and I don't have to always stay at the nicest places. We booked this hotel based off the pictures and location... and it was a major disappointment. I would never stay here again, nor would I recommend it. When you enter the hotel lobby, it definitely doesn't match the rooms. Basically, they spent money on the lobby and really slacked on the rooms. As soon as I entered our room- it smelled so badly! It had a stale, musty smell to it. Bad first impression. It was also the smallest room I have EVER stayed in and we booked the largest room cateogory they offered. It felt like a cracker box. The bathroom was soooo little, with NO space on the counter to put any personal items. And the shower, oh my goodness. It was so little and has a half door- if that makes any sense. It only covers half of the shower! So, the floor was soaken wet after each shower. Ridiculous! In the shower was a wand that slid up and down the wall, or at least was supposed to. Well, it didn't stay at the top- so the water would constantly hit you at shoulder height, which made it impossible to wash your hair. It was also pointing straight at the wall so you basically had to be smashed up on the wall to get any water. Also, their toileteries are a joke- just tiny bottles of shampoo and conditioner- NO lotion. Let's talk about the noise- every night we could hear loud music, talking and booms and crashes. I think, perhaps, the music was coming from the bar?? Not sure about the other noises- you'd have thought Charlie Sheen was maybe in the room next to us?? We had to sleep with the tv on loudly and the air conditioning on high every night. I think the JW Marriott was only $30 more a night- I wish we would have stayed there. It was so nice! Bottom line- I felt dirty staying here. The room just seemed not clean. I showered as soon as I got home and washed all my clothes- even the ones I didn't wear on the trip, because I felt filthy from our room.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cNice place - a couple of surprises\u201d", "Author": "moldey", "ReviewID": "UR100450639", "Content": "My 20 something son and I stayed in the 0 Hotel for two nights recently as we were attending a couple of sporting events at Staples Centre.

It's very chic inside but may seem a little quirky to a traditionalist. If you are driving you will be required to park in the adjacent parkade, which cost us around $11.00 per day. Considering this is downtown in a major city, it's very affordable. The hotel offers a continental breakfast which consists of small pastries, juice, tea, coffee, apples/oranges and bagels and toaster. On our second morning I arrived for breakfast one hour before it closed and they were out of bagels. I asked the attendent if there were more bagels and she said no and put the toaster away.

A small hotel with an adjacent independant parking structure ($11.00/day or $20.00/day for in and out priviledges). Very easy check-in and check-out. I had their cheapest room ($98 + change) which was smaller than my apartment, but all I needed to simply spend the night. Very comfortable bed, in-room mini-fridge (which I was told was being switched out so I brought a cooler anyways), coffee maker which I had to move to the floor to make the cord reach an outlet. Bizarre shower fixture which sprayed water into the bathroom since there is only a half-panel glass for the shower. The water sprayes into the toilet area which is only closed off by a semi-luminescent (?sp?) sliding door. Hardly any shelf space near the sink for personal items. No 'guide book' for hotel features, ammenities, restaurant/bar menu, etc... Clock radio had no directions as to how to set the correct time (it was incorrect and I had to call the front desk) or how to 'program' the AC/Heat unit. The hotel does have a bar and restaurant but they included none of this information in the room. They did advise me of the complimentary breakfast buffet which was nothing but juice, coffee, bagels, and dry pastry. I had to leave the lights on 24/7, even during the day as the 'window' was nothing but a 'trough' looking at the walls and air-conditioning pipes. I heard the people above me constantly, not partying or being wild, but just what appeared to be walking around, as well as people on either sides of the room. All in all, even though I was only there to rest before a concert at Staples, and get a nights sleep before driving home, it was an irritating time.

They also over-charged my card on the first night of my stay and took several days to adjust the charge.

My first problem was that we arrived as a late check in which we had notified them of and upon check in there was no assistance available nor offered with our luggage.

To stick with the per diem for hotels, I chose to stay at The O Hotel. The lobby was trendy, and when my co-workers and I checked in around 11 pm, the doorman operated the red-lit elevator for us. I reserved a boutique room, which is the smallest room that you can stay in. Initially I was given a room on one end of the hallway. When I opened the door I was surprised at how small the room was. It seemed to be approximately 10' x 15', and I immediately saw the bed and almost walked into the mini fridge on the floor. The full-sized bed took up almost the entire room! The only positive things I can say about this particular room are that it was clean, quiet, and the bed was comfortable. The next evening I went to the front desk to ask if there were any other rooms available (of the same type) that were bigger. I knew that they existed because my co-worker was staying in a boutique room on the other end of the hallway, and it was a little bigger than mine. The woman at the desk gave me a key to the room directly above my coworker's. I was able to switch to it (at no additional charge since it was the same room type) and slept a lot better the rest of the week. I only have a few complaints about this room. There wasn't a lot of good lighting in the bedroom area, I could hear people throwing away garbage (like glass bottles) in the dumpsters in the alley below my room until 11 or 12 at night, and the closest stairwell to my room required me to go through a staff breakroom area when I reached the first floor. One of my co-workers complained about hearing garbage trucks at 4:30 in the morning, and another said that he could hear people \"screaming\" in the rooms on either side of his. I also had to get used to the hand-held shower and the open shower design to make sure that I didn't splash much water onto the bathroom floor. Overall, I would recommend The O Hotel if you weren't staying more than a couple of nights and don't mind noise. The people at the front desk were always very friendly and helpful (for example, there wasn't a remote in the fitness room, so the employee came in to turn the TV on for me).

I don't like moldy worn out rooms so it was nice to stay at a place that feels like a package that was just opened for the first time.", "Date": "March 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MyRyTy98", "Title": "\u201cNOT a scary downtown place\u201d", "Author": "martini98", "ReviewID": "UR14056157", "Content": "I needed an overnight place to stay near Staple Center as I was going to a concert there. While it IS in walking distance, I wouldn't recommend it at night. As a single female I was very concerned about finding a hotel that I'd feel safe in. I felt VERY safe. The staff at the O was SO friendly. They all cheered, \"Have fun at the concert\" when I left. Since I just needed a place to sleep, as long as the rooms were clean, I was happy and they were. Clean, funky, and QUIET. I had a view of a wall, but who cares...I was there and then left. IHOP is right across the street and Subway is next door. There may not be any amenities but there is always something going on around the hotel.

Booked cheap via a web discount. Rooms are 'trendy' - but to me seemed a bit cell-like. Colours are all grey and white. A bit depressing really. And our window view - close up onto a wall - was not the best. The rooms are small and without a proper bathroom or bathroom door - just a sliding partition. You will get to know your friend very well if you are more than one in the room. On the plus side - flat screen plasma on the wall (no room for a conventional telly) and some trendy lighting and shower tiling made it a bit more homely. Also on the plus side - the hotel staff were great - and they are allowed to be real people rather than programmed robots. And as you'll see the lift is lit brothel red - so check the mirror in the room instead. 'Cheap' (for dowtown) parking right next door is safe and convenient.

I wanted to like the Orchid because it's reasonably priced, modern and independent. But our stay was not satisfactory. First, despite what's on the hotel's website, the restaurant/bar won't be ready for another month (maybe Dec '07). Second, since the restaurant/bar IS the lobby, the hotel is very quiet and frankly, dead. Third, service is minimal and through friendly, no personal touch that one usually expects at a small boutique property. No doorman/valet, minimal front desk services, no concierge. This lack of personal service and attention was surprising and disappointing, especially since we saw the same staff on duty for the duration of our stay. Fourth, while the rooms are furnished in chic, modern style with top-of-the-line fixtures, the bathroom is tiny with poor water pressure for the shower, no counterspace, and no hand towels. And the view. Except for the rooms on Flower Street, you get a view of...a concrete wall! The Orchid is 3 blocks from the Standard, but miles behind in decor and services. Yes, it's less expensive than the Standard, but you get what you pay for. Parking is next door in a public garage that charges $9 but no in/out privileges. The neighborhood is transitional with bars and restaurants popping up, the Pantry around the corner and an upscale Ralph's market across the street. Still, the streets can be deserted at night. No neighborhood feel like the Pearl District in Portland or Belltown in Seattle. Hopefully, the Orchid will be able to turn things around because like the neighborhood, it has a lot of potential.", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkeley, CA", "Title": "\u201csmall but fabulous\u201d", "Author": "Christine_U", "ReviewID": "UR10432962", "Content": "I was totally charmed by this stylish hotel, and its young, friendly staff. It seemed like a great value for the price, to me. The Japanese-influenced decor is soothing yet fashionable, and the architects paid quite a lot of attention to detail. For example, the hollow in the shower for the fancy soaps and shampoo is exactly vertically centered among the rectangular tiles. (Tip: the bathroom does have a door--it's sliding glass, and not that easy to see at first!) I enjoyed the mood lighting (base of the bed lights up; elevator is red), though it might be difficult if you were trying to, say, work on your screenplay at night. The location is pleasant: a clean street on one of the better blocks of downtown, right near a new and fancy Ralphs supermarket. The lobby is glamourous--you could probably bring clients there, and make them feel impressed. A great place to be if you're planning to visit MOCA, the Disney Concert Hall, the Mark Taper Forum or Staples Center.
