Breakfast ok for 3 euros. Great chance to practise your Spanish since hostal personnel hardly able to speak decent English. Minusses: loud environment, so impossible to sleep with window open; strong smell of chlorex in the room. Considerable fly in the ointment: new Camper shoes, bought on the Calle Arenal on Monday, Oct 31 for 160 euros and kept in a shop paper bag by the bed, disappeared from the room! Nobody knows \"whodunnit\", so when adding this loss to the room price, the room price stopped being a bargain - although the shocked receptionist offered not to charge for breakfast.

Everyone seemed to be aware that they needed to be considerate of others and we found no noise from the other guests at all. They offer a breakfast for a moderate price, but we didn't opt for it - we chose to go out and forage for our breakfast. But they very kindly kept some milk that we had bought in their fridge, since one of our group is celiac and brought his own breakfast cereal.

Little did we know how quiet. Yes we travelled on a lads' holiday. Yes there was a group of 10 of us. However, no we didn't spend any more time than absolutely required in the hostel and no, we didn't make any mire noise than snoring or quiet conversations while there. Despite this every interaction with the staff from check in to check out was accompanied by a sneering sense of superiority which made you feel far from comfortable. Maybe they aren't used to larger groups or maybe they just want older couples to stay but as a Hostal in the centre of Madrid maybe they should widen their target markets. The accommodation was fine, the service was diabolical and could have ruined the experience. Stay here if you're over 50 and want to be in bed by 11 each night.

In the center of town, right next to the Puerta del Sol, conveniently close to all of the downtown sights, restaurants, bars and the metro. We booked our room for 55Euros a night, and were so happy with our choice! The hotel is in an interesting old building and has many charming rooms, some facing the plaza with juliet balconies. Our room was upstairs in the back, so a little quieter. There were all hardwood floors throughout, and it was freshly painted and immaculately clean. The bed in the room was a small double bed, a little tight for two, but was comfortable. Some rooms had larger beds. The bathroom is also tiny, but clean and functional. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only negative is that you have to ring to be let into the building. This makes it very safe, but we felt quite bad ringing to be let in after a night out at a club. However, we were very promptly let in by the night desk worker (but clearly we woke her up. sorry!) The hotel offers breakfast, which you order the night before. It was good for the price. There are coffee shops and restaurants nearby that have wider selections. The hotel also offers Wi-Fi in the lobby, and had a lending library.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Clean!!!\u201d", "Author": "MarcoPolo62", "ReviewID": "UR86949509", "Content": "Hostal Riesco is similar to a nice pensione in Italy. Located on two floors of an old building on the Puerta del Sol square it is perfectly located in the center of Old Madrid. It is right across the street from one of the hub metro stations. From this metro, you can get everywhere quickly. Of course, you are a short walk from the Prado, Cava Baja nightlife, the Huertas nightlife, Plaza Mayor and other destinations. There are many little shops right outside the front door including a very nice bakery. The bedroom and the bathroom were very spacious. The decor and furniture are very simple, but functional. The place was clean as a whistle. This was a tremendous value at 56 euros for a double room. The staff was very helpful if you had questions. A few items of note, the TV has no english channels and the upper floor does not have wireless access. You have to go downstairs to the sitting area or breakfast area to use the wireless internet.

There are many good restaurants in the surrounding area. We would definitely stay here again and the people at the front desk were friendly and helpful.

The windows were fairly soundproof so when closed it really was not very loud but we were there in October and happy to sleep with them closed- it could have been quite loud with them open on this side of the hotel.

The hostal is at the third floor, with lots of uneven steps; but its ok really :). There is a small elevator- but don't expect to fit more than 2 people in there. Service was great. Cleaned the rooms daily. You have to leave the key at the desk anytime you leave the rooms. Someone is always at the desk. Bathroom is really tiny; but its okay.
