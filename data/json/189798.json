Three of us traveling, we were in room 10 on the main floor. As a previous review stated that the room was noisy, I felt this was somewhat true. Yes, you do hear a fair amount of noise. I am a light sleeper, but I was so exhausted from our travels that I pretty much slept thru it. Room 11 is next to the elevator, so I would assume the noise would be much more apparent in that room. Room 10 was great for us, very roomy. Door out to the courtyard where we would sit and relax with a bottle of wine after a long day. The hotel is very clean, our room was clean and the bathroom was clean. Plenty of towels for 3 people. All of the desk employees were very nice & pleasant. Breakfast was your usual fair. Pastries, meats, cheeses, fruit, juice, coffee/tea, cereal. Just enough to get you on your way for the day. Location nice, in a neighborhood. About 2-3 block walk to the river Seine. If coming from the airport, take the metro, about 9-10 euros. Probably the least expensive mode of transportation and will take you about an hour. Not fun if you have a lot of luggage though. 1-2 bags should be ok. On the metro, take the B line to Gare du Nord. Hop on 4 (d'Orleans) to Saint-Denis. Then hop on the 8 (Creteil) to Ledru Rollin. (dont quote me on this, check route on map to be sure) When you come up top, you will see a McDonalds. Look for the \"Laboratoire\" store front. The street to the right of the \"Laboratoire\" is Ledru Rollin. The streets are confusing, many diagonal directions (duh...Paris). Head down Ledru Rollin about 2-3 blocks and you will see rue de Charenton. There is a laundry on one corner, bistro on another corner and bakery on another corner. Hotel is across street from laundry on Charenton. I would stay here again.

Rooms are understated and stylish with old prints and orginal doors and windows. Modern bathrooms. Spotlessly clean. My bedroom opened onto the central courtyard so was very quiet (no traffic noise at all). The reception staff and the lovely housekeeper were wonderful. The breakfast room was full when I went to breakfast at peak time on Sunday but they let me take a tray piled high with goodies up to my room, and the coffee, bread and croissants were excellent. Wonderfully convenient near Bastille and a short walk from Gare de Lyon. A delightful Parisien neighbourhood with real shopsand real people. I look forward to returning.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Pavillon Saint Louis Bastille", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d189798-Reviews-Pavillon_Saint_Louis_Bastille-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$149 - $356*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">66 Rue de Charenton</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">12 Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75012</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "189798", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f8/80/fc/superior-double-or-twin.jpg"}}
