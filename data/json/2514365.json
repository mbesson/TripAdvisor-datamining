It is located across the street from Lincoln Center and a subway terminal. There is a Starbucks next door along with a pharmacy and is a couple of blocks from Central Park. I found the hotel staff to be nice, however somewhat aloof. Checking in went smoothly and I was able to stow our luggage until we could officially get into our room. The room was fine - bigger than I anticipated since the reviews stated how small the room was. Our view was horrible - air conditioning vents outside the window. But the room was so quiet, I did not want to ask for a change. The shower needed a manual to work and the shower door was stationary and only went halfway - water hit the floor due to the open space. The only complaint I had was that whoever cleaned our room kept forgetting to replace the towels, bath mat, etc. I would understand this if it was a one time event. However, four out of five nights, I had to call the front desk and ask for wash clothes and a bath mat, then wait between twenty and thirty minutes for someone to bring it. For a four star hotel, I thought this was a major oversight that was a big pain. By the way, if you plan on using the internet, the business center is available to use.

But when you look a bit closer you notice that it's got some wrinkles beneath the surface. Our bathroom was clean -- but kind of gross in that paint was chipping, there were some permanent stains on the door frame and the caulking was tearing apart.

The lobby is beautiful and the location is great. We had been upgraded to a deluxe double and were told it had a beautiful view of Lincoln Center. When we got to our room we had no view and the set up of the room was very strange with a column in the middle of the room. I called down and was told that we could switch rooms tomorrow but nothing was available that night. I was fine with that until I saw how small the bathroom was. I think it is quite possibly the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel. This was a little bit of a problem with three teens. Also the showers do not have a door so the water tends to spray out of the shower and all over the floor of the bathroom. Our heater's nob was broken so the air in the room was pretty bad, luckily I was able to crack a window. The icing on the cake for this room was that one of the girls found a yamika in the bed. I tried to not make too big of a deal about it to the girls but did mention it the next day and was able to get a much nicer room as a result. The staff was friendly. The conceirge was great the first night and led us to a great restaurant down by Time Square. The following night we were going to a play and wanted to go to little Italy for dinner. The conceirge told us to take the #1 train down and get off at Canal St. The only thing he forgot to tell us was that we would have to walk all the way through Canal St. and the stop was about a mile from little Italy. Needless to say there was a closer stop if he had directed us correctly and had us switch trains at Time Square. Also it was quite scary to walk through Canal St with 3 teenagers who were dressed to go to the theater. And we ended up only having an hour for dinner because he did not tell us that it would take us an hour to get there.

While that's inarguably an exciting place to be, it's also maddeningly mobbed, noisy all night, and overwhelmingly touristy. The Empire is only about 10 minutes' walk north of Times Square, but its Upper West Side location is worlds away. One (long crosstown) block to Central Park; across the street from Lincoln Center. A few blocks from the Whole Foods on Columbus Circle, the Apple Store at 66th & Broadway. The subway cluster at Columbus Circle (59th Street) isn't as extensive as the Times Square cluster, but it will get you most places you want to go. Best of all, though, this is a neighborhood: there are plenty of visitors in the streets, of course, but most of the skyscrapers are full of residents, people who walk their dogs, get a bagel at the deli, and so forth. The hotel itself has been recently refurbished in a stylishly comfy boutique hotel manner. In my room, the showerhead was positioned so that it wasn't possible not to get the bathroom floor wet, but that was the only example of a stylish element not quite completely coordinated. Cushy towels and bathrobe. The usual overabundance of pretty pillows and throws on the bed, but at least the room was large enough to stash them in a corner. The building is in an E-shape, such that a lot of the rooms look into courtyards (the rest look at the street). These courtyards are classic New York: not much sunlight or air, not especially clean, with white-noise-creating mechanical equipment at the bottom. But quiet, I found. The fitness center is pretty standard-issue, with some treadmills, stairmasters, and other machines. The standout feature is the view: it looks north to a small triangular park & Broadway (which at that point has a lovely landscaped median), with Lincoln Center to the left (west) and a slot view of Central Park to the right (east). Compared to the more standard windowless fitness center, this was outstanding, especially for a guest staying in a room that looks into the grey twilight of the courtyards. The hotel has a spectacular-looking roof deck and pool. I say \"looking\" because it was still closed for the winter when I stayed. Service seemed good. We weren't disturbed when we had the Do Not Disturb sign up; an error in the bill was quickly corrected; a problem with the Business Center was quickly attended to.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cherry Hill, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLincoln Center NY Trip\u201d", "Author": "BFW10", "ReviewID": "UR126749934", "Content": "We wanted to see the show \"War Horse\" and stay overnight in New York City.

Our room, a deluxe king, was exceptionally clean and well-maintained with a great view. On the 8th floor, it was away from the noise of the lobby and the rooftop bar, and the sound of the street. We had 7 nights of great sleep, even with the window open. We didn't know what to expect of the room before we came, having read many reviews that the rooms were small, but ours was a great size for the two of us. If you want a bigger room, you can't expect to pay for a standard queen and get a large suite. The Empire Hotel is in the perfect location for exploring Central Park, visiting the Lincoln Center and getting into downtown Manhattan (it's only a twenty minute walk from Times Square, in fact). When there's a Whole Foods at Columbus Circle, a five-minute walk, you can't beat the location for convenience. Wi-fi in the lobby area is complementary and If your flight isn't until later in the day on your day of checking out, there's a free luggage storage room.

The check-in was long, tedious and unpleasant. The woman that checked us in was just plain rude and seemed to absolutely hate her job. The first room they put us in was an absolute horrible neightmare. The decor was run down, the room was so small, you couldn't even turn around in it, you had to back onto the toilet because the bathroom was so small. Nowhere to put a suitcase or a bag or a cosmetics case. But the worst thing was the horrendous noise from the airconditioning units outside our window. NOT that our aircon even worked!! it was SO hot! We were sweating all night and hardly had any sleep, between the loud noise and heat. The noise was like a big truck running outside the window the entire time. And our view was a big wall with windows and aircon units. You coulnd't even open your window to let some fresh air in, because the other windows were 10cm from ours and people could see inside our room!! no wonder they've had thefts in this hotel, it'd be so easy to climb from one room to another. In the morning, I went and complained as we had been in NYC for almost three weeks and we were about to fly back overseas and we wanted our last night in NYC to be pleasant. So after much trouble, they moved us to a room that was much better and a bit bigger - it faced the outside and we could see lincoln centre. And there was no aircon noise and the room temperature was manageable. There were many other irks with this hotel, like when we had to call and ask for things, it would take between 45min-1hr for someone to bother to come around and bring it to us. For example, we asked for ice, 45min later someone showed up. We asked for an iron and ironing board.. after half an hour we rang to ask for it as we really needed it to iron our clothes before going out to a restaurant that we had a booking for. But it STILL took them another half an hour to bring the iron up. How disappointing. The only good thing about this hotel for us was the location, right across from central park and also a great spot if you want to catch the train to the airport. this was a breeze, we rolled our suitcases to 59th street (i think - at the SW corner of central park) and it has elevators here, so you can go down with ease and catch the train to the airport.

There is a starbucks literally underneath it and a few other shops located on the main road from the Subway/Columbus Circle. The Lincoln Centre is on the door step! We found the service to be efficient and very helpful, when we arrived the air con in our room wasnt working properly and this was in the summer, so we were moved to an alternative room immediately. We managed to be in New York the same week as both the earthquake and hurricane (unlucky!!) and the hotel were excellent with advice and guidance etc. There were only 2 negatives, one is the size of the room...I know NYC rooms are small..ive stayed in a few different hotels but for a 4 star i was expecting a little more space, there was barely room for 2 of us to walk either side of the ned, never mind put our suitacases out! Also the same problem with the water in the shower...think this is a serious design flaw. The other reason is the rooftop terrace/pool/bar...I was very confused as guests have direct access to the pool deck (which is fab but as others have said this is a plunge pool NOT a proper pool..its tiny!!), i went up there and could see the hotel Empire sign...however this is not the same place as the evening bar/club and to get to this even guests have to go down to the lobby and then queue and go up in a separate lift to the bar area...I really think they should offer guests some kind of priority/direct access and its one of the major selling points!! Going back to NYC in Sept this year but cant get the Empire for less than \u00a3180 a night so i must have got an excellent deal last year.

For the perfect ' girlfriend' weekend or a quick get a way while catching a show- the Empire Hotel fits pretty darn well! Having stayed there years ago, I recall smallish rooms, some with views that look towards the river and bathrooms that didn't allow exactly spell modern. But they've remodeled(not sure of the year) and the rooms now are soothing and comfortable- albeit a bit small- with modern bathrooms and some luxury touches. Frette towels and sheets, a good comforter and a mattress that allows rest for weary shoppers at days end ... add to the benefits this hotel provides. For Lincoln Center activities, you cannot touch this location and if you wish to shop... whether at Barney's or Bergdorf, the shops at Time Warner Center , this location is tops. It's an easy walk to the Subway- giving you great freedom to zoom around the City ( I made it to Meatpacking and the Lower East Side in about 20 each) but also allows you to stroll through Central Park to enjoy the Met or take a short cab ride to most of the City's most popular attractions. If you are a jogger.. your option other than Central Park, is the fantastic West Side park.. and the smaller boutique style shops of the Upper West Side are just a few blocks away. The lobby is windy with doors that seem to be constantly opening , but the check in and check out process was smooth and friendly. A great Bell Captain ( sorry, cannot recall his name) managed to control of 15 some odd bags of ' shopping treasures' along with our regular totes with a smile! Drinks in the lobby bar and mezzanine area were not as good as we had hoped. The mixologist could use a bit of training , given there are two insanely good bars just a few blocks away were drinks are not only conjured up from incredible imagination, but are truly memorable ( Bar Bolud/ Bolud Sud and Lincoln) . I do however, plan to make The Empire- my NYC home away from home, as it allows me to visit with my UWS friends and connect quickly to the LES where I enjoy the fresh , less corporate feeling shops and restaurants. There is a Starbucks immediately attached to the lobby for those who cannot talk until they have their first cup ( hmmmm) and while there are restaurants who are attached to this hotel, I did not try either. It was snowing the weekend we were there, so the rooftop and it's view- which we heard was pretty fantastic- was not the place to head. There is a ' wait on line' to get in bar scene up there.. but to be honest, I did not have the energy to check that out scene ..after long hours walking the streets of Manhattan trying to help restore the US economy! All in all.. the Empire feels comfortable and the rooms good. I'd love a few more plugs for all the electronic stuff we need to charge and maybe a better place to get a good look at the outfit or makeup.. all things they can add if they'd like. So for an easy location and good space that is a nice blend of luxury, location and amenity.. try the Empire Hotel.

We demanded another room because it was already 3:40 at this point and the man said \"there is nothing else available\" and we'd just have to sit tight. No apology...NOTHING. My husband said he wanted to speak w/ the manager because after overhearing the other woman getting a choice of room, there was clearly another room available.

I was kept waiting for my room for two hours after check-in time with the excuse of, \"It's Fashion Week.\" The hotel was incredibly noisy because, \"It's Fashion Week.\" Room service was slow because \"There are VIP guests because it's Fashion Week.\" I get it--it's Fashion Week. However, if you're so busy because of Fashion Week, maybe don't have rooms still available on a moments notice (after Fashion Week had started, no less) or, perhaps, don't allow bookings from those who (you think) aren't attending Fashion Week? I knew it was Fashion Week before I arrived since (shock) I actually work for a fashion magazine and (double shock) wasn't just there to shop at the suggested Gap and Banana Republic. (Thanks, guy at the front desk, for the super duper awesome suggestions!) Other random things: housekeeping doesn't care if the \"do not disturb\" sign is on the door and will enter anyways; housekeeping also closes the doors when they clean which seems like an enormous security issue to me; my neighbor's room service trays were left in the hallway over 24 hours; there was a chip bag in the toilet when I arrived; the french fries from room service were AMAZING even though the caesar salad was wilted; there's an \"Intimacy Kit\" available for $38 so don't let your kids rifle through the stuff available for purchase sitting on the desk; the windows actually open which might be really pleasant if the weather is nice; free copies of WWD out in the lounge was a really nice touch, though I'm going to assume it was just for Fashion Week; the TV (at least in my room) was whatever the equivelant of terrible definition is; the men working the door are quick, competant and friendly; if you have to wait two hours after check-in for your room, you'll be offered a drink in the lounge....which you will end up paying for yourself; possibly the attitude of the staff is kind of an ambiance thing for people who want that true nobody-cares-about-you city service--perhaps they're supposed to be acting that way! The best part of the Empire is the hotel itself--beautiful and comfortable. I would absolutely suggest getting a suite if one is available and mine was far enough away from everything that it was incredibly quiet despite lots of noise down the hall. Judging from other reviews, I think this is one hotel where it really pays to upgrade if you can. I wouldn't suggest bringing children and I wouldn't suggest coming here if it's your first time to the city or if you're just planning to tourist it up during your stay. If you're uncomfortable with a condescending staff or if you need city guidance, this hotel is also probably not for you. Stay here if you love the area, are comfortable with New York already, need a romantic get away where you won't be leaving the room, or you know, if you're in town for Fashion Week.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Lakes, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cFirst rate experience\u201d", "Author": "Alex H", "ReviewID": "UR124622162", "Content": "from the people to the room to the food and location was excellent.

As I was reading I came upon a great deal that was 130.00 less than I paid through the hotel website. I called the hotel to discuss this and suggested I cancel my reservation with them and rebook through this other internet site. The lady I spoke to on the phone was very nice and said no need, she would adjust it. Very nice and I thanked her. Weeeellllll, when I arrived they charged me the original price and when I explained, the lady at the front desk looked me straight in the eye and said, \"prove it\". I had no proof on me because the lady on the phone had assured me it was no problem at all. She said I could be lying and unless I had proof the price was as is. I didn't want to get in an argument so left but it really bothered me. I was dumbfounded. I have never been talked to like that before in NYC. People are usually so nice.I finally did go back and when the same lady saw me she didn't even say anything and just pointed for me to talk to another guy. I did and explained again and he changed the price within 2 minutes. The whole thing was embarrassing and time consuming. I have stayed in NYC 6-8 times a year for the last 6 years and every other hotel has been really nice. The way the front desk talked to me really took me off guard. Then we get to our tiny drab room. I am use to NY boutique hotels and don't expect a big room so was OK, but the heater was broken(I was relieved to see others mention this) and I know our room was 90 degrees. This was in January 2012. It snowed that night and it felt like it was a sweltering hot summer night. I couldn't find a thermostat so decided to deal with it when we got back from dinner. At 11:00 my husband and daughter went to Sleep No More and I went to relax in the room. It was soooo hot. I called the front desk and they told me to open the heater and turn it down from the inside and if that didn't work to find the extension cord under the unit and unplug it. Well the knob on the inside of the heater didn't work at all so I had to unplug it which sparked and believe it or not it still was putting out a tiny bit of heat. I called to see if I could get a fan and after 1/2 hour a maintenance man showed up looking embarrassed with a tiny plastic fan that was duct taped together. So I put the fan on the bedside table and slept on top of the bed(no top sheet on the bed...yuck). When my husband got in at 3am his first words were, \"whoa it is hot in here!\". Also, if you plan on going to the rooftop bar check ahead of time. There was a private party the night we were there and we couldn't go up. The lobby bar was nice, though. I asked to go up the next morning to take a picture of the sign and was told it didn't open until 5pm no exceptions. The lobby is nice and the location is beautiful but the rooms and service make me never want to go back. It is a hotel I am glad to forget. There are many other better hotels. For the price I like the Ace. No wonder Tablet Hotels doesn't feature them. I was sent a survey on my stay and explained this whole thing and never even heard back. Management probably doesn't really care unless there are good comments. The reason we went to this hotel in the first place is a young film producer we know had worked on a film there and thought it was nice.

We said that we would wait. We went to eat lunch at the restaurant next door. When we came back we were told that the room was not ready yet. We waited in the lobby until about 2:45. Someone came and told us that our room was finally ready and we were thrilled to be able to get in and unpack right away. It was only AFTER we had unpacked our bags that my husband noticed that there was an ashtray and Empire Hotel matches on the desk. And we began to realize that the room was actually on the smoking floor! Thankfully the room had been cleaned very well and did not have that \"smoking floor\" odor. The hallway had been a bit \"musty\" but we had been so anxious to get to our room that we hadn't paid much attention. We had been kept waiting in the lobby for almost 4 hours and then were given the room we had turned down when we first arrived! The manager offered little when I called to complain.

When we arrived at the hotel around 6:00 PM Saturday evening I was taken by the exotic furniture style (simulated tiger skin chairs and odd shaped couches.) At check in I stated when I booked the room I requested a very quiet room as I was a light sleeper; actually I prefer quiet to view. The clerk informed me that the hotel was fully booked and he would see what he could do. The bellhop escorted us to the 11th floor room 1120 the room and bathroom were small. After placing our bags in the room I could hear the sound of loud rap music, people yelling and sharp banging noises. I said to the bellhop could you tell the room over head to quite it down. He stated there no room above you it\u2019s the disco. I immediately called down to the front desk and requested a differnt said I am attending a Broadway play within the hour and when I return I would like to change my room. I was told that the hotel was fully booked and there were no other rooms. My wife and I freshen up and went to the play, when we returned at 11:00Pm that evening I called the front desk and said if the hotel could not provide me with a quite room I plan to checkout. Within minutes I received a call from the night manager and was told there was a seating room with a pull out bed they could give us at a reduced rate. I said that\u2019s unacceptable send up the bellhop it was then that he offered me an up grade at the same rate down the hall to 1115 a large suite with nice size bathroom he insured me the room was very quite and he provided us with a complementary breakfast for our trouble The next morning an hour before we were to leave for the party, I called the front desk requesting they bring up my car I was told it usually takes around 30 to 40 minutes for valley and it will be parked at the front of the hotel the bell Capitan will have your keys. When I went to get my keys an hour later I was told the car had not come up, as it was a very busy day. At the front desk I was told it would be another 15 to 20 minutes actually it took another 30 minutes to get my car and once more the hotel was very accommodating and comp the $60 valet parking fee. It should be noted the $60 charge is for every time you take the car. There is no in- out. Bellhops are friendly but do not rush to open the double set of front doors. You would expect as these doors are very hard to open epically if your carrying luggage.

The 1/2 shower door is bizarre and must cost the hotel a lot in water repairs due to the damage it causes on the floor, which is clearly visible. Nice very white fluffy towels. Bathroom very small.

In fact a friend of mine left her suitcases in the room after she checked out of her room and travelled upstate to Rochester.

Design-wise the hotel is gorgeous, including the rooms. But the shower is a challenge. I want to strangle the designer every time I take a shower. You see, it's all about style w/o substance although there is nice storage in this bathroom. Teak floors in the shower, nice. Rain shower head on the ceiling that drips on my hair, not nice. Men love it. It has a hand held shower wand, dangerous. You have to think in this shower. Positioning yourself is key. My husband the klutz, was taking a shower. I opened the bathroom door and got a blast of water that went all the way into the room. You guessed it, wet hair. They've since installed glass panels which keeps the bathroom somewhat drier. Once you get the hang of the showers, you can enjoy the best neighborhood in NYC. don't eat in the hotel. The food is mediocre and expensive.

Around the corner to Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Ave and the Plaza Hotel. Any direction you choose to walk is right. Only one downside; this hotel is a destination place for clubbing. They have a wonderful roof top lounge. The young and badly dressed line up, for hours, waiting their turn to get up to the roof. It really isn't difficult to get into the hotel if you're staying there but the lobby and bar sees a lot of action. Fun thing is, performers that are playing Lincoln Center stay at the hotel. I met Sting in the lobby. We actually got tickets on the Lincoln Plaza at the last minute for the Sting concert with the London Philharmonics Orchestra. Same for NYC Ballet.

Our room was clean and small but spacious - you couldn't swing a cat in there, but there was enough storage for two people. The only problem we had was that the room was absolutely boiling, like a sauna. As we found out later on, the top two floors are the hottest in the hotel and if we had known at checkin, would have moved rooms. We complained about the temperature and an engineer came to open the window which reduced the temperature, but it was still too hot to sleep in and spend more than five minutes in. Make sure you visit the hotel bar, the sofas are amazing! Make sure you have a taste of the cocktails, they are worth exploring. We ate in the bar a couple of times and were pleased with the standard of food and price which was reasonable. As a tip, don't go to the bar on a Friday or Saturday night as it is very noisy and full of teenagers.

The bathroom sink is very small and was awkward for someone who wears contacts and needs a ledge to set my case and there wasn't one. Overall the room was lovely, very clean and the bed was comfy. The room was a decent size. The only gripe I had was with housekeeping. They forgot to leave us any bath towels, they forgot a flat sheet and so there was just a fitted sheet and cover which was odd, and cold, and the bathrobe that was previously there was taken and not replaced. The staff were nice and the concierge was very popular with guests. The gym was fine. Mostly cardio equipment and some free weights. The gym is on a lower level so it was kind of nice to run and overlook the city. The room service menu was limited and there was nothing for vegans.

I was told we were eligible for an upgrade in room, which was great (not sure why we got that). They put us in a deluxe room on the eighth floor with a view of Lincoln Center. It was spacious and nicely decorated. We had enough room for my boyfriend to sit over in the little seating area and read while I went to bed without too much light keeping me awake. The bed was comfortable. The room was nice and quiet. The real thing you want to know about this hotel is how great the location is if you are planning on attending anything at Lincoln Center. You could throw a rock from the front of the hotel and hit it. We walked from the hotel to the Met in under five minutes. So easy. Also, there is a Starbucks right on the corner\u2014I got our breakfast there and took it back to the room instead of paying room service prices (which, for the record, are about average at the Empire). The southwest end of Central Park is only a couple of blocks away. We walked to MoMA along the edge of the park, which was nice, and then we walked back through the park, which was even nicer (it\u2019s a longish walk to MoMA in case you were wondering). I had a drink in the lobby bar while waiting for my boyfriend to change and get ready for the opera. The wine was good, the atmosphere pleasant, and the bartenders nice.

I also noticed that the General Manager had reached out to everyone who wrote reviews on here. To me that's great service. I actually took the liberty of calling to let them know I was skeptical, and she assured me that we had nothing to worry about and was offered an upgraded room. I would like to break this down for you as simple as possible: 1. It is a 4-5 Star hotel...which means the rooms are going to be smaller! The decor is going to be more modern, and it's going to cost a fortune because of the location. You aren't going to get a huge room! 2. The bed was amazing to sleep on! I had slept so cozy that night! 3. The shower is really nice! As far as the flooding, It has a rain shower head, it's better to shower closer to the shower head rather than stand in front of it...this will avoid the flooding, we didn't have any problems. 4. The air conditioner unit wasn't loud, well we didn't turn it on, but it had a loud dripping noise from time to time. 5. The staff and service was excellent - we do not have any complaints! 6. The only complaint I have, pretty much the only reason i only gave it a 4 was the house keeping - we went back to our rooms around 8:00 take a break from the long day of walking, and House keeping was going around cleaning the rooms, our room got knocked on twice after we said we were fine.

The subway is also just across the street and Central Park is just a short walk. Lobby and hotel itself: It's swanky. The lobby is very impressive and fits the boutique label. The bar was hopping and looked fun, but since I'm pregnant, we didn't partake. Check-in was fine. I asked for a quiet room since I'm a light sleeper and preferably a king or queen bed. Room: We ended up on the 6th floor in a small room with a queen-sized bed. There really was not a view - just saw another building since we were in the back of the property. I understand why the guy who checked us in put us there though - it was quiet. We didn't hear cars honking or traffic sounds, and we were at the very end of the hall. Yes, it was small, but it was perfectly fine for us for 1 night. The bed was awesome, so comfortable! Be aware, if you are allergic to feathers/down, let them know. There was a feather bed, feather pillows, and a down comforter. Fortunately, we're not allergic and I love the softness of down bedding. Linens were high quality. The bathroom is tiny. The sink is poorly designed and placed. It was very challenging to wash my face and even washing my hands was difficult due to the strange design. It looks nice but the functionality is lacking. The bathroom amenities are very nice quality. We had plenty of hot water but the shower pressure was just ok due to the rain-style shower head. Again, it looks good, but not the most functional. Other thoughts: This is an old building. It gives it plenty of charm, but there are also quirks. When the people in the room next to us took a shower, dang, it was loud.

Basically this place has terrible climate and plumbing control, amounting to a huge hassle and disappointment. 1) Our first room was on the 11th (top) floor, and it didn't take long for us to realize it was SWELTERING in there! Despite pawing around for thermostat and other temperature controls, we could not find the control for the heating unit. Upon calling the front desk, we spoke with an engineer who came up to the room and explained that since we were on the top floor, we were getting all the radiant heat from \"all the steam pipes\" above us on the roof. He said there was nothing that could be done, except move us to another floor. Our only other options were the 4th floor (designated \"SMOKING\" - really? in the 21st century?) and the 1st floor. At this point it was midnight and we said the 1st floor would be fine. Schlepping down to Room 107, we unloaded all of our bags and settled in a few hours later for the night... 2) Except, it was awfully hard to settle in with the CONSTANT CLANGING OF THE A/C (yes, A/C) unit throughout the night. It was a distinct metal sound that could be heard loudly throughout the room. It woke us up every hour on the hour throughout the night. Only after getting up and fiddling with the A/C and eventually unplugging the unit were we able to get some rest. (Later, when we mentioned this to the hotel staff, they curiously asked us if we were sure we hadn't been hearing the sound of the \"elevator\" down the hall... um, yes, we know what an elevator sounds like... and it's definitely not he sound of metal clanging inside an A/C unit located approximately 10 inches from your head, thanks to the small size of the rooms!) SO MUCH FOR A GOOD NIGHT'S REST. 3) The next morning, I woke up and hopped into the shower, hoping to stay on schedule to catch our departure at 9:30AM. Strangely, the hot water didn't seem to be coming on in the shower. Fiddled with the dial, changing it at 15-20 degree (out of 360 degree) intervals, but the water only seemed to be cold and colder. After **12** minutes, warm water and eventually hot came out of the spigot... by this time, I was ready to resort to a sponge bath in order to make it out of there on time.

The bathrooms are small, about 7\u2019x7\u2019 with the walk-in shower only half glassed so that when taking a shower it was virtually impossible to not flood the floor with a significant amount of water. The bathrooms had virtually no counter space due to a foo-foo stand-alone sink where you could barely get your hands under the faucet to wash them. Other than that, there were 3 very small shelves, maybe 4-5\u201d deep to store items. The room, as stated in other reviews, was extremely small which creates a variety of problems. There are actually NO DRAWERS TO STORE UNPACKED CLOTHES IN so we basically lived out of our suitcases. There is also an extraordinary small amount of space to hang clothes in\u2026maybe 3 feet wide and I could not actually hang a men\u2019s sport coat without it bunching on the bottom shelf as the space is shared with a refrigerator and a small safe.

As people returned to their rooms in the wee hours of the morning, you could very clearly hear conversations and doors banging shut throughout the night - total misery from a sound level perspective. While we made our reservations two months in advance, we were told that room floors were not guaranteed, but also that we did not want to be too close to the roof as there is a nightclub on the top floor with music and frivolity going on until 2-3 in the morning. Honestly, the three times I was at the front desk doing business \u2013 oh yeah, and they charge for internet access! \u2013 there were several people who appeared to be very upset over room issues ranging from quality to the cost of supplemental charges.

We wanted a Mid-Town New York hotel and this fitted the bill, although it was on the northern end of Mid-Town. Excellent location for Central Park, Bloomingdales and the museum/ galleries on the Upper East Side, but some way north of downtown - a fair walk. The biggest complaint I would have is the room size. We actually paid to have a superior room and although admittedly there were two double beds, the room was tiny with barely any space on one side of each bed and not much in between. The bathroom was even smaller and the frosted glass doors didn't feel as private as they should have - ok for couples but not so good for friends. There was also not very much storage space. The room was very hot - the air con unit was rather old fashioned with no proper temperature control and only seemed to cool the air immediately above it. The bar had also been hyped, but on 3 out of our 4 nights stay, it was hired out privately and therefore inaccessable until much later on. On the plus side, Chris the concierge was excellent. He secured us reservations for a restaurant we should have booked much earlier and also booked us on the Sex and the City tour which was great fun. He was also endlessly enthusiastic about our trip.

If you need a clean and safe place to stay after long days and night out, the EH would be a good option. A lot of Europeans were staying there. The main reason why I wasn't crazy about it has to do with Aesthetics. It is all done in dark, heavy colors (bronze, black) and drapes and animal-print patterns--and I found it oppressive. The lobby could be spectacularly beautiful--but the decor makes it closed and dark. I don't think of this as 'contemporary' but as some throw-back to a brooding interpretation of victorian times with dark velvet and drapes and no lights. I found myself just wanting to get out in the fresh air and openness. I had breakfast there, which was a mistake. The restaurant opened 10 minutes late; the eggs were greasy; they didn't have wheat toast and burnt the white toast. I should have gone to Starbucks around the corner.

Fortunately, while there were a handful of small things that were annoying, my overall experience was quite positive. The good things: The hotel is stylish and contemporary in the areas that count: the lobby and the rooms. Muted tones and surfaces create an atmosphere that is contemporary without being annoyingly trendy. My bed was very comfortable, although the pillows are like almost every other hotel's: excessively floppy and lacking support for side sleepers. The location is outstanding, with Central Park, Lincoln Center, shopping, subways and excellent restaurants no more than a 5-minute walk away (and usually less). The flawed things: There were some layout decisions in my room that made me think someone really didn't think things through. The only electrical outlet by the desk was wedged behind the wall-mounted flat-screen TV, making it incredibly difficult to plug in the adapter for my laptop. With people carrying laptops, phones, cameras, etc. on every trip, it's frankly inexcusable for a hotel not to offer ample electrical outlets by the desk. The shower featured only a half-width glass panel, which would probably be ok if the overhead shower head wasn't located in the exact center of the shower. I encountered a small lake on the bathroom floor after every shower. And there's the previously mentioned pillows. Overall, I was satisfied with my stay here. I slept well, I was conveniently located and I was able to get some work done, even considering the lack of conveniently placed electrical outlets.

The same bell boy offered to store our bags for us while we waited for it to become ready and it did by 1pm. Room- We got a room on the 4th floor facing the main road.

The bathroom had a rainforest showerhead. Housekeeping was impeccable and really quick. We went down one day for breakfast and was back up in an hour and the room was done! Facilities- The hotel housed a really beautiful and luxurious lobby. It's sort of the place that you want to be seen at having a drink or having a meeting. Great sofas and lounge chairs all around. We heard great reviews of the rooftop bar but never had the chance of visiting it. Guests can access it from a seperate elevator guarded by this really tall bouncer.

How wrong we were however, with a very supportive team on front desk , who simply said \"dont worry we will make sure you have the rooms you need for tonight\".

Our rooms were good with excellent en suite facilities, and although they were small were large enough for our needs. Previous reviews were correct in this respect, and for us the biggest drawback was definately the single glazing on the windows which allowed traffic noise to penitrate. We balanced this against the location of the hotel with the small Dante park in front which offers a glimpse of greenery, and keeps the main streets to each side, plus the fact that the Lincoln Centre for performing arts is alongside, and Central Park is just 1 block away. A short walk takes you down Broadway to Times Square and we felt fortunate to have been close enough to have got a glimpse of the New York we wanted to see. We feel this a good location for visitors.

I selected this hotel solely based on proximity to my business meeting, figuring I could manage just about anything for one night. First, the good. I was greeted upon check-in by Helena, who was very friendly and helpful. I was upgraded to a junior suite (I had a king room reserved; the jr suite adds a couch, chair, and coffee table), which I'm glad for, as I can't imagine what the size of a regular room would be given how small the junior suite was - but of course, small room size isn't a big surprise given the nature of the hotel. (The bathroom was also on the small size but very managable.) More plusses: the bed was very comfortable, and the shower had an overhead rain shower head with handheld attachment and great water pressure. Now the bad. Now, I'm a self-admitted hotel snob, but generally if a place is clean, upkept, and modern, I'm fine with it. My room - well, it was literally worn around the edges, which I found somewhat offputting. The dressers, night tables, a side table, and cabinetry in the bathroom were laminated particleboard (not a problem in and of itself) but the laminate was worn down around ALL the edges and made the furniture, etc. look pretty shabby. The caulking in the bathroom was in desperate need of replacement - no mold or the like (thank goodness) but just plain worn and ugly. One of the floor lamps was missing the knob to turn it on - it had just the small post the knob goes on, making it tricky to turn on. Also, there was no bathmat in my bathroom - I had to use a hand towel. Sure I could have called about the last two items, but I was there working and really did not wish to be disturbed. One final point - others have commented on the lack of a coffee maker in the room. This is indeed the case, but there is a Starbucks literally next door to the hotel, so no in-room coffee wasn't so bad. Overall, my experience was ok.

We chose to stay at the Empire Hotel because we thought it looked really cute online. It was an added bonus that after we booked the hotel, we heard that the Kardashians stayed there, too! We booked a standard room with 1 king sized bed because it was almost half the price as a room with 2 queen beds. We arrived before check-in so we asked if it would be possible to check in early. The woman at the front desk said we could check in early if we upgraded our room, which we weren't interested in doing at that time. She said she would call us if our room was available early. We left to walk around and eat lunch, but after a few hours, no one ever called. We came back to the hotel to ask if our room was available - it was (even though no one ever called to notify us). We went up to our room which was TINY... there was no dresser or space to store clothes, and the bathroom resembled something you'd find in a camper or airplane. For this reason, we decided to ask about upgrading to a suite. We called the front desk and the woman said we could upgrade to a suite, but we couldn't see the suite first. This made no sense so we walked down to the front desk. After explaining that this made no sense, we were told that we could in fact look at a suite before deciding whether or not we wanted to upgrade. The upgraded suite was still only equal in size to some of the other rooms we've stayed in in NY, but we decided to pay the fee to upgrade anyway because the standard room seemed unbearable. It takes a lot for us to complain or even submit a review, but ultimately the service is what has caused us to do so. Other complaints: - The hotel doesn't have an ice machine so you have to call Room Service for ice. Be prepared to wait an hour or more, even if you call more than once. - The suite didn't have a dresser or space for clothes, either, so I lived out of my suitcase the entire time. - There was no iron or ironing board but they were available upon request. It wasn't uncommon to see irons and ironing boards just sitting out in the hallway. - Our dirty drinking glasses sat for DAYS on the floor outside of the door to our room. - It's impossible to shower without getting water all over the bathroom floor. - The lamp turned on and off by itself; we couldn't even get it to stay on. - We never even ended up using the rooftop pool or hanging out up there because it really wasn't impressive at all. On our last day, our flight was cancelled so we needed to book another night at a hotel. We ended up staying at the Tribeca Grand and were instantly impressed by how much better the service and the quality of the hotel were.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFirst time in New York, dissapointing stay.\u201d", "Author": "rygry86", "ReviewID": "UR118374034", "Content": "Wasnt that impressed with the room..

Another reason we chose the hotel was because it had a rooftop pool, and as my husband was going to be in meetings for the three days we were there, at the end of May, I figured I'd be using it a lot. Sadly not. Even though it should have been opened by the end of May, the bad spring weather had delayed the pool opening. It opened the day we left. That was a big disappointment. The room we got was small (common in NY), dark, and with the worst view ever - we were in the 'well' directly overlooking and just above all the AC units and piping. The noise level from the ventilation equipment is so loud that you would never open the window even if you wanted to. However, we were at the end of a long hallway, and we never heard a peep from anyone. As a result of that, the darkness of the room, and the 'white noise' from the hotel's equipment, we overslept every morning! The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was big, although rather outdated. The decor was fine. The TV worked. We paid less than $200 a night through one of the online deals that popped up, and for this location it was fine. I am sure if you were paying rack rate you would get a lovely light room overlooking LIncoln Center. Another bonus to this hotel was going across the road to eat at Cafe Boulud for breakfast. One last comment about the hotel - my husband and I used to live in NY so we know about some of the long term residents that still exist in these old buildings. If you're walking down a hallway in this hotel and you see a little old lady sitting in her unfashionable room staring out at you, it's because she still lives in the hotel and has probably lived in it all her life - long before it became a hotel. She probably doesn't have AC, so leaving the door open means she gets to cool off from the AC in the hallway.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and good price\u201d", "Author": "naphhof", "ReviewID": "UR117961173", "Content": "I stayed at the Empire for one night on a business trip.

Our flight was cancelled and we needed an extra 5 nights. We initially moved to a bigger room for an upgrade fee as we were going stir crazy! The superior king is lovely - much bigger bed, lots of space and a bigger bathroom. There was also a view of the Lincoln centre - a much better experience. One thing we were not happy with is that it would cost an extra $100 per night for our original room to stay in the hotel. We couldn't afford it so had to change hotels. Talking to other couples who had also been stranded, it seems that the hotel charged everyone different rates varying from $170 a night to the $300 we were quoted. Some had been upgraded. It was just disappointing to note the inconsistency especially in the circumstances. Overall the hotel was nice, quite trendy, and in a good location.

There were many issues with my stay at the Empire. I had relatively high expectations given the hotel's popularity with the media, but also because my close friend had chosen the Empire as the hotel of choice for her NYC wedding a few years ago. The room I was given was about the size of a cinder block, and had absolutely no view at all. The window looked straight into another room on the opposite end of the hallway, which was awkward. Needless to say, the drapes remained closed the entire time. The bathroom is TINY - no bathtub, just a shower stall, which oddly enough, has no door. L'Occitane toiletries were a nice touch, but I would have appreciated more if the bathroom had been clean. I found a few hairs on the sink upon arrival. Gross. My fianc\u00e9 was on a work trip to Chicago at the same time I was in NYC. He tried to call me in my hotel room five times, and four of those times, the front desk of the hotel did not pick up the phone. The other time, they directed him to the wrong room. (Unfortunately, a friend misplaced my iPhone charger, so my cell was turned off to conserve battery.). Incompetence, anyone? Lastly, I requested a morning wake up call that went ignored.

Reception staff were helpful as was the Concierge who deserves special mention for his advice, assistance and provision of free maps! The hotel is impressive but once you leave the luxurious reception, the rooms leave something to be desired. I booked two Superior Double rooms but although furnished to a high standard, are small and cramped. Other reviewers have commented on the bathroom and shower; I also found it impossible to shower without flooding the floor. I thought the shower door was missing, but no, it just has a gap. A terrible design flaw in any bathroom. If it was designed as a wet-room then fine but it clearly was not. Never mind, a cup of tea or coffee always helps. Not in this hotel I'm sorry. Of all the hotels I have ever stayed in, never have I found there to be no complimentary tea and coffee making facilities being made available. Reception helpfully suggested that we used room service for a wake-up cup of tea. I don't think so at those prices plus tray charges. To the pool, I say pool but some imaginitive photography resulted in the rooftop pool depicted on the website being found to be little more than a small, lane-width trench of water that was freezing! The Cabanas on the roof top terrace are little more than a gazebo with a refrigerator. Not very impressive at all I'm afraid. The approach to the \"pool\" really defined the nature of the luxurious hotel to be sadly deficent on the small touches. On leaving the lift/elevator, you hunt for an innocent door that leads onto a basic concrete staircase that goes up and up, past a tastefully insulated length of pipework onto the roof terrace. The trendy rooftop bar apparently much-loved by the locals, is accessed via a separate lift. I didn't venture to that level but I did wonder if the clientele also had to climb up a similar flight of stairs. Yes, there are queues outside the hotel from patrons wishing to enter the rooftop lounge but I didn't find these to be a problem gaining access to the hotel. I'm sorry to sound so negative, but this hotel should really try to do better for it's guests. Things like the poorly designed shower, cramped rooms and no tea/coffee making facilities let it down badly. I'd rather dispense with the trendy facade for some small touches that help.

The room was visually gorgeous, but that is the only positive thing to say about the Empire Hotel. SERVICE: On Friday August 19th I asked the front desk for an iron and ironing board, it took them over an hour to deliver it to my room making us extremely late to our engagement dinner. On Saturday August 20th we asked for fresh towels, once again it took house keeping over an hour to deliver to our room making us late to our wedding brunch. When arriving at the hotel in the evening we were questioned by bouncers/doormen from the club that shares an entrance \"what guest list you are on\". After we explained we are guests at the hotel the door women offered no appology and simply said \"ok you can go in\". ROOM: Despite the room being visually gorgeous (trendy) it was extremely unpractical. 1. The faucet to the sink is so close to the washing basin that when you wash your hands under the faucet your hands touch the sink basin spraying water every where. 2. The shower comes along with a hose however the hose does not lock in so it does not function as a shower. Additionally there is NO shower door so after each shower there is a flood on the bathroom floor. 3. There is a charge for internet in the room. Checkout: Upon check out (Sunday August 21) I was informed there was a $93 charge made to the room from the lobby bar on Aug 20th. I explained to the gentleman at check out I never charged anything to the room and that that was the day of my wedding and I was not even in the hotel. I was told this would be looked into, however today Saturday August 26th the Empire Hotel charged my credit card $93.00.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNever again....... rude staff....\u201d", "Author": "flababes25", "ReviewID": "UR117201766", "Content": "Great location but really dated small rooms.

I was very hesitant with my stay here because the reviews are so mixed. I was traveling with my elder parents, and worried about the noise issue. I asked for a roll-away bed, but it is not available at this hotel. Therefore, I ended up paying an extra $50 for an upgrade to a room with 2 beds, since bidding on Priceline only gives you a standard room with just 1 bed. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, no free upgrades here! We arrived late on Friday evening, so there was a line of young adults apparently there to go to some nightclub. The lobby was playing loud music, but I asked for a quiet room, and they gave us one on the 3rd floor that faced Broadway. While the view wasn\u2019t great, it was definitely quiet. Unless a group of rowdy people passed through the hallway, we were undisturbed from the noise level. We could hear the sound of the garbage trucks and traffic, but it wasn\u2019t anything that was unmanageable. I am grateful I paid for the upgrade, because as small as the room is with 2 beds, I can\u2019t imagine fitting 3 people in their standard sized rooms. Still, our room was adequate and not as bad as I expected. The bathroom is only big enough for 1 person and very tight. The shower has one of those removable, hand-held shower heads, which makes it very difficult not to splash water on the floor (with the lack of a shower door). However, on my second day, I discovered that there was a shower head on the ceiling, which greatly helps with the splashing problem. There is a lever underneath the shower knob which switches it from the handheld shower head to the ceiling showerhead. If you fail to look up, you might miss it. Knowing about that little lever was very useful. The room had a safe in the closet, and a small fridge. The bed was comfortable. The room overall was adequate. My stay was better than I thought, but this is only because I had such low expectations. I've stayed at better hotels, but I guess it is true that you can't ask for too much in New York while on a budget. My parents liked it though. It gave us what we needed, which was just a place to sleep in a safe, decent area. Don't expect a luxurious, resort-style stay at the Empire. The best convenience is that it is so close to the subway. The station is right across the street. It goes straight into Times Square, and straight down to Battery Park (for the Statue of Liberty ferry) without having to change trains. The line also stops at Grand Central station and Penn Station, so it makes public transit a little easier if you\u2019re not familiar with the area.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Framingham, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience!\u201d", "Author": "jaeger5", "ReviewID": "UR117077403", "Content": "This was our 1st trip to New York and We had a great experience at the Empire Hotel.

Not so. Is clean, is comfortable, is convenient. Of course the basic rooms are small. Rooms are often small in NYC. Are you in town to watch TV? My wife and I were assigned a small room after bidding $200 on PriceLine. Our guest couple received a larger room for the same price. We were offered an upgrade for $80 a night ($100 for a suite) and refused the offer. And enjoyed the quiet. The hotel could be upgraded, and the owners could be less petty. The showers have a half door, so that you tend to spill water out on the floor. Yes, the shower mechanism is a bit odd, but the water is hot, so the only real problem is solved by placing a towel on the floor. The hotel charges for local phone calls and faxes, and unless you are there on business, you'll likely refuse the fee for wifi in favor of the crowded but efficient Starbucks on Broadway. (If you drink coffee, you'll want that Starbucks, as the hotel doesn't have coffee in the room; and I suppose--though am not sure--that the in-house restaurant charges more.) Another annoyance: the hotel doesn't provide free Internet access in the lobby. However, the folks we spoke to were polite and responsive. If you have a car, drop off your passengers at the door, turn right, turn right, and go to the Icon parking lot on 64th street, on the right, after Broadway: at this writing, $40/day including tax, compared to $60/day + tip for the hotel valet. Then, to get the car, stroll down 63rd street for a block and enter the lot from there. The upstairs bar was disco-like and (to us) useless, but you can walk to the theatre district in 25 minutes or less, and there are other choices up and down the west side. The bottom line is this: if you were sent to the Empire Hotel by one of the room vendors such as PriceLine, you've done well, especially if you can avoid the extra charges.

The only other downfall of this property which is important to many travelers is the lack of decent fitness center. I was embarrassed when I took a client down to work out. The equipment looked like something from the 80's and the center was just in an empty sleeping room. It was not well signed to know where to enter. The hotel needs to invest in some updated ellipticals, etc. I had to leave the hotel and take the client to another gym a block behind the hotel to work out. There is a $15 charge to do that.

The pool isn't huge, but hardly as small as a bathtub as some say. Wow I want to see their bathtubs! It was very cold the evening we tried to use it, but my daughter got in and swam around.

The location was perfect and we were able to get last minute seats for War Horse playing at the theatre at Lincoln Center. It was nice to stroll back to the hotel while the rest of the crowd were fighting over taxis. There were two subway stations for different routes about 3 blocks in either direction. There were two movie theatres and several wonderful cafes nearby. We enjoyed great meals at Josephinas, Clarkes, Chowder house and Atlantic Grill.

We were on the 5th Floor and our room was gorgeous. I have stayed in many hotels in Ireland and England and after people saying new york hotel rooms were small ours was great, loads of room to move around. We walked everywhere and it took about 15 mins to times square. We had a great view of the Lincon centre fountain. It was so close to an entrance to central park and the staff were great at getting us a cab. My stay was amazing and the toiletries were really nice, L'octainne. After reading some of the reviews on trip advisor I was really weary about my choice of hotel. But do not listen to the negatives, the staff were great really friendly and the concierge was fantastic got us a reservation for a lovely steakhouse 'The Porter house' in Time warner building..now it was very fancy..and I felt slightly uncomfortable but the food was unbelievable and service was 100% except the two girls that looked me and my partner up and down on arrival. Tickets for the broadway shows are quite expensive and it was too warm to que for them in times sqaure, plus the que was massive. We never got to the pool as you are on the go constantly. We never heard any noise like some of the reviews said. Yes, there is a que at the weekends from locals getting into the roof top bar, it seems really popular. We ate in Ed's chowder house, lovely service and great food. PJ clarkes is right beside and under the hotel..definately go, the food and service is great (BBQ ribs are to die for). The hotel organised a car for are return to the airport, A/C sedan which was lovely. The only improvements I would make would be the drinks are quite expensive, $14 for a glass of wine plus 20% gratuity..but it is expected as the hotel is top class. The airconditioning in the room works but could do with an up grade as it got warm at night.

Perhaps the owners and management will recognize that form over function isn't a good thing when trying to give the illusion of precious space in Manhattan. The piles of attractive decorative pillows with the Empire Hotel logo have to compete with luggage space when one wants to sleep in the beds. The small half-closet with no door with the mini-bar tucked inside left little room for a single carry-on. I can deal with a miniscule Manhattan hotel room, but making it more challenging for guests is mystifying to me. I might have appreciated the lovely Frette linens on the beds had the ancient air conditioner been working. When one is simply lying on top of these linens and sweating into them, the high thread count doesn't make much difference. The hotel did move us after we pointed out that we had to return to the lobby to cool off. Perhaps this was a stroke of good luck as our original room had a dark view of the other buildings on the block and the AC compressors and bags of garbage. While our 2nd room had a lovely view of Broadway, it too featured an incredibly tiny bathroom. Both rooms had shower stalls with a half-panel of glass and no door or curtain, so it was impossible to take a shower without soaking the floor. The square sink was attractive, but turn the faucet over anything more than a trickle and we got splashed. (Aha! Perhaps the piles of decorative pillows were, in fact, large Empire Hotel logo sponges to deal with the overflow problems!) I was surprised to see smoking allowed smoking in the outside bar near the pool.

We arrived at check in at noon therefore our room wasn't ready till 3p.m.. For the inconvenience she offered without me asking an upgrade to a superior room which was very nice of her. This room is considerable bigger than the standard room we stayed in last year and would be worth it for us to stay in next time. The shower area is much larger to comfortably accomodate the two of us, there was a seating area as well. This was an old building reonovated many years ago and sometimes you have to accept that you will find small rooms. There was no iron in the room so you have to call front desk for someone to bring you one. We had an opportunity to use the rooftop pool area for a couple of hours and were fortunate that it was an extremely sunny hot day to enjoy. Such a nice touch in small hotel as this. Bar lounge serves good cocktails however the price of a wine bottle is quite expensive. It's about 30 blocks from TImes Square which you can take the subway which is just around the corner, it's called One Way train, cost 2.50. Columbus Circle is just 2 to 3 blocks away and I found a unique wine store that has the wines organized by country. A store that prides itself on product knowledge, ask them what type of wine you like and your budget and they present you with the best options.

The hotel is very busy, and there are lots of people coming and going. In the evenings lots of guests are coming to the top floor bar which sometimes makes it difficult to use the elevators or ask receptionist for help. As for the rooms - mine was rather comfortable, with two large beds. It was clean, bathroom small but functional. Beds were comfortable which was important for me after lots of walking. The room was situated on 9th floor but the constant noise from the street still reached me. Windows and blinds are not really keeping the noise out. My colleagues' rooms were much smaller and more loud so just make sure that you check the room before signing for it. The staff was extremely helpfull and kind. They managed to change my room after the first night (it was located on 1st floor and I felt like I am in the middle of the street), they also helped to arrange theatre tickets, taxis and we could even take shower in the gym room after morning check out just before the travel. Swimming pool that is on the roof of the hotel offers nice views over the street and the Lincoln Center. However, the pool is so small and shallow that it is rather difficult to swim in, especially if there are kids jumping around.

To say I was shocked is an understatement. The rooms are dated, tacky, and dingy. I.e. stains on the curtains, paint peeling on the walls. Whoever selected the finishes didn\u2019t think about functionality. For example, the shower is a hand held, modern, sleek cylinder. It looks great but the shower spray shoots straight out and not at an angle so you have to hold the shower spray in one hand and bathe with the other. Very annoying. The air conditioning unit is the old floor model type. It is VERY loud so it\u2019s not good for light sleepers, not to mention it pumps cold air very intermittently so it is constantly kicking on and off and your room is rarely a consistent temperture. When I left for a bit, the maid came in and turned the AC off which meant I came back to a hot stuffy room since NY was going through a 7 day heat wave during my stay. The rooms are small and the bathrooms (shower only) are tiny but this didn\u2019t really bother me too much since I\u2019m used to NY standards of real estate. The \u201cview\u201d I had was to an enclosed courtyard and looked right into more rooms. I never even had a top-sheet on the bed. I hope they wash the duvet covers with every guest. I thought the pool deck would at least live up to the photos. Wrong again. The pool is tiny too. It\u2019s approximately 8 feet wide by maybe 30 feet long. The photos make it look much larger. When I went up to the deck the first night, it was closing early (at 5pm) for a private party. When I went up the second night, there were no towels to be had and the water was running right below the jets so water was sputtering the entire time I was there. That also meant water was not being filtered properly and there was a huge slick of sun block floating around. Ga-ross. I didn\u2019t even dip more than my calves in the pool. Another bust considering it was nearly 100 degrees in the city. And finally, the service. Yet again, disappointing. I was checked-in very quickly but when I asked about receiving any frequent flyer miles for my stay I was told she didn\u2019t know if I could get miles and to call an agent. When I went to my room, on almost the very first page of the \u201cWorld Hotels\u201d magazine, it says you can get miles with any of their airline partners. How did an employee of the hotel not know this? When I returned for the evening, my key didn\u2019t work. Only one gal was working the desk so there was of course a line. It took almost 20 minutes to speak to her to get a replacement key. Not how I want to spend my time. I go upstairs to my room and later call for a wake-up call. No answer\u2026after 3 tries. I finally just set my own alarm. It always felt that they were under-staffed, or newly staffed. All around, the Empire fell short in my book. What a bummer.

Secondly, at night the hotel seems more interested in the club being opperated on the upper floor than the guests of the hotel.

I arrived slightly after the check-in of 3 PM and as I entered the lobby I saw an extremely long line with very minimal staff at the front-desk attending to guests. The Concierge stood along side the front desk looking extremely stressed out and doing nothing to assist with the growing line in the lobby. Eventually I was somewhat coldly greeted by Romeo who offered no pleasant conversation, asked how many keys I needed and sent me on my way to my first floor room, room 114. Although I was concerned about the noise I would experience being on the first floor I had a more disturbing issue to deal with awaiting me. I entered my room, dropped my bags glanced around quickly to notice the worn and chipped furniture pieces and general age of the room. I then decided to use the restroom..However, before I could turn on the room light a flash of light against glass caught my eye on the floor of the bathroom...I turned on the light and I simply could not BELIEVE my eyes. In front of the bathtub, trapped by a wine glass on top of an Empire Hotel folder sat a LIVE COCKROACH (I have a photo of exactly how I found this in my room). I promptly dialed the front desk and explained the situation, the person told me to come down to the front desk to get my new keys. I arrived at the lobby, which was now in a complete frenzy, and walked straight back to Romeo who had checked me in originally. He blankly stared at me as I stood there waiting to speak to him (at this point I realized no one from the back office who picked up my call had communicated my issue to the front desk), I proceeded to explain the situation to Romeo in a calm and demure manner so as to not disturb the other quests. Romeo then repeated word for word what I had just said back to me as if he did not hear me properly the first time. He then made new keys and sent me on my way (with barely an apology) to the next \"ROOM of HORROR\", room 721. I entered the sweltering hot room and dropped my bags and then immediately went to tend to the air conditioning unit in the wall that seemed to be quite aged. It was set at max level for coolness, so I waited a bit to see how the temperature in the room would settle. A few hours later while trying to take a nap I decided I had enough of the balmy, humid and uncomfortable temperature in the room as well as the EXTREMELY LOUD noise that was coming from the unit. I called the front desk to express how uncomfortable I was and was told she would send a technician and she could not switch my rooms since the hotel is at capacity. The technician comes in, looks at the unit and says \"oh this is one of the older units, its just going to be the way it sounds when the compressor goes on and off, I will tell the front desk about whats going on up here.\" After he did nothing but offer justification as to why the room was hot and noisy the technician left my room. I called the front desk again and said I would like to leave the hotel as I am no longer comfortable staying here considering all that I have gone through. I would also like a full refund due to the horrific experience and the level with which I was treated. However, Miss Justyna Grochowska (ASSISTANT guest services manager) told me over the phone that the technician told her of the problem with the Air Conditioning and they believe it was functioning normally and she also believes they had provided me with a \"sufficient\" room and would only be able to refund me 50% of the total. Miss Justyna Grochowska never once offered to come to the room to experience what her guest was complaining of nor offered any alternatives to rectify the situation, she remained hidden behind the walls of the front desk. I quickly gathered by belongings and went down to the front desk to check out and take the credit (although insufficient) that was being offered. Again, it seems no one communicated to the front desk team that an unhappy guest would be coming down to check out. While I waited to be taken care of, another guest was complaining to the front desk of the air conditioning in their room...she offered a technician and planned to have two \"Fans\" brought up \"just in case\" Finally Justyna who was no where to be found appeared in front of me to provide her card and said \"OK you're all set\" to which I replied \"I'd like documentation of my refund\" which seemed to thoroughly confuse her. She had someone else at the front desk print it for me and I literally ran out of there as fast as I possibly could. I highly recommend that the Staff at the Empire be trained on how to provide a decent level of customer service to all guests. I also recommend that the credentials of Miss Justyna Grochowska be reviewed in detail, as she does not appear to have the necessary skill-set needed to interact with guests.

My main (and only) complaint about this hotel is the level of noise from the rooftop club. We stayed on the 9th floor and the music from the club was clearly audible in our room at night. Perhaps we were directly under the speakers - the bass thumped loudly through the ceiling and walls all night. On Thursday night, it ended shortly after 1am, so not a major issue for us. On Friday night, however, the rooftop club (like many NYC clubs) is open until 4am. We called the front desk twice to see if they could do anything about it - they said they'd call the club manager but nothing happened. Not really surprised by that, I'm certain the club brings in a ton of revenue and that management is disinclined to ruin the party on behalf of a handful of sleepless guests on the top few floors. But it is really irresponsible to place guests in rooms where the level of noise is this high. I'm fairly well-traveled, and at any hotel you expect a certain level of noise from the hallway, others guests, street noise, sirens, etc (especially in NYC) - but this was way beyond acceptable. Saturday morning we requested to be moved to a different room and the staff kindly took care of that for us. They moved us down a couple floors and the noise problem was completely gone. Aside from the noise issue, the hotel was very nice. Rooms were good size for NYC, comfortable bed, very nice shower, beautiful lobby, nice bar, etc. Daytime staff at the front desk (Romeo) was extremely polite and very helpful. But at the end of the day, the main purpose of a hotel is a place to sleep.

Tiny room, dirty, broken bathroom, treated like a criminal at check-in for using Priceline. I've never received service this bad, even from the DMV or homeland security. If they promise you something (like a room) over the phone, make sure you keep a recording. Background ( Summary: we got the hotel room for a few hours on a Saturday morning. The booking was for the night before. I called them to ensure that this would be acceptable. I should have recorded the call.) We had a rough red-eye coming into JFK at 6AM on a Saturday (the weekend before memorial day weekend), and I wanted to give my in-laws a chance to take a nap. Our hotel didn't have check-in until 4pm, so I went on priceline to get a hotel room for a couple of hours. I got the Empire Hotel, with a reservation for the day before (which would, of course, include that Saturday morning, until checkout). I called upon receiving the reservation to confirm that we could check-in 12 hours late, on Saturday morning, and was told that of course I could, though the person I spoke to seemed to think my couple-of-hour stay was a little weird. I also confirmed that we would have non-smoking rooms (I have an allergy). I thought I was all set, and had assured a few hours of rest... We arrived, totally exhausted, around 9 AM that Saturday (flight delay + traffic). Upon arrival, we were informed that our rooms were no longer available, since we hadn't checked in the day before. When I told them that I had called and made arrangements, the front desk worker asked who I spoke to. I told her that I didn't have the person's name, and from that point forward, was treated like I was trying to pull one over on them, although they had our reservation in their systems. After being told that the worker would have to check with her manager, I asked to speak with that manager. The manager was even less respectful than the clerk, demanding that I produce my priceline confirmation email (again, they had our original reservation still in their system), and proceeding to read through the 3-page terms and conditions on my phone, as though looking for a way out of their committment. Failing that, they put us in a converted broom closet whose floor plan had no more than half a foot between the wall and the bed at any point, save a desk and the bathroom (for reference, the JFK Airport LaQuinta inn's cheapest room was easily double the space). This was after an hour (or 1/3 of our stay, by the time we got there) spend arguing at the front desk. It's acceptable for them to use Priceline to assure occupancy. It's also acceptable for them to treat Priceline customers as second-class citizens. It's totally unacceptable for them to do both at the same time. As for the room itself: I've already mentioned the size. The furnishing were about what you'd expect at this price point, and had clearly been updated within the last decade. My room didn't have a dresser / drawers, but yours probably will. My room had a comibnation half-closet and mini-bar, hopefully yours would have a full closet. The bathroom was pretty dirty (tip to the maids: Sometimes you have to actually scrub the toilet to remove excrement - it didn't take us very long (though it was pretty gross)). The shower was done up to look like a sauna, which was a little weird. The shower apparatus itself was basically broken (It had a lot of sliding parts designed to allow you to adjust it, but it had been broken to the point where it only worked if you turned it away from the person being showered, and held it up in one hand. Combined with low water pressure, this was a tricky manuever (watch out for sharp edges on broken shower parts, too!). The poor bathroom, wooden floor, and sleep deprivation reminded me of the morning after the last night of summer camp, although the bed was nicer (and we didn't have a minibar at camp). We used their valet service, and kept our car there until the next morning. It was pretty efficient and convenient, although if you've got the time, you can some money by just going to a parking garage.

I think they attempted a Euro style shower style that FAILED. Every time I took shower, half the bathroom floor would be drenched in water. When the maid service cleaned the room, they did not even give me more towels. Wifi -- Paying $12.95 is a ripoff. It is completely unreliable. I stayed here 2yrs ago and expected them to improve it. It was unreliable back then, too. Wifi in this day and age should be complementary. Location is great if you want to be in the Upper Westside and close to Columbus Circle and next to the Lincoln Center. It has heavy tourist traffic though. Expect to pay at least $20 in cabfare if you head down to the MPD or Soho.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Little Rock, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cToo many other great hotels in NYC to go back to the Empire Hotel\u201d", "Author": "lovenyc6000", "ReviewID": "UR110373405", "Content": "I thought for awhile before writing this review because I am not the type of person 'who likes to complain for the sake of complaining' but rather a person who uses this site for what it is intended to 'advise' other travelers. If I had booked through a discounted website then indeed I would not be as apt to write but I paid full price for a very disappointing stay. I canceled a reservation at a different hotel and booked the Empire when my son and wife said they could could join me on my stay. Friends had taken us to dinner at Ed's on our last visit and I fell in love with the beautiful lobby and thought the kids would love it. Looking over the reviews I knew the hotel had small rooms so booked the the Deluxe Room King for myself and the Junior Suite King for my son. I was amazed how small the room was and I could not get my suitcase past the bed so left it by the door. The room only had a shower and no tub and yes the shower let water all over the floor. The hotel not have a coffee maker in the room and the hotel forbids one to be brought in. When my son checked in Friday their room was not ready at 3:00 pm so they used my room to get ready. When we came back later that night their room was so hot you had to open windows to tolerate it and surprisingly their room only had a tub but no shower. There was a letter in the room explaining that the lobby and lounge would be closed all day on Saturday for a private event with a list of nearby establishments for quests to use. The reason for booking the hotel was meet to relax and unwind between outings in the lounge area. When I asked about it at the desk the staff sounded surprised and said they must be shooting again leaving me to think that this was not unusual for the hotel to block off the entire lobby except for the check in area and elevators. When I asked why I was not told about this when booking the hotel just a few days ago they said they didn't know why. As a small boutique hotel it is too small to book out the lobby and lounge without impacting the guests. The private party was still going on at 1:30 am. That night the hotel had no hot water so we were unable to take baths or shower. When I called about the problem they said there were working on it but it was not fixed by the time we checked out on Sunday. When I complained at the desk about how disappointed I was with the stay the desk person offered to take 1/2 off of the rooms for Saturday. The problem was when I arrived home the discount did not come through on my credit card and I had to call and have the Director of the Front Office correct the problem. I told her I was also upset that as many times as I spoke to the staff at the front desk that my son was not to receive the bill he had one placed under his door anyway. Kind of giving a gift with the price tag still on. The Front office person was very apologetic and extended an offer to return to the hotel with a discounted rate.off of a future visit. After following the subsequent reviews since my stay I can only say stay at your own risk. It definitely is a hit or miss sort of place and life is too short and money too tight to take a gamble that the hotel will provide what it advertises. We will not be returning even with a discount.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crewe, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location.\u201d", "Author": "Aardvaark52", "ReviewID": "UR110286838", "Content": "Efficient staff and helpful concierge but bar staff unbelievably arrogant and aloof.

My partner and I stayed in the hotel for a week during the Easter week. Since I have read all the reviews on noisy inner rooms due to the venting system, flooding showers, scandalous lobby, rude staff and noise form the rooftop, I wrote an e-mail two weeks before arriving in the hotel specifically requesting a room away from the noise sources listed above and which wouldn\u2019t flood (since I\u2019d read some people\u2019s reviews which said they managed to get reassigned to such better kinds of rooms). They replied a few minutes later saying they would add this special request to my reservation. We arrived very early on Sunday morning so we left our luggage and went out to enjoy the city. We came back at around 3 PM and they assigned us to one of the inner rooms, close to the venting system and with the flooding showers! I couldn\u2019t believe it... We went back to the front desk and the girl was really nice and she reassigned us immediately to another room, but the room happened to be in the exact same area, only three floors below. Consequently, we had to go back with our entire luggage to the front desk, and the lady said there was no special request in our reservation. Since I had the e-mail on my phone, I showed it to her and she called the manager. The manager was polite but not offering much help. He even said all the rooms within the category we\u2019d booked face the venting system to what I replied that if they had told me so when I sent the e-mail, then I would have had the choice to decide whether keeping my reservation or cancelling it. It was not until we approached him again and told him: \u201cOk, we\u2019re very tired, we\u2019ve been waiting for a room for 10 hours, after a 16-hours flight (with connections) give us whatever you have\u201d that he reacted and placed us in a new room. I must admit it was very nice of him to upgrade us to a better room located in the 10th floor. The room was still a little noisy because of the venting system and my partner noticed the reason was the apparatus was missing; there was a hole in the wall. The following morning they must have come and put the machine because when we arrived the noise was gone. Regarding the other most-read complains, (i) the music in the lobby was cool, not loud at all. There was a great atmosphere in the lobby, as if you were in cool club. The lobby is amazingly beautiful and the bartenders are really good doing cocktails. (ii) Despite we were in the 10th room we didn\u2019t hear any noise from the rooftop. (iii) All the staff was very polite and nice, the room was great and clean (despite some of the deco was really avant-garde, some was kind of over the top), the bed was extra comfortable and the shower was lovable. L\u2019Occitane products are a plus, and I loved to see they had Argentine Malbec in the minibar (despite I didn\u2019t have any). There\u2019s a great view at the rooftop and it\u2019s worth going for a drink. The location of the hotel is great, just across Lincoln Center with access to the subway. One experience you should not miss while in NY is renting a bike to ride around Central Park, you can do so in Columbus Circle, just 3 blocks away from the hotel. So, despite the little misunderstanding at the beginning, our overall experience at the Empire Hotel was great, I would totally recommend it.

I thought the receptionist was kind of difficult. At a certain point we thought we had to find another hotel for the other two nights... It's not professional to blame someone else (booking.com) for problems and to tell your guest it's not your fault. Professionally you should just have a look at the confirmation and solve the problem instead of waisting time on blaming another. Another guest checking in at the same time booked a special room through his travel agent and not being able to give him that room, it was the fault of the travel agent. Very unprofessional. We asked for quiet rooms and rooms together, but as we checked this during check in, the rooms still needed to be assigned ('oh, i can do that for you') so we were on the same floor. This having booked in Octobre i thought was not professional. They clearly do not keep any comments on the reservation in mind. All standard rooms have a buzzing sound coming from the airconditioning due to the location (inner courtyard) . It's a really present sound, quite loud. If you book, you should book a superior room (but there are some that overlook this inner courtyard as well). If you take these improfessional issues away, and you don't have problems to sleep with noise, you will be ok in this hotel. The room facilities are good: a small but nice bathroom, very good beds, beautiful design. The rooftop terrace is excellent when weather allowes, very nice view and friendly and efficient service. Next to this, the location of the hotel is very good, only a 15 minute walk from Times Square, with a lot of shops and restaurants on the way. The Starbucks on the corner is a plus to have breakfast or coffee. There are always taxis outside and the Columbus Circle subway is only a 3 minute walk.

It is an ideal location for a visitor - very convenient to shopping and restaurants and easy access to transportation. However, the hotel is not well managed and is challenged to offer even the basic accomodations. It has been removated with a hip look but the upgrade is all superficial. The lobby is dark, cramped, and uncomfortable. The staff at the front desk seem disorganized and distracted. The night my son and I arrived at the hotel at 5:30pm the small lobby was overwhelmed with guests and luggage. The line was long to check in. I could hear the angry tone from many other guests so I wasn't surprised that I was told that my room was not ready. I was told that it would be another 30 minutes to an hour before the maids could get a room cleaned for us. I was offered a larger room for an upgrade fee of $50 but it was a smoking room so that was not an option for me. Instead we stored our luggage and went for a walk even though we had been up since 5 am and we were exhausted. About an hour later I tried to check in again and was told that no rooms were available - same song second verse. I was unhappy but decided there wasn't much I could do about it . So we went to dinner without being able to freshen up. By 9 pm when I finally got to the front of the line for the third time, I threw a fit when I was told that the cleaning staff was still working on a room. Because I was so irate, they finally put us in a room. The room was supposed to be two queen beds. There is no way those beds were queen. More like a twin and a half or very small doubles. The linens were nice and the tv was fine - the decor was updated. Room extremely small but that doesn't bother me so that wasn't an issue. The issue ws that the room is just not comfortable at all. There was no ac to speak of. The room was extremely hot and there was no temperature control. I called housekeeping who told me that I had to lift up a grate on the unitl and there would be some buttons to turn the fan to high or low. I managed to get some air circulating but it was far from satisfactory and I centainly would have expected that to have been updated during the renovation. The bathroom is modern and stylish but so small that it is not luxiorous at all. To top it off, we had absolutely no hot water. When I called to complain they had obviously heard that complaint before and there was nothing they could do. I was on the third floor and it was extremely loud all night. The noise from the street is not that bad - it's the city after all so that is to be expected. But since they were still celaning rooms late into the night the housekeeping noises were unbearable - carts clashing - loud voices in the hall. A maid unlocked our door and attempted to come in our room twice. I was glad to be checking out after one very disappointing night in this hotel. By the way, scrutinize your bill.

The staff were superb (special mention to the excellent bar tender who was friendly, good with guests and also very informative about where to go). The rooftop bar was absolutely amazing with brilliant views up Broadway, felt like we were in a movie! The decor throughout the hotel was modern and tasteful. Now the not so good stuff! The room was small with little room to put cases etc. The bathroom was also on the small side but I guess thats understandable for Manhattan. Our main gripe was the noise. I know that there are no quiet rooms in Manhattan but you at least expect there to be a noticeable reduction in noise when you close the window! Added to that was the fact that the walls were paper thin. We could clearly hear people talking normally in all surrounding rooms! It felt like we were in a dorm at times. Some sound proofing is definitely needed. Special noise note to the housekeeping staff as well. From about 7:30am we were woken by a constant banging of room doors as staff went in and out of rooms. The doors do not have overhead door closers which would stop them from banging.

I booked through BookIt.com for the first time and was asked how trusting I was. I thought it was a strange question but I answered the agent by telling him that I was pretty trusting. He proceeded to tell me that he had a great deal on a very nice hotel but that I would not find out the name of the hotel until after my booking was complete. I was fine with that in general as I have used HOTWIRE.COM in the past but never for a NYC stay, I prefer to know where I will be staying in New York.. I went with it and booked 4 nights at what turned out to be THE EMPIRE HOTEL for less that what I have paid for 1 night at the RItz Carlton Central Park. I had never heard of the hotel so I read many online reviews, some good, some not so good. Because I know that there are people who complain just for the sake of complaining, I read reviews but take them for what they are....just someone elses opinion. And on this one, I am sooooooo glad that I did not let the not so good reviews sway me. . Our stay here was fabulous from the time we arrived by taxi, to the time that we left by taxi. The staff was beyond accommodating. Upon arrival the Doorman removed all of our bags, baby stuff, stroller etc. from the trunk before we were even out of the taxi and escorted us into the hotel lobby which is quite chic, modern and classy . Check in was pleasant and very smooth and we were even upgraded thanks to Mr. Chatham who prior to our arrival helped to resolve an issue that arose through no fault of The Empire Hotel. The arrangement of apples at the front desk is quite welcoming, but even more importantly the apples are absolutely delicious. A very nice touch. When we walked into our room my 4 years old said \" I love this new house!!!\". And that is just what it was for the next 4 days, it was like our home, maybe even better because I did not have to do any cooking or laundry. We had a lovely view of Columbus which my 4 year old was fascinated by. He made it his job to open the curtains and raise the blinds each morning. Housekeeping did a fantastic job with our room every day. Our room was clean every evening when we returned. There were always fresh towels and soap. There were even nice fluffy bathrobes and slippers in our room. I am really not sure why reviewers have so much to say about the shower, it was not an issue at all. The toiletries, which I usually don't use because I have my own personal favorites, are now my new favorites!!! Love, love, love them. The beds and pillows are heavenly. We had no problem with noise as some of the reviews mentionsed, we were in room 515. The location of The Empire Hotel just can't be beat. It is in close proximity to everything either by train or on foot. Yet you almost feel like a resident when you walk down 63rd. I actually bought fresh fruit every day at a fruit cart down the street. 7 bananas for $1, 16 ounces of strawberries for $1.50. A pint of blueberries for $1.50. This made me very, very happy!!! There is also a WHOLE FOODS store very close by. Central Park is just a short walk away. There are so many things that made our stay here an awesome one. We really would have loved to stay much longer. When it was time for us to head home, check out was just as smooth as our check in. My 4 year old had to take just one more apple for the road. And again , a Doorman was right there to assist with all of our stuff. He even held my 1 year old baby girl while I folded my stroller. The Empire Hotel is now my favorite NYC hotel for all of the reasons mentioned and many many more. We will definitely be back....and hopefully very soon.

Tried to turn it off, unplug it, turn on AC, nothing worked. So we opened the window over Broadway and the room cooled off. Of course when we returned to the room the next night, housekeeping had shut the window and the room once again was a sauna. Now for the positives. Overall excellent hotel in a great location. Rest of staff were pleasant and helpful. Never made it to the rooftop, but appears very popular so you never have to leave the hotel for a nightlife. Rooms were nice, and I have to disagree with the comments on the decor. Its not outstanding but they did an excellent job making it cozy and elegant enough for the space provided. I've seen much worse and much more garish. My only complaint was the comfort of some of the furniture in bar area. So again pleasantly surprised. And for the money excellent value. I'd actually highly recommend except for the first impression provided by that arrogant kid at the front desk. I see negative comments on the shower. Its a rain head with no door.

I generally stay at the Waldorf or the Essex House when in NY, but the Essex was full, and all the bedbug talk surrounding the Waldorf in recent months had me spooked. I initially booked The Empire through Jetsetter, a trusted hotel source, but was alarmed when I started reading some of the negative reviews on TripAdvisor regarding the noise level and service at the hotel. I emailed Don Chatham in Guest Relations and explained my concerns. He promptly emailed me back with the assurance that our stay would be comfortable and pleasant in every way. And it absolutely was! The location of the hotel is perfect -- right beside Lincoln Centre, and short walking distance to Columbus Circle, Central Park, and the Metro -- it was a cinch to get anywhere we needed to go in the city. (And the very personable doormen were always quick to hail a cab if needed.) The recent renovations at the hotel are well done; it has a chic and trendy vibe, but retains a feeling of comfort and warmth. I never noticed that the atmosphere was too \"clubby\", as some reviewers have mentioned, and at no point were we able to hear any noise from the nightclub in our room. And, speaking of the room, I have to say that it was one of the most spacious I've seen in New York, with comfy beds, Frette sheets, and L'Occitane toiletries. The housekeeping staff were exemplary, and our room was kept clean, tidy, and restocked the entire week. All in all, a very good value for the money.

However, our room on the 10th floor (which is 2 floors below the rooftop nightclub) was vibrating from the bass beat of the club until 4am. I got no sleep. Upon calling the front desk to see if we could get a room change the night manager Erik told me they were sold out but he would call the club to ask them to turn down the volume and send up a pair of earplugs. Really? of course the club did not adjust the volume at all, and the earplugs never arrived. Also, our bathroom was laughably small. It literally fit a walk-in shower, commode, and tiny sink that was facing a wall - you could not stand in front of the sink as there was only about 3 inches between the front of the sink and the wall. You have to stand in front of the toilet and lean over in order to see yourself in the mirror. Makes it difficult to do hair or makeup. Lastly, teh room was too hot. It is Feb and we had to turn the AC on high all night, which resulted in a tolerable temperature, but not even cool. We had relatives staying in a double room on the 8th floor, and while they couldn't hear the club from that floor, their room was also a toaster. Bottom line is this is not a hotel that worries about its guests returning by providing good customer service.

This was a surprise trip for my partners 30th birthday. Months before we arrived at the hotel i emailed them to ask if there was anything they offered on arrival as a special touch as it was a special holiday, a few weeks later i had no reply from them so forwarded the email again saying i would appreciate if someone could acknowledge my email and return an answer- still no reply! When we arrived at the hotel nothing was mentioned about my emails and we were allocated our room which was a bit on the small side but nice enough and clean. The only problem was when you had a shower there wasn't a full door on it just a glass covering where the shower head was so each time you had a shower the bathroom floor would flood! I should of reported this but as i'm quite laid back i didn't want to make an issue of it. The absolutely worst thing about the hotel are the rude front desk staff. We were only staying with the Empire on room only basis so didn't have much to do with them, but the few occassions we needed them they were awful. On one occassion we needed to speak with concierge, she wasn't at her desk so i asked another guy behind the desk where she was. He snapped shes on a break, i asked if he knew when she would be back, and he screamed i don't know maybe 15 - 20mins then just shouted can i help the next in line! Not can i help with anything or take a message so she can get back to you. Another horrible experience was when i needed to change some travellers cheques, the lady behind the desk said sure thats fine you need to sign them and show me your passport. I did this then she disappeared and came back with the manager who told me i needed to re sign, i questioned this as i had already signed and she said, yes you've actually sign in the wrong place, if you don't re sign you don't get your money so signature please! I think some serious lessons in customer service is badly needed here. The only positive thing about this hotel is the location. I've come away bitterly disappointed with the service i received.

Not even one to sop up the water that sprayed all over the floor/wall/belongings while showering in the doorless shower stall. A \"chic\" design gone very wrong. Everything gets soaked and there aren't enough towels to wipe up mess. And It's a handheld shower, you must contort yourself into extremely awkward positions so water doesn't spay out. I can't imagine a less fulfilling shower experience--except possibly in prison? Bed was comfy, though there was NO top sheet-- just a comforter-- which rather creeped me out, as i hoped desperately that they change it with each new guest.

The shelves in the bathroom were nice but a sink more than 4 inches deep would have been useful. Also, the sink and fixtures were so trendy that you couldn't fit your hands under the faucet to wash them! It was ridiculous-clearly whoever designed the bathroom had never actually used one! Our room also did not have a closet, more of a recess in the wall. In addition, the floor and walls of the bathroom showed that the materials used in the revamp were cheap and falling apart.

In general, the hotel is well located, clean and good value, but with a few strange particularities: Room - as stated by others, my room was so small that you could barely walk in it. There was barely any closet space, and the 1 door shower, also referred by other reviewers, is ridiculous to say the least. The had to give me double towels every day so I could mop up the floor! Otherwise, the rooms are beautifully furnished, with a great bed and tv. One last point is that we were unable to control the heating, which resulted in a room so warm we had to open the window (it was freezing outside) so we could sleep Service - service was always very courtious, especially the concierge (I'm sorry but I cannot remember her name) who on various occasions assisted us with tickets and dinner reservations. The housekeeping was somewhat erratic however, always forgetting to leave someting, either towel, or toiletries, or bath robe. Furthermore, we lost one night stay due to the Christmas snow storm and hope to be someway comped. But as it was an advanced purchase, this was understandibly, albeit disappointingly refused. Others - there is a great/ trendy rooftop bar, however it is \"not part\" of the hotel and although you are a guest may be charged a cover charge. I was actually not, and had a nice drink (expensive but not different to any other bar). It is worth a go if you want a drink and do not want to go all the way to SoHo or the Meatpacking District. Value - this was one of the main thing that made us choose this hotel as we got 6 nights in a 4 star double at inder 200$ a night during New Years week. If you find and opportunity like that, don't hesitate to book it. If it's double that, there may be nicer options. the alternatives I found were 2 stars for the same price...

Nevertheless, the design of the bedroom is more on a boutique contemporary level with spa design bathrooms. The major flaw about the bathroom is that the shower only has one door. That's right, one door! Therefore when you take a shower water will spill out and wet the floor. I made a complaint about this issue to the front desk and they said that it was the vision of the desiger to have one door and since they are getting a lot of complaints from customers that they are in the process of changing the design. Next thing on the list is when my girlfriend was brushing her teeth, brown water started to come out of the faucet every 30-40 seconds. The front desk sent their maintenance guy to our room and he told me that it was perfectly normal due to the building having old pipes. This is an issue they need to resolve instead of just trying to move guess to a different room. Last issue on our list was housekeeping. For the most part they cleaned the room as any good hotel would but for some reason everynight they would either not replace our face towels, the large bath drying towels, or the rug for the shower. Each niight after coming back to our room I had to call the front desk to get a new set of towels because housekeeping would not replace the old ones they took.

Walking uptown from 63rd West takes you to a plethora of trendy shops, cafes, bars and restaurants where as walking downtown to about 52nd street is where Times Square begins. There is a Starbucks literally around the corner for a wake-up coffee but saying that there is a Starbucks around every corner in the city. Overall, it was a good trip. I dealt with the staff in the hotel as little as I could and was only in the room to sleep and shower. I will definitely visit New York again and will probably stay more in the heart of the action near Times Square. Regrettably, I cannot reccomend this hotel; you will find cheaper and friendlier all over the city.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMystery Hotel\u201d", "Author": "slovakianchic", "ReviewID": "UR90612553", "Content": "I decided to try out the Empire Hotel in the upper westside of New York city.

Rather than telling a long and drawn out story, I'll get to the point: The item was never found, and I'm very obviously very disappointed. It's quite unacceptable for things to go missing from guest rooms, and for them to not be recovered. There are only 3 possibilities of how the item left the room: (1) item was accidentally sent in the laundry. [oops, mistakes happen] (2) item was thrown out [negligence] (3) item was stolen [criminal] If it were #1, which I was hoping for for everyone's sake, it would have turned up in the hotel's \"efforts\" to recover the item. So it must be #2 or #3 which are both infuriating and a really big problem if that happens in this hotel. I stay in hotels 3-4 nights a week for work (about 200 nights a year) and have never had this happen before. Remarkable. If anyone if curious what the hotel offered as a \"sorry\"? A complimentary upgrade the next time I paid to stay there. Since no one ever called me back or replied to my email since [2 weeks+], as they promised they would, I'll give you my answer to your offer on TripAdvisor: That's insulting, no thanks.

Our room was no smaller than the usual hotel room in Manhatten just much better decorated and the bathroom was gorgeous - who cares that its not practical if you're only there a few days?! We were there for the 1st part of our honeymoon and were relieved after reading a very concerning review that a surprise hamper our friends had arranged was in fact waiting for us in our room and because of this reception were aware it was our honeymoon and congratulated us - so hopefully the hotel have taken note of the poor reviews from others and things have improved greatly. Loved it - would definitely go there again and recommend it to our friends", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cAwesome lobby, small but nice rooms, ridiculously small swimming pool\u201d", "Author": "Caro37", "ReviewID": "UR80367743", "Content": "The photos for this hotel were done by a brilliant photographer who must have been something of a gymnast to get his angles for the swimming pool!

The rooms were very small with very little storage space and the shower was a ridiculous affair - it looked swanky - a wooden deck with a rainhead and no door - but it poured water all over the floor. I felt so bad for the housemaids that I would spend a good ten minutes every day cleaning up the deluge on the floors after our family of 4 had showered! This is however, a great hotel for location if you can get the price reduction we did through Priceline - it was an absolute bargain. It is dead opposite the Lincoln Center complex, near Colombus Circle and two blocks from Central Park. The bus which takes you all the way down to where the Statten Island Ferry (a good 40 minute ride for only $2) can be picked up, leaves from right outside the hotel, stopping at every good destination along the way (Get your Metrocard which gives you 4 journeys for $8!). Staff were ok, but a little too aware of their Hotel's trendy status (the US Open was about to start and the hotel's nightclub was the venue for it!). The major complaint was that we were put in a room on the 11th floor initially and when we returned from having a meal out, it sounded like we had a nightclub in our room - obviously no good for us as parents with young kids in tow! Having said that, I went downstairs to ask to be moved and the young lady who sorted it out did it with much aplomb and was super efficient - within 30 minutes we had unpacked and were settled into a room on the 8th floor - where there was no noise except that from the streets as you would expect in New York.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smithtown, New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent weekend!\u201d", "Author": "traveler24NewYork", "ReviewID": "UR80131373", "Content": "From the moment we entered the hotel until we checked out... the hotel was on the top of their game.

We got the rooms from a price-bidding site, and was surprised to get a 4-star hotel at USD150 per night. However, we become apprehensively when we read some of the reviews. Hence, we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the room that we got. My party is a group of 5 adults and 2 young boys, and the single queen bedroom allocated to us was not big enough. So, we paid USD30 more per nite per room for a 2-queen bed suite. The rooms are big for a NYC hotel, and much better than what we had when we were in San Francisco. There's free wi-fi, free use of a mini-fridge, and a safe. No coffee making machine, but that's OK. I'm not sure why some people are unhappy about the room size, as I've had worse in DC, for a much higher priced room in a branded chain hotel. The rooms are very nicely done, and comfortable. The bathroom is small, but honestly, it's sufficient. The hotel sacrificed functionality of the basin for aesthetics, but that's fine. The air-con is old and noisy. No insulation from street noise, so it was difficult to sleep in late with all the noise. Parking is very expensive, at USD60/day with no in/out facility. After the 1st day, I parked my car just 2 streets south, at 61st street using Icon parking, for USD35/day. Made no sense to drive around NYC, as parking is expensive. Metro is at 58th st-Columbus circle. There's a Whole Foods supermarket near the Metro, and we got milk, juice, bread and snacks as breakfast was not included. Central Park is 2 streets away, and Natural History Museum is just 1 mile walk away, which was a nice walk in the morning. Lots of cheap eating places within half mile south of the hotel.

The bedrooms are clean, bathrooms are nice. Though some folks don't like the one door shower stand style (with a towel placed on the floor the water doesn't spill that much) - also beware of a small switch under the shower lever, which switches between the rainforest showerhead in the ceiling and the handheld shower. The other thing - there is no hot water in the room (so if you like to make your own tea - you are out of luck), but they gave me a cup of hot water in the bar downstairs free of charge!

Both my boyfriend and I have college degrees (his in mechanical engineering) and it took us well over 5 minutes to figure out how to use the shower and to figure out there was no door to close the shower resulting in a watery pool on our bathroom floor. 4) The hotel is very chic.. definitely catering to the party crowd in NYC.. the hotel staff while nice and pleasant was young and not very experienced. When checking in they asked me if their hotel was better than the hotel we were moving from. I thought this was rather childish. 5) We could not check in earlier than 3pm so we had to leave our bags there to go to our event in Central Park. 6) Very nice views from our room and seemed quiet despite all the party people showing up to attend the pool party on the roof.

Nice bathroom. Large TV and iPod radio. Could do with a Tea / Coffee machine though. 3) The starbucks downstairs is useful, especially as there is no coffee / tea in the room. Also a pharmacy. 4) Some nice restaurants nearby. Cons: 1) They were filming an episode of Gossip Girl whilst we were staying there. This meant that the pool was closed for the whole duration of our trip (3-4 days), and also the bar was closed for one day. There was no warning of this and no compensation for these facilities not being available (although they offered to pay to use the public swimming pool down the road, this is not really the same). Also, as part of the filming, we were questioned as to 'what we were doing' or told to be quiet or hurry up, when we were trying to get to our room or move around the hotel! 2) The staff varied greatly. Although some were polite, others were dismissive and even rude (including one of the managers). They seemed to have an attitude of 'there is nothing we can do', 'its not our problem', or 'the hotel is not responsible'. These were the answers given to the filming, and also when the internet stole our money and didnt work. 3) The bars and room service are quite expensive. $10 a drink in the bar. $20 for breakfast. 4) The bar can be quite noisy. We stayed on the 11th floor, and you could hear music and footsteps from the bar above. Other comments: The rooftop bar was quite nice and trendy. There did not seem to be too many queues whilst we were there, but we didnt stay on a saturday. Cannot comment on the rooftop pool as we didnt see it. Free wireless internet.

It was fantastic. The crew could not do enough for you. We stayed at The Empire Hotel in New York City. It was beautifully done out in zebra prints and chocolate browns and orange colourways. Our room wasnt large but we only ever slept there anyway. However it did overlook broadway. It had a lovely dining area on the roof (We only ever went up for breakfast and a late night drink). We were recommended the hotel by the british airways staff who we booked our tickets through. It just so happened that this lady had been to new york and had stayed there herself. Recomendation is everything. Because of its location, so close to central park and fifth avenue it was great for sight seeing. On the corner of central park (3-5 minutes walk) you can get on a tour bus. I dont know what they charge this year but it was around $10 to $12 per person a ticket. This will take you either end of manhatten island, you just choose which way you want to go, north or south. The best thing about this is that you can get off and back on again at any of the bus stops so you can get to sight see and not have to buy another ticket as it lasts all day. We did not realise this until the last day when we decided to do a tour, so if you want to see the island, go hopping on and off of the buses, its great. The weather in september was around 23 - 25 so just right.

We had a double double on the top floor and elder son plus girlfriend were three floors below. Bearing in mind that it's New York, and rooms are pricey and small, we were happy with what we got. Everything was modern and spotlessly clean, and we got a nice view towards the Lincoln Center. First the drawbacks - the pool isn't as nice as the photos would suggest. they have worked miracles on the angles, because it's small. We were keen to have a pool to keep the 10 year-old happy, but in hindsight this is a small rooftop plunge pool for the trendy crowd to gather around, rather than a pool suitable for kids (or even for swimming, really). Our only other grumble would be that the lounge and bar were so achingly chic that we felt out of place, and the food prices were so astronomical that we didn't even contemplate eating in - about 20USD per person for breakfast, and snacks were 15USD. On the positive side, we found the door and reception staff courteous, the room cleaning excellent, and all the communal areas well maintained. The location, just a block from Central Park, was excellent especially given the 100-degree heat.

On a positive note though, the consierge (a chap whose name i unfortunately did not get) was amazingly knowledgable, and found us a hair salon that was brilliant and about a quarter of the price of their own salon. On the day of the wedding we were waiting for our transport outside the hotel to take us to the bataux for a dinner cruise (which you should definately do whilst in NYC as it was amazing) and a member of staff came to talk to us and on returning we had champagne and strawberrys and rose petals on our bed, which was very nice.

We had used priceline for this hotel and got the room on the second floor for $120/night which is an amazing deal when their rooms usually go for about $299/night. When we arrived there the bellhop was very courteous and helpful and took all our stuff to our rooms. The room was big enough to put two bike bags and two bigger pieces of luggage (with a bit of room to move around them) which was perfectly fine. The room was beautiful and the bed was a little big higher than average for comfort. There was a shower only and no way to close it so even if we put towels on the floor it still got soaked. The prices for our little fridge bar and anything else was very expensive (but expected from a hotel like this). Also nice though becuase you could take everything out and use the fridge. The service is probably the worse part of this hotel esp if you have sports event to wake up to at 330am. The night before triathlon we did not put up our don't disturb signs but we also didn't have a sign that says service please (which is part our fault for this part of our stay). So while we were lying there we keep on hearing \"tap tap tap\"...made it very hard to go to sleep (we also found out it was the turn down service...which knocked on our door at 11pm the night before the triathlon...I wasn't happy but I forgot the sign so I couldn't complain too much). Either way though it is hard to sleep because of the \"tap tap tap\" that you hear every night for \"turn down service\". The maids that clean your room are very prompt and replace everything from towels to your shampoo, etc (which unless you're a person who is environmentaly friendly and don't like to waste things...that service should be perfect). I would almost have to say that the only nice person and helpful person that worked there was the bellhop. The hotel is overcrowded on most nights esp Friday and Saturday because they have a rooftop bar which is not exclusive to hotel guests (there is a dress code of dress shirt and nice shoes so don't accidentally go there (thinking it's the pool and thinking you'll relax from the heat of NYC) in your runners and a nice pair of shorts because you'll get a look of distain from the \"security gaurds\" that makes you feel very very small and insignificant. The pool was harder to find and on the way up to it you think you're going the wrong way due to going up stairs that look like it was part of a custodians closet in a dingy hotel. When you find the pool you'll find it very laughable when you realize that the photos from online are very misleading as it has not cut off any part of the pool....the pool (I refer to as a tub) is maybe about 6 feet wide (that would be pushing it) and not that long (the pool in my condo is almost four times bigger). The location, however, is amazing. You are close to two subway entrances and walking distance to almost everything (the subway entrances connect to the trains that go straight to most of the popular sights without having to transfer too much or at all in some cases). Two blocks away from Central Park, there are really good deli's around too and if you or anyone else on your trip feels sick the pharmacy is right around the corner (literally). Liked Best: -location -aesthetically pleasing -free internet Liked Least: -service and at what hour \"turn down service comes\" -\"pool\"..or tub as I refer to it as -crowded with non hotel guests going to the rooftop bar upstairs on weekends -unfriendly atmosphere (exception of very helpful bellhop) Side Note: Would upload photos I took of this hotel but I didn't take any I was that unimpressed with service (I liked the hotel that Delta Airlines put us up in better in Minneapolis and that was a $49/night hotel).", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans", "Title": "\u201cBring your earplugs\u201d", "Author": "greenturtle53", "ReviewID": "UR72516446", "Content": "This is a nice hotel with good customer service.

After a long flight the last thing that you need is aggrevation on checking in to your hotel. The public rooms were beautifully furnished and impressive as was our small but spotlessly clean and well presented room. The airconditioning was noisy -constantly switching on and off throughout the night. I have advised the hotel when booking and on checking in that we were part of a wedding party but it was not until after the wedding, when 13 of us we were waiting for a limo to take us to The Bateau that a Manager asked if we were staying there. When we arrived back, champagne, roses and strawberries were waiting for the newly weds. A nice touch but a friendly word at reception on arrival would also have ben nice.

I accepted this but was surprised that notices were put under the door informing us that the pool area was to be shut the following day for a private party. This happened twice out of the four days. I can only say that if you book this hotel expecting to spend a little time around the tiny plunge pool after a hard day in NY think again.

CONS: The common element of all my worst experiences as a business traveler lately is the same: an in-room IPOD docking station. My room was incredibly small AND uncomfortable. Don\u2019t need much, but when the bathroom door doesn\u2019t fully open because it hits the toilet, and there is barely any room to move, you know you are in serious trouble. Perhaps there are larger rooms; I certainly did not get one of them. The shower sliding door in room 1102 was missing a half (or was that on purpose?) so water spilled into floor while you are showering. Outlets were a tough find and work desk space was minimal. There was very little room in bathroom to place toiletries, etc. Noisy old school air conditioner never fully cooled the small room, but it was never unbearable. Needless to say I did not have a good night sleep either night I was there even though the bed, linens, and pillows were comfortable. The fitness room is not properly labeled, so one must know that it is rooms 124 and 125; it is below average at best. Worst, forget about receiving any kind of service; the staff seemed aloof and detached from the operation. First, the lobby music is loud preventing the understanding of any normal front desk interaction. My check-in experience on 6/30 lacked any sort of normal human behavior and I even found the woman to have a bit of an attitude; no one cared to asked me at checkout how everything was. It doesn\u2019t seem anyone cares about the guests at this place and I rarely say this. My post arrival midnight phone calls to housekeeping at midnight and 5 AM to request an iron and ironing board (they don\u2019t have them in the rooms but info flyer says to call via housekeeping) went unanswered and my phone transfer to a live person as the recording suggested did not occur till my third request at 6 AM. The very roof top bar was not accessible because it was closed for some sort of filming during the day and at night you have to compete with the long line of locals who want to be seen with the beautiful people. I guess I could have tipped the security staff. No special roof top bar privileges of any sort for hotel guests \u2013 VERY annoying. Could not even get to the pool when I had time because the pool was closed for filming. Why stay here for the rooftop bar and pool when you can get it to it is beyond me. I got the impression these folks make money renting the rooftop are to everyone and anyone (special events, film crews, etc.) so the hotel guests are always screwed. You want to hear more service attitude at this place; here is directly from their room guide. \u201cLate checkouts are granted on an availability basis and may be subject to an additional charge. A half day room and tax charge will be posted to your folio after 2 PM and a full day charge after 6 PM.\u201d I missed last Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express experience.

Also, contrary to a lot of the comments on here, the staff were all great. Every one we spoke to, from the desk staff to the bell boys were extremely polite and attentive throughout our stay. In terms of the bar being closed to guests, that wasn't the case when we were there so I can't really comment on that. Yes, the rooms are small but you're in New York - what do you expect!? Unless you have money to burn you will never get a spacious room in New York, the rooms were nicely decorated, very clean and the beds were very comfy. If I had to pick a fault I'd say that the corridors are in need of some attention and the shower leaked a little but apart from that I had a great time at the Empire. I am actually a travel agent myself and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to my customers! What I would say is that if you are looking for a bragain and want to spend a lot of time in a big luxury hotel room, New York is definately not the place to for you.

I chose the hotel because of its fantastic location. I was close to booking at a hotel nearer the southern end of Manhattan as we wanted to visit the WTC site along with the whole Brooklyn Bridge and Pier area - (we still managed to get down there one of the days and it is definitely worth the twenty-five minute cab ride). The Empire Hotel has (I'm pretty sure) been recently renovated as the lobby/rooms are all extremely-well appointed. The Lobby is modern and although it's random, the lighting was very relaxing and there was a lot of places to sit at in the Lobby - very comfy seats. The staff I met were all eager to help and when we asked for directions or tips on how to get to places they were happy to offer there knowledge. There is a restaurant in the hotel itself - we never ate there. It looked nice... but dark and more of a bistro-styled restaurant - not my type. For breakfast, we ate at the perfectly situated Starbucks on the same corner of the hotel. It was a big Starbucks with lots of seating and the people were also very friendly. We ate the first night at a small Italian down on the Avenue of the America's (the name slips me...) and another night at a Asian restaurant called Tao - this was extremely good (expensive) but fantastic food. Our favourite restaurant by far though was one called Cafe Fiorello - literally across Broadway from the Empire Hotel. The hotel is situated pretty much in the middle of a lot of the interesting places of North Manhattan; Lincoln Centre, Shops and Columbus, Central Park, Fifth Avenue with the masses of designer stores. The Chrysler, Flatiron and Empire State buildings were all more of a taxi ride away - not really close enough to comfortably walk. We went up the Empire State building at night thinking the lines wouldn't be long... but they were. I don't think it really matters what time of day you plan to visit the Empire State because the lines will always be long! If you have time definitely visit Macy's - fantastic experience! Getting back to the hotel, the cons were: The rooms were very nicely furnished/appointed but small. We had a room with two queen beds in and it was a squeeze - hardly any 'walking' space around the beds. The bathroom was small - other reviews have mentioned the bathrooms being right and they are true - they are seriously small. You could be on the toilet, wash your hands and give your feet a shower at the same time... The \"Business Centre\" was uhm... more of a Business Closet. It had two (I must say very nice/modern) computers but it was like sitting in a broom closet. Our room got very hot but the air conditioner was noisy and rattly and was very annoying when you were trying to go to sleep. We ended up leaving ours on when we were out during the day and then turning it off right* before we went to sleep - that way it didn't disturb us. One of the things my 16 year old son (who's a swimmer), was looking forward to was the rooftop pool, bar and terrace. Yeah ok... it would have been nice if we had got to get in the pool but it was closed for 'maintenance' every day yet nobody was ever working on it... Not to mention it was literally less than 2m wide and probably 10m long... not much of a pool. Also the rooftop terrace is fantastic - a great place to have a drink before going out to dinner or after getting back from your trips out... but it is very very* expensive and it was nearly always closed (parties or do's) but the one time we were able to go we had a great time. Overall, the Empire Hotel is a modern, nicely appointed hotel in a fantastic location. The rooms were small - especially the bathrooms - and there was not much of a business centre but on the whole it worked for what we booked it for.

The air-conditioning cannot be adjusted and so you may swetler a bit in summer. Downstairs bar in the evening is noisy and not recommended for a quiet drink. And so to the infamous showers. Yes, the design is a train-wreck. To use them: the big handle is for adjusting the water temperature - you have to turn nearly 360 degrees to get hot water. AFTER that look for a cunningly disguised sliding lever BELOW the main handle. This controls both selector switch for hand-held/top shower as well as the water pressure. No matter what you do, the floor will become sopping wet. however the hotel staff know that this is a dud design (as is the shallow sink) and are prompt at changing towels.

It is loud. I could not keep my window open for too long without getting irritated by the noise and opted for the in-room ventilation instead. But, you didn\u2019t hear a peep of street noise which was kind of nice. No cars honking, no people screaming. I almost forgot for a second that I was in NYC! Also, the room doors really have to be shoved to close properly which makes unnecessary noise.

Those who are paying the usual rates and/or booked into one of the compact standard rooms are likely to feel much more let down. PLUSES: Our suite was the same type depicted in the photos accompanying Pricilia's \"Magnifique\" review dated January 22, 2010. It was clean and roomy enough by NYC standards; narrow desk but long, so offered good work space; excellent black-out shades under the draperies; comfortable seating. The sleep sofa mattress was better than many of this type & my son reported the bed was fine, although we both thought it seemed shorter than the usual king mattress. Plush LaFrette terrycloth robes. Electronic safe and iPod dock-clock radio, a welcome touch. The bathroom -- supplied with L'Occitane bath products -- was comfortably sized, notably larger than the notoriously compact ones in the standard rooms. I liked the wood sauna-style floor \"mat\" in the walk-in shower & the lack of a shower door (a shower curtain ran the length of the shower) ended up not being a problem for us. Last but not least, free WiFi that was excellent (you need to ask the front desk for a user name and password). And big kudo, warm thanks to the doormen/bellmen who were personable and professional. MINUSES: There are some design & furnishing quirks I found irksome. The bathroom sink is one of those trendy, shallow ones where the water from the faucet splashes out over you; there is no counter space in the bathroom, just a small open-faced cabinet hanging on the wall next to the sink; and I'm not a fan of a ceiling-inset shower head, although the Empire's showers are at least supplemented by a spray wand. Climate control could be better and the windows don't do a great job of insulating you from the street noise outside. Drawer space is too skimpy for 2 or more people who don't like to live out of their suitcase. There is no closet, but rather a narrow alcove with a curtain drapery (which always seems cheesy to me) and a hanging rod suspended inordinately high, too high for vertically-challenged me to use. The management-service failings, however, are what stood out. The fact that we didn't get turn-down service is no biggie, but if you can't consistently offer it, then don't advertise it, or make it \"upon request.\" There was absolutely no information about the hotel to be found in the room -- not even a little card by the phone with a directory of in-house numbers to call. So when I needed an iron and ironing board (not supplied in the rooms), I had to go down to the front desk to make my request. The woman, who was not otherwise engaged, did not offer to make the call to Housekeeping but rather gave me (without comment) the extension to ring once I returned to my room. Pool hours, room service, concierge services, the spa hours and services, the location and hours of the gym, on-premises bar and restaurant(s), etc.? I'm clueless: this info was also not to be found on the hotel's \"home page\" when you access the WiFi nor was it on an in-house TV channel as is sometimes the case. Why management keeps the guests in the dark about such matters -- which could boost their revenue stream -- is a mystery to me. My other dealings with front desk personnel were the most lifeless I have ever encountered. No surprise there was a fairly long line when we arrived at 3 PM, the official start time for check-in, and I understand that not all rooms will be available at that early an hour. But I cooled my heels at the counter for 10+ minutes as the clerk, who offered no welcoming greeting, \"worked\" the computer -- in complete silence --before telling me she had a room for me, but that we would need to come back in 30-45 minutes to get the keys. She did not volunteer info as to what we could do with our luggage in the interim; I had to ask. Upon my return, she simply asked my name and whether I wanted 1 or 2 keys and handed them over, saying the room number aloud (which is a poor policy imo, even if you don't see Jack the Ripper standing within earshot) and nothing else, not even a perfunctory \"Enjoy your stay\". Similarly, check-out was uber business-like, devoid of token niceties such as \"Was everything to your liking?\" or \"We hope to see you again\". I presented the bill that had been slipped under my door and advised her that I owed an additional $12 for 2 candy bars from the mini-bar; she questioned me 3 times as to which particular candy we'd helped ourselves to. After asking if I wanted to leave all the charges on the credit card I'd registered with, she printed off a new bill and handed it to me, saying \"I need you to sign at the X\". And that was it. The grizzled guys at the news stands at Penn Station seem happier to have me as a customer than the Empire. BOTTOM LINE: This hotel is in a great location, offers some very nice amenities, and the physical plant should be attractive to many, even if the decor doesn't hold tremendous appeal to me. Based upon what I've read here on TA, the Empire is a frequent Priceline and Hotwire win. That leads me to believe that they are struggling to keep their room occupancy rates up. I don't know how much it would cost them to provide more info about the hotel, its services and amenities, the neighborhood to guests. But better training & evaluation of their front desk staff (and axing those who are poor performers) should be a management priority, wouldn't add much to their expenses and would doubtlessly be worth their while.

But all of the little negative things this trip have added up, leaving me to write this review. First, I am traveling with a colleague and we reserved a room with 2 beds. We even called 2 days before arriving to confirm this was the case. When we got here, they said they couldn't give us a room with 2 beds and they didn't care about our \"reservation\" because we had made it over the phone and had nothing in writing. The manager was completely unwilling to compensate us in any way. My colleague arrived in the room to a stopped up sink, and a shower that started hot but went cold during her shower. When I arrived, I had trouble getting a key (the girl first insisted that my name wasn't on the room, before finally finding it after a lot of arguing). I was also a little surprised that the hotel didn't have an iron or blow-dryer, because I have grown accustom to hotels having these things. That night, I wanted to get a little bit of work done after my colleague went to sleep. I went downstairs to find a place to sit, but the entire lobby of the hotel had blaring club music. All of the seating belongs to the bar, and there isn't even a quiet corner to go sit on the floor. I asked at the desk where I could work and was told I could work in the business center. The business center is a small closet with 2 computers which is right off the lobby -- you can still hear the blaring music. Finally, on Sunday morning I slept in a bit (until 9) and there was no hot water for a shower -- none at all. After the frigid shower, I decided to sit down and write the review. Like I said in the beginning, the bed and room are nice. If you are willing to deal with the issues that pop up, it might be worth it.

The location of this hotel is perfect for us as we came here for the opera at the MET at the Lincoln Center and the Central Park is just across.

A lot of reviews were saying that the rooms were the size of a thimble and that there were issues with temperature control in the room (too hot). I called and spoke to the front desk and they were polite and helpful (spoke to Diana). I went ahead and paid an extra $40.00 a night to upgrade from the standard room (which is very tiny and it's what you get automatically on priceline) to a deluxe king, which is a larger room. I figured for $190 a night it was still a good deal for NYC and at least I'd be assured of a decent room. As it turned out we got delayed by 2 days getting to NY due to the storms and the closure of the airports. I called and spoke to Alex (also very nice and helpful) and he went ahead and checked me into my room by phone so that I'd be sure not to lose my reservation. (With priceline you pay in advance so unfortunately I had to pay for the 2 nights that I wasn't even there, but that wasn't the hotel's fault, just priceline rules.) When I finally arrived at the hotel on day 3 of my visit I asked if they could at least give me a break and not charge me the extra $40.00 a night upgrade fee for the 2 nights I missed and they said they'd have to check with the manager and get back to me. They explained that they kept that upgraded room for me so technically I used it even though I wasn't there (since they could have sold it to someone else). I never heard anything from them for the rest of my stay, and to be honest, I was having a good time and forgot about it myself. When I got the bill under my door on the last day I was pleased and surprised to see that they had taken off the upgrade charge for the 2 missed days after all. That was very nice since they really didn't have to do it. The lobby was very nicely appointed with a groovy animal print bar and lounge. We never made it up to the rooftop bar but people said it was nice. The pool was closed for the winter and hadn't reopened yet when we were there (mid-March). As for the deluxe king room, if you should decide to upgrade, it is still small by Hilton or Marriott standards but for a NY boutique hotel it is decent and much better than the standard room we would have gotten without the upgrade. There's a small desk and desk chair as well as an upholstered chair. We had a nice view of Lincoln Center. I found the kind bed extremely comfortable and I slept like a baby the whole time we were there. Also, not sure if it was just our specific location or good fortune but we never heard anyone in any adjacent rooms at all while in our room, which was nice. There's a decent size chest of drawers under the TV to unpack your stuff as well as a wardrobe to hang things. There's a minibar fridge and also a room safe. As for the bathroom, it's very small and not designed with practicality in mind. It's all about style, not about usefulness, unfortunately. There's a very attractive square sink which is nice to look at but it's so shallow that every time you turn on the faucet you get wet pants from the water bouncing off the too shallow sink bottom. Also, the design of the doorless shower is again groovy and mod to look at but there's going to be water all over the floor. On the bright side, there are plenty of nice towels to lay on the floor. The shower design is a rain head on the ceiling and also a handheld wall-mounted head. You need a manual to figure out how to use this thing but once you get it figured out it's fine. We didn't have any problems with getting enough hot water. Also....a nice little extra is you get free wireless high speed internet in your room which is really unusual for NY. They typically get you with around a $20 a day charge so I was pleased and surprised. It worked well every day as I used my laptop for business. Don't dial any 800-number calls from your room, however, as their generosity doesn't extend that far. You get charged $1.00 to dial a toll free number (and then some per minute charge if the call is over 10 minutes, I think) so beware if you use a toll free access for your calling card or pre-paid phone card. I just used skype on my laptop instead since the internet was free anyway. As for the complaints about controlling room temperature, we didn't have too much of a problem. The week we were there (mid-March) was rather unusually warm so we had the A/C on the whole time. It was not as nice and cool as it could have been but it was comfortable enough to not be bothersome. This is a very old building so you have to expect some of this sort of stuff. The housekeeping staff did a good job and our room was always cleaned when we came back each day with nice refills on the L'Occitane bathroom amenities (which were much appreciated). The front door guys and bellmen were also nice. I'm not sure about the reviews that say the staff was rude. We didn't encounter any of those sorts during our stay, but maybe we were just lucky. Also, you have to figure in the NY vibe that maybe some people take as rude but it's really not meant to be. Last but not least, we loved being on the upper west side. It's a great part of town. You can walk up a few blocks on Columbus Ave. and there are tons of small restaurants and shops, walk down a few blocks and you're at the Time Warner complex which is a big, multi-level indoor mall with shops and restaurants. There are two movie theatre multiplexes in walking distance (one is artsy films and the other is regular releases). You can walk a few blocks further to the theatre district, or a couple blocks over and you're at Central Park. There's so much in walking distance it's amazing and not nearly as touristy as staying in midtown. Bottom line for this hotel, in my opinion, is that you have to go into it expecting a small room no matter what so that you won't be bummed when you get there. If you have the money to upgrade to the king deluxe it's worth it for an extra $40 a night. Go with an an expectation that you're in NYC in a great neighborhood at a very stylish hotel but don't go expecting the RItz Carlton or Peninsula. Don't even go expecting the Hilton or Hyatt because it's a different experience. It's more of a trendy, boutique hotel experience. We had a great time but if I had expected a big spacious room and a big Hilton-esque lobby, I would have been disappointed. Go for the city experience in a great part of town!! I would definitely stay here again without hesitation (and would go for the upgrade again).", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.

Booked a room months ago, when we arrived at the Empire, they had \"over booked\" and didn't have the room we originally booked. The most ironic thing was, we weren't even told this they printed out a paper and handed it to us so we could read it! For our inconvenience they were \"nice\" enough to take $30 off the room price and put us in a room with only one bed instead of two. $30 compared to a $659 per night charge was a drop in the bucket, they could have just not taken anything off and I would have been just as upset. When asked to speak with a manager we were told she was \"unavailable\" and even if she was available and we spoke with her they would not have taken off the $30. Also were told check in was at 3 pm, only to find out it was at 4 pm, which was even more confusing that they weren't starting check in yet and our room had already been taken... I feel as though my friends and I were not treated the same as others that stayed there with thoughts that we were \"too young\" and we could easily be taken advantage of. I myself am 27 years old and was with a group of friends, half are married and one soon to be bride (hence the trip). As others have said, the bathroom is HORRIBLE, the shower leaks everywhere, no hot water (even on the first shower) and the sink is not practical. There was even a point in our night that we were going back up to our room to grab a few things and I was not allowed back in until I showed my room key to the person standing outside of the hotel. I told them what room I was staying in and they could have checked with the front desk, but still refused to let me through the doors without seeing the actual room key. Since I was with a group of friends (6) some of us had keys and some did not, (as they did not hand a key to everyone staying in the room) and we weren't always with everyone in the group. Just thought for the amount of money per night we payed it would have been a completely different experience. I've been treated better at hotels that were much less expensive. The couple things that weren't so bad were the bell boys were super friendly, and the staff at the restaurant were VERY friendly and helpful as they suggested a few places to have drinks after dinner.

This is really not a problem, since we did not spend much time in the room, and usually had the window closed, also it probably reduced noise as well, we were expecting to hear car horns and ambulance noises but our room was very quiet. If you want a room with a view, I am sure they have them. The other small complaint was that there was only 1 bathrobe in the room, even though we had 2 people there, which I am sure could have been remedied if we asked the staff for another one. Another thing is the bathroom sink faucet is too close to the sink and if you have big hands, its kind of hard to wash them. As you can see, these are really not worth even mentioning.

The shower did not have a full door and I almost flooded the bathroom when I left the shower hose facing the wrong direction.

The other 4 on-line travel sites listed at EXACTLY the same price. So you\u2019ve been warned. \u201dCaveat Emptor\u201d. Once at the hotel, I did ask for an upgrade because of what I felt to be an unfair price in what I payed. We originally booked a Queen sized bed-room on the 6th floor. When I saw the view on the 6th floor I was mortified. I went back and asked them if I could have a look at their \u2018upgrade\u2019 on the 10th floor. It consisted of a king bed, with a lovely north fronting view, with the Lincoln Centre off to the side and partial view of at least one of the Chagal's that hangs in the foyer of the Lincoln Centre lobby. The club music- well, it depends on your attitude. I was worried about this after reading the other reviews, but as it turned out it was just what the doctor ordered. This is going to sound weird, but, for this quick trip I was wired for the sounds of a busy city that never sleeps. I loved the relentless beat of life emanating from the 12th floor. We were on the 10th. Saturday morning 12-2am, I did have to open my door twice to ask people to move their conversation to a more private place, and they moved on. The thing is, because of the view, the fun time I was having, my partner's attentiveness, the musicals, the food, the park, the shops, it being NYC, I went with the flow. And it was easy to do here. This place flows. The hotel has charm. The bathroom showers, not so much, but we tried to be careful and diligently sopped up the water from the shower with the plentiful amount of towels provided. The soaps, shampoo, conditioners are heavenly and in ample proportion. Actually, from a Feng Shui point of view, this hotel is being hit with a tsunami of energy coming from being right at the top of the crossroads of Broadway and Columbus, and all that energy is not being deflected in any way and, according to my theory, the hotel is getting whamed with too much chi force. In my estimation whoever designed and accepted the shower configuration for the rooms was not mindful of the energy hit this hotel receives from the flow of energy from these two streets and it is the reason for their serious water shower issues...but I digress. When I go to a certain place I kinda hope I know what my attitude will be while I am there. Once we switched floors, from the 6th to the 10th I was a bit wary because I knew that we would have to deal with the club sounds. I didn\u2019t need to worry. We both got in the groove and while we didn\u2019t find time to go to the club upstairs on the 12th floor - we were having our own party around town and in our hotel room. As I lay in our king sized bed, at 3am Sunday morning, my head cushioned on a might fine down pillow, with a just-as-comfortable white down comforter keeping me warm, listening to the muted buzz and purr of NYC city traffic coming from the closed 8 foot window beside me (which, surprisingly, you can actually open\u2026..and believe me, after a shower the room heats up and you will have to) I fell asleep and I slept like a baby, both nights.

The room was particularly dark and there was not a lot of information on the hotel in the room. After returning from dinner later that evening we found out about the music from the bar/club upstairs. We were on the tenth floor and the music shook our room. The music was so loud I could clearly identify what songs were playing. I finally went down at 2:30am to complain and asked to be moved not only to get away from the music but to try to get a queen size bed. I was told the only thing available was on a smoking floor which as a non-smoker was not something I wanted. The staff at the desk also told me that they did not have any other complaints about the music that night and that there was even a floor above me and it was not bothering them. The clerk said that loud music is bad for business so why would they do that. After getting no where at 2:30 in the morning I asked for a later check out so we could catch up on our sleep and I had to call back after 8am to request that. When we checked out we let them know how disappointed we were and they apologized but nothing else was really done about it. They also mentioned that they don't have guests on the 11th floor due to the loud music which was interesting because the clerk the night before tried to bring his point home by saying no one on the floor above me had complained. No one complained because no one was staying on the 11th floor. In summary, the loud music and lack of help from the staff ruined our romantic weekend.

The decorator obviously valued form over function -- very high tech & trendy looking, but not very comfortable. The dark colors made the room look dirty, too. I expect small rooms in NYC, but our room was missing a lot of basics -- no information on the hotel, no phone numbers for the hotel restaurant (and we were charged $1.50 when the operator connected me to the restaurant, after telling me that there'd be no charge -- I would have used my cell phone after getting the number). We (and other hotel guests) had to have our room keys re-keyed. The bathroom sink (although very pretty) was too shallow, the shower was hard to use, there were no washclothes, and we finally found the bathroom wastebasket on the morning that we were leaving. The heating system made a terrible noise (sounded like people trying to get in the room) that woke us up throughout the night.

I got an excellent price via travelzoo and was pleased to nevertheless have received a complimentary upgrade from a basic queen room to a \"superior king\". This is a smart move on the hotels part to upgrade when there's availability. I liked the little touches like the Frette bathrobe, the fresh rose on the bedside table and the umbrella for complimentary in stay use. I'd like to address a few of the more frequent complaints I've seen here. First off, the heating. It's hot. However in old NY buildings this is not unusual so it didn't bother me. Just don't bring flannel pajamas and you'll be fine. Second the shower design- the half open design of the showers is imperfect without a doubt. There will be some water splashed on the floor; however, it wasn't a flood and there were more than enough to towels to put down, so this didn't bother me in the least. The rain shower style shower head is really nice and the wooden nonslip mat an upscale touch. My room faced the alleyway. This was fine since it meant less traffic noise. That being said, the walls are thin- again not unusual in old NY buildings. I recommend earplugs. This is not a 5 star hotel but it is upscale enough to make you feel pampered and the location directly in front of Lincoln Center can not be beat. I think its a great option for tourists to get out of Times Square which is the cheesiest, ugliest, part of the whole city.

If you looked around the air shaft at the other rooms, most people had their windows open. There were a couple of downsides to keeping the windows open.

However after my recent stay at the Empire Hotel I thought I'd write my first. My wife and I stayed there in November in order to attend a Veteran's Day event in the City. We made it a sort of business/romantic getaway kind of thing. I was amazed at how beautiful the hotel truly is. It's an old historic hotel which was recently rennovated. The atmosphere is charming. There's a nice, warm feel to it, especially as you enter the lobby. The staff is top notch. They were everything you'd expect in a hotel staff and they made us feel like VIPs. Very professional yet warm and engaging. The concierge and front desk personnel were very efficient and exuded professionalism. Yet at the same time they were patient and courteous. I've been to other places where that just wasn't the case. The bellman opened doors for us. Yeah, I know, they do that at all hotels, but these bellman actually smiled and gave us a genuinely warm greeting; not one that seemed stale and rehersed. The hotel's security was no different- genuinely warm, but definitely no nonsense. They didn't come off like the goons you see all too often nowadays. Even though the roof and pool deck was closed for the season the hotel's head engineer ( a fellow vet) gave us a private tour of the areas. Great view of Broadway and Columbus Circle! The few managers I spoke with during our stay were outstanding. Very professional and on point with the concept of hospitality. They all deserve raises! We stayed in Room 817. Although the bathroom did seem a bit small and it could use a shower curtain, the room itself was cozy yet spacious. Who hangs out in the bathroom anyway; right? They had a fully stocked minibar with lots of popular drinks, snacks, wines, and beers. Our room was quiet, immaculate and the temperature just perfect. And it was every bit as charming as the lobby. It made you not want to leave your room. The big screen TV, free internet access, and a most outrageously comfortable bed only compounded that feeling. We did have one slight problem with getting onto the internet, but we called down to the front desk and within 5 or 6 minutes an engineer was knocking on our door to resolve the problem. Each time we left our room and put the room service sign on the door we found the room totally refreshed upon our arrival. The hotel has a location that's second to none. It's across from Lincoln Center, three blocks from Columbus Circle, and a block or so from Central Park. You're never more than a block or so away from a subway station that can take you to every corner of this NY metropolis. Lots of great places to eat too. And if you don't want to go far to grab a bite the hotel has two fine restaurants on its' premises to go along with a first rate room service. We only ordered coffee during our stay. But the high level of service they provided you'd have thought we ordered a four course meal. Would I recommend this hotel to anyone?...In a Heartbeat!!! Thanks, Guys!!!

Everything went along nicely during our 3 night stay --we thought the price was right, the location was good and the room and amenities were nice. Unfortunately, money vanished from our room safe and I would not feel safe staying in the hotel again....nor can I recommend the hotel to friends or colleagues. Here are the facts: We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in mid November. During our stay, we used the hotel safe for our valuables and extra cash so we wouldn't have to carry it on the street. The night before we checked out, we took our valuables and some of the cash out of the safe, leaving $250 in the safe and locking it with our security code. We checked out the next day and though I am a very experienced traveler and always check the room thoroughly before checking out, we forgot to empty the safe. We left the hotel at 10 a.m. and only realized our mistake at 4pm when we immediately called the hotel. Supposedly, the security person on duty went to my room and used a hand held device which can over ride my personal security code. I waited on hold while he checked my room. When he got back on the phone, we said, \"I'm sorry, but the safe was empty\". Of course, it is his word against mine, but I SAW the money in the safe and know it was locked when we left the room. If no one opened the safe in the meantime, how would you explain the vanishing act? I next talked to the head of security for the hotel several times. During our first conversation, he said that he personally went with the security person when our safe was opened. During our next conversation, when I pressed him on whether or not he SAW the safe being opened and that it was empty, he retracted his earlier statement and said, \"No, I didn't go to the room, I stayed at the elevator.\" Therefore,d the person who opened the safe had no witness. I found this revelation to be more than a bit disturbing. Why did he change his story? Next, I asked to speak to the hotel manager. I waited more than 5 hours to receive his call back. While he apologized on behalf of the hotel, he couldn't explain the discrepancy in the security staff's story and promised to \"get to the bottom of the situation and get back to me\". I said that I looked forward to his full report and while I wish we could get our money back, I was more concerned about the hotel instituting a better security system and follow through. It has now been nearly two weeks since the incident and I haven't heard anything further from the manager...... To his credit, he offered to offer a complimentary stay on a future visit, but until this issue is fully investigated and resolved, I wouldn't feel safe staying at the hotel. So....if you stay at the Empire Hotel, just remember that you are better off carrying your valuables with you. For the money that we lost, we could have upgraded to a better (and safer) hotel. One other point, during our stay, the lobby was closed off for an entire day as a TV show, Gossip Girl was being filmed there. I'm sure the hotel is compensated for the use of the space, but it added nothing but inconvenience to our stay as we had to go through alternate entrances, etc. It made me feel like the hotel was trying to use the space to make as much money as possible without any concern for how this might affect the guests. When I mentioned this issue to the front desk staff, they said the lobby was being used by a film crew nearly every week, so it is not a one off situation, but an on-going inconvenience to future guests.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North East", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and location.\u201d", "Author": "FleetyNorthEast", "ReviewID": "UR50119671", "Content": "I stayed at The Empire Hotel from 12 Nov 09 until 15 Nov with my daughter, best friend and her daughter, When we arrived, check in was first class and reception staff really friendly.

Shower design leaves a lot to be desired however we managed and soon fathomed out how to control pressure and temperature! Beds clean and comfy, reception area and lounge tastfully decorated and well staffed. The location was ok, two minute walk to Central Park. Despite no tea/coffee facilities in room, Starbucks literally next door which is ideal for early morning coffee. The only other downside was the $100 per day per room deposit they required. Thought this was a bit steep especially as we only took cash and no credit card, this tied up some of our spending money until we checked out at 10am on Sunday 15th Nov.........hence some last minute shopping before our taxi arrived at 6pm. We hailed a yellow taxi from JFK airport upon arrival, make sure you agree fare before getting in. They should give you a slip of paper with price on - $45 plus $5 toll flat rate. Worked both ways for us which is really good value. Recommend 'Grey Line' tour bus. We paid $50 each for a two day ticket which is a great way for getting around.

(Only complaints- bathroom size and nightclub noise). Photos of the hotel are true to life, very rich, hip, urban decor but with a warm and comfortable feel. I was suspicious that they didn't have a photo of the entrance on the web, but the entrance is very nice. If you like the look of the photos they have, you'll love it in real life. Lobby is a good size for a boutique hotel and is two-story with lots of comfy seating on both levels to rest or enjoy a cocktail. Bar is open to lobby and had fantastic drinks. Lots of rich dark browns and candles everywhere. Plenty of nooks to curl up and enjoy a cocktail after a long day of shopping on 5th Ave. Staff very friendly. We had a corner suite and it was small as far as suites go, but plenty big enough for the two of us. BTW- sofa opens to a bed. Decor was beautiful, just like the photos and our views were of the upper west side and of Lincoln Center with the fountain. Room was clean and since hotel had been recently refurbished, all felt fresh. Mini-bar in wardrobe in bedroom, wine and snacks to buy on a tray and nice bathrobes provided. Only complaint about room (besides club noise I'll mention next) was bathroom. It was tiny! Teeny tiny! Small shower with only half a door- yes, room got wet! Tiny bit of counter space but open shelves next to mirror to put our stuff worked out well enough. Club on top floor is beautiful, BUT they crank up the volume at 3am and our bed literally shook to the beat from 3-4am, AND we were on the 9th floor!!! Needless to say, it woke us up and we couldn't sleep until sometime after 4am. The club is owned by a different company so complaining would have been useless. Heard from other guests that they could feel/hear it on the 7th floor! Went to the club early in the evening, around 7pm, not crowded yet and very relaxing. Lots of sofas and conversation areas, candles, great views of the city and trendy ambiance lighting. Small outside area on roof with sofas, to smoke or get some air. Club gets a line later in evening, but hotel guests get priority entrance. There is also a small pool but only open seasonally. Two restuarants attached to hotel- both are excellent! Could have never left the building and eaten at them all weekend! Ed's Chowder House is brand new and beautiful and can be entered from the mezzanine of the hotel. P.J. Clarke's is a very nice pub-type place with lots of windows and very fresh raw oysters- entrance on street. There is a Starbuck's in the base of the building, which is great since there isn't a coffee maker in the room. Also, next to Starbuck's is a Duanne-Reed (or something like that) a large drug store that's open 24 hrs. No need to panic if you forgot to pack something! Heard from other guests that the spa was good. Neighborhood is beautiful with lots of restuarants across street and within walking distance. Central Park is about 1 and a half blocks away and Columbus Circle is about 3 blocks away with tons of places to shop and dine. You can get the carriage rides from there alongside the park. If you walk north of the hotel along 7th ave there are plenty of nice restuarants and shopping. Hotel is situated literally at the front steps of Lincoln Center- great place to stay if seeing ballet or opera. Great location if you want to avoid crowds and hectic chaos of midtown and lower Manhatten. Cab fare to & from Penn station ranged from $12 - $15.

Everyone is right - this is a great location but there it ends I'm afraid. We arrived on a delayed flight with my poor son desperate to get in to bed to be told that the room type we had booked was not available and we would have to take a standard room or nothing. Actually the story changed every 2 seconds as we were told various tales by the same 3 people on the front desk - rooms were available but were dirty and could not be cleaned as it was too late, no rooms were available at all and we would be sent to an alternative hotel, we had only booked standard rooms despite our confirmation paperwork from the travel agent, we had not paid in advance and would need to pay by credit card, again despite our travel agent confirmation etc,. etc. This went on for a good 20 minutes with both my friend and myself getting more and more upset and my baby becoming quite distressed through tiredness. Even more annoyingly, while all of this was happening, more guests were turning up and checking in to superior rooms even though we'd been told that none were available. When I pointed this out to the reception staff, the guy who appeared to be the Duty Manager became quite aggressive and was very rude informing me that their bookings were blocked and ours weren't (whatever that means) but in all it left us feeling that we were being singled out for particularly awful treatment. Eventually we agreed to take 2 standard rooms on the proviso that our these were changed to superiors the next day but on getting to our rooms mine was so small the cot needed for my son couldn't fit in it whilst the door of my friend's room opened on to the bed with no space to walk round! They really were like cupboards. At this point I joined in with the wails of my son and sat in the corridor crying. The Bell Boy was lovely and went back down to reception to see what could be done, reappearing with one of the ladies from reception who took me to a living room of a suite and arranged for a \"put you up\" to be brought in - but a least myself, son, crib and cases could all fit!!!!

I explained we were on honeymoon and I wanted what I had requested but I received no apologies or gestures of goodwill.

They told us the first room would be ready at 3:30 and the next at 4:00 and to compensate gave us all (9 of us) a round of drinks. The bartender was sweet and gave us our drinks, and out of no where started throwing around stuff and being really nasty. We sat in the lobby until 3:49 when they told us only one room was ready. At 4:45 we were given the other room key. In order to make it up to us they gave us $100 off each room and 8 free tickets to breakfast. However, you have no idea what it took to get anything here.

I got a 30% discount on the room through the hotel's own web site. With all taxes, ect. included, the room came to $267.00. The room was very clean and very nicely appointed. There was a large walk in closet to hang our clothing and in the closet was a mini-bar fridge and a safe (free to use). The bathroom was plenty big with a full tub and shower and full shower doors. There was space next to the sink to put our make-up and toiletries plus there were shelves underneath for additional items. You did have to be careful not to turn the water on too quickly or it would splash due to the kind of sink it was. We had nice robes to use. Check in is listed as 3:00 p.m. but we went early to see if we could drop off our luggage as we had tickets to the ballet across the street at the Lincoln Center. We arrived at 1:00 and got to check right in and our room was ready. We ate at the hotel's restaurant, Center Cut, and the food was wonderful. We had the pre-fix menu and was very satisfied with the portions and the quality of the food. We each got 3 huge cookies which we took to the room as we were full from the main courses. After dinner we went to the roof top lounge to get a good seat for the fireworks. Guest's do not have to stand in the line that is outside. You just go to the elevator's and show the bouncer your room key and they let you right in to the elevator. Also, we had friends who met us at the hotel for the evening. All we had to do was go down to the lobby when they arrived and tell the bouncers that they were with us and they got to go to the roof top right away. The drinks averaged $13-$15 each but that is not any more expensive than many places in NYC. Every staff person was very friendly and helpful from the doorman to the bus boys.

The Pros: Great location. Right across the street from Lincoln Center with lots of restaurants, Central Park, and Time Warner Center nearby. Right above Columbus Circle, it is where the midtown starts to give way to the West Side. The hotel public areas and room were extremely clean. Finishes and furnishings are all fairly new. Bed was comfy. The Cons: Our Standard Queen room was definitely on the small (tiny) side and it only had a single window that faced an air shaft making for a very dark room during the middle of the day. The lighting in the room didn't really help much. Except for the bathroom there was only one single plug available to for iPod, cell phone, laptop chargers and it was kind of hard to get to under one of the night stands. We had a non-smoking room but at least once we smelled smoke coming from somewhere else. Overall the small bathroom was kind of nice but the sink was oddly hard to use. The stylish faucet was too close to the shallow basin which made it very hard to get both hands under the water at the same time. I don't think I have ever had trouble washing hands in a hotel bathroom before. The fitness center was small with 5 cardio machines and few free weights. One of the major reasons I chose the Empire was because it has a pool on the roof. I thought that might be a nice amenity given our late June stay. Unfortunately the day that we arrived they close the pool earlier in the day because of rain even though the sun was out in a bright blue sky for about five hours before it started to rain again. They claimed the closure was due to the threat of weather, safety etc. But they seemed to be overly cautious relying on a forecast rather than on real time conditions. Setting aside their judgement about whether or not the pool should have been open, we got conflicting messages about if it was open, when it would open etc. We got at least three different stories and no one was really sure if it was open or not. At one point the hotel operator told me it was open even though we had just tried to get to it but found a locked door. He tried to transfer me to the front desk, but instead I waited on the phone for 8 minutes and 47 seconds before I got tired of waiting and hung up. The real relevation was a little later in the day when someone at the front desk told me that the pool was open and defended their closure policy--but said she would check with the food and beverage department to make sure it was open. This suggests to me that the pool is a profit center for the hotel and not an amenity for guest. If the food and bev people aren't ther to take your money then the pool is closed? Another disappointment was the spa. I waited for 15 minutes for my treatment and never had anyone explain that they were running late or any kind of acknowledgement that they were keeping me waiting. It was only after I said I was leaving that the receptionist offered me a weak \"we will be right with you...\" I said thanks but no thanks. My partner did have a mani/pedi that he said was pretty lackluster and definitely not worth the time. It is also one of those boutique hotels that feels like it is more interested in being a nightclub, and has lines out the front door for its rooftop bar in the evenings. Overall, the stay wasn't hideous.

It is all very grand at the entrance,lounge,lobby and bar with brown and gold interior decor.Our son was able to get us a promotional code which gave us a 30%+ discount and it was still, more than we wanted to pay but, it was in a good location.When we arrived apparently our room had been given to someone else which was rather disturbing to say the least.We arrived around 6pm and rooms are only available from 3pm so we were not exactly late. However,we were offered a room with two double beds (called a double double).There was a hanging rail with a curtain and eight coat hangers no wardrobe and no chest of drawers.We returned to reception to be offered another similar room, but with a wardrobe and a chest of drawers but the bad news was they wanted $50.00 (about \u00a330.00) a night more oh and no view of the street ! So we went back again and mangaged to settle on a room (looking over Broadway) with two queen size beds(a double double) with a hanging rail and a long seat with two drawers with no extra cost. At the time it was suggested that we go out and come back for better choice ? No way,these things are better sorted straight away even though we had had a seven hour flight and a one hour taxi ride from JFK. Incidently get into a yellow cab as it's a fixed fare of $45.00 anything else could cost more than double. Anyway there are 400 rooms in this hotel and about three people dealing with guests as they arrive so I guess they cannot be expected to know what each room is like.We came to the conclusion that style/design is more important than practicalities.The shower was missing a sliding door which had supposedly been removed as there was a safety issue ? The wash basin was a very trendy shallow box shape which meant you had to put your hands down flat to wash.Although the room was a little dark partly due to the decor there were four different lights. The bed was very comfortable,the 32\" flat screen TV was good but don't expect good programmes although you may just see a good film if your lucky.We were on the third floor and the double glazed window pretty much took away all traffic sounds.The rooftop bar was good,so was the terrace, with good views and the pool was great on hot days, as it is not heated. The air conditioning seemed to stop and an engineer came up very swiftly to put it right. Unfortunately this happened again and again and again and so on. We had visits from about six different engineers over the week and did not want the hassle of changing the room, which may not have been an option.When it came to pay the bill, I said I wanted to talk to someone who could authorise a deduction due to the faulty air conditoning unit. All the staff are very good and the manager I spoke to apologised, taking $100.00 off the bill and about $18.00 in taxes.Otherwise the final bill would have been about $1440.00 inc. taxes and without the promotional code, even more ! Overall the location was excellent and hotel was a very good standard. We were just not used to paying so much for a room only.The Lincoln Center was just across the street and a multiplex cinema just five minutes on foot up Broadway.If you are into Starbucks, there was one in the same block two minutes away.There were a number of eating places almost opposite which got cheaper the further you were prepared to walk. If you are staying for a week get a metro card for $25.00 (\u00a315.00) so you can travel on the subway every day without incurring more outlay.It almost paid for itself on the first day ! There is so much to see and do I could not begin to put it all down here but a trip to the Hi Line walk opened 9th June was very pleasant and central park was only a short walk away with it's boathouse and boats.

It took me almost 20 minutes just to check in! There were more staff assigned to people trying to access the rooftop bar than staff dedicated to checking in guests. My question to management - is your primary concern to service guests to your hotel or guests to your rooftop bar? The rooms were SO small, even by NYC standards. There was no closet - just a pull back fabric sheet that had the mini bar. The desk did not even have a plug for a laptop! The shower was pretty cool once you figured out how to turn it on! As mentioned by others, the air conditioner in the room is quite loud. The pluses were the location.

It was a quick subway ride to Times Square (I wouldn't quite say easy, since the NYC subway system always seems more confusing than it needs to be, but there are a number of lines that you can get on at Columbus Circle), or an inexpensive cab ride. As for the room itself, we must have been lucky, because our room was quite large, with a king-sized bed, desk, chair, closet, and dresser, and the bathroom was a decent -size too. It was on the first floor, and we were afraid that it would be noisy, but that really wasn't a problem (we are fairly sound sleepers, though).

However, given the prices for the room and the service of the hotel, there are most certainly better hotels in the area than the Empire Hotel. Upon checking in at 4pm, we were told that our room was not ready yet, despite it being check-in time. When told how long it would take, the receptionist said he had no idea, and that we should just come back in a few hours. Not even an apology or a rough estimate. So we went out and came back at 6pm, and still the room wasn't ready. When we asked for an explanation they had none. Things then got even worse when we asked to speak to the manager. The receptionist went to the back office to speak to the manager, and we could hear the manager respond \"not my problem, tell them I'm not in\". What kind of hotel does this! When we told the receptionist that we heard him, he pretended to have no idea what we were talking about. Finally 20 minutes later we were given our room, on the 3rd floor facing Broadway. As others have mentioned, the AC/heating unit didn't function properly, and it felt like it was 90 degrees in our room. We couldn't really open up the window because of all the noise from the street and the construction going on. So despite the bed being quite comfortable, we were barely able to get any sleep because of the noise and heat. The bathroom was another mistake. It was so small that only one person can go in it at a time, and when you shower water gets all over the place. You would think they would fix that. On the 2nd night we decided to check out the rooftop bar. It is served by a separate elevator in the lobby. When we went down there was a line outside of maybe 10-15 people. However, it took a good 25 minutes before we were finally let up there. When we got up there we were surprised to see maybe 20 people in the bar. They made us wait downstairs all that time when the place was empty? The drinks are outrageously priced, and the waitresses are really pushy when it comes to ordering drinks. We checked out of the hotel on Sunday. We called down for the bellhop service, but they never showed. They tried to charge us for a bunch of drinks from the minibar which we never took.

One of the bellmen took our luggage after we gave up the room at noon and a few hours later we went back to retrieve our bags. That was when one of them let us know that we get to the airport by a normal taxi with the meter running (we had paid around 80 dollars to get from Newark Liberty to the Empire) or we could use one of the hotel cars for a flat fee of 75 dollars - tolls and tips included. We chose to take one of their SUVs but, when we got to the airport, the driver said he had to charge 85 dollars to include the toll. I argued that I had been told that the flat fee I had agreed on was 75 dollars and that he should take it up with the people at the hotel.

My mother in law actually was there a couple of days longer, from the 14th. We were travelling with my Californian mother in law (in her 60's), my husband, and our two girls, ages 12 and 9, from Ohio. We booked two Superior double rooms through Expedia, and they were DIRT CHEAP compared to anything else -- about $200 plus tax per night. I had stayed in the Empire a lot as a kid on Opera trips with my parents, so I knew the location and felt comfortable there. I also read online that the Empire recently undergone a complete renovation. One thing to remember, unless you want to pay gazillions per night for a room, NEW YORK HOTEL ROOMS ARE SMALL. I have also recently stayed at the Time hotel, and the room sizes at the Empire are comparable if not a bit bigger. We booked two adjacent Superior Doubles, and got 2 rooms overlooking the street on the third (actually the 5th, the way they count floors) floor. Each room had two double beds with lovely linens. The beds were very, very comfortable. There was also a small desk, a flat screen TV, and a bench-type thing with two drawers, and a small closet with a safe and minibar. The room was small, but very clean, comfortable, and with some manners (excuse me's) the three of us in my room were fine. The bathroom is tiny. One person at a time. But I have found this typical of New York and wasn't bothered by it. I always bring earplugs as I am a suburbanite, and not used to a lot of noise beyond crickets and birds. There is some street noise, but nothing unlike anyplace else in New York. The service was good. There was always a doorman or two to get doors, offer help with luggage, or hail a cab. The concierge helped print boarding passes (although the rest of the desk staff wouldn't do it, said we had to speak to concierge). The staff made good breakfast recommendations, helped with directions, etc. They keep a bowl of apples on the reservations desk, which was nice. I think my girls ate more than their share. . . . The lobby is gorgeous, my girls wanted to stay there and lounge. There were other nice touches like cookies on the bed for turndown service, an extra soft blanket folded at the bottom of the bed so you didn't have to \"unmake\" it for a nap, lots of pillows, and all the amenities (shampoo/soap/sewing kit/body wash/lotion/robes/hair dryer) that you expect. You can't beat the location. You are a block or two from Central Park, Tavern on the Green is only a block or so north, Lincoln Center is directly across the street, Museum of Natural History is an easy walk north, the Theatre District is an easy walk south. Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Radio City, etc. are all easy walking distance. Tons of eating options. Metro is close, cabs are easy to get,. It was sub-zero temperatures during the first couples days of our stay, and our room was chilly (but not unbearable). I like it that way, and didn't ask for help with the thermostat. My mother in law does not like it so cold, and they came up and adjusted some interior valve on her heating unit so it heated more, and her room was toasty. There was nothing WRONG with the heaters, it was just VERY cold out, and they were able to adjust them.

The hotel did not give any complimentary water bottles and the mini water bottles in the fridge cost 6 a pop. We were so thirsty that we were forced to go down into the gym and drink the water there.

Next morning we complained at reception and were told we'd be moved to \"a more comfortable room\". We repacked all our things and went out for the day fully expecting to be given a room equal to or better than the first one. Imagine our disappointment when we returned and found we'd been moved to a much smaller room at the back of the hotel with (what we thought) very noisy air conditioning. Only when we switched off the aircon late at night did we find the noise was coming from a generator outside the window - a noise that went on all night. I couldn't face repacking and moving again as we (thankfully) only had two more nights at the hotel. We never did manage to get hot water from either the tap or the shower. The Empire is in a great location and could be a very special hotel if only they concentrated more on customer service and less on silly gestures such as apples by the bed.

We called the hotel and upgraded to a King, as they admittedly stated the queen room was actually too small for two people (that's bizarre...then call it a single!) We agreed to the price of $30 extra a night over the phone, but when we checked in they told us it would be $50 extra a night. We even had the name of the staff who guaranteed the rate and had them check with the manager, but they said the staff member who told me that was just mistaken.

The Empire Hotel was one of the most miserable hotel experiences I have EVER had. The location is ideal - across from Lincoln Center and down the block from The Warner Center and a block from the park - couldn't be better. The decor is fresh and 'current'. But after that... forget it - the air conditioning didn't work in the first two rooms they put me in. The units haven't been updated since the 1970's easily. The second room wreaked of cigarette smoke in what was supposed to be a non smoking room and floor. The room service is miserable and every order except one had to be called back by an English speaking operator to confirm the order was taken properly. The digital movie service was always grainey at the beginning of each movie and would frequently skip throughout the movie. The rooftop pool, while loaded with incredible potential, was out of service half the time. The wireless service in the hotel, which is the only service for email and web services was spotty at best in each of the three rooms I was moved around in. The hotel operators are useless and the front desk managers were unbearable, negligent and unintelligent on important issues like billing, accommodations, city services, etc. And the easily the worst, and most disgusting component, occurred when unfortunately I got sick from gastro inestinal virus which rendered me useless for a 24 hour spell. As difficult as this is to write, the uncontrollable nature of the g.i. situation led to some uncontrollable mishaps in bed. While I personally tore the sheets off the bed and insured they were properly taken care of, I was repulsed to see upon my return to my room after a day on business in the city, the the mattress down cover had not been switched out - or burned as it should have been - and that the diarrheal stain of an unfortunate moment was right there in plain view... if all the other details weren't enough, this simple fact sums the entire experience up. INSURE, THAT IF ANYONE YOU KNOW IS PLANNING ON STAYING AT THIS UNBELIEVABLE PROPERTY, THAT YOU DISSUADE THEM FROM DOING SO.

First of all, the Empire is not a dive. It rates a solid two stars, although it\u2019s advertised as a 4-star.

One hour later we arrived at the hotel and met the manager who had just arrived (were they going to keep me on hold for 4 hours?). He immediately declared that he knew nothing of any problems, but hoped everything would now be satisfactory. The room was clean. There was no shower door, which is apparently the case in all their rooms. As a result, water pours all over the floor. The hair dryer blew the circuit breaker (not the gfci). There was no hot water on the first morning. The continental breakfast, free at the Comfort Inn, is $17.50 per person at the Empire. Two of the 4 elevators were broken, but luckily we were on the 2nd floor. The wifi went down one evening and wasn\u2019t restored till the next morning. There was no coffeemaker in the room. The air-conditioner sounded like it ran in diesel. The overpriced mini-bar ($6 candy bars) took up what little counterspace there was.

This trip was to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. So, we wanted everything to be perfect. I would love to be able to tell you what a wonderful experience we had at your hotel but unfortunately I can\u2019t say that. What we experienced was very upsetting for us. We arrived at your hotel on the evening of May 14th for a 5 night stay. We were shown to our room #1115 which had a wonderful view of Lincoln Center and the City. On May 15th after a full day of being on the go, we came back to our room to find the door ajar. Upon entering the room we were startled to find 3 workmen. One man was on a ladder halfway in the ceiling crawl space, one man was holding the ladder and one man was just standing there staring at us. After recovering from our initial shock, we asked them what was going on. They stated they were checking out a problem with the plumbing and that they were told we would have to switch rooms the next day. Hearing this but not knowing exactly what to do, we went down to the lobby to talk to someone in charge. We found that there was nobody who would take responsibility to speak with us on this issue. They kept deferring the situation to a manager who seemed to always be unavailable. So we had to explain the situation to the desk clerks who seemed surprised to hear this story and had not been informed at all. They told us we had to wait while they looked into it. After about a \u00bd hour of waiting in the lobby (in that we had no room to go to because of work still being done) we were told that we would have to move from our room the next morning and that it would be an upgrade (which my husband had to aggressively ask for in light of the inconvenience). The next morning we were all packed (just another added inconvenience) and waited to be moved to our new room. After waiting for about two hours, we were finally told that the new room wasn\u2019t ready. So we went out for the day and upon returning to the hotel in the afternoon very wet and tired, our new room was still not ready and we had to wait in the lobby again. Once our room #1112 was finally ready, we were surprised and very disappointed to see that our new room was not what we considered to be an upgrade. It may have been 4 feet longer but nothing else was different or better. The closet was so small (much smaller than room #1115) that we had to live out of our suitcases. The crowning blow was that we had lost our wonderful view and now looked at a building only a few feet away from our window. So instead of listening to the wonderful city sounds, we were now relegated to listening to the many air conditioners running from the other rooms. Out of total frustration, my husband talked to a manager who was on duty at that time and after explaining the situation to him and expressing our extreme unhappiness with the room and the lack of concern on the hotel\u2019s part, we were offered us a paltry $100 discount on our bill. But all we really wanted was a new room with a view but were told that no room was available. However, the next day, we saw that our old room had new guests staying in it. We were very dismayed to know that your management knew how unhappy we were and that we were not offered our old room back; which was really all we wanted. I can\u2019t begin to tell you how this situation put a dark cloud on our anniversary trip and that we were not treated with respect or concern from your front desk and management team. No one at the Empire really seemed to care that this was putting a damper on our trip and that we had to spend so much time and energy on this situation when we should have been celebrating our 30th anniversary with joy and happiness without worrying about hotel deficiencies. I can guarantee you that we will never come back to your hotel and we will let all of our family, friends and business associates know what our experience was at the Empire Hotel. We will also be putting our experience on line for other potential guests to read before they book a room at the Empire. Until we received your post stay e-mail, a manager\u2019s name never came up as one we could speak to regarding this situation.

They checked our bags, directed us to a great breakfast place up the street and said they would get us into our room early if at all possible. We came back around 11:30 am and the bellman told us to relax in the quiet mezzanine lounge and he would come up and get us when our room was ready. Sure enough, around 12:15 he came and told us our room was ready! Only drawbacks were the bathroom lighting and the heating system. The bathroom light caused so much glare I had to put on makeup by the window. It was very cold in February when we were there.We had trouble with the room getting too hot, but found that if we left the window open a crack the room temperature was fine.

We have stayed at many different hotels during many travels, and this was one of our worst experiences.

In addition, there were no bars in the bathroom and it was unsuitable for a handicapped or elderly person. We requested a change to a handicap room for my elderly mother, and although there were bars and a walk in shower (albeit a cold shower), again the controls were difficult to understand and use, the flooring was slippery (not proper flooring for a handicapped bathroom), and the water did not run properly down the drain such that the rest of the floor in the bathroom also became slippery.

Was sooo disappointed. This went on for two days. Asked to be moved, but the first time I asked the place was booked. I asked the second day and they were able to move me for my final two days. The staff was incredibly friendly and caring, but the bathrooms are ill-equipped and like others, it took FOREVER to get hot water. I felt like I was staying in a hip hotel that was redecorated, as opposed to completely renovated from top to bottom. So many details yet to be taken care of.

Although rates in NY are crazy, we may have spent just under $200 per night (Sat and Sun) with taxes and fees. Not bad! Stars also for the location. I'm not a big fan of the shows, so being near Times Square is actually a disadvantage. The SW corner of Central Park was perfect -- think romantic walks. At Columbus Circle there's also the Bouchon Bakery (originally from San Francisco) with wonderful pastries and sandwiches, Whole Foods, and the shopping mall in the Time Warner building. From 63rd, we explored the upper west side which has the natural history museum and the best little brunch spot at 80th and Amsterdam. The hotel is also convenient to the Apple store (SE corner of Central Park), and the Capezio store (although generally I prefer Bloch). Decor was quite unified, from the custom carpet to the 60' drapes in the lobby, and the individual rooms themselves. Smallish rooms, but this is NY. My two gripes are (1) bathroom door is frosted, not solid (why is this so common? do I want to know what unspeakable things people do in the bathroom?); and (2) the shower fixture we could only turn on standing under the head, so we always got doused in cold water before it heated up. It may have been malfunctioning, but it was annoying. The bed was marvelously comfortable, and we liked the \"do not disturb\" magnet on the door. Very tricky! Otherwise, this place will have a lot of things going for it when the rooftop pool and lounge opens.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cI hate this place\u201d", "Author": "SojournerMobile", "ReviewID": "UR14401326", "Content": "The best way to describe the rooms are as expensive closets.

Suite was decent sized for NYC and all clean and new. Disappointing that the top deck bar and pool won't be ready for months yet but location was spot on for exploring the city. One thing I would say though is to keep an eye on extras being charged to your room. We were billed for merchandise that we didn't even know was supposed to be there never mind having used it. On checking out I managed to get the charge waived but they obviously need to review how they check inventories in guest rooms. The buffet breakfast wasn't the scramble we were led to believe but it was a bit ordinary and the room they opened to provide seating was utterly soul-less. Not a tip-top class hotel despite trying to charge top end prices but overall very acceptable in a city where there are some absolute shockers of rooms.", "Date": "March 15, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Empire Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d671150-Reviews-Empire_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$279 - $591*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">44 West 63rd Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10023</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514365", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f1/40/48/empire-hotel-lobby.jpg"}}
