A few steps from the hotel there is a big supermarket and the historic ice cream factory \u201cPalazzo del Freddo\u201d and enjoy the delicious ice cream they. The place is very popular and we went there every night. The hotel has Wi-Fi in the Lobby but it will be a plus if they can make possible to have access from the rooms. The hotel is close to many important places and the Termini station. You can walk to the Colosseum from the hotel (about 15 minutes), just follow Viale Manzonni but I recommend you NOT to stop if somebody try to ask you for direction pretending being a lost tourist. That is an old trick that would happen anywhere in Rome and the trick consist in stopping the victim to distract him or her by showing a map or dropping something on purpose while the accomplices try to pickpocket or grab the purse.

I have to admit that Rome was not as expected! Like any city, there are rougher areas and this hotel appeared to be on the outskirts of such an area. We were in a separate part of the hotel just of a main street on the third floor. The room was lovely and had everything that you needed for a short stay. the staff were also lovely and spent a great deal of time to make us feel welcome and mark a map out of all the best places to go and see. There were two metro stations very close by and the Termini is about 10 minutes down the road. From there you can get trains to various places and there is also a metro station here too. All the metro stations are quite clearly marked and there are only two lines so it is difficult to mess up so badly that you cannot get back! The metro is quite a scary experience if you are a first timer - especially at rush hour (7-10am). We were told to go to the Vatican early on in the morning and were a little shocked to find that you are packed so tightly onto the tube that people actually push you in and help close the doors behind you!! That being said, you can time your watch by them and they are so reliable and quick, I would definately recommend getting a ticket for the length of your stay. Vatican is AMAZING. I was walking around with tears in my eyes its so breathtaking. Don't overly panic about the dress code either - like we did! We were of the impression that we needed to look extra smart and we actually looked very daft! It is not as strict as people make out, just be respectful - dont wear shorts or inappropriate tops. I am sorry to say that I was a little disappointed in the Sistine Chapel. Its obviously a must see, but don't expect to be astounded - especially after seeing the rest of Rome. For a 2 star hotel, I would recommend this for the value for money. However, bear in mind that you will not be in the best looking area! You will be closest to the colleseum and everywhere is in walking distance. Myself and my partner walked around the entire of Rome (apart from Vatican) and I'd say that it was a great way to see it. There are so many hidden treasures that you notice when you are walking around.

One piece of advice - get a Rome Pass card (30 euros) - gives 3 days free bus/tram/subway travel but the best bit is skipping the massive queue at the Colosseum and its free entry.

When you get off at the airport there is a direct train to Termini for 11 Euro each and the hotel was only a 10 minute walk from Termini station. There was a positive and a negative for its location, the positive being that you could get anywhere very easily, with both the train and the metro being on your door step, both of which were cheap and easy to use. It also meant wherever you went, it was easy to find your way back from. However, it wasn't the most pleasant area, we didn't feel unsafe as such, just a bit uncomfortable. But we spent very little time in and around the hotel anyway so it wasn't much of an issue. The staff were very friendly, the rooms were clean and modern, We were a bit dissapointed there was no electrical outlets in the rooms, i'm guessing so you don't use excessive electricity, but there was a t.v. and a hairdryer so unless you wanted to charge anything, there wasn't need for them. The breakfast left much to be desired, coffee and 'juice' with two bread rolls, sum jam and chocolate spread. But it filled a hole. Overall it wasn't particularly glamorous but the safe was free, the rooms were clean and spacious, and the location was great, once we knew where we were going, we could walk to the Trevi Fountain in 15 minutes. It is exactly what you need for this kind of trip. And I would recomend a trip to Rome to anyone, we booked the whole holiday with Easyjet and it was really reasonably priced, the food out there is amazing (especially the ice cream) the sights are out of this world, particularly the Vatican, although I would recommend spending a bit more money and getting a guide as you could be walking around clueless for days in there and the audio guides are rubbish! Although we found the buses and trams a bit tricky to suss out, the metro was brilliant and only 4 Euro for an all day travel card. But if you've got the legs for it, it is relatively easy to walk anywhere you want, we often walked to our destination, often catchin lots of amazing sights on the way, and then got the metro back when we were tried. Villa Borghese and the musuem there are a must, not much is said about them but there were a real highlight. One word of warning, however, don't accept anything from anyone on the street. They walk around with roses and say they want to give you them as a present, then come back 5 minutes later and harass you for the money, the same with the guys doing bracelts on the Spanish Steps, they say it is lucky for them to weave it on you, then try to charge you 10 Euro for a piece of string!

The rumor also was that Coliseum was a brisk 15-20 minute walk away. Anyway, most of the hotel was recently remodeled \u2013 I think that they were still in a process of doing that. Marble floors, marble bathroom in good condition. Free safe, 5 euro a night air conditioning charge and other basic amenities. Very friendly stuff. No internet in the hotel.

Whilst our room was quite nice and seemed recently renovated and to a modern specification, the access arrangements were bizarre and the breakfast timings were very limited. The check-in and breakfast room is in an adjacent building to the bedrooms (which were within a private residential block), and entry to the bedrooms required a separate key to the main building, a lift to the 3rd floor (private apartments on the others), a buzzer entry system to get into the corridor with the hotel rooms in, and then finally you were at the door of your hotel. when we first arrived and had the buzzer system explained, we waited ages before the reception buzzed us into the corridor, and they were visibly annoyed over the tannoy and said that we should have only pressed the buzzer once. The thing was that we had been there five minutes trying to get in - it was as if they were away from the reception (adjacent building!) and hadnt heard us buzzing to try and get access. We weren't impressed. The area around the hotel is very run down, but we knew this when we booked so it didnt surprise us. The breakfast arrangements were also very limited, with a 1.5 hour window between 07.30am and 09.00am. Our hotels in Florence and Venice served between 07.00am and 10.00am. Also, unless you venture towards Termini train station there are very few eating and drinking opportunities nearby, so dont expect to come back to the hotel late on in the evening and be able to be fed and watered.
