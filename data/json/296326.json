I had a room with 2 twin bed. I chose one of the bed sto sleep in and when I pulled back the crisply ironed top cover, it was obvious that the bed had not been changed as it was covered with black hairs. Not what you want to find in a bed you are about to sleep in. Someone came to the room to change it, but obviously had never changed a bed before. Dropped the clean sheet on top of the dirty sheet . . . I slept that night in the other bed and changed rooms the next day.

As a lover of Starwoods/Westins/W Hotels, I was a little nervous about staying at a small local joint, but a trusted friend's recommendation (who travels far more than me) pushed me to give this place a try. I was not disappointed. My rating of excellent is based on the following strengths: Service: Very friendly staff, extremely helpful about the area and things tourists should know about. Afternoon and evening complimentary tea service (with sweets) is provided in the lobby, and a great way to relax after a day of sightseeing in Sultanahmet. Value: A rate of 90 euros per night for a Double room (which included a single and King bed), and free breakfast for both me and my friend on the rooftop terrace earns an excellent rating for Value. The view was nonexistent (of an air conditioner and the building next door) but the location made up for it. On the plus side, my no view first floor room shielded me from the calls to prayer, which I never heard nor woke up from in my room. Breakfast is substantial - juices (cherry, peach), coffee, breads, cereals, cheese, bread olives, meats, salads, all with a great view of Blue Mosque. The hotel cat may pay you a visit on the windowsill to ask for some of your turkey. You'll also get to meet and overhear interesting conversation from other smart travelers who choose this location. Location: Walking distance to everything: Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, Cistern, Bazaars. If you dont have a view, just step outside and zig zag your way through the charming alleys and side streets lined with cafes for less than a minute, and you are in view of the best of old town. Rooms and bed are nothing to write home about, but they were clean.

I got a great rate for a single room and appreciated the included airport pick-up. I also used the car service for an airport drop off as well. Communication after making my reservation was great. After arriving at the airport I didn't find anyone holding a sign with my name - so I called the hotel and was told the driver would be there in 5 min due to traffic - perfectly understandable as I'm well familiar with Istanbul. Connected with the driver and we were off. Arrival at the hotel was fine, check-in was easy but the front desk attendant left much to be desired - I inquired about the metro and was given a bit of basic information then told to come back after going up to my room and she would explain it to me. I came back an hour later and the attendant just stared at me - I inquired again about the metro and got a rather indifferent response so I didn't pursue it anymore. The great thing is the metro is literally around the corner and very easy to use. I didn't figure out how to purchase the electronic pass until the next day which was also my last day but this is a bit cheaper than purchasing individual tokens as is noted in other posts on Istanbul. The hotel room was fine - simple furnishing, clean and came with a decent array of toiletries. I had requested a room away from the elevator - this worked well as I did hear a bit of steps in the evening but not as much had I been at the other end of the very short hallway. I could not figure out the television and was unable to connect to the internet my entire stay - there appeared to be no signal in the room and while strong in the lobby I still couldn't \"join the network\". The breakfast buffett was full of typical turkish delights and a few hot items - nothing elaborate. The view from up top was fantastic and for those interested in the Blue Mosque and all the other tourist sites this is a great location. Check-out was fine and they held my bags as I had 4+ hours till my trip back to the airport. The trip back to the airport was issue free.

The smart new lobby is better laid out, and still very welcoming. The seating both there and in the bar has expanded, and welcomes conversation over tea or wine. Best of all are the very comfortable new beds, with bedside lamps, and the re-modeled bathrooms. The managment did a great job with this. The professional reception staff, Nuray, Benyamin, and Ozan, are anxious to help with just about anything, and are without fail friendly and attentive. They keep track of messages, luggage, and groups of friends trying to connect with each other. The cook does a bang-up job of creative breakfast buffets, and presents excellent Turkish cuisine for lunch and dinner. The masseur is popular all over the neighborhood; he serves guests from other hotels as well as those of the Ambassador, in his lovely massage center complete with mini-hamam. The cleaning and wait staff are efficient, friendly and adaptable. Finally, the view from the terrace is simply incomparable. Located directly across from the Blue Mosque (the entrance is on a little picturesque alley paralleling Divanyolu) and in full view of Hagia Sophia and the Hippodrome, we have found no other hotel to be a better value than the Ambassador.

The hotel is surrounded by many sidewalk restaurants to fit any budget, some very impressive cooking skills. For the price we paid it was truly a bargain, and the Turkish breakfast was the best of many I have enjoyed during my visits to Turkey. The staff arranged transport and suggested they provide a light 3 am breakfast for our early am departure. This helpful attitude extended from our arrival to departure. I might suggest that during Ramadan one might try to book rooms 104, 204 etc. (No view but an air shaft, but sheltered from the night time festivities in the large park between the hotel and the Blue Mosque) I'd also recommend Ramadan as a great time to visit, aside from the heat, since there are all sorts of free musical events nearly every evening amid a very festive atmosphere.

There weren't much information about the family room online and we were initially apprehensive. However, on arrival, we found the family room to be fine. It is basically two rooms with a single room opening into a bigger, double room. There is no sitting area but the rooms are comfortable enough. We are here on a conference and judging from the reports from others at the conference, rooms in the sultan ahmet areas are generally small. So - Hotel ambassador actually compares favourably. Compared to other boutique hotels, this particular hotel may not have the more \"traditional\" charms but a colleague moved out of one such hotel to ambassador because he found the other place to be uncomfortably small. So, yes - photographs can be deceptive. Rooms in Hotel Ambassador may not be large and the website may lack the charms of other hotels but we were perfectly happy with our stay for the following reasons. 1. we have read much about the roof terrace and it is true. The view from the terrace is fabulous. 2. The rooms are comfortable and spotless. The bathrooms are excellent. The rooms themselves don't have much of a view but they are quiet as the hotel is tucked away in a corner. We didn't find the prayer calls a problem at all. I slept through some nights and on the two nights when I heard the call, I drifted back to sleep easily enough. As the rooms we were in are not facing any streets, restaurants or bars - we really had restful nights. 3. the best thing about the hotel is the friendly and helpful team - ayhan (who has just left), benjamin and ismail provided excellent service. They are the reason why we prefer small hotels. The staff made our stay in Turkey memorable. My only suggestion to the hotel is for them to improve their breakfast. The breakfast is adequate but it gets repetitive. With the big range of summer fruit available in the market, I am just surprised that there were not more options. It would also be nice if they could provide turkish coffee rather than the disappointing nescafe as part of the breakfast. However, it is hard to be dissatisfied when you can break your fast to view of the blue mosque and aya sofia. If you are staying there for 1 or two days, this will not be an issue. However, we have been here for a week and do look forward to some variety. We noticed some complaints about the air-conditioning and were also concerned. However, we stayed in two different rooms and had no problem with the air-conditioning at all. The family room comes with its own air-conditioning unit but the junior suite on the 4th floor is cooled by the central system. It is not chilly and this may be a problem for those who like really cold rooms but it cools the room to a comfortable level, We are so comfortable with the place and we have booked to stay in ambassador again on our return leg in August.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in the centre of the historic town\u201d", "Author": "SB_ANorthampton", "ReviewID": "UR68316334", "Content": "The Ambassador hotel is lovely.

Be that as it may, our one night stay in the hotel was money's worth essentially because of its fantastic location & its super view from the terrace where b'fast is also served . Blue Mosque & many other monuments could be seen from the terrace top & we took some fabulous pictures from there. In fact we had the pleasure of feeding sea gulls who come visiting the roof-top restaurant. We alsp spent a lovely evening on the roof top where nice seating has been arranged 7 you can enjoy your drinks there. The rooms were in keeping with the low 100 usd- tarrif. Bathrooms a trifle small but ok. Unfortunately in our friend's room the air-condtioner did not work well, despite complaint & their effort to set it right the locationin popular Sultanet Ahmet could not be better with a lively market right out side the hotel & plenty of restaurants & bars to choose from.The Mosque & other monuments were at a stone's throw& Trains & bus stops merely 50 meters away. a special word of praise for the staff who were very helpfull & cooperative. Two negatives : the hotel is 20-30 meters from the road where taxi drops you. A narrow but lively cobbled lane takes you to the hotel. No bell-boys to help you with your luggage.
