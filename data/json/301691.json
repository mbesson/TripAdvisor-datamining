This hotel has evolved into our home when in Dubai, such is the warm welcome we always receive from the Staff, commencing with a car transfer from the airport to the hotel which takes less than 10 minutes. The Club Select Rooms are tastefully furnished with solid wood furniture, and the en-suite facilities are most comprehensive. The King size beds are very comfortable indeed and the tea and coffee making facilities provided in the room are accompanied by complimentary water bottles. The LCD television is of a good size and Sky News is offered amongst the many channels available. My recommendation would be to purchase a bed and breakfast package, since the breakfasts provided will delight even the most discerning palate. There is a Business Centre located in the lobby to provide an hour of free Internet access per day for e-mail use etc, and the opportunity to check in on-line with your airline is very convenient indeed. The restaurants within the hotel provide a varied menu of classical arabic food and Italian cuisine, in a very relaxed atmosphere of quiet comfort. It is a non-alcoholic hotel however this proves to be quite acceptable since the alternative drinks offered are wide and varied. I cannot praise the Coral Deira hotel highly enough for the mnanner with which every guest is treated as a friend and afforded every consideration. During our recent stay, we just missed the complimentary bus service to the shopping Mall at Deira City, and they arranged for us to travel with the General Manager into the City area in his limousine, as he was to attend a business meeting close by.

I'm really not sure where all those negative revies are coming from I've had ONLY 2 unpleasant occasions: 1. First time they were supposed to pick me up from the airport but it tokk me forever to go thought passport control so there was noone at the airport arrivals waiting for me. I called the hotel and they told me to take any taxi and they'll pay the bill, which they really did. 2. Some other time I arranged (free) transfer back to the aiport with them but it was some odd time in the middle of the night for a red-eye flight so when I checked out there was no transportation waiting. However, the receptionist solved it and 15min later I had my transfer. Well, 2 other slight negative is that they have one very serious-faced waitress (hostess?) in the breakfast restaurant. I think she could act a bit more friendly. Then they also have one rather annoying doorman who grabs your bag from your hands every single time you show up at the entrance, even if they are so small that there is obviously no need for help. A tip beggar, really, kind of annoying. I NEVER had any problems witch check-in or booking or them ignoring my e-mails, quite the opposite: I need visa to enter Dubai (arranged by the hotel) and sometimes my requests are very confusing and changing: my travel dates change, or are pending, or my required visa type changes, or I need to split/combine the bookings.. So, every single time the reply very fast, with all the info I'm asking, with great willigness to jump through all the hoops with all my messy requests, making sure someone else picks up my case immediately if the initial person goes on holiday etc, their \"visa manager\" always deals with me personally, in e-mails and in person, there's always a cold welcome drink upon arrival etc. Moreover, they are flexible with my check-out times (check out at 9pm with no extra charge), always fresh flowers in my room (with some hotel chocolates and flower petals on my bed), always complimentary bottle of water (not just the first one). Another time they picked up my additional visa charge (charged by coressponding government authorities) despite the screw-up that caused the charge was from my side AND still gave me late check out option at no extra charge... Anyways, my rooms are always decent size, clean, comfortable and well equipped, the staff is very nice and helpful (except for that one serious waitress and that one beggar doorman)... Someone complained about no iron in the room, no alcohol in the hotel and about construction/ugly view. Well, it is Dubai, you know. Meaning, construction everywhere and absence of alcohol - is NORMAL for that city. Sure, there are are hotels with lovely views and/or no construction nearby but those would be in a different price category. Given reality of Dubai as whole Coral Deira has TOTALLY NORMAL price/value ratio. As for the iron, once again - it's Dubai. \"Outsourcing\" that sort of work is so affordable and widely spread here that noone would imagine that a 4*-5* hotel guest would even consider doing it himself. Location - close to the airport, a couple of decent malls and a handful of nice restaurants. I agree that it's not in the best spot for visiting the main attractions of contemporary Dubai, all the westernized, brand new skyscrapers and all that jazz. But if you want to get a feel of more \"real\" Dubai, more authentic - and delicious and cheap! -restaurants - then the location is excellent.

Apart from that, the hotel was excellent, staff were helpful and can arrange most day trips/excursions. The rooms are excellent and clean.

It is also EXTREMELY difficult to get a taxi outside the hotel, the few that pass by don't want to stop and walking to the nearby shopping mall doesn't help either and people will jump in your taxi that you've been waiting for.

The 3rd bed was not as comfortable as the others. When the room was serviced they seemed to forget there were 3 of us and would leave towels for only 2 people. The bathroom had no window nor was there any form of ventilation and it got very misty and unpleasent when we showered and used the toilet.

Taxis are very hard to get late in the evening back to hotel. Now the good news. Breakfast was plentiful and varied to suit all tastes but if you leave it till the last minute to have breakfast it was very busy and the waiters were unable to attend to everyone. Deira Shopping Mall is 15 min from hotel. It is huge so allow at least half a day to go round the place and it's not expensive but Emirates Mall is just full of designer shops and unless you have unlimited funds then give it a miss. Plenty of places to eat outside the hotel which are reasonably priced. Gold souk is overwelming and you need lots of time if you want to haggle and get a reasonable bargain. The gold shops in Mina Bazaar were best and i made a few purchases here. We went on the curtousey bus to the sister hotel at the beach which was a very pleasent day. Desert Safari is a must. When you get there you can pay to go on the sand buggies but haggle the price as we witnessed an American being charged twice what we had been. It's a case of what can they get away with.

Upon presenting our online prepaid accommodation voucher, we were told there was no record of us. The guy on reception made some enquiries, couldn't sort it out and so said we would need to pre-authorise to pay the 1000 Dirham a standard room cost. Fair enough - even though this was the last thing you need at that time of night - he assured us all would be sorted out in the morning. Next day, I went down to the lobby and explained to one of the staff what had happened - they informed me that the local agent had not received the booking. I then showed the hotel the confirmation emails AND my credit card online receipt to show how I had already paid for the room. Enter Mr helpful - possibly named Imad, although he didn't introduce himself. He checked the emails and credit card statements over and over and then finally phoned the company - I was asked to speak to them. They told me the mistake was the hotel's and that they would sort it out. To cut a long story short, let's just say that at 4:30 I had had enough. Almost 4 hours later I was left with no other option but to forcefully and loudly articulate my dissatisfaction at the front desk. Enter someone with customer service training. A Sri Lankan man with impeccable manners and understanding. He immediately offered us complimentary food and drinks in the restaurant (which incidentally suffered from the same lack of training - staff bringing out fried eggs instead of Caesar salad and bringing out ice-cream desert at the same time as the main course!). He also sorted out our transport to the airport and this was much appreciated - 45 minutes later he had the whole matter sorted. As for the tall black gentleman (Imad) - he was more concerned with letting us know that it was the travel agency who had made the mistake - not the hotel. He didn't seem to realise that when you have one day in Dubai, you don't want to spend it in endless arguments at the front desk. Even though the problem may not have been the hotel's fault, the way it was handled was atrocious and it ruined the last day of our holiday. The hotel (material) is fine, it's the total lack of customer care shown by some staff that lets it down a bagful. If you want to stay somewhere that you can be sure of quality service, this is not the place. Did someone say 5 star?

Well not in this so called 5* Hotel. Plus there is no ironing board available. I stayed for a week and could not find a person on the staff who could tell me how to call a local cell phone. If you have guests visiting you, be ware, ask them to bring their passport or other photo ID. Guests are not allowed in your room. Specially if they are of opposite gender. There are two restaurants. An Indian and an all in one. Food was average at best. Transportation to and from hotel a bit risky. Please confirm and reconfirm the day before arrival and departure. Although I had booked the room with early arrival and paid for it the room was not ready and got charged anyway for full day for getting the room just 2 hours early. Ok now the pluses. There are two Shopping centers nearby within walking distance but be prepared for a price shock. No bargains there. There is a small Grocery Store right next to the Hotel ( Right had side if facing the hotel ) from which you can buy water. YES Hotel will not provide water even at a resonable price. I dont understand the comment that others have about convinient location. Convinient for what exactly. Going to 2 malls? Things are close to everything. Dubai is no Texas. its about the size of Rhode island at best. Things cant be very far in such a tiny place. But be prepared for long delays caused by trafic. To travel about 7 KM, or lets say 5 miles to where the business district is took about an hour in the middle of the day . So if you are going on a business trip find a location near your meeting place. Another thing about this 5* hotel. No free internet access. Oh yes the Business center has 2 machines. IF you take your lap top have a Flash memory stick and may be you will get lucky in them being able to print anything for you. As for the staff, over all good but ver few folk swith good command on English. Had to explain things several times. to get it right. If I had to compare to US based hotels / motel. I would say it was more like a Days inn or similar hotel. Generally clean, but carpets on my floor were very dirty and room next to me was being repared so had constant noise.
