As for the hotel, it was a mid-level European hotel. The bed was very firm. It was getting to be rather warm in our room, but they say that is Rome in May. The location was amazing on Via Sistina just a few doors down from the Hotel Hassler at the top of the Spanish Steps. The subway station was only a block away, at the bottom of the Spanish Steps. There were some amazing restaurants within a 5 minute block (our hands down favorite was Enoteca Antica on Via della Croce). My wife found a wonderful leather shop nearby too.

The hotel is nicely situated for a tourist who is in a hurry but for those that may have more time, I'd suggest heading out of the historical core and stay across the river Arno near the Ottaviano and Lepanto Metro stations as you will still have access to the Metro but will be staying where the Romans actually live and work.

The hotel location was actually rather inconvenient for him - he was attending a conference for 3 days of our trip - but he wanted the location to be good for us overall. It was. Hotel Internazionale is just yards away from the top of the Spanish Steps - and therefore a Metro train station stop. Other places looked farther away on a map than they really were. LOTS of places are within walking distance, including a really good coffee bar and a Blue Ice gelato store. :) The hotel staff was, in general, exceptionally nice and helpful. The gentleman who worked the overnight shift did not speak English as well as the daytime staff, nor was he as polite and friendly... but he was still decent, not rude or anything. The daytime staff was absolutely wonderful. Housekeeping did a fantastic job as well. They never barged in or bothered us, but whenever we came back after being gone for a while the room was in perfect order. They even left me a couple extra hotel pens when I left them a note requesting them. :) The room itself was very nice. Very spacious for a European room, from what I've been told. The closet had plenty of room and included a mini bar/fridge and a safe. The bathroom had a double sink vanity, and even a bidet! There was a desk with chair, and also a small loveseat. The room also came with a tv (reception was poor but tolerable) and a radio. A window in the bedroom area, and a second one in the bathroom, looked out into a private courtyard area. It was nice being able to open the windows and get fresh air but not have to worry about people looking into our room. The air conditioner/thermostat was a bit finicky but after about 2 days we got it to do what we wanted! The mattress on the bed was a bit firm for my personal taste, and the pillows were a bit TOO mushy, but I managed to sleep ok anyway. The hotel offers breakfast every morning until 10 a.m. in a designated room. The room is closed after 10 a.m. so it took us a few minutes to figure out exactly where it was, but we eventually found it. Don't go in barefoot, though! I got kicked out for trying to just walk downstairs and eat breakfast with no shoes on one morning. Whoops. The food is the Italian equivalent of a continental breakfast - eggs, bacon, various pastries and cereals, with some cheeses and meats also offered. Coffee is included; juices have an extra charge. You can get the breakfast brought to your room, or enjoy it on the hotel's 4th floor garden balcony, for an additional fee. We chose to just eat in the breakfast area for free and it was fine. Room service is offered but we did not utilize it so I can't comment on that. There is also a small snack bar/bar just off the lobby. It was closed every time we came back to the hotel at night so I can't comment on that, either. The hotel does have wireless internet access. We were told that it would not work in our room - that we'd have to go down to the access area in the lobby - but that turned out to be incorrect. The wireless signal worked just fine in our room. There is a computer available for public use in the lobby area, and it has a printer attached, so that is helpful if you want to print a map or a boarding pass. If and when we return to Rome we will probably stay somewhere else just because there are SO MANY nice hotels to choose from, but Hotel Internazionale served us well and was a great value overall. We really have nothing bad to say about it.

The rooms are filthy, stained carpets, water damaged walls, around 30 years worth of dust on the furniture and curtains. Paying 220 euro a night you would expect a moderate place, but seriously this place is the pits. The staff are useless. My husband had a fight with the staff as soon as we got there and demanded a room change. Our initial room was no bigger than a closet, and had no hot water(it took 30 minutes for the hot water to come through in a trickle enough for one person to have a very quick shower). They finally changed us to what they describe as their superior room. Judging by the photos i would hardly call it superior.It borders on backpacker budget. The breakfast is horrible. We contemplated changing hotels but it was our last stop before heading home and we were exhausted. However looking back now, we wished we had changed. There was a gorgeus little hotel around the corner called Hotel Homs, where we would have coffe every morning(and even breakfasts after experiencing the Internazionale's breakfast). We were only there 3 days and the waitress would recognise us and know exactly what we wanted at the Hotel Homs. It is miles ahead of the internationale, and we even enquired about the cost of the room and it would have only been 200 euro. The bed was broken, we couldnt even move around without the thought that we may fall off.The only small positive is its location right at the top of the spanish steps.

The rooms were clean, and a good place to rest in the middle (because it is very warm), and end of the day. I loved opening the shutter each morning and seeing the Italians go to work.

Booked via Venere.com after trawling many sites and hotels. We decided on the Internationale as it was central and reasonably priced. We were a little concerned as we didn't see that many reviews for the hotel and those we did, were ok. We booked a double superior room at 230 euros per night. We took the leanardo shuttle train straight from the aiport into the center of Rome - only 30 minute on a direct train. Very easy. From the termini station in Rome we took a taxi as it looked a fair walk from the station and we had a large case. Taxi cost 5 euros. We were able to check in to the hotel early as the room was ready. We were given room 27. Upon entering the room I was disappointed. We were given a room at the back of the hotel that was looking onto an atrium rather than the street. Due to this the room was very dark with no natural light coming in the windows. Once our eyes settled to the darkness and we turned all the lights on we were happier with the room. The sheets and towels were clean and bed comfy. The only downside was the room could have been given a little tlc. The edges of the carpets were frayed, the skirting boards were loose from the walls and the paint work needed touched up. The bathroom was large but the walls were a little mouldy - a lick of paint would have sorted it out. If we left the main lights off you wouldn't notice any of these things. The room had a mini bar that had plenty room for us to store our own water and wine - save on the hotel prices. Breakfast was included in our rate and we went only once to the dinning room. Standard continential breakfast with cereal, fruits, ham, cheese etc. If you wanted eggs you were expected to pay anything from 3 euros up. The hotel as a lovely terrace on top of the hotel that you can take breakfast on for 10euro a head - bit pricey but view is lovely. We went up to the terrace after a day out sight seeing and the view was stunning. We thought that had they had a bar on that floor it would have been complete. Overall the hotel was ok. When in Rome you are only needed a place to sleep and this did the trick. Rome itself is lovely. Everything is walking distance.

The lobby was cool, but when we entered our room, the AC was running, but it seemed hotter than it was outside. The AC ran the whole time, but it was always uncomfortably hot in the room. The room itself was also pretty run down. On the first day, we needed to do laundry. There were no prices on the checklist in the room, so I called the main desk and they did not have a price list, so I took a leap of faith and the laundry we did in Florence for for 8 euros cost us 129 at the hotel! I was pretty upset to see this at checkout, so I asked for the price list again and they still couldn't come up with one. At our next hotel, their price list confirmed that each item was on average about 5 euros, so I would recommend doing your laundry outside the hotel at all costs, but that doesn't really excuse them not having a price list. The only saving grace for this hotel, is that is probably the cheapest hotel that is within a block of the Spanish Steps, but not really worth the 250 euro/night charge.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "Henny&Roth", "ReviewID": "UR6555896", "Content": "We stayed for 7 nights at this hotel.

I had been trying without luck for some info on this hotel on tripadvisor, but was never able to find anything current. The hotel is located at the top of the Spanish Steps, on via sistina, which runs parallel to the top of the Spanish Steps. The hotel at the top is the Hassler; on the same block is the Intercontinental, then the Internazionale. So the location is ideal. We could walk everywhere. We went with another family and I have 3 kids. The other family has 2 young boys. They stayed in room 34, which was very nice---high ceilings, lots of charm and a working air conditioner. This room faces the street on the 3rd floor. My husband and I split up because of the 3 kids. My daughter and I stayed in room 34, which was also nice, faced the street and had a good air conditioner, but was in desperate need of paint. There was no dresser, just a 60's style wardrobe. It had high ceilings, wood floors and a beautiful old rug. The walls needed work. Overall I liked the room for it's charm. My husband, on the other hand, had a triple--a room facing the courtyard. It had a nice patio, BUT it was hot. The air conditioner was old and could not cool the room. Although this was August, it rained and was only in the 80's during the hottest times. His room was also on the 3rd floor---room 40. My husband found it old and outdated. I was originally given room 35, but moved because the air conditioner did not cool the room. My husband moved to room 24, because we thought it would be just like the room above it where our friends were staying. Unfortunately, the air con. was in the hall and didn't come close to cooling the large room. So, my friend, who is italian, talked the hotel into upgrading him to the suite on the 4th floor. The suite, the only one the hotel has, is two bedrooms with a bathroom between them. It's more like two connecting rooms. It also faced the courtyard. It had two air conditioners, which also couldn't keep up with the heat. My husband thought maybe because it was on the 4th floor (the top floor). The whole hotel needs updating. The walls need paint, the furniture is 60s in some rooms and nice in others. The beds are firm. The bathrooms are adequate. The rooms are all very very dark. All the rooms I saw (and there were a lot!) were large. The ceilings are high. The rooms are all different. The hallways are old and tired. They have a beautiful old staircase which is roped off. The staircase they use is rather unattractive. The lobby is 60's, 70's. The hotel has great bones, but needs work. If they fixed it up, I'm sure they could get $400 - $500 a night. It could be just great with all of it's old world charm and a great location. It is not at all luxurious in any way. I'm a light sleeper and never had a problem with noise. I wouldn't stay below the breakfast area (3rd floor facing the courtyard). The breakfasts were good. The service was also good. The air conditioning was a big issue. If the weather had been hot, even in the 90's, I think we may have had to move hotels--although my room was fine. The majority of the rooms were not fine. So, my experience was different than my husband's. I hate Hiltons and large hotels with no charm. I felt like I was in Italy. I would stay here again, but I don't think my husband would. If you do decide to stay here, ask for the 3rd floor, away from the breakfast area. Ask for a room with a new air conditioner (the new ones are white, the old ones are beige), ask for a street view--they are more charming, less noisy and more updated.(--Although I thought room 40 was very charming--but right across from breakfast and the A/C didn't really work.) And I loved room 34, but it was a quad. We were gone for a month and ended our trip at the Airport Hilton in Rome. My kids thought it was 10 times more luxurious than the Internazionale. This was our first trip to Rome so I have nothing to compare it to.
