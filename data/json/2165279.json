We both had a very pleasent stay and the staff was outstanding. The hotel atmosphere was very peaceful and fresh. The gentleman on reception was very welcoming and printed off the transportation information to city centre. The room was lovely, the added amenities in the room such as the lavender linen spray, complimentary spring water, slippers and robe was a nice touch. The bed was so comfortable and felt very rested. Breakfast at the One o One Restaurant was very delicious and filling. The Manhattan Lounge was also very nice. Me and my partner really appreciated the late check-out the last day, as I was was not feeling my best and gave me extra time to rest. The house keeper even gave me an extra bottle of water to make me feel better. Even though the hotel was located out of city centre the transportation was quick, and only within 5min walk from the hotel to the trams. A hotel is only as good as there staff. Well done to the team at Crown Plaza. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haifa, Israel", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best in Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "GuyHadar", "ReviewID": "UR127403474", "Content": "The Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South is a great hotel in a not so bad location.

This Crowne Plaza, however, is probably the best I have stayed at. Very good rooms and very quiet, even though the hotel was quite full because of a business convention. Staff are excellent and the bar and restaurant food was quite good (try the suckling pig if it's on the menu). You may find yourself using one or both of the bar/restaurant as, like others have said, this hotel is out in the financial district and there doesn't appear to be much in the vicinity. It is a plus that the hotel is near the RAI and the airport but I can see that if you were visiting Amsterdam for sightseeing, you would want to get this hotel at a very good rate in order to allow for the need to travel into the city. Overall, if you need a hotel that is near the RAI, I think this one will fit the bill. If you are sightseeing, stay closer to the city unless you can get a really good rate at this one.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood business hotel\u201d", "Author": "Erannn", "ReviewID": "UR125846443", "Content": "New hotel.

While the hotel itself was very nice, I have had EXTENSIVE, ONGOING problems with fraudulent credit card charges from the hotel. I reserved and paid for the hotel using a third party (Hotwire). Upon arrival, I was asked to put down a credit card for incidentals. Because they wouldn't take any of my American credit cards except for my Visa debit card, I had to use that. The only incidental I should have been charged for was a bottle of water from the minibar. A few days later, the hotel charged my debit card for almost $2,000. I spent about $30 on several international phone calls attempting to get the money refunded by the hotel. It took about 10 days, but it was finally resolved. They shorted me about $50 on changes in the exchange rate, but I just gave up at that point. I was given no explanation for what had happened other than it was a \"computer problem\" and no one ever apologized or even seemed concerned. It was frustrating, but mistakes happen. However, yesterday I was charged another $600 by this hotel. It has been almost 2 months since my stay. I am reporting this charge as fraudulent and canceling my credit card. There is absolutely no reason a hotel should be fraudulently charging customers two months after their stay, computer problem or not. Other things to note - the hotel seemed very clean. However, the mini bar refrigerator in our room had several leftover items in it from previous guests (half empty water bottles, coffee mugs filled with some type of liquid). Also, the location is in the middle of nowhere and none of the businesses surrounding it were open on the weekend.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGood Quality Business Accommodation\u201d", "Author": "Mark S", "ReviewID": "UR124122353", "Content": "I was booked into here as there was a shortage of accommodation in my usual AMS hotel.

As I needed the box I called the hotel and found out they located the box. When I requested it to be sent they weren't ready for it as there was no procedure for it yet and they didn't have any boxes to sent it in. The next day I travelled by car to pick it up.
