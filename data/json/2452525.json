We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. In fact, we are lucky enough to receive a complimentary upgrade to deluxe room by the manager, Mr Mehmet & let us to check in very early after an early arrival with no extra charge. The rooms were great, decorated with very good taste & luxury!! I cannot forget the softness of that bed. Bathroom had separate shower and tub. Free wifi. Unfortunately we did not try the hotel spa. All in all we really enjoyed our stay, this hotel is highly recommended, and would not hesitate to stay here again.

The staff's attitude was not professional except Mr Morchay and the personal who served the breakfast. Mr Mehmed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attitude was worst.We had 4 rooms , 2 of them were small and dark,and when I asked him nicely if we could change one of them he replied in an unpleasent manner that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the matter of money and if one pay less can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect better!We paid 120 US dollar for one standard room! Now when I check online I see that with almost that amount of money we could have a Royal suit or family room (1680kr/night)for 2 couples if we had been given better information! The other exampel was when I asked him for a secound key.We got just one key when we arrived and the other day, my housband was out and when I asked him for another one,he gave it to me under condition that I have to pay if I loose it ,again in an unfriendly manner!", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul", "Title": "\u201cFriendly helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "ValerisaIstanbu...

The staff are well trained and the hotel is certainly very comfortable. Quality furniture and materials too. Very comfortable beds and Wifi reliable. Nice location in the old city and next to Aksaray tram stop so there is easy access to all over Istanbul. Quick check in-out, complimentary coffee, tea in room. I stayed there 4 nights and actually booked for my sister - I will definitely stay there on my next planned trip. The hotel is very elegant and the staff are very friendly, the rooms were clean and the airconditioning is perfect. We also had an upgrade from a standard to a deluxe room free of charge, that was very nice from the hotel!

Location: if you are not willing to take the tram or walk 20min to the main attractions, do not stay here. Although it is advertised as being in Sultanahmet, the neiborhood does not even resemble it; on top of that, even the taxi drivers say that this is not a good place to stay (as we were told by the one who picked us up at the airport). 2. Service is a nightmare. Staff seem to speak english but they do not understand a word, trying to solve a problem is impossible. Our room had a problem with the hermetic window which allowed the freezing air of winter enter, hence the room never got warmed despite the heating. To fix it they offered two solutions: to fix it ourselves with tape (it sounds like a joke, but this was for real!!), or to go to a lousy room with the promise of getting the window fixed by the next day. By the next day they gave us our room back with the window broken. When I told them that the problem persisted and showed them the broken window, they tried to make the case that I had broken it. I simply had to leave the hotel, and find a new one. But, this is the worse part, as I was booking a new hotel from my laptop using their wifi, they cut the access.... Do not get fooled by the nice pictures (though the hotel is good looking in reality), this hotel is a rip-off!", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grand Durmaz Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2452525-Reviews-Grand_Durmaz_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$117 - $392*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Ataturk Bulvari Kemalpasa Mah.
