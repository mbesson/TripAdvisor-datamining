Great location and we loved the view of the CN Tower we had from our room--truly spectacular. On the flight home, however, my partner and I discovered that we had been sharing our bed with bedbugs! Now, the management is likely to say in response that there's no way of knowing what the bites from or when they occurred but unfortunately I have some past experience with these critters and know what I'm talking about. We just hope we didn't bring them home with in our suitcases!

It's in a good location in the city, two blocks from subways going in either direction, a 15 minute walk to the Air Canada Centre or Hockey Hall of Fame, close to the entertainment district, etc. Inside, it's your typical big city Sheraton. The hotel bar is way in the back, but quiet for getting work done. The rooms are fine. The valet is awful. Truly awful. Probably the worst valet I've ever seen. Just be prepared for it, and call to get your car 20-30 minutes early. Don't tip. I'm a liberal tipper generally but refuse to tip for a valet that takes a half hour to get my car. Note that if you're cheap and book on sites like Priceline or Hotwire you don't get SPG benefits at this hotel. This seems to be SPG policy but enforcement varies by location. This hotel is strict about it. You get one or two double beds, and you have to pay if you'd like anything bigger. Still, you should give them your number for incidentals. I still got my SPG Gold bonus points even though I was not awarded any points for the base price of the room.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ithaca, NY", "Title": "\u201cexcellent March break!\u201d", "Author": "family-traveler256", "ReviewID": "UR126400577", "Content": "We came to the hotel to attend a professional conference but brought our kids.

Check-in can be slow but it is volume only. The desk staff is courteous and efficient. The rooms are good for the most part. They could use some more lighting as they never seem fully lit. The bathroom is clean but sparse. The bed is comfy but the pillows aren't firm enough for my taste. We always park under Nathan Phillips Square and leave the car for the entire weekend. We have never had an issue, the cost is reasonable, the parkade is open 24 hours. You can walk or take a taxi just about everywhere that you might want to go. We never fail to get a view of Nathan Phillips Square, Old City Hall and the city skyline, which we always enjoy, coming from a much smaller city. There is much cheaper food to be had outside of the hotel, but having said that, we did have dinner at the hotel once and it was good (but rather pricey). There is a Tim Horton's just outside of the hotel, and a coffee shop that sells Starbucks in the Lobby (again, somewhat pricey). The Eaton's Centre is a short walk and the Bay can be reached by the underground concourse. They have a great variety of prepared food for sale in their Marketplace. Our conference facilities were very good, they handle large volumes of people very well. The facility is well-signed so my room was easy to find.

Temperature control was an issue, as I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it below 73 degrees F even at the coldest settings with the fan on high. Major hotel pet peeve: locating those big heater/air conditioning boxes directly under the window where the closed curtains cover the upward flow is plain dumb.

Having been to Toronto and the Sheraton before I knew the valet parking is expensive ($45 per night). There are other options, such as parking under city hall (entrance off of Queen right at the Sheraton Centre). This ran us about $14 a day in comparison and it is accessible to the Sheraton without even having to go outside! Check-in was quick and we were upgraded to one of their Jacuzzi Salon Suites. These rooms are large and have a good sized Jacuzzi tub with a nice skyline view. The rooms are starting to show a bit of wear and tear as well. We were told that the Club lounge was closed, which is unfortunate as it is one of the main reasons for booking the Sheraton. I would have expected to be offered a free appetizer or something at the restaurant as is done at many other Sheraton's when the Club lounge is closed, but that was not the case. We found a nearby restaurant in its place and had a good time there. The biggest complaint I had was the temperature in the room. Upon entering we cranked the temperature down to 18.5 because it was swealtering in the room. It never got anywhere close to that temp, my guess was that the room started off at 26 or so and might have gotten down to 23 or 24. One of the nicest things with the Sheraton though is connection to the PATH, which allows you to get to the Eaton Centre without having to go outside. This was nice since we walked to the mall without having to take a jacket. The pool is also really nice at the Sheraton, it is an indoor/outdoor heated pool. The only downside to it right now is the Fitness centre is undergoing rennovations so the pool area had some pretty serious fumes (paint or varnish or something).

Again, very pleased, as this was not expected - Upgraded to a king suite on the 25th floor, instead of the club floor standard king room which I had booked. Ideas for next time: - When I was waiting in the priority line, the hotel duty manager asked me twice if I was a Gold/Platinum member, in such a way that was a little disappointing. It was almost as if he did not believe I was. I was dressed casually as this was a personal stay vs. business. As a younger professional, this happens often, so I would not negatively review the hotel over it, just something to keep in mind. - Turn down service was not available due to the hotel being full that night, which is understandable. An idea would be to have this service for Gold/Platinum members regardless of hotel capacity - Front desk wanted to charge me 5.00 for a wine opener, which was annoying since they had sent me the bottle of wine in the first place; I called though and had the charge removed. - Upon booking, I had specifically had asked for a room on a higher floor facing Nathan Phillips square so that I could watch the fireworks, which was not available upon check in. I was given a suite on the 25th floor, instead of a club standard room which I had booked originally, however, it is my understanding that I would have received that anyway due to my member status. So that was disappointing. - Breakfast was a little picked over due to the amount of people staying, and it would have been nice to have some protein (eggs).

We were shocked to learn that the cost of valet parking was $45 which is the highest price I've seen in any hotel including those in downtown Ottawa and Montreal. At the end of our visit when we collected our car the radio channel was changed and the volume was blasting. I do not think this is acceptable. The line up to check in was extremely long. It took over 20 minutes to get to the front of the line. The front desk staff member was efficient and friendly. We chose to upgrade to a club room although the price quoted was more than the stated price on the internet. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable but the room was small. The evening snacks and breakfast in the club lounge were about what we would have expected and in line with those at other hotels. Every other room had a paper in the morning but for some reason we did not receive one. The view from our 42nd floor room was pretty incredible. We had a late snack in the hotel bistro after the show of beer and nachos. There were very few people in the bar. The food was fine but the service was not great. Our waiter just seemed to disappear after we got our menus and it took a long time (over 15 minutes) for him to return and we had another long wait for a beer. Next time we would sit at the bar instead of the booth because I think he forgot about us. I was frustrated to find an extra charge on our credit card when I checked it after our stay. This happens from time to time at these hotels and it really irritates me. I would never consider touching the overpriced snacks.

I have stayed at the Sheraton before and have always had a pleasant stay. I have to admit, I was not disappointed this time either but I have to say, the rooms were looking a bit more tired this time around. However, the beds are just as comfortable as ever! The best thing about the Sheraton is that is very close to The Eaton Centre - one of the best shopping centres in Canada. It is convenient for families & business guests. The biggest plus is that I was able to get a rate that included parking. At $45 a day for valet parking, this expense can add up quickly if you are in town for a long weekend. I was hoping to get an upgrade to a club room in order to get access to the club dining room (which sits at the top of the hotel and provides spectacular views). My sister-in-law often stayed at the Sheraton so I was able to sample the delicious breakfast buffet in the Club Lounge. I was disappointed to see that the this lounge was primarily closed of over the holiday season. I still feel that people do continue to work during the season or at least for for New Years and family visits. It is a shame that this 'perk' is not available then. One big criticism that I have of the Sheraton is the amount of personnel that they had at check-in & check-out time. There was a considerable line up so if you want to check out from the comfort of your room, I would suggest you try that instead of waiting (that is what I did but the person I drove down with had not so there was a bit of waiting involved). I would suggest that you try to get a view facing City Hall. Any other view will just get you a view of other buildings and is not as interesting.

After a couple of moments, we worked out that the entry is via the undercover parking area. So weaving our bags through the hodgepodge of parked cars, we found the entrance. Wow, the foyer was almost breath-taking. It is complete with cosy chairs, coffee shop, bar... not to mention huge waterfall and landscaped gardens. Quite amazing given the discomforting disorientation we just had. Check in was relatively smooth, although I would suggest it would be a whole lot faster if all of the clerks weren't desperately signing up guests to their rewards program. It was a rabble of features being repeated over and over along the line. The room was very nice and relatively large. I had booked a king, but was given two queens. Upon questioning, I was told the only room with a king that was available was an 'Accessible Room', which I declined as I thought it would be selfish to take up a room which someone might actually need, for the sake of a wider bed. My room overlooked City Hall and the heritage park across the road. Nice, but not very exciting. Bathroom was big and well appointed, except for the bath-tub. Small and uncomfortable - no long soaking here. Get in, get out. The location was second to none. A short walk East, and you hit the Eaton Centre, Yonge+Dundas Square and Yonge Street. A short walk West, and you're in the beginnings of the Queen West revival, with hot boutiques and cool caf\u00c3\u00a9s and bars. To the South, you'll hit King Street, where you could mistake it for NYC on some street corners. Room service was over-priced for the quality.

The views from this room are great but there are not enough seats to accommodate all guests at peak times, tables that become free are not cleared of dirty plates promptly etc. One morning I was pushed out of the way by a member of staff who wanted to replenish a container I was standing at. There was no \"excuse me\" or apology. Our room on this occasion was clean. I find that the Sheraton lacks the finesse of other hotels of a similar standard. It is so large and clearly has a large conference market that independent travelers can appear to just \"make up the numbers\". The location is ideal but make sure you stay in the Queen tower. Skip the \"free\" breakfast and go next door to Tim Horton's where you are much more likely to get a chair and a clean table at which to sit!", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cheshiremackat", "Title": "\u201cNice weekend treat\u201d", "Author": "cheshiremackat", "ReviewID": "UR121986890", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for a nice weekend away from the house.

After reading a number of reviews I was worried we would would get a small, inferior room. I did try to call the hotel directly a day ahead to request a king bedded room but was told that priceline rooms were assigned at check-in and requests could not be taken in advance. Check in: We arrive at about 2 pm, were the only ones at the checking in counter. Vernon, the gentleman at check-in was warm and seemed sincerely glad we were there. He left a very good first impression on us. I asked for a king-bedded room, he said he would make sure we had a nice room and he did! We were in room 3223, overlooking city hall. The floor was marked as \"preferred\", we were thrilled! We were there the Monday night before Christmas and the hotel did not appear to be very full so that probably helped. Room: We were on the 32nd floor with an amazing view. The windows went wall to wall. The city lights at night were a sight to see from that vantage point. The bed was indeed comfortable and the bedding impressive. Nice comfy pillows. The furnature was upscale, very nice. The heat worked well, we were comfortable. There was a big comfy chair with an outoman in front of the window. The TV was a flatscreen which we didn't watch much. The bathroom was typical. The water pressure good. If you were there for more than a day or two, you might find the vanity space meager. The towels were fluffy. No fridge but an ice machine on every floor. We did bring a little cooler with us. We felt very fortunate to get assigned this room. A Globe and Mail was outside our door in the morning. Nice touch! I did look at some of the other rooms on other floors when the doors were open and they were getting cleaned. There were some rooms that were considerably smaller, only a queen bed in a much smaller space. The amenities looked the same, the bedding nice but smaller. I'm guessing if the hotel was in high season, this is what we would have gotten for the price we paid. The hallways on the lower floors I looked at did not seem to have been renovated and were slighly more dated. Our room was almost across from the elevator but we didn't notice any extra noise. We asked for late check-in and were given until 3 pm. Again we felt that the staff was looking for ways to make our stay nice. Parking: We parked across the road from the hotel entrance in the municipal parking on Queen Street. It is underground parking so we missed it the first time round as we were looking for a \"parking lot\" .... It has an underground path (just a few steps) to the hotel lobby, no need to go outside. Pricing was this: from 7 am to 6 pm $14, from 6 pm to 7 am $6. We parked from Monday at 2 pm to Tuesday at 3 pm and paid $34. Cheaper than at the hotel but more than we are used to paying. It is something to factor in when pricing out your stay. This is Toronto though and everything is expensive! The \"PATH\": The PATH is the underground walkway that runs through the downtown core. It was amazing. We walked to the theatre district, about 15 or 20 minutes almost totally inside. The Sheraton is right on the PATH, so we walked underground until we got to Roy Thompson Hall on King Street and then above ground the short distance to the theatres. We went to Second City but the Princess of Wales and Alex were right there. We walked the PATH to Union Station from the hotel (2o minutes) and then a few blocks to the Speghetti Factory for dinner. The staff at the hotel have PATH maps and were very helpful in mapping out routes. Overall: The hotel more than met our expectations. We do hope to return for another quick getaway in the future. The pool area was being renovated while we were there. It looked like it would be nice when completed. The hotel does definately feel more like a business hotel, even the outside looked more like an office building.

Obviously you need to set reasonable expectations for a large convention hotel, but basic functions of their operation have fallen apart.

Upon mentioning it, I was told I must have forgotten to take the door tag off my door. When I replied that I know to leave it off (given I spend half my life in hotels), I was pretty much ignored like I was lying. We dined at the lobby bar multiple times and the staff all voluntarily mentioned the upcoming renovation. They all openly expressed their displeasure given the bar seemed somewhat updated and as a result were going to lose tips for four months. Furthermore, I had club level access with my SPG Platinum status. The access was really irrelevant as any \"Joe, Dick and Tom\" could come in for breakfast in the mornings. Of the 17 day stay, only twice did they ask what room I was in. The other mornings you could just walk in. The word had gotten out to the entire hotel of the free access because it was a mad house every morning. There were no filters and in fact one morning a homeless person sat at the seats next to me swallowing muffins whole, and none of the staff blinked an eye. One morning the temporary gym was empty and I started a workout on an elliptical. Ten minutes later a staff member appears and instructed me,\"please get off the machine immeaditly.\" When I walked over and asked what the issue is, she said that I hadn't signed in for the machine for a 30 minute slot and was \"forbidden\" from using the machine until I did so. I signed up and contined my workout only to see her leave and not return. Only one other guest came into the gym during this encounter. When staff publicly complains about their employer, ignores guests comments, rooms are not cleaned iorang specific order and a lack of security is present, it could be the impact of the current management team.

Busy place! I have no idea how the valet staff coordinate the mess, but kudos! They were friendly and professional. Upon departing, our car was ready within fifteen minutes after calling for it. Check In: A long line. It moved rather quickly, but we were still in line for about 15 minutes. To be fair it was check in time (3-4pm on a Saturday).

One major point that soured our stay was that we were told when we checked in that the parking would be $45 at the hotel but we were better off parking across the road at the city lot as it was half price. So we parked across the street.

Located in the center of it all, the Sheraton Centre has always been a favorite of mine. This will be the fourth time we have stayed there. On this occassion, we paid the extra and experienced the \"Club Level \" service. While the hotel itself is generally an awesome, albeit expensive place to stay, the club level service was not at all worth the extra bucks. We can honestly say that I have enjoyed far better amenities at other hotels three star and higher. With the club level service, we got to stay on the higher floors ranging from the 26th to 42nd with pretty damn good city line views; got a continental breakfast (not unlike what one would get at a two or three start hotel. The only difference here was the meal was served in the club lounge on the 43rd floor with almost panoramic view of the city. There were also beverages served throughout the day and snacks from five to seven every evening. Linens were comfy and were said to be a sweet sleeper experience. I guess, I should mention the two free bottles of water in the room and what were supposedly upgraded bathing products. Aside from the few food offerrings and the free water, a traditional room would have been just fine with as much comfort as what was afforded at the club level. There could have been a bit more attention to details in the room; wine glasses were never replaced, towels were neatly placed, but were not attractive or soft; rugs were not vacuumed daily; windows were dirty. What was truly awesome were the staff at every level. Even though we were four hours in waiting for our room to become ready, the staff were more than accomodating. Everyone was friendly and seemed to go out of their way to make our stay enjoyable (was it because I was at the club level?). Housekeeping, valets, desk clerks, guest services.... all were cherry and welcoming. At no time did anyone hesitate when we had a request. It was honored efficiently and with a smile. It was the staff that made our stay delightful. The hotel is now showing it's age. Eventhough the Sheraton reports at having spent millions in upgrades to its hotels, this one was not one of those lucky to have had a face lift. With a bit of work, paint and new wall paper, this could remain as one of the classic Toronto hotels. For it's location alone, we would highly recommend it. Access to above ground shopping and more so to the underground malls and eateries make this a most enjoyable and spot to be situated.

Unfortunately, I didn't find the front desk to be very helpful or friendly. The check in process was pretty slow as well. One tip if you want to save money on parking is that you park across from the hotel in the underground parking. It's about $9 to park there, instead of the $40 fee at the hotel. The parking lot is directly across the Sheraton Hotel on Queen Street. My other advice is do some research about different restaurants in the area because there so many to choose from. Unfortunately, I didn't find the concierge very helpful when asking for a good thai restaurant. The breakfast place that I would recommend is EggSpectation on Yonge. They have good service and good food there. Definetly find some time to stroll down Queen Street, it is a neat place to walk down, with nice stores for sure.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWOW.

It really is nice enough to sit down with an iPad and read a book or get some work done in a pleasant environment. Onto the negatives: I travel quite a bit for work and personal trips. On work trips I stay at Holiday Inn Express, exclusively. On personal I tend to stay at Kimpton properties, but i stay at at least one Sheraton a year. The last Sheraton property I stayed at was in Baltimore the rooms were stunning and it was a great experience. My stay at the Toronto Sheraton was a mix of business and pleasure. The rooms at the Toronto Sheraton Centre left quite a bit to be desired. Sheraton beds are always excellent but it appeared as if the update to the furniture had bypassed the bathroom. The fixtures were usable but beyond dated, the layout was poor, and even on a low flooer there was NO water pressure. We had a view of the under construction pool. I can't fault them for this, everything needs refreshing and this is a logical time to do the pool. In addition to the bathroom, the desk was unacceptable as well. There were no available outlets anywhere in the room, with the exception of ONE on the desk. In this day in age, most if not all travelers will need at least two (computer and phone) open outlets to charge each evening. I don't expect a hotel to meet my expectations in this regard (four - a computer, two phones, and an iPad) but I expect them to meet the minimum. Speaking of meeting the minimum, lets talk internet. I do not expect free wireless internet in all rooms. I DO expect free wireless internet in the lobby for SPG Members (AT MINIMUM). Additionally, I DO expect free wired internet in all rooms. I can't recall the last time I traveled in North America and had to pay for internet service in the hotel. At a business oriented property (as Sheratons tend to be), this is unacceptable. I don't need to be able to get on Hulu or netflix (which would be nice, I would pay for that) but I need to be able to get on email (on my system, not a shared computer), gratis. Other problems abound. Twice on our first night we were woken by what sounded to be a jack hammer (1:30 and 3 am). Cigarette smoke frequently permeated our hall and on one day, the hall floor was covered in either mud or dog feces. I dare not get close enough to find out. The courtesy phone I used to report it was never answered. The room itself was clean enough, the curtains were stained and the bed skirt was FILTHY (looked like grease) but the towels, bathroom, and sheets were clean. Overall, this is not a Sheraton experience. The first impression of the lobby and staff was excellent, but the room didn't hold up to those expectations.

However, there as reasons for this and I will explain. I checked the website, the list price was $260/night. I booked through Hotwire, and got a room for $99/night. Yes, I would say that is a huge discrepancy. For $99/night this hotel is outstanding. For $260/night, not so much. So I can give this 5/5 for value at $99, but much less for full price .... The valet parking was great, fast friendly .. both coming and going and I tipped nicely as I was so pleased. ($45/night FYI) The lobby at this place is outstanding ... huge well appointed, very classy. Check in was fine, I was hoping to get upgraded or switched to a King for being such a nice person, but apparently they were all booked up (which I don't believe .. had I been a travelling Rock star, Im pretty sure they could have accomodated me haha). Anyway, the room was fine, a basic room on the 14th, with 2 double beds is what we ended up with. So me and my lovely wife wach got our own bed we joked. The room was clean, the decor was fine. Strangely low ceiling in there ... maybe 7' if that. Again, nothing special. The bathroom was somewhat lack lustre, one marble sink but small. The bed was soft, the sheets crisp and white. The TV/cable was OK, the view of the rooftops was .... well ..... I could see the CN tower if that even matters. The video check out actually worked well as a bonus. Ill try to post a photo later ..... There are better options for a $260/night room in Toronto. I stayed at the Residence Inn (See review) for $240 which included parking and breakfast, and that is THE place to stay in my opinion for that kind of money. Overall for location, it can't be beat. If you get a Hotwire deal, then yes, stay here or if you want to be right down near the Eaton Centre. I had chosen here as we were going to a show at Massey Hall. On a side note we did get desert in Traders in the lobby, and that place was nice enough, and surprisingly the drinks weren't overpriced.

From valet to check in to calling down to the front desk it was an over all disappointment. Upon arrival it was a crazy mad house valet were not outside taking keys opening car doors or unloading luggage. At check in you are greeted by a note at the desk saying that if anyone calls to complain about you being too noisy they will give you one warning call and upon the second complaint charge your room 200$. I called down with a question to the front desk and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t greeted by my name as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced in every other Starwood property I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at. I know that sounds snotty, but I expect a certain amount of butt kissing for the price I pay to stay at a hotel, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t COST them more to be warm and welcoming but it really makes a difference. We were given a room on the 4th floor and it really appears that they purchased an older hotel and built upon it. There is an odd transition between the elevator and room 456 you walk down ramps so it feels like you are on maybe the 3rd floor not the 4th. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve posted some pictures of the hallway and vending area missing light fixtures and missing ceiling tiles. In our room there were no bottles of water waiting for me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Again I know this sounds snotty but at every other Sheraton they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been there and I expected them and missed them being absent. It appeared the room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any heating system there were two space heaters plugged in for my use I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve posted those pictures too. The first door to the bathroom leads into a room with a large vanity/sink. Inside that room was the closet for this room with the safe. Additionally there was another door that housed the shower/tub and toilet and it was small and cramped. You could have sat on the toilet and washed your hair in the tub. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve included a picture of this too. The shower head was very low making me believe it was an insert on top of the original bathtub. The set up of the vanity and shower/tub toilet reminded me of they way Travel Lodges/Motel 6\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are set up where the vanity is part of the hotel room? The rooms have very thin walls as others have said, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the amount of conversation I could hear from the people next to us and also in the hall way and from the note at check in this Sheraton will profit 200$ from you based off their poor building abilities! WiFi or Wired internet is 15$ for 24hrs and there is no free WiFi the lobby. Valet is 45$ a day and they should be ashamed for charging that much with such a terrible staff to greet and send off their customers. If you get a good price and you expect a 3 star hotel this is an good place to stay.

Cmon guys lets not allow your best attribute go to waste.The lounge was dead all three nights we visited.The staff bored and with no customers no tips.Its better to have a full lounge =more people drinking pricey drinks=more revenue .Breakfast selection a bit better if you like boiled eggs.

The fact that the hotel is centrally located was very convenient as my colleagues and I attended the Princess of Wales theatre on Thursday night and you can walk there in 15 minutes.

The coffee shop has some good treats and food for a light breakfast or snack. Not the friendliest folks there but adequate. The big problem with the place was the lack of heat in the room. I spent the first night uncomfortably cold and promptly called down for some help with the heating. No one came after a long wait so I went to lunch.

Normally I do not stay at the conference location since it is usually very expensive, however it would have costed me more to rent a car and pay for parking each day. It was $195/night with the conference rate - even more without. The hotel itself is located in the heart of Toronto with easy access to Union Station and many features and attractions. It is more of an upscale hotel with lots of business people, but since there were multiple conferences going on I didn't feel too out of place. Upon check-in I found out that they had reserved me two double beds instead of one king bed which is what I booked. I still don't understand why they would book 1 person into a two bed room, but this same scenario had happened before at another Sheraton I stayed at. They were unable to accomodate the king bed for the first night, but did compensate me very well with free buffet breakfasts every morning of my stay (which was 5 days). The rooms are quite nice, with some stunning views of Toronto (I had a beautiful view of the CN tower and its light show). The room has a safe in it for storing valuables which was convenient. The bed was unbelievable comfortable, though they could stand to offer a few different pillow types since the ones they had were very soft. You had the option to decline maid service in exchange for either a 5 dollar food voucher or 500 SPG points each day (I earned 1500 points during my time here). Internet does cost extra from your room, but there is free wireless in the lobby as well as 8 computers you can use. The hotel has a pool, fitness room, and hot tub. The pool is partially indoor/outdoor which is unique though a bit cool at times. There is usually a sauna but due to renovations this was closed. The food wasn't too bad, though overpriced. Room service has an automatic 15% added on plus $5 to deliver, so beware. Overall, my stay was great and the hotel did an excellent job compensating me for the problems that occurred. Though it was a bit pricey it does have a great location with lots of services. It is more business focused, so I don't think it would be the best family location.

Upon check in they did not have a king bed reserved for us, why idk any other hotwire hotel i have ever booked we got a king bed for 2 people. Anyway the man benhind the desk offered us an upgrade for 20 bucks to a king bed. Really? people get up graded all the time for free, I say. Hubby says oh dont worry aboput it and offfers topay it, at the station beside us the man was giving another lady a free upgrade for the 2 nights she was staying, so i looked at our check in guy and smiled he finally says \"well i just heard my colleague give out a free king bed so i guess i will too\": Thanks buddy i say cause I heard that too. He also threw in free breakfast buffet in the morning. I have read alot of reviews of how the food is not really good, so we dicided to go out for breakfast elswhere and enjoy it.

The bed is sooooooo comfy OMG. really soft and lots of pilllows.In the morning when we tried to shower the shower wa broke.

This hotel is geared to conferences and meetings because it has the facilities. It is not a good choice for a \"tourist\" or an over nighting business traveler. Breakfast cost $37 for one person and for that, one had the option of an omlette and the usual greasy potatos, selection of processed over cooked pork products and extremely poor quality \"baked\" goods. Sure, breakfast buffets are basic, but for the price, there was nothing special.The bacon was cold and dried out, the ham was sitting in greasy water, the \"pastries\" were obviously industrial variety as opposed to actually being prepared by a real baker. The crowning glory were the sausages that tasted \"off\". I had to spit it out. I should have walked out after the 8 minute wait for a waitress to make her way over to the table in a room at 30% capacity. The lady making the vegetable omlette put a teaspoon worth of vegetables in the eggs. I counted 2 slivers of red pepper, and 2 tiny pieces of yellow pepper with lots of onions. The food areas were dirty and the utensils used to serve were sticky and dirty. Would it have killed one of the staff to change the utensils every so often, or is the hotel trying to see how many people can contract a food related illness? What was the unsmiling hostess thinking when she sat us next to a serving station in a nearly empty room? We had the delight of a busboy banging cutlery and dishes while having a loud conversation with his co-worker. Don't bother stopping for a beer in the main floor bar as the price is significantly higher than many of the surrounding options. I pity anyone attending a conference at this hotel as the meals are unpalatable, greasy, overly salted, and unimaginative. The only consistency in food is that it is over priced and bad at any time of the day. The sad aspect of my experience was that at one time, the Sheraton had both a great brekfast and lunch otion that was imaginative, distinguished by quality and competitively priced.

First of all we booked this stay through selloffvacations and it only cost $292 taxes in(CAD) for the two nights and after reading reviews from here didn't expect a very nice place. Upon check-in the guy behind the desk (not mentioning names) was nothing but polite and nice to us. Right away asked us if king bed and higher floor were our prefrence yet our selloffvacations package said double bed standard room. Then when we had said yes to that he said I will upgrade you to club level free of charge if you sign up for the starwood perferred guest plan which was also free of charge and was given a membership card. The room we got was on the 35th floor with a view of the CN tower(amazing view of the city) which on the door noticed the room would normally cost $529.00 per night. We had also told the from desk on check in that our flight didn't leave until 10:55pm on check out day and immediatly he gave us what he called V.I.P checkout time which was 4pm also free of charge. Also we had asked for a map of toronto and he gave us a map and also marked on it showing us the best places to visit and the areas of town to stay out of. Because we declined housekeeping for the two nights we were there by putting this piece of paper on our doorknob we received a $5 voucher for any of the restaurants in the hotel or 500 starwood points each on checkout. We went to canadas wonderland on sunday and saturday night being tourists didn't know how to get there so we went to the information desk and were treated very nicely and they told us the cheapest fastest way to get there showed us on our map how to and also gave us written directions with distances and times on it. The pool was very warm and a nice touch to the hotel with the indoor/outdoor aspect. The only downfall we found was that we ate at Bistro on Two for breakfast on sunday and it was fairly expensive for a plate of 2 pancakes and a plate of eggs bacon and sausage $55. Which also when being seated we were'nt notified they didn't take debit that is until we went to pay for it 'sorry we don't take debit cards only cash or credit' and were told there was a atm on the basement level if we wanted to go get money. In the end I just charged it to the room to save the hassel. The morning of check out they had already done up our reciept and had it placed under our door which I found rather convient as we could check out from our in room TV but we chose the traditional front desk check out route and when we said we didn't have our flight until 10:55 that evening the took our luggage and put it in storage for us for no additional charge and told us that we could use the change rooms by the pool if we needed to change before we departed also offering to call us transportation to the airport.

It was also our 5th anniversary, and the staff did so much to make this a memorable, wonderful stay for us, above and beyong our convention needs! There were many convention events, from breakfasts, to suite events and parties, and the food and beverages were great each time. Further, the event staff and waitstaff really went the extra mile to accomodate a diverse group with many needs; every request was met with a \"can do\" attitude that we appreciated! The rooms are comfortable, the beds and bedding cozy and soft, and the extra amenities in the rooms added to our positive experience.Even though the hotel was at capacity, we were never disturbed by any noise, and we slept very well. Our room was on the 5th floor, and we enjoyed the view. We also went to many upper suites for meetings and parties and the views were great. We enjoyed the Club Level for a gorgeous view of the city, and wonderful drinks and appetizers. Sunsets, and the lights of the City at night were both breathtaking from the Club Level! The location of the hotel is perfect whether you want to shop, eat,attend an event, or just relax. The City has a great web of transportation that is located steps from the hotel, whether it is walking (we felt safe walking day and night on the streets of Toronto), the subway, Path or bus and trolley system. You really don't need a car, in most cases. There is a great business center in the lobby that's free to guests; a comfortable area with new computers and printers that guest may use to print boarding passes,etc. There is WiFi available, but if you don't need your laptop for anything pressing, this is really convenient and appreciated.

From the minute we stepped through the doors we were treated like VIPs. When the booking was made we were on a very tight budget and could only afford to book room only. We arrived at the check in area and were told that as it was a special birthday we had been upgraded to club class!!! I have a SPG card so we received points on that too!! The from we were allocated was on the 35th floor and the views were spectacular to say the least. We could see the harbour area and Centre Island (through the buildings) and the CN Tower as well as an impressive array of skyscrapers that lit up the night sky like twinkling stars. The room had two beautifully comfortable beds in it (I had the best weeks sleep in a long time!) and everything you would expect from a 4* hotel. Considering we were right in the centre of this wonderful city you couldn't hear a thing through the double glazing. This hotel is situated right at the heart of everything. Just a 5 minute walk and tou were T the Eaton Centre a HUGE shopping and eating experience. Be sure to visit the Urban Eatery food court.........but go there hungry, there is so much to choose from. Situated within the hotel there is Traders, a friendly bar for all ages, Link which is a coffee and snacks bar, and Quinns which is an Irish bar where the welcome is warm and the food beautiful. Up on the 43rd floor we found the club lounge. This lounge afforded some excellent views of the city from two sides through floor to ceiling windows. The food here was buffet style and it was always well stocked and beautiful. The staff in the lounge were extremely pleasant and very helpful. They always had a lovely smile and a hearty good morning/afternoon/evening for you. Nothing was too much trouble for them. All of the staff at the Sheraton Centre Toronot deserve a pat on the back. Their customer service is second to none. I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a special place to stay, and will 100% stay there again on my next visit.

Rather annoyed at the hotels assumption. The only issue that we had was on the first morning we wanted to go to the Bistro on Two for breakfast as it was a reasonable price, roughly $12 for a full cooked breakfast. We got down there and there was a notice to say that it was closed, some sort of function. I feel that there should have been a note in the room to tell us this. We had to go to the Bar in reception where breakfast was being served. We ended up paying $17 for a continental breakfast consisting of a few pastries, some cereal and a couple other bits. Or we could have had a cooked breakfast for $22, I feel quite ripped off about this especially as we had to wait 15 minutes for juice and coffee. I wrote 2 comment cards saying exactly this and no one has mentioned this to me. On check out I didn't even get a bill for the breakfast and I find that I have been charged for them.

At least we got lucky, one of the other guys had blood over his car and the guy that broke in was HepC positive! The TO cops were faultless in dealing with our angst (they indicated that City Hall parking lot is notorious for break ins - so why does the Sheraton direct guest there?). Sheraton staff were far less concerned about TOs image than the cops. All we got from them was a \"Oh\".! Other note. Valet parking is $35 on Friday and Saturday only (dont believe what they tell you at check-in, their forms are pretty clear on the distinction) Sunday onwards is $45. We could only get into valet parking on Sunday!. Finally, we got put in the Richmond Tower. This is inconvenient if you want to use the pool etc since you have to schlep across public areas (dripping) to get back to your room and when we stayed seem to be full with college-aged kids who had only just discovered alcohol. The room hadnt been totally cleaned of \"party string\" even by the time we checked out (3 days later). Don't take the breakfast included option.

The Traders Bar & Restaurant was great. i worked out at the fitness center (fullly equipped) and watched people swim in the indoor/outdoor pool. I can't think of anything negative to say! A few tips about staying at this hotel: We had breakfast at Tim Hortons' every morning. You walk through the lobby and you are practically at the front door of the Timmy's . $6.00 gets you coffee and cream cheese bagels for three! You can park in the underground public parking across the street on Queen st. Parking for the whole weekend cost us $50.00 as opposed to taking the valet parking that would have cost $45.00 per night. Also you can go directly to the underground parking directly from the Hotel Concourse level. There is an underground city (P.A.T.H.) where if it is raining, you can go to the Eaton Center and countless other landmarks. When booking, call and see their promotion specials. They are really good at finding you the special of the week. I have stayed at this hotel 3 times before and it just keeps on getting better and better.

Our room was clean, and the beds were nice. Otherwise, I don't have too many positive things to say. This hotel is not very ideal for people with a car. The valet service is outrageously priced (use the public lot across the street, under City Hall). There isn't a good place to pull up your car and hop out and check in - it's all in a tight, chaotic space filled with taxis and the valets. I can understand because the hotel is downtown and space is limited, however, the entrance area is not pleasant. I cannot believe that in this day and age, and at this cost, that the hotel does not offer free internet in the rooms - even inexpensive chain motels offer this. There was an internet menu card in the room with three levels of availability, starting at about $8/day. And while it isn't standard elsewhere, it would have been nice had there been room left in the minibar fridge for us to put our own drinks, since we were there for a week and certainly wasn't going to touch the $5 cans of pop that were in there. There are 43 floors in the hotel. If you have an issue with heights, be sure to request a lower room when booking. Because there are many floors, there are two banks of elevators - one for the first 25 or so floors, and the second for the upper floors. The banks of elevators were not well marked and we saw many people get very confused and irritated. The elevators were, however, quite fast and the trip to the top never took long. We were also surprised at how noisy the hotel was. It was very busy while we were there, and we could hear other people from in our room. There were a couple of loud parties going on in nearby rooms, some of which were visited by security. On our check-out day, our hotel bill was mixed up and incorrect and so we could not use the express check-out option because we had to go to the front desk and have our bill fixed.

At these prices, we expected better service than some road side motel would have provided. Actually, during our travels, we stayed at hotels that were half the price, were immaculately clean, and included complimentary full breakfasts and free, in-room wi-fi. Sheraton could learn a lot from such places. When my husband complained, the maid brought fresh towels, but then mixed them up with the dirty ones--for our family of four sharing the room. We again had to complain. Then that night, the management intentionally booked a large group of under-aged and rowdy teens, who were having a drinking party, in the room next to ours. They were banging into the walls late at night and it sounded like they were breaking the furniture. The management tried to ignore our request that they do something about the noise, until my husband threatened to report them to the police for allowing underage drinking. They then took care of the problem. They did credit our bill for one night of our stay. Needless to say, we will never stay in this hotel again. The concierge talked us into expensive tickets for a bus that made various stops in the city during the day. We later discovered that it is much less expensive and more convenient to simply buy a city Day Pass, which allows you to ride all public transportation--buses, trains, and subways--and hop on and off as needed. I realize that concierge is given commissions for selling things, but as guests of the hotel, they should present options. We felt that as visitors and guests, that they took advantage of us. Do NOT park in the hotel parking lot. It is outrageously expensive compared to the public parking nearby. Once again, guests are gouged. There is no free wi-fi in rooms. Even the cheapest hotels now offer free in room wi-fi. But not the Sheraton. If you want to surf, you will have to go down to the lobby and wait to use one of four computers.

The reception staff were very friendly and helpful especially when I had to book another night at very short notice, after already having checked out. I stayed on the 34th floor and had an amazing view of the CN Tower. The room was large enough and clean. The bed was amazing, the pillows were so comfortable and the bed was not rock hard, like you get sometimes in city hotels. The room however was basic but enough for a short stay. Hairdryer and coffee facilities in room along with a safe. There is a swimming pool which appeared to be busy but I did not use. Breakfast is not included so I would suggest walking around the corner to either Starbucks or Tim Hortons which is the Canadian equivalent. Tim Hortons very reasonable, huge selection of coffee's, muffins and bagels for breakfast/lunch. There are some very nice restaurants nearby and some cheep and cheerful ones. My colleague and I booked a meal in the CN Tower restaurant, unfortunately I was very ill before hand and spent most of the evening in the toilets ( which are lovely and clean) I did get to see the food and my colleague who managed to eat a 3 course meal stated the food was amazing!! T he staff were very friendly and were concerned about me and did not charge for my food which although I ordered I could not eat. I know some restaurants would have still charged!! The view was amazing and I would definitely recommend. I had booked on line before hand which I would recommend via the CN Tower website, it saved you having to queue and you have your own lift to the restaurant, a little VIP service!! On a day off we took the Greyhound bus to Niagara Falls which is approx 2 hours away, well worth it!! The bus station is only a very short walk from the hotel and cost approx $30 return. The journey is boring, it is all motorway. The Niagara bus stop where you are dropped off is about a 20 minute walk from Niagara Falls but there are a few taxis hanging about. The walk is very nice, it is not sign posted so we asked someone who was waiting for the bus for directions to the falls, it is very straight forward. The Maide of the Mist cost $16. My stay was fairly short but I do not think I would stay at the Sheraton Centre again, I think I was just not impressed with Toronto. I was amazed at the amount of homeless people who was asking for money outside the coffee shops and sleeping even outside the Sheraton Centre!!

There all all kinds of restaurants nearby that you do not have to rely on those within the hotel. There's a huge pool, large exercise room, and coffee shop/wifi station on the premises. The staff was very friendly and respectful. Unfortunately, there were three major issues we encountered. (1) This hotel tries to be a \"green\" along with the rest of the city. At most hotels that I've visited, going \"green\" means that you still get maid service, but you reuse your towels. Here, opting for \"green\" means that the maids DO NOT ENTER your room, even to make the bed, tidy the room, or empty the garbage. It's a problem if you get take-out food and eat in your room or you stay longer than a day or two. We even tried to leave our overflowing garbage can outside our room, but the maid did not empty it. Think twice before going green. It's seems more of an economic move to save on maid service than an environment concern. Next, there is NO CONCIERGE who can assist you with travel plans or make recommendations. There is a \"tour and trip information\" desk. But they are paid by outside vendors to promote specific vendors. When we tried to select a tour to Niagara Falls, they push the most expensive tour, over $150 per person, that included a meal we didn't need. When we asked about other options, including some in the tour books, they refused to comment. (BTW - we booked a great tour in a mini-bus for $60.) If you have questions, you're better off asking the bellmen. This would not be a problem if you are there for business, had unlimited funds, or don't care to sightsee.

As a platinum SPG member we were given an upgraded suite and provided access to the club lounge. As this trip was the celebration of a significant birthday for myself the suite was a nice touch. Special mention has to be made to Lily at the front desk...she was wonderful (even wished me a happy birthday on check in). She also arranged to have a bottle of sparkling wine brought up with two flutes for a celebratory toast. This was an unexpected surprise that I found touching. The temperature in Toronto hovered in the upper 40's centigrade with the humidex for most of our stay but the hotel air conditioning did not fail us and the room was cool after being out in the heat. The room was kept clean and the cleaning staff were friendly and seemed to get the room done prior to noon each day. The club lounge was being renovated and we went to the temporary second floor space (I cannot wait for the new space upstairs to open) and while the space was small, the service and positive attitudes from the lounge staff made the time spent there a true pleasure. The selection of food was very good in the morning (yogurt, fruit, selection of cold and hot cereals, breads, pastries, coffee, tea and juice) and good in the evening (more snack type foods but well prepared). There is a great pool area and a fantastic fitness centre (you have to rely on my wife's words on that as I did not partake in the dubious pleasure of exercising while on holiday). The hotel is a two block walk to the Bay and the shopping centre (you can take the PATH system from the hotel and go to the Bay underground if the weather is uncooperative); the shops are pretty standard mall fare but the stores are a cool respite from a hot day. You can also find streetcars on Queen Street in front of the hotel (Queen Street West has a lot of shops, restaurants, boutiques etc) as well as having access to the subway one block west of the hotel.

LOCATION: The hotel is opposite the New City Hall and 2 minutes walk to the Eaton Centre and all of the shops on Yonge Street as well as the Subway. It is also linked to the underground PATH network and it is possible to get to the area around the CN Tower / Union Station without going up to street level which is a godsend when it's either scorching hot or teeming down with rain. There are lots of little shops and food outlets etc within the basement of the Hotel and a handy 7/11 shop near the entrance on Queen Street.

I would advise giving yourself a good hour before airport check in as there was a lot of the traffic on the highway on our return journey", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasant Stay at Sheraton Centre\u201d", "Author": "AverageTraveller24", "ReviewID": "UR116577001", "Content": "The staff at this huge hotel really made our stay enjoyable and relaxing.

On Friday night, the 29th, at 3 in the morning an altercation broke out between two rival groups using fowl language and eventually death threats right outside our door in the hallway. To report what was to be a noise complaint, I was on hold for Guest Services for over 10 minutes while the argument outside escalated and my children and I got increasingly fearful. One group eventually stormed off before security arrived (or I got through) with a promise to kill the other party (he didn't want to shoot the other person(s) in the hotel; he demanded the other guy(s) go outside so he could do it there). The departing group said it wasn't over. When I finally got through, the staff member asked what the problem was then 'if' he should send security; as if the outbreak had not been reported. I refused the offer to move my family (afraid for our safety and what we had heard, and if the others thought we could have seen something). I accepted the offer that security remain on the floor for the rest of the night. I stayed up because I was frightened and through the rest of the night, people came and went from the rooms in question, including at least one person from the rival side (so where was the promised on floor security?). Upon reporting the incident the next day to the front desk, I was placated and summarily dismissed because they didn't want incoming guests to overhear the events of the night before. Our violent neighbours benefitted from being at the Sheraton because if they had met the other rival party outside, on the street or at another venue, I'm certain there could have been a more violent outcome.

Complimentary local calls, fitness centre access and refreshments at certain times throughout the day are also provided. Another convenience at the Sheraton Centre is the Airport Shuttle Bus service, which is frequent and reliable. Needless to say, no hotel would remain competitive if it was not for good staff and the Sheraton Centre management and staff are the best, in my opinion. Even while waiting in the lobby for airport transportation, we were offered chilled water on a warm afternoon; a thoughtful gesture that meant a lot!

Right across the street from City Hall, near Eaton Centre, and public transportation, the location can't be beat. The rooms, however, are in need of a little upgrade and refurbishing, to be considered four star. First off, I'd recommend you park your automobile across the street in the municipal underground parking garage. There is an entrance right off Queen Street West, between University and Bay. The price was significantly cheaper than the hotel's valet or parking garage and it has a pedestrian connection from the underground garage to the shopping area below the Sheraton lobby- very convenient. For as crowded as the hotel was, the check-in process was rather easy. The only hitch was our rooms were not ready. We arrived about an hour before the official check-in time, so this was nothing to get discouraged about. We just had to wait in line again a few hours later (of course the line was longer now) to actually get the room keys. We stayed on the 31st floor and upon entering my non-smoking room, I found the air quality to be very stagnant and smoky. The previous guest in my room was definitely smoking cigarettes in the room and bathroom. I half wanted to request a different room, but didn't want to have the replacement room located on a different floor than my family. (I also didn't want to have to wait in line in the lobby again.) Luckily the smoke smell dissipated after the first day and life went on. There was nothing else particularly wrong with the rooms- they were just a bit dated and in need of a refresh- especially the bathroom. It is an old building, and it definitely shows in certain areas. This is why I'd dispute the Sheraton's four star rating. Three stars- probably. But not four in my opinion. Probably the worst experience during our stay was breakfast in the hotel's \"Bistro on Two\" restaurant. Not only was it way over-priced, as expected, but the quality was no better than a free continental breakfast at a Holiday Inn Express. And the waiter, he was just plain rude. (Luckily, there's a Starbucks in the lobby with grab and go pastries.)

The hotel was obscenely packed throughout the stay- tour groups, weddings, conferences, people, people and oh my god, more people. The check in line was LONG LONG LONG but I breezed through the SPG line and was able to check in immediately and get a 4 pm check out on the day I was leaving. HUGE bonus. The floor we were on was virtually empty except for one night when we had a very loud party stay next to us. We complained about noise and smoke the next day (non smoking hotel and smoke coming in out room) and they quickly fixed the problem and offered me more points. Um, yes please.

We rang reception and were assured that someone would be up right away to sort it out. Well, it took an hour with 3 more phone calls, each promising that someone would be right up, before someone eventually came. They confirmed our diagnosis that the safe was broken and told us that we'd be able to store our laptops, camera, kindles and documents at reception. So we took them all down, queued for ages, and were then told that the boxes there were too small to hold these. The receptionist was not very helpful or sympathetic. We were eventually offered another room (Richmond Tower) and were promised a couple of breakfast vouchers. So we had to re-pack our bags and move... and eventually had a VERY late dinner. The vouchers didn't arrive, of course.

Clearly privacy of guests is not a priority at this hotel. (3) The club level rooms include continental breakfast and refreshments from 5PM to 7:30PM in a lounge on the top floor on the 43rd floor.

There is free WIFI in the lobby that is crowded, unpleasant and super slow. (5) The AC in our room could not keep it cool in hot summer days.

I mean come on, nearly $30 for a breakfast buffet! And it was nothing special, either. The second morning I discovered the Tim Horton's just outside the side entrance. The room was just OK. A bit dated. The beds were comfy and clean, no bed bugs ( I checked!) The computer was wired in the room, I brought my own and the hotel charges some ridiculous amount like $15 per day, but my internet was included in the business rate. The rate I paid was about $250 per night. The rack rate on the back of the door was , get this, $550 per night!! So not worth it! This hotel is close to shopping and all the downtown amenities. Due to being on business I had obligatory dinners to attend and did not see much of the hotels restaurants, but I imagine they were really pricey. The food served at the conference was just OK, nothing really great but that was probably due to the conference planners and cost factors. This hotel is really expensive but I don't know if there is another less expensive place in this area.

I hung the sign out on my door and got a clean fresh bed and new towels every day! Probably a problem with support staff that do not speak English very well.

So: Sheraton or Best Western? The difference between these two hotels for us was a mere \u00c2\u00a323, and we were very glad we paid that extra \u00c2\u00a323 for Sheraton. Why?

They were our key contacts at the hotel, for any advice on what to do, where to go, how to get about etc. When we left, we could only say goodbye to Lily as Aabad was off I presume and Ronnie was off to Cuba for his anniversary. The only downfall to the Sheraton will probably be have to be the (i) Internet and (ii) parking. Firstly, the free internet is only available in the lobby but I gave this hotel 5 stars because we received complimentary internet access for a few days due to some confusion as our holiday provider stated we had internet access in our rooms - we didnt know about the internet issue until we had to use the internet to book some tickets online and didnt even expect to receive complimentary internet acess...however, the staff looked after us very well! And secondly, as we hired a car for about 4/10 days, we chose not to park at the hotel as we thought it was quite expensive so instead we parked in a public parking lot across the hotel, for a cheaper amount.

I have a tendency to prefer a particular area of the hotel so that I can easily tend to my canine daughter's needs. At check in I learned these room were not available due to some drilling that was going on and would be immensely disturbing. The staff tried to be as helpful as possible and to offer something to take the sting out of the hassle, which I greatly appreciated. (Yes, I guess I can be bribed!). Although I'm sure it would have been immediately tended to, I did not report a less than clean bathroom issue. I only wanted to eat and go to bed. The next day we were able to switch rooms, so I was happy. A courtesy pre-arrival email had made it known that the pool would be unavailable certain days...but I was not prepared to see the beautiful garden that I enjoy sitting in being in its own renovation mode, and the waterfalls that I so enjoy were non-functioning. A major disappointment to me, but my canine daughter showed me how one could still enjoy the garden and have fun even without that feature. I have written the hotel manager to strongly urge that as the hotel is non-smoking that they go all the way and enforce the garden as a no-smoking zone as well. I find it very disturbing to go out to enjoy it and have to deal with people attending meetings or on breaks lighting up, blowing their smoke about, and leaving their butts on the ground or in the garden beds. Since my last review there have been some other changes: The wicker chairs/sofas at the window overlooking the waterfall have been replaced with single chairs of a more classic nature. For the moment the windows were frosted so people wouldn't have to observe the garden coming back to life with fresh plantings etc. If you order food from Shopsy's (NOT related, but in the hotel) DO check to make sure your condiments are in the bag. The Bay Dept store no longer has a post office and the greeting card dept is now within the grocery...though there is a post box. There is a post office in the back of the Shoppers Drug store in Eaton Centre. The hotel room service or Traders in the lobby does a fantastic cobb salad with a delicous champagne viniagrette. Be sure to request this. I did the first night and I think someone was confused and sent the balsamic...which was good as well. The Club Lounge offers a beautiful view of the city that can't be beat...and the breakfast buffet and evening snacks are outstanding. The staff remain friendly, personable and attentive... The beds are very comfortable...though desk lighting could be improved.

On arrival at the hotel there was a friendly welcome from the reception staff and the check-in was quick and we were told everything we needed to know about the hotel - times of breakfast, opening hours of the pool etc. We did not use the pool but it was lovely and my husband used the gym in the morning which was also good. Our room was on the 32nd floor and overlooked Nathan Philips Square. The room included two double beds, flat screen tv, tea/coffee machine, small table and arm chair. The room was very comfortable and we all slept well. The air conditioning was a must for the week we were there. One of the days reached 32 and the coolest day was 19. I had read reports from others who were bothered by noise and bedbugs! We suffered none of these and found the hotel clean, comfortable and the staff friendly. The cleaning staff were lovely and very friendly. I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again should we ever come to Toronto. I would also recommend hiring a car. We toured Straford and St Jacobs which is amish country. Very interesting to see amish people going about their normal everyday business. We also visited Niagara Falls and, if you get the chance, visit Niagara by the Lake which is about a 15 minute drive away. The town is very pretty and has a number of olde worldy shops and lots of eating places. We found Canada to be quite expensive for food, clothes, trips etc. As we have a 14 year old we took her to Canada's Wonderland which we all loved although it cost us \u00c2\u00a3130 for entry for the 3 of us. If you buy your tickets online before you go you will save $20 Canadian dollars each. We were slightly disappointed by the CNN Tower but feel if you're going to Toronto you must visit. Once again restaurant expensive, although we did not have a meal there. Views good but the Tower felt quite claustrophobic once you got up to the top with lots of visitors. The lobby of the hotel is lovely. Once again, very clean. There is a Starbucks in the lobby which catered for breakfasts and quick food. There are also a number of other eating places leading off the lobby to the underground shops. There is 30 minutes free internet access in the lobby which my daughter used daily.

I have stayed at four other Toronto hotels but none of those has come close to beating the excellent experience I consistently receive at the Sheraton Centre. Let me tell you why I like it so much. First of all, the facilities are top notch. Everything \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lobby, restaurants, rooms, workout area - are modern and fresh looking. Each room that I have stayed in has been nicely appointed, quiet, and very clean. The beds are very comfortable and I have always gotten a great night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. Location, location, location \u00e2\u20ac\u201cIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best in Toronto. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right in the core of the city. Everytime that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed somewhere else, I always end up needing to spend most of my time near the Sheraton. The views have been interesting. On one side, an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153up close\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd view of the Canada Life Weather Beacon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by its lights it is possible to determine whether it is going to rain or snow, be clear or cloudy or if the temperature is rising or falling. On the other side, I found the view of the lighted CN tower to be very relaxing to sit and enjoy the view while calling home after a busy day in the office. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful. Whether I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m asking for directions, food recommendation, a good running route, each person seems to sincerely want to do their part to make your stay as convenient and comfortable as possible. I have been impressed with the food. The onsite Traders and Bistro on Two restaurants provide many delicious and convenient food and drink choices to satisfy the tastes of the people in your group. I have been most impressed by the room service that I have ordered a couple of times. I really like the Cobb Salad with Chicken and topped with chunks ofBlue Cheese. The chunks of Blue Cheese melded with the chicken to create a wonderful flavor. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had a Cobb salad served quite like that and it was truly one of the best salads I have ever had. I tried to duplicate it at home but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have quite the same result. The workout and pool areas are top notch. The workout area is quite large and has many options for strength and aerobic training. The full 25 meter, indoor/outdoor pool is the biggest and best I have ever seen in a hotel. It would be impressive at a top notch resort. The pool is especially interesting during winter as a moveable wall lowered to the waterline so that half is indoors and half is outdoors. It is really cool that one can swim uninterrupted laps as you go between indoors and out through cutouts in the wall in each of the lane. My kids really want to come with me next winter to check this out. I look forward to the staying at the Sheraton Centre the each time I return on business to Toronto. I like the Sheraton Centre and Toronto so much that am also planning a visit with either my entire family or just my wife to show them the sights and sounds of Toronto as well as to let them check out the many cool features of this hotel.

Downtown Toronto was active at that time of night along our route up York Street, and especially so in the Sheraton Centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle arrival area and their large lobby. We were directed by the bell staff to Reception where we were checked in very efficiently . We were given a room with a king bed on the 10th floor overlooking the City Hall. The view was quite appealing even with the current re-construction going on in Nathan Phillips Square. The room was very nicely furnished and very comfortable. My wife who is fussy about those things found the bed very comfortable. The next morning, we were checked out reasonably fast. There were 4 tour buses parked just outside the hotel on Queen Street so while there was a potential for delay they did have 6 clerks on duty.

The only downside to our stay that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention was that twice during the night we were awakened by noisy guests talking outside in the hallway near our door. Then, at 02:30 we were awakened by a fire alarm that had been activated on the 3rd floor. I was completely alert after that, and with the subsequent announcements, it was at least 30 minutes before we settled down again. Can you criticise a good hotel for the actions of bad guests? It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem fair, but our primary objective was a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep and it was not met. Still, my guess is that during the week with business travellers, this place would be a really great location. On the weekend, you take your chances with the possibility of a rowdy element. It is not just at the Sheraton \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the experience of great locations and not-so-great guests about 4 times in the past year!", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Location": "5", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta", "Title": "\u201cWiFi and security issues\u201d", "Author": "ezier", "ReviewID": "UR110281674", "Content": "Since there is no wi fi in the hotel rooms you have to go down to the lobby to get a wi fi connection.

It was a great stay. We were upgraded to a club level room with a great view of Nathan Phillips Square. The room was clean and tastefully decorated. We have absolutely no complaints with the quality of the room and the guest services provided. But, a few days later, I realized I left my necklace in the hotel room. We stayed the Friday night and by the time I noticed my necklace was missing, it was now the following Tuesday. I called the hotel immediately and was told my necklace had been found. What a relief! I was told I could come pick it up any time and the necklace was in safekeeping. Unfortunately I could not pick up the necklace immediately as I was away on business for three weeks. I came in as soon as I could to pick up my necklace which was April 1st. After speaking with a few security/lost and found personnel, my necklace could not be located. I was informed that since I called the hotel about a missing necklace, which was found by housekeeping, the hotel was responsible for holding that necklace for as long as needed. Had I not called the hotel within 30 days of my stay, the hotel was well within their rights to no longer keep the necklace in the safe. Good thing I called. Or so I thought. When I went to pick up my necklace, after keeping me waiting for 45 minutes in the hotel lobby, the person who was searching for my necklace brought out a stack of papers to show me she could not find my room number, name or any information stating I called about the necklace. After glancing through the papers myself, for about 30 seconds, I noticed my room number, my name and necklace for pick up, highlighted. She informed me of the 30 day policy ( which did not apply since I called with regards to the necklace). I was told the person who turned in the necklace, the housekeeper, would be able to claim it after the 30 days expired. I was then told the hotel would keep in touch with me while determining the status of my necklace. After not hearing from the hotel for a number of days, I called and was told the hotel could not locate my necklace and could not get a hold of the housekeeper who may or may not have claimed the necklace. After 10 days of me visiting the hotel to pick up my necklace and being proactive in calling the hotel, trying to get some answers, I was still told the necklace was missing and could not be found amongst any employees. The hotel told me they would spend the rest of the week ensuring that the necklace had in fact been lost by the hotel and I could expect an answer by the end of the week to see where we could go from there. Two days later, I received a call from a third employee I had never spoken to saying the employee handling my case was on vacation and would get a hold of me the following week. This employee then informed me, they could not find any record of ever finding a necklace in my room. I immediately became worried that my necklace suddenly was of no importance, even though I clearly was shown papers that said my necklace was found and would be picked up. I decided to take this situation in my own hands and visited the hotel two days later. I spoke with a security employee and informed him of my problem. Within 20 minutes, the employee was able to find a record of the hotel finding a necklace in my room, but he could not find the previous paper I had seen 2 weeks earlier when I first visited the hotel to pick up my necklace. He informed me that paper was floating around the hotel. This employee was incredibly helpful, courteous and did more in 20 minutes than anyone had in two weeks. I asked if I could copy the paper or take a picture of it. He said that was against hotel policy but said he would make a copy of the paper and keep it within his own personal records that only he had access to. So, now onto the following week (Monday). Knowing that the person handling my case was coming back from vacation, I called the person I spoke to, to call me as soon as possible, and she did within an hour. When she called, she apologized for the inconvenience and the frustration the hotel has caused me. Having all my information in front of me, I asked her what information she had available to her. I was told she had none. The employee was eager to come to a resolution, asking how much my necklace was worth and said she would go over all the information they could find and would get back to me by Thursday as we both knew the long weekend was coming up. Eager to come to a resolution, I informed the hotel employee I would look for a certificate of appraisal for the necklace. Now, the necklace I lost was a birthday gift to me from my mother, who received that necklace from her mother. So I really had no idea whether or not there would be any certificate of appraisal. After explaining the situation to my mother and after receiving a very heated lecture, she did inform me she had it appraised years ago and would give me the certificate which included the suggested replacement value on it. Today, being Thursday and nearly three weeks since I first visited the hotel to pick up my necklace, I called the hotel trying to get a hold of the employee dealing with my case to inform her I had a certificate of appraisal. I immediately got her voice mail that said she would be away until the following week. (Again, I'm told I would have a resolution, but mysteriously, an employee working on my case, is away. Now this is a different employee that has disappeared, literally the day before I was told I should have a conclusion to my case.) At this point, it is clear the hotel has lost my necklace and did not follow their own security policies. I have been dealing with the security department this entire time and I am shocked that any records relating to my case, can't seem to be found by employees unless I personally explain how they can be found IN PERSON. I finally got a hold of the last person I had spoken to regarding my issue, and got her fax number to send in the certificate of appraisal. When I asked her what the next step would be once I sent her the certificate, she informed me it was no longer 'in their hands' and was quick to get me off the phone. I was told the insurance company was now handling the case and the hotel was no longer tied to the issue. I was never made to feel comfortable that this case would be dealt with nor was anyone apologetic in ANY WAY for the loss of my family heirloom. I was told the certificate was going to be sent to the insurance company and I would hear from someone within a week. Ten days and 0 phone calls later, I called the last person who I had spoken to, and asked if she would be able to find out the status of the claim. Hours later, I received a call from the insurance company, not the hotel, asking for some information regarding the necklace. She also asked me to send her another copy of my certificate of appraisal. How is it that all the information regarding my necklace seems to float around, but never to the person who's actually handling my case? I now have to go out of my way to provide more details and send information that the hotel should have been giving to the appropriate person. What strikes me as odd, is the Sheraton was so willing to be rid of my case, to let the insurance company handle it and take no responsibility. I never once had anyone who was consistent with follow ups or even seemed to have a caring nature when speaking with me regarding my lost family heirloom. It seems the people who complain regarding a noisy stay, get offered free use of amenities, a few extra nights and a points system, yet all I'm offered, are a very stressful 8 weeks of trying to get to the bottom of the reasons behind how a hotel could lose such a valuable, personal item, that was supposed to continue to be in my family for another 60 years. How is it after 8 weeks I am still making phone calls, still posting on trip advisor, only to have to keep telling my story to numerous people in hope of a resolution? Once again, I want to be clear. Yes, I left my necklace in the hotel room. My fault. But I feel I took the appropriate steps to find my necklace within three days of my stay. Since then, the hotel has found the necklace and THEN lost it. I feel like I can't express enough I took whatever steps necessary to retrieve my necklace. So beware, the Sheraton is a nice hotel, but be careful when you leave your room.

I would recommend that people walk out from door and walk 300 yards or so left to Sunset Grill for breakfast. Great value . Second issue is with people taking your drinks oders from the table. They charge 20% gratuity on all drinks which are already over 10CAD if you include taxes. Absolute rip off ! Last gripe is on room service. My kids wanted room service and we decided to give them a treat ; I might add I was not in the room when food was delivered. They ordered steak , childs nuggets , child pizza. Pizza was 'tiny' and nuggets were spiced ; sirloin steak was burnt to a crisp and was not edible.

We were given a room on the 17th floor, close to the ice machine and elevator which could be heard from inside the room but still quite adequate. The room was clean and comfortable, although the double beds are a bit small and not as comfy as some have said. The Hotel location is ideal, we parked at the lot across the street (as others have said, it is much cheaper than the hotel Valet parking). For the price we were quite content. However, that changed as bed-time approached. We were traveling with our daughter who has been quite sick but is now recovering. This weekend was a little trip for her, to relax, see a show, and buy a couple of new outfits (she lost some weight while sick). Unfortunately a group of young men were put into the room next door, there seemed to be quite a few of them (couldn't have all been guests at the hotel). They were rowdy and noisy while pre-drinking before they went out around 11:30PM. So, we figured that was the end of it. It wasn't. They were back again around 3 am, even rowdier, throwing ice cubes at the walls and it seemed they were looking for a fight. There was an altercation outside our door around 3:30 am and they were gone again......I believe one of them made a cell phone call and the quote was \"we re coming for you and your family, expletive, expletive\". At this point I called the desk for Security. I'm not sure if Security arrived but I heard the group leave to the elevator shortly after this. Somewhere around 4 am some of them came back and seemed to go to bed, then around 4:30-5 am one of the rowdier ones returned and seemed to be still looking for a fight. After about 30 minutes they settled him down and that was it for the night. During this time I phoned the desk again and requested a room change if we were going to have the same neighbors for the next 2 nights. They were very apologetic and told us they would move us to a higher floor (club level) with complementary club lounge privileges. We were pleased with this and 1st thing in the morning we accepted the offer and were moved to a room on the 40th floor. The room was pretty much the same (quite decent) and we took advantage of the complementary club lounge privileges in the mornings by enjoying the Continental +++ buffet style breakfast. It was very good. The room seemed a little on the warm side and seemed to really stay steamed up after the 3 of us showered (maybe the exhaust fan wasn't working?) but no big deal. The first night we spent in this room was fine. The 2nd night was different. A group of young people (19-20 year old - my guess) were having a party. Started at about 10 PM and went on until I went down to the desk (12:30-1 am). Again there seemed to be a lot of people who were likely not Hotel guests and people were making calls outside our door giving more people directions on how to get there. Again the desk people were very apologetic and Security shut it down quickly around 12:30 PM- 1 am. They all left and we didn't hear anything else until their arrival back around 3:30 am......... not much really just one or 2 token expletives. As I said, the staff was very apologetic and said they would assign some star points to my account that I could use for a free night stay in the future. I checked earlier and the points were not there but there was a disclaimer that said it could take 7-10 days for points to show up. Maybe it was just luck of the draw, but only 1 nights sleep out 3 left us pretty disappointed. We did appreciate the efforts made by Hotel staff but because this was a weekend for our daughter we really wanted for everything to be better. Probably won't stay here again. I know that this kind of thing happens, not sure what the solution is ???", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, however...\u201d", "Author": "citygirl0827", "ReviewID": "UR104535883", "Content": "My boyfriend and I booked on hotwire a 1 king room. Compared to the prices from the Sheraton website, we got a total steal! We stayed only for one night, but we didnt want to pay the ridiculous prices for hotel parking, so we parked across the street. Its literally a 30 second walk from the parking lot to the hotel. Weekend rates are amazing! We only paid $13 for parking compared to $45+tip. When we walked in, it was very clean and service was fast. Room was very nice, however the bathroom was small, and the counter space was very minimal.There wasnt really enough room for my make up bag, and his toiletry bag (toothbrush, razor, deodorant, ect). The bed was very comfortable, however the pillows were very soft and the minute you put your head on the pillow, you sink. My boyfriend and I had to put two pillows to get the right firmness. We had some drinks with us, so we called down to the front desk to ask if we could have a fridge (at an extra $20 fee), however they didnt have any more left, which is odd because most hotels come with a fridge! Anyways, we had to fill up the sink with ice to keep our drinks cold. Also, room service prices are just absolutely ridiculous! $18 for a continental breakfast? $30 for bacon and eggs? Give me a break. If you go down to the restaurants, their prices are about $5-$10 cheaper, depending on what you get. Around 7pm we went to the hotel restaurant, however what I noticed was a lot of \"hoodlums\" (baggy pants, over sized clothes) hanging around the main lobby. It looked like they were doing a drug deal, but Im not too sure. I dont know if they were hotel guests, but they would hang around near the doors and it made me feel very uncomfortable because they would just stop and stare at me as I walked by them and they would hiss at me. I didnt feel very safe in the hotel in that aspect and I needed to have my boyfriend with me if I wanted to go down to the lobby for whatever reason. My boyfriend suggested to me that because it is very centrally located downtown, they are just probably hanging out since everything else is closed. After dinner when we went back to our room, our floor (and especially our hallway) REAKED like weed!!! At that point in time I was kind of disgusted. I did call front desk about it and they said that they would handle the situation accordingly. After going out for the night, we arrived back at around 3am and noticed that our hallway didnt smell like weed anymore, which I was very pleased about. Our sleep was amazing (despite the pillow situation) and we were graciously given a late check out at 1pm. Overall, our stay was fine.

Nothing wrong with the hotel or common spaces, but the room we were given was not up to 4* standards, it was more in the 2.5 to 3* range in my opinion. The furniture was worn, every bureau or nightstand was touched up with brown paint to hide scratches, there was only one phone in the room, and it was on the work desk, so you if you called for a wake up call, you had to get out of bed to answer the phone. The room did come with an alarm clock, but it was not functioning properly, and the volume button was broken, so you only had one level of volume.....LOUD.No mini bar, very few amenties in the bathroom, all in all a real bare bones older room. I have stayed at some 2.5 - 3.5* properties in the city, that had much nicer rooms with many more amenties. The room was clean, and the beds were comfy, though I did request a firmer pillow the 2nd night, and was told they did not have any firm pillows, but they could send up more of the ones we didn;t like if we wanted (love the logic of that one). This might have been a \"Hotwire/Priceline\" room, as some hotels seem to reserve the rooms no one wants (this one was close to the elevator and ice machine), or rooms that have yet to be updated to third party customers. I know the manager of this hotel responds to these reviews sometimes, I'd like to know exactly what your policy is for customers who have, as your check-in clerk described it...a pre paid reservation, because in this case I certainly did not get what I would describe as a 4* room.

Finally I took the elevator one floor up to find that the entire eleventh floor is a restaurant! Sure enough, I heard that thumping from above even in the hallway of the 10th floor . In my opinion, this hotel has no choice but to forget about using that 10th floor for guests. Otherwise they are are really doing their guests a disservice. They are quite a busy hotel, so if you arrive late you will probably be stuck on that floor. Note that this will probably not impact your sleep quality as the noise seems to start around 10 am or later. Another comment about this hotel is that there are quite a few partiers using it when the Leafs are playing hockey, staying up until 3am.

Expedia then contacted the Sheraton and told me they were advised that the hotel had a computer glitch and they did not show a king room had been booked - a different story than I was told by the hotel management!). Eventually we got to our room. About 30 minutes later someone opens the door to our room - they had booked into the hotel and were given the same room as us (this not only happened to us but to others as well). We did get a subsequent call from reception apologising for the glitch and offering some financial compensation. On check out they had errors on our hotel bill - they charged us for services that had been prepaid. The bill was corrected, they apologised for the glitch and I settled up. Later when I checked my credit card bill there were other charges on my account from the hotel. I called the hotel and they told me there were room service charges against our room - I told them we did not have room service and that I had settled my account in full when we checked out.

Their response was to make me believe they felt like this issue could ruin my whole holiday and so do whatever to get it fixed making me feel like their No.1 priority for that moment. It was a great experience at having a (small) problem resolved v quickly. Perfect customer service and some, so well done Dino Sepe! The bars and restaurants in the complex are good standards (if a little expensive), sauna and pool area was good too.

I found that there is a parking lot opposite the hotel on Queen Street West that charges roughly $20 for 24 hour period. On arrival we parked in the mentioned garage. There is an entrance for the Sheraton Centre on the first level so you dont even have to go overground. On entrance to hotel I was impressed by the decor & cleanliness throughout. The checkin clerk was helpful & because I had recently signed up as a SPG member he offered us a choice of room. We opted for a single Queen. The room was spacious enough for 2 people & the amazing view from the 31st floor looking at the financial district. The room had a decent sized LCD with a decent channel selection. There were a few sports channels so I was happy enough. The bathroom was clean. The room also had a safe & iron/ironing board. The internet was charged at $14.95 per day, but we didnt purchase. The hotel is in walking distance of Yonge Street & Dundas Square. CN Tower, Rogers Centre & Air Canada center are walkable, but it can take around 30 mins.

We reserved one night with Hotwire and had an unnecessarily difficult time extending the stay one additional night. I understand that the hotel does not hold sway over the Hotwire reservation but there was no reason for the hotel to give us such a hard time about adding an additional night, given that there was availability. Calling ahead shunted us back to Hotwire's system, which of course was unresponsive. Upon arrival, the front desk said it had no access to the rates available on the hotel's own web site, so it we suffered the ridiculous indignity of reserving the next night ourselves on one of the complementary computers in the lobby, then returning to the front desk to combine our reservations, as instructed, saving $50 per room per night over what the front desk was able to provide. After doing that and being assured that two reservations were combined and seamless, sure enough the keys expired the next day, just when a mad rush of new guests were coming in from massive travel delays, causing another completely unnecessary problem for us. The concierge reacted to my disgust and fixed the problem promptly so I appreciate that. Beyond all that the rooms were nice with nice views, although one was a bit small. The staff were courteous and helpful. The location is quite central, yet not in a \"dead after 5:00\" district you might find with other business hotels\u00e2\u20ac\u201dother interesting neighborhoods and attractions are either walking distance or short and readily available cab rides away. Walking includes connectivity to the network of underground tunnels/malls, although our trip to the nearby Eaton Centre mall was disappointing. The indoor/outdoor pool is quite an attraction, especially in sub-freezing weather, but the staff was oddly militant about exiting the pool outside. Not entirely unreasonable, as it's icy, but getting out of the heated pool to test the freezing weather (briefly, of course), seemed like the most logical way to enjoy the outdoor feature, and there were otherwise no signs to the contrary (and there were no smoking signs, for instance). I wasn't bothered after an initial warning, so no worries, just weirdly contradictory. The breakfast buffet featured a generous spread but was very expensive, even by major hotel standards. Good, but not a good value. Several other restaurants owned or closely associated with the hotel were closed for the holiday season, which limited our options. We were referred to The Keg, a steakhouse down the street, which aptly served as a cocktail destination on the first night and dinner the next. No free internet in the rooms, which seems rather outdated. Plenty of people taking advantage of free WiFi in the lobby, though, including on a few hotel-provided computers. So some significant hassles but otherwise a nice hotel with courteous staff. Would stay again but probably would not seek it out especially. Would just as soon stay at the Fairmont Royal York down the street, or just try another 4-star hotel next time.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat up until NYE problems...\u201d", "Author": "Mike_NCL", "ReviewID": "UR91567580", "Content": "In all, this is a great hotel to stay in, centrally located, clean rooms and friendly staff. However, and here's the bit that's left the sour taste. As we were staying on New Years Eve, we expected a little noise from Nathan Phillips Square (we got a great room to watch the fireworks and event from) which quickly finished at about 12:30am, and maybe some other noise from revellers getting back in late - we don't have a problem with that, it's New Years Eve after all. What we didn't expect was there to be a party on the 43rd floor, the hotel to shut the lifts down to prevent anyone going to places where they shouldn't and revellers from upstairs using the 42nd floor fire exit to get up and down to the 43rd. Whilst shouting, squeeling and smashing glass. Did I mention this was right outside our room? Did I also mention that the hotel sent a letter to every resident the previous morning warning that there would be party patrols monitoring noise levels to check no one was having a party in their rooms? It took a call to security to sort it out, and even then the party didn't finish til 2:30 - which was meant to finish at 2am. We voiced our concerns on checkout that morning (New Years Day) to the Lobby Manager who was checking us out and who studiously took notes and asked if there was anything he could do to ensure we stayed at the Sheraton the next time we visited Toronto. I suggested that our breakfast that morning could be free (which he agreed to) and that next time at least give people the choice of room if an event is going to disturb residents.

I managed to get a cheaper rate thanks to one of the popular third party websites, and was quite pleased to have got the Sheraton Centre in Toronto. It is a large hotel - we were on the 30th floor, but I do believe there were many floors above us. Our room was smallish - one queen bed, a small tub-chair, desk and TV. The TV was a decent sized flat screen - and the picture quality was good too if you care about those things! There was a large stain on the floor by the chair - not great for a 4 star hotel, but I guess some wear and tear is to be expected in such a large hotel. The view from our room was wonderful - the CN Tower, financial district and even a small part of the lake could be seen. The bathroom was functional and very clean. The bed was comfortable, and the room temperature could be controlled with ease. The tea/coffee making facilities were decent too, with Starbucks coffee being the brand of choice. I used the gym,and must say this was not bad at all. All the equipment was very new and of good spec - although I didn't use the half indoor half outdoor pool! (It WAS minus 8 degrees outside! Although plenty of brave souls took a dip so I expect the water temperature was just fine). All the staff we came across were friendly and helpful, although the cleaning ladies were very noisey in thr morning! (Knocked on our door at 8am for room service, despite the 'do not disturb' sign being left on the door knob. They then came back about an hour later and did the same thing, before having what seemed to be a 2 hour chat outside in the corridor!). The parking is valet only - at a whopping $45 a day! I would suggest that unless you are made of money, use the municipal parking lots instead. $45 is outragious! Also, it costs $15 to use the Wifi in the rooms - go downstairs to the lobby and it's free for 40 minutes. Overall, a pleasant stay at this hotel.

The hotel quickly dispatched keys to a new room and had maintenance and housekeeping on the spot within 10 minutes. Good. They offered free breakfast for the inconvenience without any prompting. A nice touch.

The free wireless in the lobby wasn't all that reliable but they do provide free computers to use for a time limit of 45 mins max. So that was nice. The rooms were clean and comfortable. I guess my one complain about the rooms would be the walls seemed quite thin and you could hear the room next to you quite easily.

I was offered an explanation of their cleaning/room availability procedures, but that did nothing to explain why my \"guaranteed\" request was not honored and my elderly mother was now in a different tower than my family.

What I just don't get, though, is why the value-engineers and bean counters think it's a great idea to skimp on the basic amenities. Why can't they provide decent toiletries? Why can't they provide anything better than a manky Starbucks paper cup to drink coffee out of? Why are there no glasses in the bathroom, just horrible cheap plastic things in cellophane shrink wrap? It degrades the whole experience, from arriving with the hopeful feeling you might be staying somewhere vaguely luxurious, to the depressing realisation you are staying in something more like a youth hostel where they make the beds nicely.

I have never been anywhere that an employee was not recommending that you use their service. Then, there was no direction as to where to check-in, as it is tucked away off the main lobby. After wondering around, we finally found it. I was told that we were to have a double room. I asked for an upgrade, particularly since I am a rewards program member. My guess is that the rooms that the hotel offers on Hotwire so cheaply are the small double-size beds. I was told I could pay an additional fee for a Jr. King suite room. I willingly and happily agreed. Then I was told none were available. Why would you offer it if it isn't available? I asked if any King rooms were available (non-suite), and I was told that none were available. However, as I was standing there, the employee next to the one waiting on me offered two different people upgrades to King rooms - both of whom arrived after me.

Thankfully, you couldn't hear outside the bathroom, though. The best thing that I can say for this hotel is that it was a bed to sleep after a weary day of sightseeing. But, did I mention the fact that the beds had the noisiest sheets? It was sleeping in a paper bag. You can also hear what is happening in the hallways as there is little insulation.

It had one double bed, with barely enough room to fit a desk and arm chair in along with it. We could have paid extra to upgrade to something bigger but decided not to. The room was nice, though a bit dated. The carpet, especially, was showing its age. The bathroom had a somewhat awkward layout, with the toilet under the counter. It made it difficult to use the counter space properly, but we did get a good laugh at my husband being able to \"check out his technique\" every time he used the washroom, since the placement of the toilet allowed him a good view in the mirror!

Other than this, room service did a good job with punctual deliveries. The Club Level is on the 43rd floor. They had a continental breakfast buffet and snacks at night. Beverages other than juices and coffee must be purchased (very disappointing!) The bar did not have a sufficient selection of alcohol to make my preferred drink. My last evening in the hotel I brought my cocktail to the lounge and was allowed entry and shortly thereafter was told they must take away the drinks we brought. Staff was treating me like a child but finally conceded and allowed me to finish the cocktail I brought. Normally the Club Level had 2 stations open to toast breads. On Labor Day, a very busy day, they decided to only have one station open. They also ran out of paper cups, making it difficult to take coffee to my wife. For some reason, on several visits to the Club Level, my adult kids were told they were not allowed in the facility without an additional charge. In these instances we told the staff to contact the front desk to work out the difficulty. Nevertheless, it was a hassle. Of all our disappointments, our biggest complaint regards inadequate cooling in our rooms. The AC units can be set to 65 degrees, but would only achieve a low temp of 71 degrees. This made for very poor sleep, in spite of the hotel supplying a fan. Complaints about this to the front desk accomplished nothing. I definitely would not recommend this hotel and will not return.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottinghamshire", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel - Will Be Going Back !!!\u201d", "Author": "Summer-Sun-x-", "ReviewID": "UR78467545", "Content": "Me and my friend arrived at this hotel on 28th August, we upgraded to a club room with access into the club lounge which has fantastic views of the city from the 43rd floor.

The pool area is brilliant complete with indoor and outdoor bathing areas, also equipped with a Jacuzzi and pool bar. Pool towels are included. The location was fantastic, easy access to the famous sites, although if you didn't feel like walking, Toronto has various local transports to offer, including busses, trains and the subway etc... We used a taxi to get to and from Pearson International Airport which cost around $58, you could also use a local airport shuttle bus which cost's around $22pp or if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to take 2 trains you can get there for around $10pp. The room was fantastic, although we didn't have a CN Tower view from the 38th floor it didn't disappoint us, we were facing the new city hall which at night time lights up and looks amazing. We booked the CN Tower on arrival, we purchased a total tour ticket which cost $38pp and included: - entrance to the observation deck, entrance to the glass floor on 141st floor, entrance to the Skylon pod on 181st floor, entrance on to a motion ride and a 3-D film. The only extra would be a meal at the 360 restaurant, which is quite pricey! We managed to get a trip to Niagara Falls whilst we were there, which I would completely recommend, we had a 10 hour tour which cost $169 it did seem a lot but was well worth it, we had lunch overlooking the falls, maid's of the mist boat ride, a shopping break at Niagara On The Lake and to finish the day off a wine tasting at Niagara College. A great way to experience Niagara but if I had more time I would want to stay for 2 nights to be able to see everything and even cross the board to the United States.

This bed bug infestation seems to be common throughout all the rooms of this hotel. It seems that bed bugs will follow you home, and will cost thousands to remove.

I told both of them we were not upset and it was not a big deal..just wanted a clean glass.

Kind of difficult when you have a family with you that are tired from the journey. While we got alot of attention from managment after the problems and they did provide some compensation for our troubles, this was very different than any of our previous stays at this hotel. I think it must be a staffing issue as we found that housekeeping was slow all weekend to clean up the rooms. Perhaps it was our fault for not wanting our room cleaned at 9am on a Saturday morning when housekeeping went by the first time but usually you don't need to specifically ask to have your room made up. We also noticed the lack of service when we did use the club lounge for breakfast, we found the replenishment of food and the clean-up to be slow.

Overall we were happy with the room - especially the views of the CN Tower/city. It was clean and tidy and was in a good state of repair. We were upgraded to a king size bed which was massive in comparison to UK beds. I personally found the pillows too soft. The bathroom was clean and towels changed every days. My only negative about the room was the fact it was located next to the vending machine/ice machine area. This reduced the width of the room slightly and when the machines were used their was some noise. We did not feel this was bad enough to request a room change. I did find the rooms aircon a little loud and thought were had a poltergeist when it would suddenly come on in the middle of the night. - however it was very pleasant to return to a cold room after a days sightseeing. Due to the tripadvisor reviews we did not eat at the hotel. Their are many great places to eat in the vicinity. We enjoyed Tim Hortons and Sunset grill for breakfasts and visited Little India for a great curry, Chippies for excellent fish and chips and had a belly busting meal at Baton Rouge.

This club membership seemed worthwhile since the 33rd floor (and probably above to level 43) were specifically reserved for members of this club. We were treated to a King-sized bed upgrade for free ($20 value) since they didn't have a queen available at the time.

It was a fantastic deal for such a well-established brand of hotel.

Upon arrival I asked if there were any payable upgrades (I do this everytime I book through a third party site and I highly recommend it). Not only was the girl happy to look, she gave me plenty of options as well. We decided to take a junior suite for an additional $30 dollars (one king bed, one pull out couch, and a balcony located on the 3rd floor). My friend and I spent the day shopping and when we came back to our room around 8pm we noticed the room next to us had a 'please be quiet' sign on the door and thought that was weird. We went into our room and were just watching television and talking when we heard a knock on the door. We thought it was our friends who were meeting up with us (we were going to see deadmau5 that night - it was AWESOME btw). When I opened the door, no one was there. I looked around and heard a door open, it was the person next to us. She said 'you need to be quiet, I'm trying to sleep.' and she tried to close the door, I stopped her and said 'all we're doing is talking, that woke you up?' and she said 'yes, you're being loud. I need to sleep.' I kept stopping her from shutting the door because I was trying to tell her my friends and I wouldn't be leaving for another 2 hours so if we're loud talking at normal volume this is going to be an issue. She didn't care though and just insisted that she needed her sleep and shut the door in my face. I called the front desk and explained the situation saying that I didn't want to be kicked out on account of waking this woman up again. He was totally understanding and within 10 minutes he had us move to a room just a few doors down. They didn't have any staff available to run the new key cards down to me so I happily went up to the front desk to get them myself. I spoke with the gentlemen who had helped me and asked if there was anyone beside us in the new room, which i quickly said after 'not that it matters' I didn't want to give the impression that we were going to be purposely loud and disruptive to other guests. He said 'no, no one is next to you and to be honest that woman was quite rude to tell you to be quiet.' I was pleasently surprised to see that the hotel would be on our side at all! Turns out the Sheraton has a no noise policy that begins at 11pm (not 10pm like most hotels I've stayed in) and it being only 9pm at this point, the hotel sided with us.

We often ended up using the service lift and I once got lost taking the stairs out of sheer desperation. Parking at the hotel itself was ludicrously expensive at more than $40 a night - the hotel is connected to the huge City Hall parking lot which charged less but still more than we would have liked. Internet access in the room was expensive however the lobby had a few machines which allowed you to get online for free. All in all the hotel was pretty comfortable but our room could have used a bit of a lick of paint.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest Toronto locaton; best hotel pool; A-1\u201d", "Author": "barb1960", "ReviewID": "UR70342439", "Content": "Went for a business conference and brough my two sons with me(ages 17 and 20).

We were greeted very professionally and were happy with the location, the view, and the room. The hotel is right in the middle of the action on Queen Street and extremely close to all the downtown activities. The room decor was nice, the beds comfortable and the cleanliness was fairly good. The pool and hot tub were very nice, and not too crowded, which surprised us given the huge number of people staying at the hotel and the hot weather! We enjoyed that very much. There's no mini-bar in the room, which surprised me. Room service was incredibly expensive. There's very few places in the area where you can pick up fruit or a pastry for breakfast, so you're a little bit stuck in that way. We went down to the Starbucks in the lobby which had absolutely awful stale muffins. Now, the biggest complaint we had was that we were awakened at 3 or 4 am by a fire alarm. Now normally I would say that's life, and just accept that people sometimes pull an alarm just for fun. However, I had read reviews that this is a VERY common occurrence at this hotel. I think they need to look at WHY this is occurring on a regular basis at this hotel and look for ways to address them. I would suggest limiting the number of proms/teen age events to have a more mature crowd. Also perhaps warning people ahead of time so they can make an educated decision about whether to stay there or not. (Yeah I know that will never happen.) If you are a person who has trouble falling back asleep after the worry of a fire alarm, stay somewhere else. You won't get a good night's sleep. In addition, how about an apology the next day? In the morning, I would have liked to close the blinds, but they scrimped on the curtains and I believe that it is not possible to close the heavy fabric, only the light, useless ones (hopefully management will correct me if I am wrong). So we were awakened at 6 am by the incredibly bright light. Basically, we got three hours of sleep...no fun at all!", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hereford", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "HerefordSniper", "ReviewID": "UR69736464", "Content": "this is one of the best locations in the city. we only had to walk 20 minutes to get to anywhere !

Check in was efficient and we were allocated a room on the 32nd floor of the hotel, over looking Nathan Philips Square. The receptionist made some airline staff wait until she had finished checking us in before dealing with them, this was very refreshing to see, a pet hate of mine is airline staff pushing in and demanding to be dealt with immediately. Location wise the hotel has direct access to Path and on the edge of the entertainment district. The room it self was a bit small compared to the Delta Chelsea, where we had previously stayed. We had a double bed which was fairly comfortable. The room was clean and well maintained, with only the air con unit making an annoying noise. Maid service was very efficient, though I couldnt understand why one day we received water and the rest of our stay we havent. Maybe that will change before we leave on Sunday. The hotel provides free WiFi to guests in in the lobby, this is something that isnt really advertised very well, instead the in room brochure is pushing high speed net access in the room for $16.95 a day which we felt was quite steep. We only learned about the WiFi after allowing the hotel channel to complete a full loop. We havent used the hotel restaurant yet, Bistro on Two, it seems overpriced and has some serious competition both inside and outside the hotel which the hotel management have decided to ignore or not compete with. So we have eaten in Quinns/Shopseys a few times, located in the lobby of the hotel. The hotel is located on the PATH and a small fast food court is readily available for lunch and breakfast, which is a lot cheaper. In Room Dining is again expensive. It took us a while to adjust to the time difference and we found the 1.30 am to 6am dining menu to consist of a chicken wrap and salads, not a good offering for a high profile 4 star hotel, so we didnt bother, we stocked up with nibbles from the 7/11 nearby. We had money to spend but the hotel offering just wasnt up to what there guests are looking for.

You know that there is a problem when I refuse to take off my socks while walking around the hotel room due to the lack of confidence that I had for the sanitation of this hotel. You know it was really bad when it's prompting me to write my first review since becoming a member of Tripadvisor... I stayed at the Sheraton Center 2/3 through 2/5. Thank goodness it was a short business trip. For $167.30 plus tax a night, I got a room that had hair all over the bath when I walked in, blood on the shower curtain, and consistently bad customer service (don't believe me??? I took photos on my iPhone because I couldn't believe it either). Here were some of the issues: 1. I called downstairs to ask what the number to the Hyatt Regency was down the street. The agent said that she would have to call me back. After waiting ten minutes with no return call, I called down again and got another person. This person took forever to try to figure out the number. Can't you just Google \"Hyatt Regency Toronto\" and get the information? 2. How can housekeeping not see the hair (most likely pubic) in the bathroom. We're not talking hair here and there. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking clumps of hair, scattered throughout the bath. I called downstairs and had housekeeping come up right away to clean it (they did). I would have changed rooms but I was too exhausted after a 6+ hour flight. 3. The vent in the bathroom had not been cleaned in a long time. The picture does not do it justice but notice it's mostly brown (it's supposed to be white) - YUCK!!! 4. When housekeeping left, I decided to hop in the shower. I closed the curtain too see blood. Are you serious??? I got right out and went to bed. 5. In the morning, I called downstairs to get the address and directions to the Hyatt Regency. I later found that they gave me the wrong address and directions (they gave me the information to the Park Hyatt and not the Hyatt Regency). 6. At the front desk, I asked for directions to Mariposa Cruises (the largest cruise company in Toronto). The agent looks at me while standing in front of a computer and says \"I don't know.\" I stand there a little longer thinking that they would look on the internet with the computer right in front of them to find that information but no, he just continued to look at me. WHAT???? I asked this same question to the front desk agent at the Hyatt Regency (after getting lost with the directions given to me by the Sheraton) and without any hesitation, was given the name of the building that the cruise line was located and circled it on a map for me. 7. Valet: The valet ticket reads \"Please allow 20 minutes for your vehicle\" Kind of ridiculous since it costs $45 a day to valet in the first place. 8. Since the valet is busy getting the cars that the people in the hotel have requested, you also have to wait for a valet to take your car away when you pull up to the hotel. After a long day, I pull up in front of the hotel to find nobody there to take the car. I wait and wait and nobody comes to help. I finally had to get out of the car and find a bellman who was willing to help me out by taking the car himself. These are the only things that are coming to mind right now. The whole stay was a disaster. Toronto is a beautiful city and I cannot wait to go back. One thing is for sure, however. I will not be coming back to the Sheraton Centre when I do. P.S.

My first stay was January 19-20th for business. I was a little disappointed with the room. Found it to be a little dingy, and the carpets were pretty dirty in the hallways, etc. My first thoughts were that this is NOT a four star - you should see the Intercontinental in comparison - stayed there twice in the last six months and it is amazing! Anyway, I then decided to upgrade my room for the next visit this past weekend, which was also the weekend of my 30th birthday, so a celebration. I was told that for $60 a night, you get a nicer room, with nicer fixtures and amenities, free appetizers, free breakfast, and free wireless internet, and it was the only way to get a King bed. The non Club level rooms were either one or two doubles. Since it was my birthday, she offered to do the upgrade for $50 a night, so I agreed. When I arrived the second time, I was disappointed again with the upgrade. The room furnishing was exactly the same - except for being slightly bigger, having a King bed, and having a mini-fridge which the other did not. I was told it would be a NICER room. The wireless internet is only in the lobby and club lounge, not in the rooms. I thought I could live with the $50 a night if the breakfast were good, but it is a pitiful continental. You can get better muffins and croissants at the Tim Horton's downstairs. After breakfast, I went to the front desk and requested to \"downgrade\" again to a normal room, since the \"upgrade\" in my opinion was not in the least bit worth the money. $50 would get me an amazing breakfast! To their credit, they apologized and told me they would not charge me for the upgrade, but keep me in the same room (they were pretty full, so probably couldn't move me). They gave me new keys (to remove Club Loung access I guess?) and sent me on my merry way. Since they were giving me a free upgrade, I didn't take one of the front desk representatives up on her offer to send up complimentary sparkling wine for my birthday, since that would have made me feel guilty . This was the more minor issue of my stay. The major one was getting robbed while I was out. While I was out Saturday night, someone entered my room and stole my purse and my laptop. My purse was recovered by hotel staff on a different floor (fully intact, minus cash and subway tokens). The laptop, however, is gone forever. I cannot describe how violated I feel when it comes to my privacy. That laptop has my whole life on it. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not even mention the files I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lost since my last backup. The worst thing though, is how I feel the hotel treated me. They called me around 3am telling me my lost purse was found. I told them I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose my purse, but left it behind in the room. They told me it was in lost and found. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when we noticed there was a problem, and I noticed it was gone. They told me they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d come to take a report and bring me my purse. After hanging up the phone, I noticed my laptop was gone, too. I called the front desk, nobody picked up. My husband called again, and after a while someone picked up. They transferred him to security, where someone picked up, and then immediately hung up the phone. It took a while for them to finally come upstairs (and at 3:30am, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like waiting). I ended up being up until 6am with security, police, etc filing reports. According to security, the door lock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s log shows that it was left ajar. It is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to leave that door open without a door stop or something. It is that heavy, and the springs are that strong. Trust me, we tried, and I have the videos to prove it (thankfully I had taken my camera with me when I went out and left my purse behind in the room, so I had it to record the video). The door will ALWAYS fall shut. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m thinking either the lock malfunctioned, or worse\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. (Security logs can probably be altered). I tried talking to security the next day, asking them to entertain the possibility that the lock didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t register. I was completely brushed off \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The log says this\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd etc. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electronics. Electronic locks do have quirks and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always work. I had enough issues with the lock electronics on my previous car, locking and unlocking itself. Heck, I had difficulties unlocking the door earlier that day. And, I have two other people that were with me confirming the door was closed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a habit, after all. I never, ever left my house or apartment door open. I outright challenged the guy to come upstairs with me and try to leave the door ajar. He brushed me off again. He was being very very vague, obviously trying not to say the slightest thing that could be any acknowledgement of responsibility. So there are no security cameras on the floors, there are none in the elevators, and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to pass security to get to the elevators. The elevators are equipped with key card slots, but they are not required to access the rooms. The security is pitiful at best. I cannot begin to describe how horribly upset I am about this. I have my videos of numerous attempts to leave the door ajar and am deciding what to do about all of this. Was expecting a call from the manager today, but have received none so far.

It's smaller size hence fewer rooms means elevators are not half as busy as those in the other tower, and the rooms were large enough to facilitate a family of two adults and a 15 year old teenager, that being myself. The location was by far superior to many hotels in Toronto, being just steps from amazing Yonge St. and the large but pricey Eaton Centre, facilitating every shop you could imagine. The 'buisness center' in the lobby was an exellent feature, and although staying at a busy time for the hotel I was always able to use one of the slow but facilitating computers, and although they may appear full at first glance a few patient minutes will see one become available.

We parked the car in there around 4pm and took it out the next day at 12pm and somehow racked up a bill of $32! Besides the parking issues, when we checked in we were asked if we wanted a room with a double bed or two double beds. I told the guy that when I called I was told that the room was a King size bed.

Beware of the latter. We booked our room through Hotwire and were given a room on the 7th floor of the Richmond tower. To our surprise, the room was absolutely tiny, with only a full sized bed, barely large enough for two adults. The room was so small, there wasn't space for our two large suitcases. When we asked if another room was available, we were told that it would be an additional $50 per night to move to a room with a larger bed (i.e. if you book through a travel site you are a second-class customer). The bathroom was tiny and dark with literally no counter space for toiletries. One of the three bathroom light bulbs was burned out, and the shower leaked badly from the side, spraying water onto the bathroom floor when operating (they did fix both of these issues after I complained). Worst of all, our room was inexplicably not cleaned after our first night, despite our two requests to do so. The Richmond tower is obviously assigned to teenagers. There were kids in the hallways talking and/or reading at most hours. Oh, two of three elevators weren't working in this tower, so 10 minute waits to get up/down were the norm. $18 for Internet access, $45 for parking. The hotel is so big, common areas are mobbed with guest at most hours. Public areas of the hotel were nice, and the location was great. We especially liked the easy access to the Bay and Eaton Centre via the underground PATH system. Overall, while the main tower may be nice, the Richmond tower is two-star at best.

As a result, there was much wear and tear on this hotel, and service was sub par at best. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stay here again unless I find one hell of a deal. ROOMS: My room was on a high SPG floor which provided great views of the financial district. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty much all it had though. The bathroom in particular was in poor form. The shower handle was loose and the water temperature was impossible to control. There was rust on some of the fixtures, and the HVAC vent was so loud that it kept me up at night. I guess on the plus side the bed was comfy and the power outlets were on the desk and not behind/underneath. SERVICE: The service was slow and impersonal, with the exception of the young club lounge hostess. There were long lines for checking in (see photos), long lines in the club lounge, and long wait times on the phone to reach an agent. It took over thirty minutes for someone to deliver coffee packets to my room. AMENITIES: There were some nice amenities, including the oversized fitness center and the heated indoor/outdoor pool. The former was dark however, and the latter was overrun by little kids. The club lounge was impressive though. Located on the top floor (43), it had panoramic views of downtown on two sides, as well as an impressive evening cocktail reception. Expect long lines during peak hours though. Free WiFi in the lobby and club lounge. LOCATION: Despite it being my first time in Toronto, I quickly realized how great the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location was. If this is your first time as a tourist, you just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go wrong with the location. Plus the hotel is one of the tallest buildings in the area so you can spot it if you get lost. CLEANLINESS: The public spaces and rooms were clean for a hotel with so much traffic, but at times there were so many people making messes that the staff just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep up. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be uncommon to see empty cups and dirty napkins in the lobby or various parts of the club lounge. There was also visible wear and tear in the guestroom, especially in the bathroom. This hotel could use a renovation to make things a bit more fresh. VALUE: I was able to find a phenomenal deal for my stay, and I really have no room to complain since I certainly got great bang for my buck. That said I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I would ever pay the retail rates for this hotel.

I booked this specifically for the included continental breakfast as I wanted to save my family of 3 the expense of paying $20/person for the buffet breakfast offered by Bistro on Two, the usual breakfast place of choice in the hotel. This turned out to be a mistake. We stayed at the hotel on a weekend so the Club Lounge was EXTREMELY packed on the Sunday morning at 8:30am when we ventured down for breakfast. I was expecting a nice leisurely breakfast with my family with a nice view and ended up a table at the end of a hallway with not even a table cloth because the place was so packed with people. Having a small child with me (who couldn't help much bringing food and coffee back to the table), my husband and I ended up making WAY too many trips to the main buffet table to get food and beverages (as there are no trays provided). As a previous reviewer mentioned, I was quite appalled that after about my 5th trip up to the buffet to get some orange juice I came back to our table to find a badly photo-copied form sheet asking for a tip! You've got to be kidding? I received zero service while sitting there, no one offered to refill coffee, no one took our used plates. What would the tip be for? This breakfast experience aside, the hotel itself and the rooms are marvelous. The rooms and beds are very comfortable, the views are breath-taking, even considering that I used to live in Toronto and have seen it all before, it was still amazing from the 36th floor. The pool is great too, although the location of the change rooms is a bit inconvenient. From previous reviewers, I took the advice and parked across the street at the City Hall parking lot for an amazing overnight price of $18! The last time I stayed here I paid $40 for valet parking and had to wait forever to get my car the day I checked out. It's definitely worth parking over at city hall and it's very easy to get to. You just go down the ramp right by the main Queen Street entrance to the Sheraton and then take the left ramp down (the right ramp is the Sheraton valet parking entrance)...so you're basically in the same underground. There are plenty of other hotel guests parking there, so you don't have to worry about your car sitting in a dark and secluded parking lot overnight. It will be perfectly safe. The Sheraton is also conveniently connected to the underground PATH system, so you don't even have to go outside to venture over to the Eaton's Centre. Very convenient indeed. All in all, I would definitely recommend staying at the Sheraton, but don't bother paying extra for the Club level rooms, the Bisto on Two may cost a bit more in the end (if you're paying for more than 2 people) but the experience will be much more relaxing for you and your family!", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clane, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, very nice room, but food was poor!!!!\u201d", "Author": "John_in_ie41", "ReviewID": "UR48784601", "Content": "I was in the hotel for a conference staying for the week.

The club lounge on the top floor has views in both directions to allow you to take photographs. Breakfast selection in the lounge was plentiful and the staff were very helpful.

I haven't been to the city in a long time and I was taking a much needed vacation. The room was clean and the staff very friendly, especially the gym manager. The hotel lobby is newly renovated and modern and the <<Sheraton Link>> free internet was fun but you had to wait a while to get a free computer. The gym itself was clean and modern. The half indoor half outdoor heated pool was just great and not too cowded. The changing rooms (although a little detached from the entrance of the fitness and pool area) were well appointed and clean and there were plenty of fresh towels at our disposal. The weather was awful during our stay but the underground access connecting the Sheraton center to Toronto's PATH and subway and all it's attractions was a HUGE plus (although some of the underground connections close early). It was nice having a window in our room that I could open a bit to let in fresh air. There are always cabs waiting at your disposal at the entrance at all times. The city itself has much improved over the years and there is no signs of stopping, I recommend the city and hotel for a great little getaway. The only negatives: Not much service at the valet, I drove up expecting the valet and bellboy to help with the car and luggage but ended up taking everything out myself, having my girlfriend wait with the luggage while I parked across the street (at a cheaper rate then Sheraton). The wait was long to check in but next time I will register with Starwood prefered guests and zip by the line like many did. Also after check in, the clerk at the desk should have told me that I was staying in the Richmond tower, it took me a while to figure out the configuration of this hotel, and that there were 2 towers, Queen and Richmond. It was a shame that the waterfall garden was closed for the season. On the second night there was a fire alarm at 4am which was very annoying, we had to leave our rooms quickly.

We parked our car at the lot across from the hotel for $24/day (underground parking, safe) and then took public transportation or walked to wherever we wanted to go. The subway stops were within two blocks of the hotel which was very handy. We also had to go to St. Michael's hospital and it was a short ten minute walk away. The best part of the hotel was the location. We stayed in a junior king suite. The list price was $279 but we paid $159 through a special deal with our credit card company. We were expecting more space, but in fact, the suite was really just a slightly larger room than a standard hotel room. There was a balcony, that overlooked a garden, but it was too cold and wet to go out onto it. As well, the small table and two chairs on the balcony were not cleaned and the balcony itself had some leaves and branches on it that were not cleaned up during our stay. The bathroom left a lot to be desired. The tub/shower combo was just standard and was located in a tiny room right beside a toilet. It was so small we couldn't easily close the door. The sink and counter were outside this area which was good, but there was no door separating that space from the room so anyone using that area disturbed other people in the room who were trying to sleep. The decorating was OK, nothing special, and there were some gouge marks in our rug. The outside door of our room had peeling paint on it. There was a nice flat screen TV. The room could be renovated, but the good thing was that is was spotless. The bed was very comfortable. To access the room. we had to descend about 8 stairs once we got off the elevator, which was a challenge when we were transporting our luggage. The worst thing, though, is that we couldn't adjust the heat in our room. When we called for advice we were told that the heat wasn't on yet - we couldn't believe that a hotel in Toronto wouldn't have its heat on in October, when the outside temperature was 5 degrees celsius. Our room was only 67 degrees. We did get a heater brought to the room, which helped somewhat, but it is unacceptable to have to have even needed one. The pool was nice - a very large indoor/outdoor one with a separate lane set up for anyone who wanted to swim lengths. My only complaints about the pool were that it opened at 7 am - I'd prefer 6 am as that would allow people to go for a swim before starting a day's actiivity. I couldn't make it to my 8 am conference if I only got into the water at 7, so that was not as convenient. I also like a pool to be warm. The temperature of the water was 81 degrees, but for me, that was too cold, given the outdoor component of the setting.

The bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. There was a spacious desk and leather arm chair with foot stool. We were given robes and plenty of towels.

Firstly it's in a central location, close to two subway stations, on a streetcar route and above the PATH which can be accessed easily by going down into the concourse area. The room was very good. It was spacious, the bathroom was well equipped and, above all, the bed was amazingly comfortable. We had a room in the Queens Tower with a view looking towards the CN Tower with the lake visible between the office blocks. We asked for a quiet room and it was away from the elevators on our floor. The only problem was that we could still hear what seemed like elevators clunking away in the building though we were not sure where they were. However, this seemed to ease off late at night and didn't disturb our sleep. Contrary to the experience of others we didn't have to wait long to check in or out and the staff (reception, tour/information and cleaning) were all friendly and helpful. For breakfast go down to the concourse and make your way to the Thomson Concourse where you will find a little place called Fit for Life on the right hand side. They do great breakfasts of omelettes and toast (or, if you choose, there's a salad and fruit bar). Run by really friendly staff this was a favourite place for us. It was spotlessly clean.

On Dec. 31st you need tapes to reenter the hotel or to go to the public parts, but if you checked-in before Dec 30th, they did not give you any tapes to show that you are a hotel guest, so you have to go to front desk at 11.30pm - real great fun.

We requested an upgrade and she gave us a range of options for us to chose from. As this hotel is the tallest in the city it seems to be broken up into two pay rates. One for floors 2-25 and another for floors 26-40. I would suggest the upgrade as for an extra 50 canadian dollars you get a great breakfast on the 43rd floor for each day of your stay. (Also included in the upgrade are canapes served from 5pm on this floor but we were never about to enjoy them.) You also get a room on one of the higher levels, we were on the 36th floor and the views were amazing. Even though it was quite close to elevator and we were staying during the Caribana Festival our room was very quiet. It was spacious with a large TV and air conditioning. Our room was cleaned daily with fresh towels and toiletries added. Also complementary were two bottles of water which were placed in our room which was a nice touch. Another feature of this hotel which we found great was the range of in-house movies on offer. For about 15.99can (cheaper than two tickets to the cinema) you could chose from around 100 movies, some of which had yet to be screened in the UK and others that were showing in the cinema at the time.

I don't normally go to such effort when choosing a hotel but because my husband and I were travelling with my parents , it was a necessity to do so. I reserved and pre-paid our rooms roughly six months prior to our arrival and got a good rate. When we checked in the spacious, airy reception was busy, but managed efficiently. I specifically asked for quiet rooms, which we got, but for the first night only. You see, much to our horror, the Caribana Festival weekend was upon us and the hotel from Friday until Monday transformed from decadent hotel for the discerning business / city traveller, into something akin to a hooker line up at a baseball game in a ghetto. Despite 4 separate calls to guest services between the hours of 1 and 5 am, no effort was made by the hotel to calm the noise and drunken antics in the corridors which punctuated 3 out of our 4-night stay. I know this for a fact because the noise was literally outside our bedroom door therefore, I would have been aware of security asking for quiet. In the end I emerged from my room, dishevelled and cross at 04:50 on Saturday morning with a plea that they keep the noise down. They did reduce the noise but not for long and only on that one occasion. This hotel has a range of services to offer: indoor-outdoor pool with sun-loungers; sauna; well equipped gym; restaurants; bars; shops, and a lovely waterfall garden. The restaurants are not cheap; in fact Toronto in general is an expensive city to visit. The free internet access in the lobby is painfully slow, so unless you really can't go without internet access, don't bother. There are 3 check-in stations in the hotel lobby which enable you to check in online and print your boarding cards free of charge. The bedrooms we reserved had 2 double beds (very narrow, advise you pay the little extra for a king), desk, TV, hairdryer, en-suite with shower-over-bath, ample sockets and lamps, large windows and air conditioning. Air conditioning is somewhat antiquated - radiator-style vents at the window behind the blackout curtains and quite noisy...but barely noticeable on Caribana weekend...if it wasn't for the prolonged periods of disturbance in the wee small hours, and the lack of assistance from the hotel staff I would rave about this hotel.

All in all, the hotel was wonderful. The bad points: The first room they gave me was next to an ice maker and the chiming of the elevator lobby on the 7th floor. (No way to sleep through all of that). They moved me with no complaint to the Richmond Street tower (which I would recommend). The beds were doubles, not queens. Being tall, I thought it would be a problem but it didn't seem to be (height-wise). Two people sharing such a bed might be a little tight, though. They did have 'king bed' rooms at an additional cost. The cost of the starbucks in the lobby was ridiculously expensive. A blueberry muffin costs $4. If you walk past the Starbucks and exit the door at the eastern end of the lobby, there's a 'coffee place' there with muffins for $1. My key card stopped working for some reason -- a minor inconvenience. Now, the good stuff: the room was very nice: two beds, oversized chair, desk + chair, flat-screen TV. The bathroom was spacious. I'm 6'4\" (just under 2 m) and the shower head was taller than me! Lots of towels; great housekeeping staff (I used only 2 of the 4 pillows that were on EACH bed) and housekeeping was thoughtful enough not to keep replacing the 2 pillows that I didn't want. This way, I had little to do but jump into bed, in the evenings. The view from my room was great: below is a wonderful courtyard with nice landscaping and a waterway that leads to a waterfall that spills into a glass-enclosed area of the lobby bordered on with rocking chairs. Looking out from the window was a dead-on view of the new city hall complex which was quite pleasant The pool is the largest indoor/outdoor pool in North America and the fitness center was very nice -- both included in your room rate. They served complimentary popcorn in the lobby as well as lemonade. There was a 'business center' area in the lobby with free computer access as well as free wifi in the lobby that could be accessed from any seat including a long narrow table with chairs on either side that seemed to attract people with their laptops. The location couldn't be beat: 1 block to the subway.

However, I'm not sure why everyone else had such difficult times and so many negative things to say. This was by far the best hotel experience we ever had! I booked the hotel through Hotwire for a really good rate. RIght after booking it, I called the hotel to ask to make sure we had a room with a king sized bed because my husband and I would be celebrating our anniversary. Not only was the woman I talked to very helpful and friendly, the hotel upgraded our room for free! The moment we got to the hotel, the staff did their best to make our anniversary magical. The man at check in greeted me by telling me happy anniversary, during our stay we were given a \"gift\" from the hotel to help us celebrate our anniversary, and then as we were checking out another man told me again that he hoped our stay was fantastic! We had club privileges so we were able to have breakfast every morning and snacks in the afternoon. The food was good and the employees were very friendly. The tour and information desk was excellent and always willing to help us find a good place for dinner. They always gave us a lot of options and they always knew the exact location and gave us great directions to get there. They were really knowledgeable about the area and a highlight of our stay. The hotel is in a great place in the city and getting the subway is really easy. We used quite a bit of public transportation to get to the zoo and to see Jersey Boys. It was easy to use and we felt very safe the entire time. It only cost $9 for the day and you could use any type of transportation (subway, bus, streetcar). Also, we parked across the street at the center for the performing arts (I think it is called) and it was $25 a day. Better than the $40 valet at the hotel.

Because of this, I am particularly leery of staying in hotels anywhere. Unfortunately, the Sheraton Centre Toronto seems to have a bed bug problem on its hands. I did my normal mattress and headboard search in my room and came across numerous black dots on the mattress corners. These are in fact the droppings of blood-fed bed bugs. There was also a discarded skin shell inside the white plastic corner protector of the mattress. Bed bugs shed their skin when they grow after feeding. After having pulled the bed away from the wall, I noticed a fine line of white powder running along the carpet where it meets the wall. This is probably an extermination or containment effort of some kind, perhaps diatomaceous earth. Since I was sharing the room with a friend, we immediately requested another room. The front desk staff was quite accomodating, excusing themselves several times. The second room, on the same floor, had all of the same signs. Exasperated, but late for a dinner appointment, we left, leaving our suitcases in the bathtub of the second room, and explained to the front desk staff that we would be back to discuss the issue. Upon our return, the lady at the front desk had alerted the manager, who came out quickly to meet us. He was quite friendly, though strangely he refused to admit that the hotel had a problem, even though I am well-versed in the signs of an infestation and asked several times if he was aware of the problem. Could this be for legal reasons? I even offered to show him the proof, but he said it was not necessary. I mentioned several times that I in no way wished to embarrass the hotel or alarm other visitors, but that I was unable to sleep in a room with bed bugs due to my former experience. The manager assured us that \"housekeeping\" had been made aware of the problem. He moved us to a third room in another (the other?) tower. The beds seemed clear of bed bugs or their droppings and I told the manager this when he called to check up on the situation. Unfortunately, I later discovered bed bug droppings and blood stains along the edge of the wall where it joins the carpet behind my bed. My collegue noticed more of the white powder behind his bed. Being as it was quite late, we decided to make due with the room since it was already the third that we had tried. At least the signs weren't in the bed, or at least on the exterior of the mattress. If you have never bed bugs at home, it is pehaps difficult to imagine the scope of the problem and the insuing stress and loss of sleep that follows. To avoid this problem to the best of your ability, I highly recommend keeping everything off of the floor in hotel rooms and for God's sake, don't put anything on the beds! I keep all of my bags closed on the suitcase stand in the bathroom, or even in the shower when not in use. Always pull the bed out from the wall and tuck in any linen that touches the ground. Lift the mattress and look for the bed bug's characteristic droppings: tiny black dots, like those from an ink pen. The black dots are blood from past meals and will smear if on a surface such as baseboards and wooden or metal bed posts. If an infestation is really bad, you might actually find live bed bugs just scurrying around. Upon returning home, one should wash all of one's clothing and store suitcases in large, sealed plastic bags if possible. I found giant Ziploc bags in New York which do the job quite nicely. Don't forget that, depressing as it seems, bed bugs can live for up to 18 months without eating blood. They just wait patiently for their next meal. I don't blame the hotel for the problem as a bed bug infestation has nothing to do with cleanliness or quality. I still feel obliged, however, to make this problem known to potential future customers so that they can take the appropriate preventive measures. There are several other reviews of this hotel which speak of much more horrific experiences than mine (i.e. live bugs on top of the bed). The staff was helpful with my complaints, but once a hotel of this size is infected, even on a small scale at first, it seems nearly impossible to fully control the problem without spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars. Since the average person is still unaware of bed bugs, or doesn't seem to care until they start biting at night, it is unlikely that many hotel chains can or want to take the costly but necessary steps to eradicate this problem, including educating and advising their guests about safety precautions as well as being upfront about the hotel's bed bug infestation status.

We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel- without traffic it can take about 15 minutes, but at most, give it around 30-35 mins. The flat taxi rate should be $40 CAD- but our driver didn't have a meter (which we unfortunately did not check beforehand), and he charged us $49. We arrived at the hotel around 10:30pm. We were given a room with two double beds. Per another review, we requested for an upgrade when we checked-in. For $20 extra/night, we could have gotten a king bed. For $50 extra/night, we could have gotten a club level room, which included free breakfast and internet. The hotel was semi- full that weekend due to a dance competition. Check-in was uneventful. We decided to keep our room. Please note: there is a charge for internet; however, the lobby does have free wi-fi. It's under \"the link\" network- where you'll be asked to enter your name and room number. We were given a room in the Queen Tower- and unfortunately, the room smelled like smoke, and the vents were taped up. We did have a nice view from the Queen Tower. We requested another room (note: you'll have to go through \"Guest Services\" to get to the front desk), and they were able to give us another room, but in the Richmond Tower. The room was a lot better, and it did not smell like smoke, but the view wasn't the same (which was okay for us). One of the frustrating things about staying in the Richmond Tower was that the elevators were definitely slower than the Queen Tower elevators. The room wasn't as modern as it could be (in both towers)- which was surprising based on the the first impressions of the lobby, etc. Hotel Restaurant: We ate a late dinner at \"Trader\", the restaurant/bar on-site. Note: the kitchen closes at 10pm on Friday nights, so try to be there by 945pm (not sure about the hours for the other days). My husband had the fish and chips and I had the steak chilli- both were decent- very nice service. Location: This hotel is very close to a lot of attractions- we walked to the CN Tower (around 15 min), St. Lawrence Market, Yonge St, etc. The one nice thing about the hotel is that there is a \"Tour and Information Desk\". They were very friendly, and very knowledgeable. Note: You can buy tickets from the info. desk and avoid lines (e.g. CN Tower). Also, they can arrange tours for Niagara Falls (Please see separate review for Niagara Falls/Toronto Tours). Also, the hotel is not too far from the subway. Subway Note: You can purchase an all day pass for $9.00 total (with various combos: 1 adult and 5 kids or 2 adults and 3 kids- something like that!!). The hotel does have luggage storage and bell services. Note, there is also express check-out and a couple of computers set up for airport check-in and printing boarding passes. The staff was very friendly. Overall, the hotel was in a good location, the staff was friendly, and the room served its' purpose.

The bathroom was clean and big enough for a hotel bathroom, so I'm not really sure why so many people complain about them! We stayed on the 25th floor and asked for a water view, which we got. It was only a partial water view because of the way the hotel is actually laid out, but it was still nice and we had a great view of the CN Tower. The food at the hotel is very good as well. We got a 50% discount on all food with the StarHot card, so we ate at Trader's. We also ordered room service which was amazing! The cheesecake was soooooo creamy - to die for. We got big breakfasts in the morning and they were also very tasty and substantial. There was really only one flaw with the stay. When we checked in we asked when the pool was open until, because our one main reason to stay overnight in a hotel (when we live in Brampton) was to go swimming! The lady at reception said 10. As we were finishing the check-in my boyfriend noticed a letter on the desk that said the pool would be closed from June 1-June 7, which was the time we were there. I asked the lady if the pool was even open and she told me she had forgotten it was closed. We could use the pool at the Westin but it was about a 25 minute walk away. I was quite upset when I got upstairs because I had a completely flexible schedule and could have gone downtown for the night anytime. I know that hotels have to close the pools for cleaning and such and have no problem with that, but if there had been any mention of the pool closure on the booking site I would have either waited until the pool was open again or booked in at the Westin. But there had been no warning and I wasn't even told upon check in. If we hadn't noticed the letter and asked the lady again, it's likely we would have gone to the pool later only to find that it was closed. I ended up calling the front desk to ask if there was anything they could do. I asked if we could possibly move to the Westin, which they said wasn't possible. They apologized for the inconvenience and offered to give us taxi vouchers to and from the Westin so that we wouldn't have to trek all the way there and back. I thought this was a pretty good offer! We took the cab to the Westin, swam as long as we wanted and then got another cab back to the Sheraton. Aside from the minor blip with the pool, the stay was great.

Finally my bill had a few relatively minor charges - few dollars here, few dollars there - that I still do not quite understand (I think I got charged for using the TV to watch local channels). If you are using Priceline, or any other budget minded website, be aware that the incidental charges (e.g. parking and internet access) may blow away any money you \"save\" by staying at this hotel.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan", "Title": "\u201cPretty Convenient Location With Some Minor Problems\u201d", "Author": "FleetingDasein", "ReviewID": "UR31267409", "Content": "We stayed at the Toronto Sheraton Centre for two nights during May 2009. I booked through Hotwire for only $60USD a night, so I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered the hotel to be the Sheraton Centre. I don't want to discourage other Hotwire/Priceline customers, but the discount price haunted me during my visit. After reading other reviews, Sheraton Toronto Centre does seem to differentiate between Hotwire/Priceline and full rate customers. If you booked at a discount price, do not expect a room in the upper floors with a good view of the CN Tower. The hotel lobby is magnificent. Check-in was fast, efficient but a little bit too impersonal. I was notified that I had booked through Hotwire, and that my room was in the 5th floor of the Queen tower overlooking City Hall. As the front desk gentleman told me, the room had a \"decent\" view. I was a little bit disppointed but I was tired and decided to head straight to my room. I got one of the newly renovated rooms. The room was well apointed and spacious. I noticed that there was some trash from previous guests in one of the bins. There were even some prescription pills left behind under the bed. I've had worse experience in other hotels around the world, and truth be told, I was quite content with me room. I just ignored these two inconveniences but I know most people wouldn't. Another thing that bothered me about this room is the fact that the flat screen television was not directly in front of the bed. My neck was already hurting from being on a plane for so many hours, and I did not want to make it worse by watching TV in such an awkward position. The bathroom was pretty comfortable but not very appealing in regards to the position of the toilet (right next to the door). The room was above average. If you want to compare it to other Toronto hotels, it is definitely better than the Delta Chelsea but nowhere near Intercontinental on Front St. Then, there's the charges. My partner and I were mixing drinks and needed a knife in order to cut a lemon. They wanted to charge us to use a knife from the restaurant. Then there are the charges most people are familiar with---It is $14.99 for high speed internet and $2.00 for every phone call. Suggestion: I was able to get free wireless internet in my room. So check for open connections before paying the exhorbitant fees. So far everything that I have written appears to be negative, but the Hotel is quite a good value if you are paying discount price. It is conveniently located and pretty close to everything downtown. There are many stores in the lower level of the hotel, so if you want a quick snack, you are less than 5 minutes away from a McDonalds. My favorite amenity was the huge indoor/outdoor pool and the hot tub. It is great to swim surrounded by tall buildings. Quite a surreal experience if you are not used to big cities. Bottomline, do not pay full price for this hotel and if you pay discount price, know what to expect. There are better hotels out there but this is the only one in the middle of it all.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay @ the Sheraton\u201d", "Author": "J_onthemove", "ReviewID": "UR31052691", "Content": "Stayed for a quick one night through Toronto last month.

A very pleasant 20 minute taxi-ride from the Airport at around $40 takes you to the heart of the city & the hotel entrance. Admittedly this is not a particularly enticing entrance as it's located \"under\" the rest of the hotel but once inside we had a hassle-free check-in & both me and my fiancee agreed that it was the most pleasant check-in we'd had for some time, courteous, helpful & most importantly, quick ! Our room was on the 32nd Floor with stunning city views toward the CN Tower. Whilst hardly lavish or particularly snazzy, the room was very spacious & perfectly clean & modern. The bed, linens, A/C, Heating, safe, bathroom & shower were all perfect but the lack of a fridge was disappointing as hotel bar prices are very steep (as expected). The lobby was great although the huge stairwell/escalator area near the outdoor garden window was very dated due to the high density of shiny chrome - very 1980's Trump Towers ! Overall though it was a nice area to relax although internet points were usually very busy. The lobby has direct access to the amazing PATh system but the shops and food-places directly under the Sheraton are extremely dated when compared to much of the other facilities in this underground metropolis. It's still very convenient however. The location of this hotel is simpy perfect. Within walking distance of almost everything a first-time visitor could ask for (with the possible exception of the Royal Ontario Museum & Yorkville Area - about 45 mins or more perhaps ?). The PATH System makes everything incredibly accessible when either cold or wet & we felt very lucky to be able to walk all the way from the Rogers Center to our room without ever having to venture outdoors. There's plenty of great eating places within 10 mins of the hotel although we did struggle to find inexpensive breakfasts but that was probably just not looking hard enough. We did eat at Traders Bar one evening and whilst the food was adequate we soon wished we'd ventured out to the Keg Bar & Grill which is one block away and you get a far nicer experience, meal & value for money. Our friends stayed at the Fairmont which we could have gotten at roughly the same price as the Sheraton but we were glad we stayed where we did. Whilst the Fairmont is admittedly very impressive & has sumptuous public areas (including a link to PATH far nicer than the Sheraton) we felt the location combined with the modern and far more spacious rooms with a view outweighed the benefits of staying at the more well-known Fairmont.

It's very conveniently located for downtown business. The hotel itself is quite large and boasts a big lobby with a large contingent of helpful staff to cater to the traveler's needs. Service is generally courteous and professional, and very efficient (except for parking attendants -- see below) The rooms are spacious enough with a nice work area. Beds are comfortable and the bathroom is functional. I wouldn't call the rooms plush, cosy or trendy by any stretch of the imagination. Decor is bland with your typical basic hotel chain furniture and drab colors. The gym is quite large with more than enough equipment. The adjoining swimming pool is quite nice, half inside and half outside which makes for an interesting feeling when swimming outside in a snowstorm in the winter. The hotel has 3 restaurants but I've always only visited the sports bar due to the lack of interest in the menu of the other restaurants. Bar menu is very basic and food and drinks are outrageously priced as I've come to expect in this type of large hotel chain. Good thing is, being in the downtown core, there are a lot of much better restaurants just a few steps away from the hotel. Parking in the hotel is by valet only which is convenient when arriving but it takes a long time to get the car back (I've seen up to 20 minutes) so that's a pain. But there is a municipal parking just across the street under Nathan Philips Square which is connected to the hotel through the Path. The Club Lounge on the 43rd floor of the hotel offers a very nice breakfast buffet with breathtaking views of the city. Contrary to many other hotels including the Hilton just across the street where drinks are complimentary, they charge for drinks in the evening at the standard hotel prices.

I get so excited when I have a Sheraton stay booked because I know I am going to sleep like a baby. The restaurants are a bit pricey - especially drinks in Traders. But the buffet breakfast in the bistro, while pricey, is incredible and fills you up for the entire day - booking through Expedia often gets you two coupons for a complimentary breakfast buffet. yum! My favourite thing after the beds is the lobby. Fantastic for people watching, sitting and reading, using the computers or just socializing. My only complaint is on my last two stays, the rooms were far too warm and even when setting the temp to as low as it would go, the temp in the room never dropped below 25. Also, there always seems to be some kind of construction going on in the hotel - however it rarely disrupts my stays and it has improved the hotel.

I spent an extensive amount of time reading hotel reviews about this Sheraton. The public parking across the street was sort of inaccurate on the reviews. While cheaper than the Sheraton, be aware. With NO in-and-out privileges, it is $14 for normal business hours, then starts a whole round of charges past that, $6 post-business hours to late night, then $6 for overnight. So our parking was $26 a day plus. It is reduced on weekends. We crossed the street to the hotel, and took the PATH. While I bid a low Priceline rate, with taxes, then Canadian taxes, it was another $20 per night. What I hoped for was an upgrade to club level. Smiling up the check-in clerk with my nice clothes on didn't work. She did suggest that the Sheraton was running a special to upgrade at $40 a night. The value is excellent, so we took it, since internet access alone would run $16 a night. We've stayed here before, so it was pleasant to be back. The view of the city (which I requested) was exceptional especially at night. The bathroom was quite small for two for a week, small sink space. A room with two beds (which I requested) also provides some more room. The doors and paint were a bit worn. Lots of small debris in our hallway on the 42nd floor. Quite surprising, but I suspect this hotel is having some problems. We were a couple of doors down from the Royal Suite, which did have a party going on with guests lingering till midnight. We just turned up the TV. Used the spacious gym everyday which was great. My husband felt the pool was filthy with a pool boy just dazing into space when not busy. The hotel needs to keep the pool clean while guests are in the vicinity. It is an indoor/outdoor pool, but with staff sitting up front not doing anything, it doesn't hurt to remove debris from the pool. The best part of this hotel stay, in my personal opinion, is CLUB Level access. The breakfast is exceptional, in an exceptional surrounding, and free. Lots of pastries, fruits, boiled eggs, yoghurt, lots of healthy options, and unlimited Starbucks and better quality coffee and espresso. With a breakfast like this, lunch is not necessary. Appetizers are equally well-done, again in a beautiful surrounding with floor to ceiling windows. You do get killed on the wine though. Two glasses of wine, the most reasonable on the menu, and you'll get a glass quarter-filled, ran $28, including the multiple Canadian taxes. With a spread like this, dinner is not truly necessary.

I extended my business trip and decide to spend the weekend in downtown Toronto. After a very successful Priceline bid of $50 (US) a night, I was happily surprised with the Sheraton. (Previously - twice - I got the Westin Harbor Castle thru Hotwire.) After a quick, cheerful and painless check-in (despite a very busy Friday afternoon), I arrived in room 1546 - a great semi-corner room (with city and CN Tower views), nicely appointed furnishings, superb bed & linens... and, unfortunately, dated carpet and a few hairs in the bathroom. The hotel lobby is fabulous - a Saturday morning clown entertained the kids, great popcorn (free) to satisfy the pre-dinner hunger and a great city vibe. I had a great work-out in the gym and wished I had more time to experience the pool and another work-out. The gym is very spacious and has modern equipment. Swift and plentiful elevators kept the hotel guests moving up and down without much delay. The hallways are quite dated and need updating. One eye sore was the tray of dishes left in the hallway (outside room 1547) that was there when I checked in on Friday afternoon and didn't get picked up until late Saturday afternoon. Upon leaving the hotel on Sunday morning, a bellman stopped me in the lobby asking where I was going. When I told him the airport, he grabbed my bag (without asking me )and said that the limo service was cheaper than a taxi. He said the cost was $55 all inclusive. I asked him twice if that included everything, specifically tips. He said (twice) that $55 was all I need to pay the driver. Upon arrival at Pearson airport, the driver advised me that the price was $55 + $3 GST (tax) and tip was not inclusive. The drive rwould not budge (and not get my luggage out of the truck) until I paid him in full - despite my arguments that the hotel bellhop had advised me $55 all inclusive. The receipt had the company name Canadian Limousine Service , and - get this - there was no GST number on the reciept. CRA audit lead pending. This tainted my experience and stay at the Sheraton. I would suggest that the bellman was part of the scam and would advise those that don't want to be scammed to just walk out the lobby and hail a taxi (as there are plenty waiting in the driveway). I've taken the limo service from the Westin Harbor Castle and both times the bellman told the driver, in front of me, what the price is and that the price was all inclusive. I hope that Sheraton managment reads this complaint and investigates this limo company that operates with the hotel. The driver was also very intrusive (trying to find out if I owned property, how much it was worth, how big my family is, etc.). Great stay, very nice room, very central and friendly staff and vibe.

No rooms on the north side of the hotel, he told me--the north side overlooks City Hall and Nathan Phillips Square--only the room he wanted to provide, and a few others, none with views and all near the elevators. Seems that since I was booked through Priceline, I was relegated to the hotel's inferior rooms. He as much told me so, and not even pleasantly. Since I wasn't winning the argument, I went to my room 740. Not wholly unpleasant, it did have two beds with nice duvets, odd vinyl Burberry print wallpaper and drapes, and a view of the pool. Unfortunately, the bathroom had not been cleaned thoroughly--I found a rusty or bloody washcloth between the shower curtain and the wall that the maid missed earlier. As well, my safe was already locked, so I couldn't use it. I tried twice to leave messages for the general manager, and didn't get calls back. Finally, on my third attempt, I reached Carmela at the front desk who moved me to the type of room I wanted to begin with, and for my troubles, provided club access. The new room, 3111, was much nicer, and had a corner view of both City Halls. Neither room was huge, but this one had a working safe, and a clean bathroom. Nice bed too. The hotel's club on the 43rd floor is one of the nicest facilities I've seen like it anywhere. At one point, it was a rooftop restaurant. . .the stunning views of the skyline and City Hall remain, with a high ceilinged, well appointed space. Club guests enjoy a buffet continental breakfast, as well as hors d'oeuvres from 5-8 each evening (though drinks, and expensive ones at that, are extra. $11 glasses of wine, etc.) The fitness facilities are well appointed, and free to guests. The machines are adjacent to the pool. There is no hotel in Toronto with a more central location than the Sheraton. The subway--clean, efficient, well located--is a block away, and a train/bus combo gets you to the airport for $2.75. As well, the Queen Street streetcar runs right in front of the hotel, to take riders west to Queen Street West, an alternative shopping area, or east to The Beaches, a New England-style village with a lakeside boardwalk and cute shopping strip. Eaton Centre is just a block away, for noteworthy shopping. And the city's financial district is just in back of the hotel. So other than a rude desk clerk who shouldn't be in guest contact roles, and the housekeeping issues, this would have been a good stay. After I returned home, someone from the hotel contacted me to apologize, and invited me to stay at the hotel in the future. Nice attempt at recovery. That said, if a hotel is going to take bookings through Priceline or any other source, it shouldn't treat the guests poorly, or any differently from any other. If this behavior is encouraged by management of the hotel, Priceline shouldn't allow a hotel to participate.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guelph, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPriced higher than it can possibly live up to!\u201d", "Author": "Marcello74", "ReviewID": "UR28587790", "Content": "Stayed two nights at the Sheraton Centre while attending a conference. Once I found it (see note below on signage), my front desk experience was great -- they were organized, polite and friendly, allowing me an early check-in with no attitude.

Great flat screen TVs in the rooms, though no HDTV channels -- just HD movie options. HVAC controls in the room are new and great. My view was of the business district and the CN Tower...very nice. My room was not quite perfectly clean. There was a half-consumed bottle of water along with the fresh bottle when I arrived -- obviously looked over by cleaning staff. The bathroom wasn't quite as clean as I'd like, and there was not a working bathroom fan. I found the hotel restaurants and room service menus to be absurdly priced. I did find the food I ordered to be good, though the trays were a bit bare (no ketchup or steak sauce, for example) and the service fantastic and friendly. At that price, though, I'd expect no less. The conference amenities (including food) were well tended. My only complaint about the hotel -- aside from the ridiculous pricing -- is that there's very little directional signage, and since it's a very big place, a person needs help. By day three I was still getting waylaid down the wrong hallways. For such a big conference hosting hotel to be short on signs is odd. Consider that it took over 10 minutes to locate the check-in desk when I walked in the first day! I found that staff were a bit scarce in the main parts of the hotel.

It is cheap, clean, and will drop you off right at the hotel. Booked a \"King Suite\" which had a couch with a pull-out bed and a king size bed with very soft, comfortable pillows. There were 2 large flat screen tvs, 2 desks, very comfortable leather chair. The room had 2 large windows with a view of Toronto and the CN Tower. The room has a mini bar/refrigerator and some snacks. The prices of everything are very high, for example $5.00 for bottled water. Don't use any of the products. Just take the elevator down to level \"C\" which is the level of the Toronto PATH system. This is what makes the hotel great. There are many stores to buy snacks, meals, or beverages. There is a shopping area in the PATH 1 block from the hotel called \"The Bay.\" I found a whole case of water, 12 pack (same exact bottles as in room) for $2.99 CAD. So take a look in the PATH before you pop open something in the room. Note: While walking the PATH I noticed that many stores and restaurants were closing around 6:00 PM, so make sure to get down there before the stores close. The hotel did have a restaurant, large pool, and huge lobby. Overall, it was a good hotel with many services available.

We were offered an upgrade for an extra $100 a night. This consisted of a room above floor 25 (we were already on floor 24 which was quite high enough for me), full breakfast (which we don't eat) and free access to the pool and gym which I didn't think we would have time for having only two days and a long itinerary, so we declined. The reception area was huge with lots of comfortable seating, computer access and tables to work at. A large enclosed patio garden on several levels with waterfalls and pools could be seen through huge glass panels in the reception area. I forgot to explore the swimming pool area which I read about when we came home. I wish I had seen it as it is supposed to be the largest indoor/outdoor pool in Toronto. Our room was spacious, clean, well furnished and above all light with a super open view over a square which meant we could see over the other buildings for miles. What a lovely change from our previous hotel where the room was dark and our window looked straight into the window of the next building. Everything was spotless so it was a surprise, on retiring, to find the previous occupant's chewing gum still parked on the bedside clock! With so much to do in 2 days we were out most of the time and didn't eat in the hotel but we did have a drink in the bar on our first night. Wow! The bill came to over $20 for a pint of beer and one small Baileys. On our last day I popped into a little shop at the hotel entrance from the PATH system to buy 3 postcards. I was in a hurry as I paid and got my receipt and it was only as I started to write the cards in the reception area while waiting for our shuttle that I realised I had paid $7 for 3 small ordinary cards! The PATH system is a series of underground shopping malls all linked and stretching for 27km (17miles). Great if the weather is wet and cold and super fun to navigate. I loved the fact that we could get back to the hotel when it rained without ever going outside on the street. Coming from a rural area where shops are few and far between this was heaven. With our stay in Toronto limited, the staff at the excursion/tour desk were brilliant and we booked a city tour, harbour tour and entrance to the CN tower on an all inclusive reduced ticket. Another tip I got from a person who gave us directions was that if you want to eat inexpensively and well, but wish to avoid the fast food outlets, head for the theatre district. We did this and were delighted with the choice and value to be had. Canadians are lovely people I was beginning to find.

The night wasn't too cold, so we didn't need it, but I wonder what happens when it gets cold? There was a full garbage bin outside our room when we arrived and it was not emptied by checkout time. My kids have always loved the indoor/outdoor pool, an attraction in the winter because it is neat to swim with the snow all around. However, it does get cold and it is nice to hop in the hottub to warm up. Suddenly there is a new rule that no children under age 12 may enter the hottub no matter who is supervising. (complete with pool police to enforce the rule!) Kind of an ugly surprise when you are all cold and soggy. Buffet was still pretty good on Saturday morning.

We also were able to get complimentary bottled water in our room. There was a coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee included also; I believe this is standard for all rooms. Our room had a view onto the Nathan Phillips square and ice skating rink as well as the old city hall building. The room itself was a good size with the typical desk and chairs. The Sheraton Sleeper Bed was very comfortable. The bathroom, however, could use some updating even though the marble sink and countertop were nice. Staff were generally helpful, professional although I suggest that the concierge staff members (apparently there were the same two people on duty during our day visit) become more familiar with the hours of operations for recommended restaurants. We were there on Boxing Day weekend and were told that Fune Japanese Restaurant a few blocks from the hotel was open. It was not. Therefore, we wasted our time walking there. Location-wise the hotel is good if one likes quirky as well as chain shop shopping as the hotel is on Queen St. W. It's also attached by the PATH system to The Bay department store which is connected to the huge Eaton Centre shopping mall. If you care to walk to Chinatown it's a long hike about 20 minutes or more depending on how slow or fast one walks. It's also possible to walk to the Queen's Quay harbourfront-about 25 minutes or so. In fact, we saw the Westin Hotel near the harbour and were very glad we chose to stay at the Sheraton. The Westin is isolated and the hotel itself very quiet. That is a good thing if one needs quiet as the Sheraton is completely the opposite. The Sheraton's lobby is huge and bustling almost like a train station in my opinion with many people walking in and out of it. During our visit there was a large group that had their get together at the hotel and their members occupied just about all the public spaces. As far as internet use goes, the Sheraton is pretty good as there is a bank of seven computers with complimentary internet available for guests in the lobby area-first come first served.

Parking: I took the advice of others who have written reviews on here, and parked directly across the street under Nathan Phillps square/Town hall. It was much cheaper, and is easily accessed from underground directly to the hotel. 2. Another great thing about the Sheraton is that it is directly linked to the underground P.A.T.H system, hence you can walk to the Eaton Centre...Air Canada Center...etc without going outside. This is nice if it is raining, but I do reccomend doing your walking outside, and enjoying the city views. 3. The lobby is huge...and busy, but check in hardly took 5 minutes, and we were off to our room. The room itself was clean and nicely sized. No complaints at all. We were in the Richmond tower, and it was fine. 4. Didn't eat in the restaurant, but there are many places to get a bite around the hotel.. There is a Mcdonald's in that PATH to the Eaton Centre if you are looking for a quick cheap coffee or bite to eat. Overall, I quite enjoyed the Sheraton. Perfect Location for a shopping weekend, (a minute walk to the Eaton Centre) or to enjoy the downtown sites. Probably a 10 minute walk down Young Street to the ACC. Hope this helps. Don't hesitate to choose the Sheraton.", "Date": "November 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener", "Title": "\u201cLuxury Hotel overlooking City Hall\u201d", "Author": "TiredCanadian", "ReviewID": "UR21706501", "Content": "I spent a night at the Sheraton for business.

I had a problem with very noisy neibours but when I asked to be moved I was lied to and told there wasn't a single free room to move to. As I said I like to balance things out so I would say location is excellent however, the front of the hotel makes the m25 look like a peaceful place to pass through. Facilities inside are very good but don't go to the bar for too many drinks or you'll be looking to remortgage your house pretty rapidly. Walls are paper thin so hope you have nice people next door, the staff however are very friendly much the same as the rest of the people in Canada.

Didn't eat in the hotel; we had breakfast at various cafes in the subway under the hotel as we needed to get on and out siteseeing and prefer not to eat dinner in hotel restaurants as they normally have little atmosphere. Instead we ate at two local restaurants, the Keg and Little Italy, which are just around the corner from the hotel main entrance and both provided good food at a reasonable price. The hotel is in a good position for the shopping areas, restaurants and for siteseeing. It is about 20 minutes walk to the quay and a little more to the CN Tower.

I do think it is rated too high. To call this hotel 4-stars along with the likes of the King Edward, Inter-Continental, Park Hyatt, Sutton Place, Royal York etc. does those other properties a disservice. It is more like the 3.5 star Delta Chelsea if you are looking for something to compare it to. It's not the kind of place I would ever knowingly choose. It's too big, too impersonal, and seems to cater to large tour groups, big families and flight crew. Upon arrival you feel like you are in an airport or suburban shopping mall. It's dark, crowded, and utterly lacking in charm or character. Check in was a little unpleasant. When I asked for a non-smoking room the clerk responded, \"You did read the fine print of your reservation, didn't you?\" I told her that the other person in our party had a severe allergy to smoke (total lie), so she grudgingly \"found\" us a non-smoking room, albeit one with two double beds rather than the king we requested. I fully expected to have a view of a brick wall, dumpsters or ventilation shafts, but instead we had room 1945, which overlooks city hall and the downtown skyline. The room has been recently redecorated and is comfortable enough, although the upholstery on the lounge chair was already spotted and the woodwork already scratched. The decor is not as nice as that in the Toronto airport Sheraton. There is a decent outdoor pool, but it was always filled with kids so we didn't bother with it. The fitness centre is well equipped but guests are charged $10 per day to use it! I've never had to pay to use a hotel's fitness facilities before, and I've stayed in hotels that have had much nicer ones. Shocking. I suppose the hotel is in a good location if you want to spend time at the Eaton Centre or go to shows in the Theatre District.

We unwittingly booked over the annual \"Caribina\" weekend which is a celebration of the Caribbean so the hotel became very full, very quickly. The guests up for this weekend were very noisy and even in the lobby, where they hung around in their dozens for hours on end, made a heck of a noise. We were a little disappointed that nobody dealt with this as it wasn't in keeping of the previous ambience of the whole place. The guests would then be noisy in the corridors until all hours until finally, at 0400 on our final night, one of them set off a fire hose, which resulted in a total evacuation. However, the staff and fire dept quickly established the cause and we had only got down to the 16th floor when we were told it was safe to return to our rooms.

Our room ,which we booked through Expedia ,was on the 30th floor with a commanding view of the city skyscrapers as well as the CN Tower. The room was well furnished and in good condition.

The standard room we were given was on the compact side and lacked a mini-refrigerator as well as an exhaust fan for the bathroom (the bathroom mirror would steam up after a bath). I have stayed in both 3 star and 4 star hotels and I feel that a 4 star hotel must be spacious in every way in addition to having all the features that some 3 star hotels don't have.

We had wonderful views of City Hall, and since it was winter we could go ice skating. The rink lit up at night which was beautiful. On one visit we had access to a club on the top floor, which was basically a restaurant. There was a small buffet with good food and you could order drinks. The walls were lined with glass windows and the city views were amazing from up there. The pool is great. Going in the winter time was a nice experience because half of the pool is outdoors. You can swim from the indoor half to the outdoor half. So I can now say I've swam outside in January! There was also a hot tub and sauna which was very nice. The location of the hotel is great. There are restaurants and places to shop nearby. For dinner we walked underground to a restaurant under the Fairmont Royal York, called Benihana.

I only got to hang out for the day but I will give as much details as possible! This hotel is beautiful!! It's not much to look at from the outside but as soon as you walk in you are faced with this really pretty, enclosed waterfall that I saw many people just sitting around and reading, watching, relaxing.. whatever!. There's a bunch of computers that they offer free internet access on and tables around for people to play checkers or chess on. My sister has a 6 month old baby and they put in a crib at no extra charge AND, get this, they gave her a FREE kid's package that included a little puzzle, an alphabet book and a nightlight. She was like \"I didn't order this.\" to which they replied that every child gets one! The pool is quite big, compared to other hotels I've stayed at that offered pools. Half of it is covered and the other half is outdoors, with lounge chairs all around for sunseekers. There is a sauna and a spa but i didn't use these so I can't comment. There are several restaurants on premises which I hear are quite expensive. I think a lot of the patrons that leave reviews get the room via priceline, like us, or hotwire so it is heavily discounted but the truth is, this hotel has one of the best locations in the city and is actually worth a couple of hundred dollars a night, so to expect really inexpensive food prices is a little unrealistic. Just because you're paying $70 for the night, doesn't mean it's a $70 hotel! However, no need to worry! The hotel is connected to the PATH (underground mall) , as many have stated, so there is tons to see and eat down there, and it's right on Queen St., which is IMO, the best street in Toronto! There is a wealth of cheap eats right around the hotel and it is located smack dab in the middle of everything. I believe the room was the standard room but it was more than enough. There were two double beds, a window facing the pool, quite a large bathroom and the tv. There is also a coffeemaker and complimentary tea and (starbucks!) coffee. The beds and pillows are SUPER comfortable!! Plenty of room to move around and for a large crib. The baby, however, did not like the crib (constantly crying in it and definitely not a crying type of baby) and slept better, much to the dismay and constant worrying of my sister, on the bed with a barricade of pillows around him to prevent any falling. There are events going on all the time here but this weekend was super busy with the gay pride parade and a mexican fiesta going on at Dundas Square AND the jazz festival at Nathan Phillips Square. We could walk to each of them no problem within 10 mins. Trust me, we would not walk far with the baby! If you like going out, clubland is really nearby as well so you pretty much never have to cab if you are looking to see downtown toronto, for any reason. The events desk was extremely helpful in helping us locate the events and the route of the parade. They were able to even route out the best possible way to meet up with the parade for us. The staff everywhere was very helpful and quick to respond. Checking in and out was a breeze even though my sister forgot the confirmation papers back in Ottawa. The parking at $40/night is a bit crazy.. Just look for green P signs, which indicate municipal parking, and it should be far less expensive, like $10/night. We even found free parking during certain hours of the weekend, you just need to be on the lookout for signs. If you're visiting, don't even take a car, there's several streetcar and TTC stops really closeby! Hope this helps and you enjoy our beautiful city!

The bed was very comfortable and the choice of pillows was nice. We visited Travelers for a drink and a lite meal. The hostess who was not busy, totally ignored us.

Inside the hotel you will be met by warm and friendly staff,a lovely lobby with a mini waterfall view and cosy little seating area. The staff are extremely efficient ,always prepared to answer questions and do anything that is asked of them to their best ability. The Sherraton has three different restaurants,one is for breakfast and lunch ,(which serves a wonderful buffet breakfast ) ,Traders for pub food ,and lastly , 'Steak ' Which serves more upmarket food allowing you to dress for a special dinner and enjoy a wonderful evening meal with it's tasty,well presented dishes,the latter being the most expensive . The exit onto Queen Street West,,has a Statue of Winston Churchill facing towards the Hotel,this looks really nice,as does the water fountain display that you can see looking out of the glass windows, near the conference room in the Sheraton at night.We stayed on the 35th floor and we got a lovely view from our room window when the water fountains were all lit up at night. The high floors offer really great views of skyscrapers at night and the main Tower a really nice view of the City Hall. Our room was reserved by Tony Pepe,who works in the customer relations department at the Sheraton. This was because I was anxious about staying in a large establishment and worried that I may not get a high room with a view, so I aE.mailed the hotel to help me out. The room was so nice ,which was a real blessing as we were celebrating our birthdays, When we got into our hotel in th evening a lovely box of chocolate cookies had been placed in our room with a little note wishing us a Happy Birthday ,which I thought was a lovely touch. Tony Pepe had sent them to us and I was really appreciative of the special care and attention by the staff ,(after being a little apprehensive about how the staff might treat customers in such a huge hotel full of people!!) The Sheraton has an area in the lobby with several P.C's for use by the guests in the hotel, you will need to look out for a spare one as they are in great demand!! However ,the people on them are only on for a short time ,so you can eventually use one. The rooms have internet access also,at a price. You can go down from in the lobby of the hotel directly into the path system that takes you underground to get round and about the city,which is great in very hot weather or wet weather. I have enclosed pictures of the hotel and views from the hotel, I would recommend the Sheraton as a great place to stay,which is central in location to the main attractions in Toronto and would love to stay again. I was really thankful to all the staff who made our stay so special I give this hotel ten out of ten . e", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, AB, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "EdmTraveller101", "ReviewID": "UR16718602", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while in Toronto at the tail end of my vacation.

As it was directly above the PATH underground, it was incredibly easy to walk towards the harbour, the Eaton Centre and the CN Tower. The hotel was also in between two subway stations making desinations such as Bloor Street, Union Station and the Royal Ontario Musemn that much easier to get to. It is also situated on Queens Street West which is full of excellent shops, restaurants and boutiques. The hotel itself if definately catered towards business and large conventions but it is also a fantastic hotel for families. We had interconnecting rooms on the 4th floor in the Queens tower. We were in an adjoining annex to the main Queens Tower and the rooms were definiately bigger than the rooms in the main tower with much larger bathrooms with a separate bath/shower and toilet. I travelled with my parents, wife and infant son, and the hotel kindly met our request for inconnecting rooms with king beds, cot bed, kettle and fridge. They were all free of charge. The rooms have a small balcony which overlook the swimming pool. Admittedly it didn't have the view of the CN Tower or City Hall but we definately willing to forgo that for the larger interconnecting rooms. The rooms have a flat screen TV, safe and the hotel has a self service laundry and a good swimming pool which stays open every night until 10 pm. They also have a very good spa which we tried out. We didn't notice the chiming bells of the old City Hall clock tower but I would imagine it would be a lot more audible for the guests staying in the main Queens Tower closest to the clock. There is also free internet access and it was never busy when I used mainly because I used it either first thing in the morning or last thing at night. Didn't try the hotel restaurants considering there were so many restaurants close by to the hotel. Also I am a member of the Starwood Preferred Guest scheme but used the main check in area which was very quick and efficient with a kind gentleman porter helping us take our bags to the rooms immediately.

I took the overnight bus from Ottawa to Toronto. It wasn't the most comfortable journey, and I really needed to refresh myself before my course. Luckily, the Sheraton didn't disappoint. ROOM They had a room ready for me by 6:45AM (a crazy early check-in time) on the 34th floor facing the CN Tower. The room had a coffee maker that brews Starbucks coffee - complete with Starbucks cups - and an LG flat screen TV (I didn't actually use the TV). A quick snooze in the Sweet Sleeper bed and a shower (the soap and shampoo smell like oranges) perked me right up. BED Of all of the things I love about the Sheraton, their bed has to be their best asset. I slept like a baby and woke up refreshed from my nap and my overnight sleep - I would have slept in longer if I didn't have a course to go to! I could hear a bit of noise from the hall and from the street below, but it didn't bother me at all. RESTAURANT The breakfast buffet was also extensive - I had a mixed vegetable omelette made to order, a yogurt and fruit parfait, toast, cheese, and grapefruit juice - but it was expensive ($26+tax). The ketchup was cool - it came in single serving-sized glass bottles. STAFF The staff were all friendly, but occasionally they were too sure of themselves. For example, when I asked about what time the local Goodlife Fitness (a gym) opened, I got the same answer - 6:30AM - from two different employees, but the actual time is 8:00AM on weekends. GYM Since the Goodlife trip wasn't going to work with my schedule, I inquired about the hotel gym. I was initially disappointed to learn that the hotel's fitness centre costs $9 per use for the first two uses, but I noticed through the window that this isn't an average hotel gym - they have an extensive selection of heavier dumbbells and bars and a variety of weight machines and cardio equipment. The gym is open 24 hours and seems well worth the small fee. LOBBY I returned to the hotel in the evening and watched a bit of a boxing match in the hotel lobby. There is free wireless Internet and a business centre down there - it gets pretty crowded on the hotel terminals, so I recommend using your own laptop if you can. I also rocked in a chair in front of their waterfall garden (which was very relaxing). The lobby is modern, well-equipped, and a great place to socialize. POOL The indoor/outdoor pool, the whirlpool, and sauna were also well-maintained. The pool was nice and warm, and it was kind of cool to swim outside in the early morning when it was still cold out. The whirlpool jets could have been a might stronger, but it was kept at a decent temperature (not boiling hot). I met a group of guys in the whirlpool who had got their rooms through Priceline at $60/night, so it was clear that there were great deals out there.

First impressions of the hotel are good, with a welcoming hand from uniformed staff at the front door to a very quiet check-in desk with plenty of staff. The hotel reception area is large with a comfy seating area and tables with free wifi access, an internet zone, small shop, and a cafe selling Starbucks coffee - the free wifi makes this an ideal place to check mails etc even if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t staying in the hotel. A set of 'rocking' chairs facing out onto the artificial waterfall are popular at all times of the day and are great fun to sink into at the end of a day with a book and watching the comings and goings. My suite was located on the 6th floor as was very well sized and comfortable. A flat panel tv in both the lounge and bedroom areas were a nice touch and the furnishings were to a good standard. The lack of a fridge was the only downside - I like to keep some bottles of water, and snacks in the hotel room in case of late night munchies and the lack of fridge or mini-bar in the room meant having a carrier bag out on the side. The Bathroom was well sized with a solid bath with power shower over, plenty of towels although a little small, and the usual selection of 'smellies' (Shampoo, Shower Gel, Soap etc), face tissues, and Hairdryer. A nice addition was the 'recycle' box in the bathroom where used newspapers, paper bags etc could be left for recycling - the first time I have seen this in a hotel and something I think all hotels should offer as well as the normal policy of requesting guests to reuse sheets/towels to save on water/chemical use. The bed was comfortable with a firm mattress and a number of layers of sheets and duvets which made temperature control very easy as you could shrug layers off during the night. A radio clock alarm is provided and there is plenty of drawer space although the cupboard is in the lounge area of the suite which felt odd as you have to pad through the room to grab your trousers/shirt in the morning. The one element I really didn't like in the room was the lighting - other than the bathroom there were no wall switches in the suite to operate the lights - each light was controlled via a lamp switch toggle which meant having to turn each one on and off individually. The room had two heating controls (one in the bedroom, one in the lounge) which operated hot/cold air blowers mounted under the windows - the system functioned well and it didn't take long for the room to warm up or cool down when needed. The location of the hotel is excellent for the business district, with the CN Tower and Rogers Centre easily within walking distance. The Hotel is joined onto the PATH system as well so you really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to step outside if the weathers cold. Breakfast was an open buffet style affair and there was plenty of choice although some of the cooked breakfast options did appear to have been sat in their 'canteens' for some while.

When checking in for the second time, we discovered the room we were allocated was less than perfect. I reported this to reception and we were immediately upgraded and given complimentary breakfast.

At that rate, it turned out to be a solid choice in a good location in downtown Toronto. Check-in was pretty quick although the clerk took a long, annoying phone call right before helping me. Later noticed long lines at check-in. As soon as I got to my room and settled down for a quick nap, the phone rang: it was the front desk just making sure the room was okay. A case of \"service\" going a bit too far. But the room was fine: flat-screen TV, desk with internet cord and electrical plugs, good heat control, comfortable bed. Television in next room clearly audible. Internet service appeared free one day and then stopped, showing me a screen asking for $15 for 24 hours. I called guest services to make sure a certain area code was a local call, and that local calls were free; I was told \"yes\" to both and made my call. A few minutes later they called back to say that \"just letting you know, local calls are $2.\" Cute. Room was in the Queen tower, north side; good location and was not bothered at all by the hourly bells. Ordered breakfast from room service and it was prompt and very good, but $34. Gym facilities better than some. Equipment a bit of a mish-mash (and the area could use a renovation) but lots of machines and weights, treadmills, yoga mats. Pool is a good size, indoor-outdoor aspect probably more fun in the summer. Lobby area is nice, with a coffee bar and free internet, although only four computers were working and most were usually in use. Free wifi in that area as well. Single espresso and tiny San Pellegrino came to $7.41. The Airport Express bus ($16.95 one way) stops outside the hotel and is a great way to get to the airport, it only makes a few other downtown hotel stops, and took around 40 minutes. The hotel's location is good, steps from the Eaton Centre mall and Yonge St. shops and subway; nightlife area on King St. a short $10 cab ride away. Not a ton of stuff in the immediate vicinity although there are shops and fast food in the underground passages below the hotel. All in all, for under $100 night it was a pleasant if unremarkable stay, good facilities with some service flaws. I walked by the Delta Chelsea, a hotel with a similar price and availability on sites like HotWire, and its location seemed less central and entrance area an unfriendly maze of car ramps.

The hotel was great, as per many reviews on this site, and just as I expected. I had a room overlooking city hall on the 37th floor (club level). It was directly opposite the old city hall with clock which strikes on the hour every hour, but this did not affect sleep as mentioned in a reivew before, as the beds were so comfy, I defy anyone not to have a great nights sleep. One tip I would give for anyone wanting to book is that the Club Lounge is now temporarily closed for refurbishment until April, I think, and breakfast & hors d'oeuvres are now served in the Bistro on 2. This had the added advantage of having breakfast upgraded to hot & cold from just continental (which was great anyway), so you can have omelettes, waffles, bacon etc as well now. The hotel is very central, about a 2 mins walk to the Eaton Centre and no more than 20 minutes walk from CN tower and Rogers Centre. If you want an alternative to the Eaton Centre, try Bloor St which is a bit more upmarket - easy to walk in about 30 or catch the TTC which goes from the corner of the block where the hotel is situated. I would also recommend booking on a Canadian website as you will be able to claim back the GST/PST on any accomodation under the Visitor Tax Refund scheme. Under this scheme, keep any receipts for purchases, especially clothes, for more than CAN$50 and as long as your receipts total CAN$200 or more, you can make a claim. Overall, Toronto is a great place, but not a spectacular as New York as most of the buildings are very grey, very 50's & 60's, although there are a few Victorian and Deco buildings about if you like to look at the architecture. A must is Niagara Falls, the sights are amazing, even in winter. The tour desk in the lobby offers a great trip, which on the face of it looks expensive CAN$164 per adult, but is well worth it as the guide can me excellent and interest information along the whole route and was very knowledgeable.

Thankfully the reservation was perfect and after a seamless check in at the Preferred Guest 'lounge' (a perk at such a busy hotel) we went up to our rooms on the 11th floor.

The Sheraton Centre proved to be an excellent choice for us. We were a little worried when we arrived as it is a huge hotel that obviously has a lot of conferences and business events. We were not sure it would cater well to us and our kids. Also, the check-in queue in the mid-afternoon was very long. However to its credit, the line moved very quickly at reception and when we checked in we found the front desk staff exceedingly friendly, helpful and efficient. We had no trouble getting the room configuration we needed (connecting rooms with 1 king and 2 double), which is something that a lot of hotels seem to have trouble with. Whilst they didn't have it available on the first night they accommodated us in a large suite that was more than adequate and then moved us to the 2 connecting rooms the next day without fuss or bother. The rooms were large and very comfortable. We stayed on the club level and I highly recommend paying the extra to do this. It is not that much more expensive and for the price you get access to the club lounge, (very comfortable to hang out outside your room) and their sumptuous continental breakfast in the mornings. The breakfast included a big variety of fresh fruit, cereal and yoghurt, a variety of breads and croissants, cold meats etc. It was attractively presented and fresh and tasty and what particularly impressed us was the wonderful and welcoming service from the breakfast attendants who were all friendly, efficient and helpful. You can also access the club lounge in the evening for drinks and complimentary hors d'oervres with dips, cheeses and biscuits and little appetisers which again were tasty and plentiful. (I confess we made this our dinner a couple of nights). There is also wireless access in the club lounge which is great as the internet access in the lobby is often busy. Any requests we made of the hotel were dealt with promptly and we had particularly good assistance from the tour desk with any queries we made. The hotel pool (half indoor/half outdoor) and hot tub was fantastic even in winter. The fitness room was well-equipped. It was bitterly cold whilst we were there (we live in a very hot climate) but you could access all parts of the city from the underground network of walkways which was terrific for getting around with the kids. For family activities, the CN Tower was fantastic and the ice-skating rink across the road was huge fun for the kids. Eaton Centre was also just a short walk away.

Due to the fact I booked my holiday over a year ago I have been regularly reading reviews on this hotel and there are a couple of recurring themes I would like to offer my own experience of and hopefully put any peoples worries to rest. I cannot fault this hotel at all. The only ONLY thing I could possibly say doesn't even count really as a negative thing, and that is that the website advertises an in-room safe. We did not find this but that was fine as the reception operates a safety deposit box facility which is manned 24 hours, and I found this preferable to an in-room facility. Everything else was brilliant. Here are the main positives: 1) The location is just perfect. We were no more than 10 or 15 minutes walk from any of the major attractions. The hotel also has a stop for the airport express bus and the Grays Line Tour company (with which we booked an excursion to Niagara) right outside. Be aware though the stops are not right next to each other so you may wish to double check where you need to be with the concierge, which we did and they were very helpful. 2) We did not experience any fire alarms going off, which was a real concern of mine following previous reports. The Sweet Sleeper beds are absolute bliss, although I did find the pillows a little TOO soft for my liking but still the beds were extremeley comfortable. 3) Some reviews I have read seemed to suggest that visitors had a bad experience if they stayed in the Richmond Tower, that is was run down and noisy and unsafe. We stayed in this tower and had no issues with any of those things. It is smaller than the other tower but I still had a lovely view of downtown Toronto. Everything was to the same high standard we experienced in the rest of the hotel. 4) Check in and out was absolutely fine, we requested and received a non smoking room with no problems, plus there was little or no queueing whenever I needed to access my safety deposit box. 5) We only ate in Traders and the Lobby Cafe and did not experience any other of the dining facilities in the hotel, but found them to be reasonably priced with friendly staff. I would have appreicated slightly more variety on the Traders menu though as I am a fussy eater.

There is nearly always a long line at the front desk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed when we arrived at 5pm after a very long journey, the wait to check in was a good 20 minutes. Having finally reached our rooms, about 25 floors up on the south side, we started to unpack only to find ourselves tormented by a regular metallic screeching noise from outside. The front desk were not in the least surprised when we asked to switch to the north side of the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I got the impression quite a few guests switch. They gave us new rooms graciously enough but it took another 30 minutes for the bellman to arrive with his luggage trolley and the new keys. Our plans for an early supper followed by an early night to recover from the journey were scuppered. The next morning we found there was no water in our bathroom or our daughters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bathroom. Front desk sent up a key to another room and all four of us had to take turns to go in our nightwear in 2 elevators about 20 floors to shower in an empty guest room. Not only was this embarrassing, but it also wasted a lot of our limited tourist time. We were repeatedly assured by the hotel that the water would be fixed by lunchtime. In the evening, coming back to change quickly before the evening meal, luckily we checked the bathroom - to find that there was still no water in either of our rooms. After quite some fussing, the hotel found us two rooms on a higher floor adjacent to each other. These rooms were fine but again our evening was ruined by the lengthy time taken to find rooms and move to them, repacking and unpacking. These final rooms turned out to be very good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quiet with great views to the north looking over both new and old City Halls. To make up for the disturbance, we were given access to the Club Lounge which was very useful for the buffet breakfast and the two pc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with internet access. The hotel also gave us a small discount by way of further apology. We were, of course, most unlucky with the water and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suppose future guests will experience that \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..but there are some things of which it would be helpful to be aware before choosing to stay here: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bedrooms are very noisy if on the south side or if next to an elevator shaft or the ice dispensers. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have access to the Club Lounge and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have your own laptop with you, there is a small area in the lobby with about 6 pc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s available for use\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6by anyone, guest or not ! So the lines are huge. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The concierge desk always has a line and the staff mostly sell packaged tours. Their knowledge of attractions appears surprisingly limited \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for Niagara, for example, they sell a guided tour package but could offer no constructive advice on a self-drive day. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Food outlets within the hotel are expensive but there are many restaurants within easy walking distance above ground and also a wide range of sandwiches, sushi and fast food on the PATH to which the hotel has direct access. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Parking is much less expensive under the new City Hall, directly across the street with an underground passage through to the hotel. It is more convenient too as you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to wait for the valet. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The location is very well served by public transport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is also a short walk to the Eaton Centre, a large shopping mall.

Well, they did follow through in the end after much discussing,and the room was nice with a 2 person whirlpool jacuzzi next to the SO comfortable king size bed.This room also included complimentary buffet breakfasts on the 42nd floor every morning that were quite nice, as well as early eve. hors duerves AND free parking.

Check-in: The stay started off well. Despite booking through priceline, we were upgraded rooms upon arrival through the automated check-in system. I had e-mailed a request for non-smoking which either by chance or intent (I was never replied to) was met. When we arrived at the room, the furnishings were nice. There was a work desk, data ports and flat screen TV. The bathroom was basic tub and shower, but clean. Our room had a nice view of queen street and Nathan Phillips square. Noise: One of the problems fellow travellers have cited ended up being a large problem for us. You can hear the noise of people in the halls and adjoining rooms really easily. The walls seem to be paper-thin at the Sheraton Centre. On our second day we were unfortunate enough to have a family with a small baby move into the room next door. For the next two days we lost plenty of sleep. The fan brought to us didn't help very much. The night before the wedding we were visiting we called the front desk and asked if they could move us to a similar room. First, we were transferred 4 times. Then, put on hold indefinitely. Upon calling back, we were told the hotel was sold out (rather hard to believe). This may sound like a minor inconvenience, but losing sleep from noise in adjoining rooms felt like a major one at the time. I would have preferred smaller, even dirtier accomodations in order to sleep well. On labour day itself, the structure of the building was again exposed. A parade was going on in the street, 34 floors below us and it sounded like it was the people directly below us. Heating: Our room would not heat up. I'm not sure if they turn the heat off during the winter, but our room was too cold for the majority of our stay. Pool: Nice, large pool. Half of it is under cover, the other exposed. It's heated, and was apparently 78o the day we were there. Unfortunately it was a busy weekend, and there were too many people to practically enjoy it. No fault of the hotel. If you think it is going to be a busy time however, you may want to schedule your pool time appropriately. Conclusion: This place has a great location downtown. It is also connected to the PATH. You'll love parts of the accomodations.

We booked very easily through the hotel website. On arrival our check in was handled very efficiently and we were in the room on the eigth floor in no time. The room was well furnished looked quite modern with all the ammenities that you would need. We were staying for two weeks and it was a good length of time to get a proper view and feeling for this place. The lobby is absolutely huge with entrances to Le Bifteque and Traders (more about them later) and the entraence to the PATH system. The path system is a 16km long underground shopping paradise with 1200 shops. You can go the whole day without ever going up on the street. The first time we walked it we got lost on the way back! The lobby has different desks for everything you need; one for the tourists to get information, one for the porters and a seperate check in for the higher class rooms. There is easy access to the streets from the hotel and the hotel even has some shops of its own that might catch your eye. There is a great shop called Kumar's in the hotel which does great brand name cloths at really good prices. There is a conveinance shop and small coffee shop also. The lobby does hold a small business centre and that can get crowded with people queing to use a computer. The hotels hosts fantastic looking gym, spa and pool areas. The half indoor half outdoor pool is quite good with a poolside bar for your use and a jaqussi and alot of loungers as well. One thing though, I found the poolside drinks alot more expensive than inside the hotel. In Le Bifteque Restaurant which from all accounts is one of the top beef restaurants in Toronto, we were treated to alot from the the place. I come from Ireland and to have a filet mignon ($27) served chargrilled and sent out was something I'm not really used to. I like mine sealed and oven cooked but it was quite something to taste, it was a good bit of meat. Even though the food was very good all through our stay (especially the raviolli for $12 and homemade steak burger for just $9) we got both sides of the waiting experience. They have some very good servers and a couple not so good. Here's a tip, after around nine in the evening a gratuity is added to your bill, fair enough, before nine the reciept says \"Gratuity Not Included\" which says to me, tip if you want, its optional. When I get my bill off the waitress twice in the two weeks I was there that had the Grat Not Included sign circled in pen and 15% please written beside it, I don't want to tip any more. Leave the tip option to the customer please, don't look for it or you won't get it! The other restaurant is Traders, in which I found the food too plentiful and I like my food but I couldn't eat everything they put in front of you. That's not a complaint but a compliment on what they serve. Is a little more pricey I found than the other restaurant but I didn't mind. You don't mind paying for quality. Try their battered fish and chip, or the indian butter chicken and they do great soups ($7) There is another restaurant called Bistro on Two which serve breakfast and lunch only. The service was good all around there and the food was lovely. The serve fresh big breakfasts and oone thing to watch out for. They charge for every thing you have. All items are individually priced. Our first breakfast there which was 2x tea and oj two breakfasts and toast was $47 as everything on the hot breakfasts is again individually priced. One thing to watch out for in Toronto in general, especially if you aren't from the area, taxes are not included in many things and are added on at the till which for the first few times you buy something there, it can throw you off a bit. The Sheraton Centre is connected to the subway at Queens through a short walk on the PATH system and you would be pleasantly surprised at howq cheap it is $2.75 a trip and that is good. The cleaning services in the hotel for the rooms were efficient and friendly to talk to when you meet them and invisible when they are working. The room was cleaned to a high standard every day and a comp newspaper left in every day also. There is an ice machine on the floor and a vending machine also which can come in handy if is gets balmy in the time of year you go there. The check out procedures are quick and easy and the concierge is adept to helping you with bags or transport. The hotel has a holding area for luggage if you need to store them for an evening flight for example like we had. The Sheraton Centre was a great hotel and just about perfect for what I wanted. It is in the city centre and a short hop to anywhere you want to go.

This is a convention hotel. While we were there the Herbalife Honorees from Latin America were all staying there. Hoardes of people flooded the lobby at all hours. Not a problem though, the place is HUGE! We caught the Airport Express directly to the hotel, although you can take the Airport Rocket and subway, I didn't feel like doing that with luggage. I recommend the Airport Express. Check in was mobbed when we got there, but they had folks at every terminal on the desk and within 10 minutes we were in our room. We were on the 10th floor with a view of City Hall. The room was nothing to write home about. It was clean and comfortable. The cable was extensive with both Canadian and American television channels. The beds were those new \"Luxe Hotel Beds\" soft and comfy. Except I prefer a hard matress. I slept really well though, so no complaints. The A/C left something to be desired. It didn't cool the room below 74, and since the bedcovers were heavy duvets, this was problematic. Additionally, if one closed the blackout curtains, the source of the A/C was BEHIND them, so no air circulating. We slept with the curtains open and tried to keep the window open as much as possible during the day, since if you didn't close it at night, you'd hear the clock in the church across the way chime all night long. It was also hot in the hallways and other common areas of the hotel. We decided to go down and grab a bite to eat so we had a meal at Traders. Boy! Was that underwhelming. The chicken planks and fries were fine. The fries actually were just like English Chips, I would have liked some malt vinegar for them, but our waitress made herself a bit scarse. We also tried a chicken curry, that was not all that good. I thought perhaps that since there were a few curries on the menu that someone in the kitchen knew how to make them. I was wrong. The area is downtown and rather than downtown in NY, where there are shops and restaurants and all sorts of entertainments within walking distance, this was more like downtown Pittsburgh, where at the end of the business day the sidewalks roll up. The only things around were tourist spots that were obvious rip-offs and other hotel restaurants. We took a cab to see Evil Dead, the Musical at the Diesel Theatre. That was a BLAST! Catch it before it leaves in September, if you can. We took a tour of Niagara Falls with the King Tour company. There was a bit of a hassle with pick up. We were expecting a large motor-coach to pick us up at 8:30. Finally at 9:00 a town car pulled up and took four passengers and the driver (I sat [--]) to another hotel so that we could cram into a 21 seat van/bus (think Airport tram) for the 8 hour trip. We sat in the back on the 5 across bench. This was uncomfortable. More for the poor schmoe sitting [--] there, I at least had a foot rest and could lean against my husband, he just bounced around for the whole day. We went to a winery (ice wine, who knew?) Niagara on the Lake for about 40 minute (we crammed lunch down) and then down to Niagara Falls to ride the Maid of the MIst. The tour was totally worth it because we didn't have to wait in line. Just grabbed a ticket and were escorted onto the boat. The tour was $80 Canadian dollars and the Maid of the Mist was $14. We spent 3 hours in Niagara and then went back to the hotel. The next time we go, we're going to try a hotel in a neighborhood, rather than smack downtown. I'd also like to say that your meal options weren't all that great near the hotel. There's a Ruth's Chris steak house, which was perfectly fine, but no funky, neighborhood joints. Everything was super expensive (due to a really crappy exchange rate.) There's a Ted Hortons adjacent to the hotel. That's no big deal, but it is cheap. We never did find the food court. All in all, there's nothing wrong with the Sheraton, it's exactly what you'd expect from a huge hotel. You can certainly get to any attraction quickly and easily from it. It's quiet and comfortable.

My college-age daughter and I were there for a convention. We had a mixed experience-overall, the convention staff was great and the hotel staff, not so much. Some basics: The hotel is in the middle of the city, across from City Hall. There's a parking lot under City Hall that is considerably cheaper than the hotel one, so that's where we parked, and it worked out well. The hotel is within walking distance of the Queen Street business district, which has lots of funky and affordable shops and restaurants. When we arrived, one bellman at the entrance took our luggage and loaded it onto a cart, then took it inside and turned it over to another bellman to take up to the room, so we had to tip 2 different people. Nice little scam they have going there. We didn't check out the pool or the exercise room at all. The pool is available at no cost but the exercise room has a fee to use it. We didn't have time for this to be an issue, but really, why big hotels do this sort of thing I'll never know. It's just cheap and petty. It will never cease to amaze me that you can get services like this free at places like Best Westerns and Days Inns but not at high-end hotels. If they want to rip off people who are going to expense their visits, fine, but give the rest of us a break. The rooms have high-speed wireless connections but again, this has a fairly high fee. However, you can connect in the lobby for an hour at a time at no cost, and you can do this as many times during the day as you'd like, just making sure to sign off at the end of the hour for a few minutes. The hotel has 3 restaurants and a coffee bar. One of the restaurants, Bistro on Two, is open for breakfast and lunch. I went in for breakfast one day. It was extremely expensive-$27 CAD for the breakfast buffet. The food was good but still, that's way too high. There's a steakhouse which we tried for dinner one night, and that was fine. The prices were reasonable for dinner and the food was pretty good. We had no problems with service either, but it was an off-peak time, about 4:30 PM. We had a terrible experience with the last of the restaurants, Traders. Five of us went in for dinner one evening at about 6:30. the restaurant was busy but not full and there was no line. It took 20 minutes and 2 requests for service to get a waiter, 20 more minutes for drink orders to be taken, 20 more minutes for drinks to be served (incorrectly, so the waiter had to go back and try again) and our orders to be taken, and half an hour for the food to begin to be served-it came out one order at a time. By the time my order arrived, I had to leave to work a volunteer shift. My daughter brought my meal to me in a takeout container (no utensils were provided) and the restaurant added a 20% tip to everyone's bill. It was a dreadful, unprofessional, infuriating experience. I will be notifying the hotel directly about this. The hotel is connected to a food court, and mall, and inexpensive options are available there for breakfast and lunch. The shops and food stands close at the end of the business day though, so there aren't in-house budget choices for dinner. The coffee bar in the hotel is like a Starbucks, with comparable selection and pricing. We had asked for a room on a high floor in the main tower. When we checked in and renewed those requests, we were told that no such room was available. The room we were assigned was next to an ice machine, so I went back to the desk and spoke to a different clerk, who was much more helpful. She got me the exact kind of room I had requested in the first place. The room was fine, not huge but certainly livable, with a lovely view of City Hall and the adjacent park. The bathroom was also fine. The room was clean but somewhat worn, which I found surprising in a hotel that isn't all that old. The beds were comfortable but the pillows were the small, very soft kind that I find pretty unworkable. I much prefer the bigger, more solid ones. For some reason, our room wasn't cleaned or made up on the 4th night, so we had to request extra towels. They came but the person who delivered them didn't take away the mound of dirty ones. Also, the safe in our room didn't work and although we called security to fix it, they never did. Overall, if I come back to Toronto (which I hope to do-we didn't get to see the city much at all), I'd look for another place to stay. We paid a special convention rate which was considerably lower than the rack rate, and that was okay, but I would definitely not pay the rack rate.

Check-in was relatively quick, and the staff were very helpful and polite. Once we got to our room - we were very disappointed at what we found. Certainly not what we'd come to expect from a Sheraton, or even what we expected from the reviews on this site. We had paid extra money for an upgrade to a \"suite\" room. All this seemed to mean was that we had an extra room attached to the 'bedroom' portion of the overall room with what they claimed was mahogany furniture. The furniture seemed to be mahogany stuck to pressed-particleboard. Additionally, they advertised \"leather furniture\" on their website which turned out to be one chair. They did have a couch in the room but it was a ghastly shade of yellow and very uncomfortable because it was also a pull-out. In the bathroom, the bathtub was dented and scratched and the sink (no joke) was less then 8\" in diameter. The hotel had been listed as \"recently renovated\", but the room appeared to have the baseboards scratched. Upon arrival in the room, we discovered that the ventilation system in the room made some very strange high pitched wheezing noise. When we contacted the front desk, they sent a maintenance worker up. His solution seemed to be simply to put a piece of paper over the vent that was making the noise rather then fixing the problem. I guess he was too busy. We were so disappointed by our stay in Toronto that we actually left early. Internet in the hotel was at a cost (very expensive) and the city wifi internet was /significantly/ cheaper, and available city-wide (offered by the Toronto Hydro utility I think). Why would I want internet that's more expensive and only available in the hotel? On the plus side, the lobby was very nice with a waterfall.

Well worth the extra when you have two children. The check in & tour desk staff were very helpful, efficient & we were dealt with very quickly. The extra room gives a separate bedroom & lounge with sofa bed. The first night we called housekeeping to make this bed up, the porter arrived with two single beds & full size mattresses.

There are so many restaurants that the best advise is try any, they are all good & prices are much better than the UK or Europe.

There was valet parking at $35/day but we didn't use this as we returned the hire car soon after arriving. Check in was speedy after we queued for just a few minutes. The clerk did try, gently, to get us to upgrade our room but we declined. He was very pleasant and informative. In fact, every one of the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room in the Queen's Tower was as you would expect in a typical busy city centre business hotel. It was on the 32nd floor with a good view north over the city square and old town hall (which chimed every hour night and day). I wondered if the view to the south was better, perhaps seeing some of the lake. A friendly chambermaid let me in to another room on the opposite side of the building for a look. No lake but plenty of high rise buildings. No problems in getting to the 32nd floor. The lifts were plentiful and speedy Our room was fine, and not particularly big. The bathroom was not too large either, but everything was clean and in good repair. I requested a electrical extension cord and it arrived within a few minutes (no socket outlets near a mirror for my wife to dry her hair, and the bathroom would be too steamy after a shower .) There were a couple of queen beds but just one easy chair. There was also a safe and coffee maker in the room. The beds were comfy. The air conditioning took a bit of fiddling to set just right (not too hot, not too cool, not too noisy) The room was single glazed which I though was unusual. Double glazing insulates the heat and cold but it also deadens the noise. In saying that, apart from the chiming Town Hall clock and occasional sirens, street noise was never more than a low level hum. The lobby was very busy most of the time (There was a large convention on in the hotel's function suite at the time and I spotted a couple of weddings over the 3 days we stayed there) There are 3 PCs in the lobby which are free to use for 20 minutes or so which were very handy for a quick email home or to transfer photographs from a full digital camera onto an empty memory stick. There were lots of nice comfy chairs, newspapers, books all over the lobby. There was a sports bar and restaurants but we didn't try them. We preferred to eat out as there are oodles of bars and restaurants all over the place from hot dog stands, burger joints to fine international dining within a short stroll or taxi ride. The hotel lobby and the concourse, a floor below, is connected to Toronto's PATH, a 16 mile, 27 kilometre network of shops, restaurants, food courts, services etc connecting many of the major buildings, hotels, stores, malls and stations in the town centre. Great for keeping out of the heat in high summer and the snow in winter [---] The only complaint I had was not about the hotel but some of their guests. A party of VERY noisy ladies rolled in at about 4 am on Sunday morning, obviously after a very good night on the town. I've no objection to that, but I do object when they run back and forth between rooms, yelling, giggling and screaming in glee, slamming doors and shouting down the corridor to each other. There was no sign of the giggling ladies on Sunday morning and no more nocturnal shenanigans for the rest of our stay. There is a bus stop right outside the door for the airport bus.

We had room 888 which was in the Richmond Tower, we had a view of the financial district. The beds wwere very comfortable and the rooms were cleaned daily. The hotel is very big with 4 restaurants a leisure centre and gardens. The hotel is connected to the underground tunnel system called \"path\", where underneath the hotel you can find a large food court. There is also free internet access to all hotel guests. The hotel is located oppisote the town square and is connected and close to the Easton Center and the Bay Department Store.

The room on the 35TH FLOOR (!!) was superb. It was very clean and the king size bed was also very comfortable. The hotel lobby was huge and the bar in the hotel wasn't very expensive which was surprising. We did go to the Sunset cafe for breakfast (as recommended by other tripadvisors) and it was a great tip so thank you. The cafe was only a block or two away on Yonge and Richmond and was very nice and great value. Everything seemed very close by and we walked to the waterfront area and the Steam Whistle Brewery (right by the CN Tower) and i'd recommend both, if you get tthe chance. The CN Tower was absolutely superb and although the restaurant was very expensive it is worth doing if you can. (and besides we sat a couple of tables down from Will Smith and his family!!) Overall a great hotel and great city. Would love to go back and would strongly recommend this hotel and city. The one and only thing wrong is the $35 a day valet parking!!

I walked in after spending 1 night at the Days hotel, took the subway over at noon, had my bags in my car trunk which was still park at the Day's hotel garage-did not have to move it till 2 pm. The lobby is so big I could not find the check in desk so I asked around. Was told this man at a small desk could help me-turns out to be the gold members check in desk-which I seen the sign at the end. He was so very nice to me, did not say that I should go to the normal check in desk where everybody else goes. Took my ID and credit card and notice I book from the internet. Was hoping they would just give me a room, the hotel lobby was so nice I could not believe the price I paid. Check in went great, in fact I was given a room on the 27 th floor. In the Queens tower, Wow. No asking if I wanted a upgrade for a small charge. A first class place all the way. What more can I say, the view was great, the elevators were high speed-they zip you pass the first 24 story's. Could not even feel it stopping. My room was first class, it had a room safe which was locked. I called downstairs, as soon as I pushed the button somebody was there, I told them I could not open the safe so they said someone will be over to my room. In 5 mins a very nice dressed man show up. He was able to get it open with some fancy phone-like a blackberry. Even the safe work first class, you enter your numbers and the door just open. Not like most where you need to pull it. Was the only problem I had and it was quickly taken care of. The next day, after a great night sleep-those beds blow away the Day's Inns beds, I order room service. Got the farmer breakfast and juice. Again, just push the button on the phone and somebody was right on the other end, no waiting what so ever-same with those elevators. 15 mins later my food was in my room, hot and very good. Bill was $35 but was worth it. I paid $20 for breakfast across the street from the Day's hotel the day before, food was not as good and I had to go outside my room. Well after I return home I joined the starwood member club, you get points for each dollar spent-not if you book on Hotwire just if you book from the hotel itself. I already am a Hilton Honors member but the Sheraton are even nicer-then they also have the St Regis hotels-not in Toronto but in most big city's.

There was a large wardrobe and 3 good deep drawers and a cupboard and shelves - plenty of storage. The bathroom had lots of counter space. For some reason the maid didn't take the tips we left just by the tele. We did leave a good tip when we left though. Our flight home wasn't until 11.30pm so we asked for a late checkout.

The prime rib was excellent...didn't care for much else food wise there. Beneath the hotel is Toronto's PATH underground walkway. This is a 10km stretch that extends from the Eaton Centre shopping plaza to Union Station.

This stay was a real mix of good and pretty bad so I thought I would share our experiences. We booked two rooms online through Starwood. I am a Gold member with Starwood which means they are supposed to upgrade us, room availability permitting. Starwood sent an email shortly after the booking asking if we would like to pay for an upgrade to the Club Level. I called the hotel itself to ask if I wouln't be upgraded automatically due to status with Starwood and was told unquestionably yes we would be upgraded. On arrival we were told that no upgrade would be given and that out of the 1400+ rooms in the hotel (it's a big hotel), no suites were available for upgrade or purchase and the only two connecting rooms were on a low floor. While I was being told this the couple next to us was being asked if they wanted to pay extra to be upgraded to one of the six club floors. Real mixed messages here. Later we were told by staff that the hotel was running the entire week at 30-40% occupancy. The rooms at the Sheraton Center are finely equipped. the rooms were clean and adequately sized and furnished. the hotel dates from the 70 s I think, but it has obviously been rehabbed recently. The real issue with the room was there is no door seal at the bottom of the door and we were immediately opposite the elevator bank. It was loud even during the day and ungodly loud at night. Further complicating the noise was a broken elevator which was stuck on our floor and whose door alarm was going off every two minutes for seven hours. It finally was fixed at 1:00 am after several requests. My wife and I made three requests for switching rooms the first day, all of which were turned down flat by the front desk (Remember hey were at 30-40% occupancy). The thermostat in our room was also broken so the heater was blasting to room to over 80 degrees. If we turned it off, the hallway noise was even worse so we had to leave the connecting door open with our kids room and set their thermostat to 65 so the two systems battled all night. The next morning a maintenance person came and worked on the heater, pronounced it fixed after a minute then left. Trust me it was not fixed. They next morning after a sleepless night, the front desk did locateus two connecting rooms far away from the elevator on an upper floor. We could not switch rooms till late afternoon, but finally we were in the new rooms. That night we slept soundly and in comfort. Pool- The indoor outdoor pool was great and we and our kids used it everyday. Fun for the kids to swim oustide in 30 degree weather with steam rising off the pool, then come back inside. Lobby- This is an attractive hotel Lobby. It's big and business oriented place, but looks nice. Location- The location near City Hall (Ice Rink at Nathan Phillips Square), the Eaton Center and shopping District was ideal. Right after arrival we realized that my son had forgotten his swimming suit. He and I were able to use the underground tunnels (PATH) system to walk two blocks in shorts all in conditioned spac,e to the Bay (large Department store) and puchase a swimsuit. Easy, convenient and fun for us Californians though we did get more that a few strange looks walking in shorts in Toronto in late December. Staff- While we met a few great staff at the hotel, but there were a half dozen who were mediocre to downright rude and this really affected our experience at the hotel. They just didn't care if the guests were being taken care of or not.

However, THIS hotel is completely overrated on this website. I spent a great deal of time weighing the pros and cons of staying at the centrally located Sheraton Towne Center and at other \"higher\" rated hotels. I decided to try the Sheraton on my travel agent's and Tripadvisor reviews' advice. We stayed there for our family Holiday mini-vacation Dec. 28 through 31st. I'll try not to go on forever -- though the negative experience we had at this hotel would warrant it. We purchased a Sheraton deal on the website -- though I contacted the hotel directly by phone to ensure I was getting the best deal. I upgraded to a Club Level room for an approximate $60 per night when I made the reservations. When we checked in there appeared to be no problem -- we were ushered to our room by a reasonably pleasant bellcap. The room was short a couple of towels as there were four of us staying in the room including our two children, 7 and 10, and they would be swimming and, thus, showering after each swim. I then noticed that the Club Level included robes for the room, which were not present. Called front desk and they took care of this with no problem. We then embarked on a tour of the hotel. First, to the 43rd \"Club Lounge\" (exclusive rights for Club Level patrons) for hors d'oeuvres and drinks in a luxury club lounge with \"fabulous view of the city\". We shortly discovered that the Lounge was \"closed for the Holidays\" and would not reopen until after our visit was complete. So, the free continental breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres, were no longer part of the deal. We asked where our \"free\" breakfast would be served and were told that it would be at the Bistro on Two -- the restaurant's staff had no idea what we were talking about. Oh, yeah, Traders, the main bar and restaurant in the hotel was ALSO CLOSED!!! \"for the holidays\". Well, after a great commotion with the front desk (Catherine, Manager -- was actually, to her credit, very accommodating, very understanding and I felt sorry for her that she had to deal with such a mess!) I managed to obtain some compensation for the fact that the hotel had completely lied to me about the services and facilities offered during our stay (and that I had paid EXTRA for!). Next morning at 6 a.m., the FIRE ALARM went off -- if you've read the previous reviews of this hotel (as I had) you would be somewhat prepared for this -- but, we were on the 36th floor and this wasn't something I wanted to warn my children about and risk their being terrified the whole stay. But, when those alarms went off, I was wishing I had told them, because BOTH of my kids were completely FREAKED OUT (thanks, Sheraton!!!). On our second day, the pool temperature began to drop and never stopped. It was a \"refreshing\" 70 degrees F., by the time we left on the third day. Dirty (I mean not even washed since eaten upon) silverware on our table at the restaurant at breakfast. Drain broke in our room -- drain stopper completely fell out into my hand. Complimentary toiletries were not replaced properly. Came back to our room after a long day of touring and the tip we left the maid was gone, but the beds were not made. Well, she/he managed to pull the comforters up over the crumbled sheets, our kids' stuffed animals and the tv remote -- left under the comforter. Pillows not fluffed -- in fact, not even moved. No water bottles left (as provided in \"Club Level\" Room). Called to have room \"fixed\" -- okay, I could make my own bed, but, this was beginning to be ridiculous and why did I pay all this money for a \"luxury\" hotel and get none of the expected services??? Went to dinner -- came back to the room and NOTHING had been done! WHAT??? Called the manager on duty and then they sent someone up (9 p.m.) to re-make the beds and bring clean towels -- they had only left three and we needed four, etc., etc. Okay, so have I persuaded you??? I suppose it could have been the holidays -- but, I've stayed in many, many luxury rated hotels around the world and could NOT believe my eyes or my ears the entire time I was at the Sheraton! Shame on them!! My kids were unhappy and scared every night to go to sleep because there might be another fire alarm and they were generally unhappy, because I was so unhappy! Wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone who expects to receive the quality services they pay for!!! I don't care if it is the Holidays!

Room: We were placed on the 6th Floor in the Richmond Tower (the older tower). The hallway looks dated and had a musky smell but the rooms look like they were recently renovated and there was no odor. The beds as in all Sheratons are lovely. Everything is clean, the decor is in good shape and we have no complaints especially for the price. Bathroom was also very clean and of adequate size. The shower had good pressure which is always important to me when travelling. One flaw is the lack of a fridge so we had to use the trash bucket to hold some ice for chilling our beers bought from the liquor store down the block. Internet was a bit pricy at $15 CAD a night but considering the room rate we paid (about $100 CAD per night) it was not a big deal afterall. Location: Smack in the middle of Downtown Toronto at Queen & Bay and super convenient, shopping is everywhere within walking distance and so is Yonge Street and the subway system. We parked our rental car in the City Hall underground parkade directly across the street (there's an underground walkway that links the parkade to the hotel) and it saved us the $35 valet parking fee per day. The parkade wasn't cheap though still costing us $15 per day on average. We walked to the Air Canada Centre for the Leafs game and it took us about 10 minutes one way. Dining: We can't comment on this as we didn't eat at the hotel, Tim Horton's right outside the door was our main hangout for the weekend. Housekeeping: Maid service was very good and the room is kept clean everyday, requests for extra towels were promptly fulfilled and again no complaints here.

I booked the night using my Starpoints (7,000) and requested an upgrade to a 'club room' for 1,000 more points. The upgrade was well worth it for many reasons. The room came with a king size \"sweet sleeper\" bed (with a heavy and comfy comforter) and was designed nicely with crown moulding and stylish furniture, including a leather club chair and ottoman. The club rooms are high up in the Queen St. tower (ie. over 40 floors up) so the views are fantastic, and only the club rooms have access to the Club Lounge on the 43rd with free hors d'oeuvres from 5:00 - 8:00 each evening and a free continental breakfast in the morning. Hors d'oeuvres included big tasty chicken wings and cheesy puffed pastries as well as fresh fruit, cheese and crackers and breads with dips. The continental breakfast was very substantial and would have easily cost $13 each if we were paying for it. I would highly recommend upgrading to a club level room for these benefits if the additional cost is only $20 or so. My only knock against the room was that the bathtub was due to be replaced (rusting around the drain significantly), and the bathroom was quite small. Fortunately we were didn't need to be in the bathroom at the same time. It was adequate and clean, but definitely not spa-like. The room had a digital thermostat so you could just set the temperature to whatever you desired, and it would do the rest. Noise was not an issue at all for us - we barely heard a peep from our room the entire time. We didn't use either of the restaurants and room service seemed steep (Caesar salad was $9 and there was a $3.50 charge for delivery plus an automatic 15% gratuity), so we ordered some food in from a place offering free delivery. We also parked across the street at the city hall underground parking lot which was $18 for 24 hours. They have an underground entrance to the Sheraton which was really handy as it was raining when we were leaving.

There is no clear cut path with which to walk from the city sidewalk to the front doors. You end up dodging past and around the dozens of cars and taxis lined up outside. This is not a big deal but just weird considering they just completed a major remodel of the hotel. This Sheraton seems to be stingy with the amenities. The fitness center will cost you $9.00 unless you have paid for a higher priced room. The towels in our room's bathroom are not of high quality. There is no fridge or minibar, or wine glasses in the room. The newsaper delivery was hit and miss. Sometimes, there was a paper outside your door sometimes not. Saturday mornings there is no delivery. When I phoned the front desk they suggested I would find a Saturday Globe and Mail at the car desk in the lobby. I immediately went down to the lobby and was told they were all out of the Saturday edition of the paper. Hence I conclude that the Sheraton's motto should be revised to read, \"You belong-for a price.\" However, the positive experiences included a very comfortable room and beds. A quiet five day stay despite being beside the ice dispenser and elevators.

When arriving at the hotel late at night they had been kind enough to upgrade our room for the entire stay so we ended up on the 35th Floor with access to the Club Lounge on the 42nd Floor. The room was fantastic; we had a good size bathroom, living room and a spacious bedroom with Jacuzzi, which was extremely nice. The views from the room were unbelievable; we had a clear view of the CN Tower and the lake. The only downside to our room was the fact it was geared towards the business man, plug points were not in the right place, the bedroom had no dressing area, the shelf in the bathroom was small and the lights were not in the right place - this made it a bit harder when trying to get myself ready on my wedding day. If you get chance it is worth going to the 42nd Floor as they have floor to ceiling windows on both sides and you get a fantastic view of downtown Toronto and the breakfast is not a bad price. The two things I would be wary of are the telephone charges it works out a lot cheaper to buy a phone card and use a public phone. The second one is eating in the hotel, the Traders Bar is very nice but the food is expensive for what you get, there are plenty of great restaurants and bars in Toronto which are well worth checking out.

We had requested a standard King, they gave us two doubles by the noisy ice machine, so we upgraded to club for 60 bucks a night, and the front desk woman said \"it is SIXTYdollars per NIGHT\" as if this was some sort of huge premium (which it was for such poor pathetic service). They tried to shove us into a smaller club room; we went back to front desk asked for another; front desk person lied and said there were no rooms available---hah! We went to the platinum check in area and told that front desk lady of our situation; she told us there were lots of rooms available and found us one, but again, no smiles, no interest, very perfunctory. Pool was freezing, half indoor half outdoor, and they chose to leave the overhead door that separates the areas open, while it was raining and the temperature was 16 degrees outside--as a result too small hot tub was packed. Disinterested pool person sits at his booth and says things like \"towels are over there\" without looking up from his newspaper. Club Lounge OK--great view, but Toronto can be pretty ugly on a grey day. Club Lounge looks unfinished or a room that was once a nice restaurant. Breakfast is fresh fruit, cereal, breads, croissants, coffee, tea etc. \"Hors d'oeuvres\" are cheese, crackers, cold cuts, and hot meatballs and cheese tarts, armenian flat bread with the usual suspect spreads: hummus, baba ganoush, unknown pink (taramosalata maybe?) cream.

As most people have commented the beds were very comfortable, although there was very little counter space in the bathroom and the towels were a bit small. We had expected more things like that to be above average seeing as it was a 4/5 star hotel. The pool area was very good although, like the rest of the hotel, the recent refurbishment couldn't hide the fact that it was basically a 60's built concrete building beginning to show its age. We ate at Traders on the groung floor one night and the food was very good and reasonably priced. We also had breakfast in the 1st floor restaurant one morning, which was nice but pretty expensive. The big plus about the place is its central location and the access it gives to the PATH system which links it to the main shopping and business areas.

This hotel is huge! The staff are friendly, food excelent and location out of this world. We stayed on the 18th floor looking on to the CN Tower. The room was really nice, clean, big, well decorated and yes the beds are awsome! You never have to wait for the elevator. There are 6 on each floor and are fast. Bell Boys always outside the hotel and will whistle you a taxi in a flash. If like me, you smoke or you just want to get out of the room for a bit, the gardens in the middle of the hotel are the perfect place. There are plenty of benches in front of the ponds and waterfalls and I found these a relaxing part of my stay. I did on a couple of occasions go for a smoke at the front of the hotel and every time I did, I was hastled by beggers. The Esculators in the lobby go straight into the PATH system which then leads straight in the Eaton Centre which leads straight to Yonge/Dundas. Had dinner in Traders which was lovely and room service was brilliant. Went elswhrere for breakfast, usually in the PATH system or the Eaton Centre. There's about 10 different fast food places in the PATH about 1 minute walk from the lobby including McDonnalds and Pizza Pizza. Toronto is very very big and busy. Would recommend the yellow tour buses to get your bearings. These buses stop at something like 35 locations and you just jump on and off as you please. We found it very handy and interesting at the same time as the buses have a tour guide giving you facts and stories of the area as you go. Restaurants get busy also, pre booking at most restaurants is a must. If not, you may be in for a long wait at the bar. We actually found it quite difficult to eat at night. There's a lot of \"posh\" restaurants and some are out of the busy parts which made my wife and I feel unsafe and uncomfortable. I would recommend the different restaurants within the hotels and the restaurants on the harbour front. Lots to do here, shopping is great and cheap (same fashions as over here but half the price), Toronto zoo and CN Tower a must! Toronto Islands are a good day out but beware of \"Harry\" - some bloke on a bike that will offer to give you directions or take a photo of you and the missus and then ask for 3 cigerettes or $4 for doing it. Quite harmless but gets on your nerves after a couple of times of seeing him.

As I was travelling with a large family group (8 of us) including children and older relatives, we had booked four rooms. The check in clerk failed to explain to us where the rooms were and consequently some of us went up the wrong tower with children, older relatives and baggage in tow (presumably because they wanted us to use the bell boys). The room was as described on the website - i.e. big bed and average sized room for a city centre hotel - unfortunately, when I went to get in the shower I found someone else's hair on the wall and empty toiletry bottles, indicating that the room had not been properly cleaned. Since I'd been up since 4.00am travelling from Edmonton, I decided to let this pass - later as I got into bed, exhausted after a very long and trying day (exacerbated by the breaking news about the terror plot in London making my family nervous about travelling by air) I noticed that an air vent in the room was blowing noisily. I tried to ignore it and settled down to sleep by by 11.30pm I was at my wits end so I called the front desk - who informed me that room 580 in the Richmond Towre had a vent related to the service elevator (Which didnt' appear to be anywhere near this room but who knows) and therefore they could do nothing about it and they couldn't move me because they were full. (This was true - every room in TOronto was full because of a big conference). I realised I had to put up with it and asked for a move as soon as possible and since I was intending to travel to Niagara the next day on a tour I had to wait to the evening before I could actually move my hotel room. Since I was forced to stay there for the rest of the 2 nights I was pleased to find that my next room was much quieter - the air vent was now in the bathroom which could be shut off. No apology was put forward at this time and since I was pre-paid I didn't feel there was much I could do to mitigate my loss or deal with the fatique caused by the hotel. When it came to leaving the hotel, invoices were put through the doors of my partys rooms and it was clear from this that someone had been using my parents room to watch movies and these were being charged to the room - my parents almost were charged for this because the way the invoice was written gave the impression that they had been zeroed - we had used myu credit card to charge incidentals to all of the rooms so I would have been liable for this. When queried, the clerk said that someone was watching a movie in the room - even though my parents both stood there. With poor grace they remvoed the charges from the bill and zeroed it out properly. Then I went to check out. No apology about the sleepless night or diry bathroom was offered until I asked for it - eventually they agreed to refund $100 from my incidentals bill - which in my opinion was a rip off too - breakfast for three people - french toast and coffee came to nearly $50!!!!! What is irksome is that because I was prepaid as part of the holiday (I had a mixture of pre-booked and un pre-booked hotels because I was travelling from Vancouver via the Rockies to Edmonton and then flying to Toronto) I had absolutely no comeback and if anyone thinks I was going to leave it until I got back to the UK and then complain from 3,000 miles away, they can think again. We had a far better night in a Ramada at Stony PLain for $160 than in this hotel which variously styles itself as 4 diamond and 5 star. One thing I would like to say in its favour.

We found a great place to eat breakfast though on Younge street \"eggspectation\" - fried breakfast, coffee, fruit juice, basket of toast and jams worked out about \u00c2\u00a312 for two. You must take a trip to Niagara (we had ours organised through the hotel who were very good) it cost us about \u00c2\u00a375 each and was worth every penny, that included coach with driver who gave a guided tour of every inch of the trip, lunch which was excellent, ride on the 'maid of the mist' and a stop off at Niagara on the lake which is a beautiful quaint old town. The only downside was that the day went too quick, we didnt seem to have much time in each place although we set off at 9:10am and didnt return until 7:30pm. The city of Toronto is a wonderful place and I would love to go back again and do all the things I missed out on this time and if I did I would most definately stay at the Sheraton Centre.

Furthermore, 10 mins after arriving in our room there was a knock at the door and a waiter came in with a bottle of Asti and biscuits with cheese. Nice touch!! The room was clean and found it a great idea that you could choose that you either didn't want your room serviced the next day or that you could choose a time. A def plus when you are tired after a wedding and all that travelling!! We chose not to have our room serviced and this was adhered too. All in all our stay was fantastic, great location, the staff we were in contact with were friendly and helpful, the pool area was clean as were the changing rooms. I also liked the touch that you could recycle things by putting it in a bin under the sink in your room. The only thing that does not give this hotel an excellant rating is that they had just had a new fire alarm installed, one false alarm i can take even at 7.30am, another at 12 midnight the next night not such a problem as this time the fire brigade were called due to an \"incident\" but 5.30 again on the 4th day is a bit much. Not such a hassle for us as we could go back to sleep but i did feel for the people with babies who had to wake them up then put them down again.

Emailed the hotel in advance asking for a room up high facing city hall, which we were told at reception was going to be the case, but our room was actually on the 7th floor not overlooking city hall. Despite this, we were delighted with our room which was spotless, fantastic bed, quiet and very well serviced for us 2. We liked the fact that you could choose the time your room was serviced in the morning. This was handy in particular the day we were going to my brothers wedding and wanted the room cleaned between 2 and 4. 3. We found when we rang guest services, they were very prompt to drop up what we wanted and then followed up with a call a little later to ensure we were happy. 4. We had breakfast downstairs one mornng which was nice, but cost 48 dolars. We ate out every other morning for around 28 dollars. Of note were \"Eggspecations\" and \"Over easy\" on Yonge Street. Delicious breakfasts. 5. We ate twice in Traders downstairs and were extremely happy with the servoce and the food. 6. We ate in a place called the Keg which is a steakhouse, just around the corner from the Sheraton. The steak was fabulous! 7. Our group which consisted of 7 people, booked a limousine to take us to Niagra falls. This was booked through the Four Seasons where one person wass staying. It cost over 500 dollars but split 7 ways was cheaper than doing a tour - and we felt like celebs! 8. Didnt feel that check in staff were over friendly, but everyone else was. All in all, a great trip and would highly recommend the Sheraton.

There are plenty of varied restaurants nearby and a superb British style pub (The Duke of Richmond) 2 minutes away opposite the old City Hall which served a good variety of beer and good pub meals. It is far better than the hotel bar where service was cursory, prices were expensive, seats were at a premium and the noise level was considerable. Our room was reasonably sized, clean, well appointed and well serviced although there was no mini bar. We had to phone down to get our luggage which I think had been just left in the foyer with no-one taking responsibility for it. The ice machine on our floor (28th) was not working nor was the adjacent soft drinks machine during the whole of our 4 day stay. This was sloppy. The staff were OK without being outstanding. They actually matched the hotel which I would rate the same way. There was not a lot of charm or sophistication in anything I saw. When we left we paid $47 dollars for a \"limousine\" (their description) to the airport - as advertised on a notice in the foyer about how to get to the airport. We took this to mean that this was a hotel vehicle as we had to pre-book it. When we left, however, we were put into an ordinary taxi at the fixed rate of $47.

I arrived at 3 p.m. knowing that check-in is at 4 but was given a room (usually possible on a weekend stay) right away. I took a dip in the pool and enjoyed swimming under the curtain to the rainy outdoors. The pool is especially fun for families in winter because children really love the novelty of being able to swim outside when the snow is falling. I then took the PATH to the Bay for its excellent cafeteria style bakery and lunch counters. I brought the food back to my room and enjoyed the view of Toronto city hall from 32 stories up. I then walked to the theatre (Canon - formerly Pantages) to see Cirque \u00c3\u2030loize presents NOMADE which was wonderful. The sweet sleeper bed is a treat and I always leave thinking I need one for my home. The room was clean and the one small problem I encountered (the remote was missing) was resolved within 5 minutes. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone staying in downtown Toronto. Tips - Ask for a high floor with a view of City Hall in a renovated room - if asked if you'll accept a room by the service elevator.. say NO - ask for walking directions from the tour desk as most theatres and major shops are an easy walking distance and a very pleasant walk. - park in the municipal lot for large savings - in winter, you can use the PATH system to get to most major shopping and many restaurants without ever stepping outside.

The room itself was fantastic, with a huge king size bed that was extremely comfortable. There was also a desk and small armchair in the room and it wasn't cramped at all so v spacious. The bathroom was also a good size and although it wasn't renovated, it was spotless! My boyfriend was also delighted with the hotel and although we both loved the place, the majority of our time was spent out of it! A small word of warning, the restaurants and bar in the hotel are expensive. This is to be expected in hotel bars but just to let you know! There is a fab place just 2 secs from the hotel called sunset grill which does tasty, cheap breakfasts/lunch all day long! It's located on the corner of richmond st/yonge st. The hotel is in an excellent centre location, we walked all over the city centre and the major attractions were not too far away. For example, the CN tower/Skydome are only 10 mins walk away from the hotel. I particularly liked walking down to the harbour front and taking the ferry over to centre island, it was a gorgeous day and we just wandered round the park! I would like to mention that the company Toronto Tours are also located in the lobby of the hotel. They are fantastic to recommend restaurants etc, but the organised tours are pricey. The tours are of a v good standard and take any hassle of organising out of it as they tend to pick you up at the hotel and drop you off, but as I mentioned, they are v expensive! For example, we paid 150 canadian dollars each for the evening trip to niagara falls, and although we had a fantastic day, we felt as though it was massively overpriced as we had v little spare time and the dinner was standard buffet fare. (still tasty!) Another recommendation is that when you visit the CN tower, it's only a few dollars more to go for lunch in the 360 restaurant than the general admission fee for all of the tower. The food was lovely and we felt we would not have looked out over the city for as long or appreciated the view as much had we just gone to the observation deck. Our meal lasted just over an hour, during which time the restaurant revolved one full rotation. We loved Toronto and hope to go back soon!

The room at the Sheraton was good, but I did not like the pricing on a few things. I stay at many 4 and 5 star resorts so I know how expensive things can be. But I believe if you are paying decent money to stay at their facility, the least they can do is not charge you for the fitness center. The fitness center is very nice, but they charge you $9 a day. The parking is $33 a day and room service is too expensive. If this was a 5 star resort in Vegas I would expect this. But for a 3.5 star place charging a minimum of $179 per night, those things should be included and you shouldn't have to pay $16 a person for a continental breakfast.

We were right in between two subway stops and directly connected to Toronto's underground system of shops and restaurants. This was convenient on a rainy day. We could get to the subway and head up to the Royal Ontario Museum without getting out in the rain much. I only had two problems with the hotel. First, was the main entrance. It was like walking through a small parking lot to reach it. The main entrance is undergoing some renovations so maybe this will be remedied when that is finished. You have to walk through several rows of parked taxis and the circle drive which is not very safe for small children. There is a side entrance off the sidewalk that we discovered later. The second problem was not the hotel's fault but a condition of the great location. One night during out stay there was some sort of music festival going on in front of the city hall which was across the street.

The price was what attracted us to the hotel (so low I don't want to say) but the staff and the location is what will keep us coming back here. We went to see Cirque Du Soleil which I would recommend to anyone no matter what city they are performing in. Just get your tickets in advance. Even my two teenagers, who were not at all interested, wish that the show would have continued on for another couple of hours. Great family fun! As far as the hotel goes, upon check-in, the front desk staff confirmed that I had requested a non-smoking room with two double beds which was no problem. I also asked him if we could have a view of the government buildings which was also no problem. We were Up Graded to a 24th floor, beautifully decorated room with a view as requested. This whole process took about 5 minutes. Now even the elevators in the hotel were quick and readily available when we needed them. I don't believe we waited more than a minute either going up or coming down. After the first night, the cleaning lady left us extra towels and extra bottles of water for our thirsty teenagers after seeing we had four people in the room. In reading other postings about parking at the hotel, we decided to park in the city parking garage directly across the street. All we needed to do was take the hotel elevator to the PATH floor and the garage was just around the corner. This could not have been easier. Since we didn't plan on using the car, we left it there and upon leaving three days later, paid $35 CAD. That's a bargain in the city and we didn't even have to go outside in the rain. The city subway (just a block away) was so convenient as well as just walking the PATH to Eaton Centre and beyond. We took the subway and then transferred to the Bus 509 which took us right to Ontario Place and to Cirque Du Soleil, all within 30 minutes. So we had plenty of time to shop in the tents before the show began. We also walked to China town, (15 minutes), and were there for the opening of their annual festival. My daughter just loved the divercity of this city and the ability to walk everywhere. We all share her sentiments. We also went down to the Harbor and took a boat ride into one of the island coves. At the booth in front of the boat, they wanted only cash and also quoted us a price of $11 CAD per person. Since we wanted to use our credit card, they sent us to the Tour Booth where you could book all different tours. After talking with the clerk there we still ended up on the same boat but the pricing was cheaper. Only $7 for the teenagers since their age limit went up to 15. So we saved $8 just in walking across the sidewalk (15'). We ate at some great places but the one that stands out was the Cafe Crepe at 246 Queen St. W. (2-3 blocks from the hotel). You can watch them make the crepes and then add several different ingredients into the crepe depending on the orders. We had the ham/cheese and the dark chocolate which we ordered to go. They wrap it up like a waffle cone and off you go. The best fast food place. You can also sit inside but we were in too much of a hurry to see the city.

This seems to be a common response after reading other reviews from travels who booked a room using Hotwire or Priceline, I've used these sites several times & have never had any problems until this stay. The room was a decent size, had a nice sitting area & a clean/comfortable bed; our room also had a patio door that opened up into the Waterfall Garden which was nice. The negatives were the stale cigarette smell, stained carpet & the 2 males who were traveling with us said the toilet seat was broken & wouldn't stay up on its own. We called the front desk/\"customer service promise line\" to see if we could be moved to a non-smoking room because the smell was not pleasant & were put on hold for 5+ minutes, called back, were put on hold another 5 minutes & finally gave up! (this also seems to be a common experience according to other traveler's reviews that I've read since my stay) 45 minutes later they coincidently called our room to see if the cot we request had been delivered (which it hadn't) & when we requested a room change we were told they didn't have anything available but they could have housekeeping come up & \"spray our room\". Eventually the cot arrived & was set up for us, my travel companion who slept on the cot said it was actually comfortable; 3 of us ended up sleeping in the king sized bed which fortunately wasn't too bad.

There was a great \"roach coach\" across the street (lovely name I know but that's what they're called) where for $3 USD you can get a good late night snack/dinner of fries with either a burger or hotdog made while you wait (veggie options are available too which was excellent for us).

I am not one of those people who is of the school of \"well I only paid $70 through Priceline, so if i get a mediocre room I am fine with it.\" No way. The reason why I used Priceline is because the selling point is that you can get a 4 star room for $70. If that is the assertion, then that is what you should get. So I was disappointed to put in a bid with Priceline for a 4 star hotel in Toronto and find out I was staying at the Sheraton. My parents had stayed here once before and were given a horrible room and had a terrible stay. They said their room was old and shabby with a strong reek of cigarettes, and there were spit-marks all over their windows, which the hotel explained away by blaming it on a partying tour group from Spain, but refused to change the room. I found their experience was not uncommon after reading quite a few negative reviews on Tripadvisor about \"cabana rooms\" lax security and suspect cleanliness. I called Sheraton Reservations to put in my request for a renovated room. They claimed it was out of their jurisdiction. I insisted. I called more than once. Still no luck. Next, I tried the \"Service Promise Help Desk\" at the hotel itself. They should be called the Service Promise Help-less Desk. After cutting me off about 4 times in a row, they finally looked up my confirmation number and said room requests were only on a first-come-first-served basis. What I gather from this is once they mark you as a Priceline customer you are treated as a poor step-child. Priceline should do something about this since so many of their customers have experienced this treatment. My last step was to contact the general manager and tell her what happened. Her staff responded very quickly and efficiently and took care of my request. I was VERY HAPPY with my room in the end. It was large and beautifully renovated with a king-sized bed. The hotel is in an excellent location close to Queen Street West which is where we like to have dinner and drinks when in Toronto. The food court on the lower level was a convenient place to get breakfast in the morning without going outside. However, I would not classify the hotel as 4 star. (Maybe 3.5 stars.) Although the pool is free, it is full of kids at all hours, and guests have to pay $20/day for use of the gym. Shower caps are not provided with the room ammenities. The hotel is very popular with large families and groups. The atmosphere is noisy and active. Overall, I would stay here again if I could get a similar standard of room for the price I paid, but mostly because of the location, not because I was wowed by the hotel, although I did appreciate the trouble the manager's office took to accomodate us. We also stayed at the Intercontinental Toronto Centre on this trip, and had a reverse experience there. Although we weren't crazy about the location and found it a little dull at night (in the Financial District), we loved the hotel itself, and found that to be a true 4-star experience.", "Date": "June 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "happyherts", "ReviewID": "UR3577331", "Content": "Have just spent 6 nights at Sheraton Centre and found the hotel to be excellent and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay downtown in Toronto.

The corrider was dark and freezing and the room wasn't much better. On first inspection the bed was nice but that was where it ended. One of the main lamps had wires sticking out of a bulb hanging out and when I looked out the glass door I discovered that the dead lock to the outside balcony was broken and the door only had a small clasp lock stopping anyone trying to enter from outside. (Although on the 4th floor - the balcony was accessible from the 3rd floor pool deck - the room balcony overlooked this). The room also had an interconnecting door to another room.

I was called over by the Sheraton Preferred Guest Agent and after describing the problems I asked if I could use some SPG points to upgrade to a room where I felt safe. She said this wasn't necessary and pointed out the Sheraton promise. She then gave me a room key to a room in the Queens tower on the 31st floor and apologised for the problems.

Even then, I knew the hotel was special and nice. So much so, me and my girlfriend went back to Toronto, this past August 2004 to see the city and Cirque du Soleil for the time it was in town. One was able to see the hotel more in depth, and to just marvel at how close it was to everything in the dowtown area of Toronto. I have no major complaints about this hotel or the staff whatsoever! The front lobby when pulling up in your car can be very very busy, so be patient and the parking lot attendants will get to you asap. The lobby was big and spacious and the staff get you checked in right away and off to your room really quickly from what I noticed. Most folks just sit and chit chat in the lobby, it's so wide open to guess and people who are just walking through to other parts of the hotel or city. They have a nice bar/restaurant on the first floor that offers a lot to a guess, depending on what your looking for. All the main nice restaurants in the downtown locale if staying here is in walking distance, or a quick cab ride! Ruth and Chris Steakhouse, The Keg, Fisherman's Wharf of San Francisco, just to name a few are right there for your eating pleasure's! The room was AWESOME! A very nice view of city hall to the north, and in 2002 when I stayed here had a wonderful view from the south looking right at the CN Tower. Everyday I woke up I took incredible pictures of the city and city hall. So to me all the views are good, no matter which direction your facing while staying here. They had a nice fitness area, big for most hotels, nice big jacuzzi, that can seat quite a few folks in there, and not a bad swimming pool for those that like to swim. I know in the winter time the pool was heated in 2002, I didn't get in it in August of 2004, but the pool was nice with plenty of towels for all guess to dry off on. Lots of shops within the hotel for one to do some shopping on the property. Only thing I didn't like about my room was the very small sinks inside the room, one would think they would've been a tad bit bigger, but aside from that, the room was nice. Soft bed, lots of space for two individuals. I love how the Sheraton Centre connects to the Eaton Centre shopping mall, that right there is the highlight of staying at this facility. I was told by a friend that this isn't the best mall in Toronto, it's the tourist mall, but to me it's really nice. The way you can take the underground walking path to the Bay shopping store, then take a few lefts and rights and your inside the 3 level mall is nice I must say, very! I think that really help sells the hotel even more to me, just to have that option without leaving the hotel and still be able to sight-see with just walking a mile or less. One thing I didn't like, being that Nathan Phillip Square is right across the street. Me and my girlfriend went there the first night in town to just relax and the place smelled something awful of urine by all the homeless folks living there, not the best place to relax at the end of the day, due to the smell!! I do recommend this hotel to the fullest! I think one by themselves, or with friend, or family can really enjoy this town and hotel no matter time of season it is.

(Shouldn't be but that is a different matter altogether...) Upon check-in, the Sheraton check-in clerk told us how lucky we were to be assigned a \"mini-suite\" that they called a \"cabana\"room. Warning bells should have sounded as we entered the cabana area and passed an outraged customer complaining of \"missing glass\" in his room. I never found out what the missing glass was but I can say that our room was NOT 4* quality. More like a 2* Holiday Inn with some years on it. Peeling paint in the bathroom, dirty carpets and generally getting close to shabby. The cabana is in neither the richmond nor the queens tower, it is a few rooms tacked onto an area where the smaller meeting rooms are located. But all this would have been fine considering the paltry sum payed for the room, if it had not been for the noise. Now, I am a VERY heavy sleeper and I couldn't care less about a little noise from next door. But, this room was the loudest I have EVER been in. If our neighbors talked in a normal tone, their voices were somehow amplified and sounded like they chatting in the same room as we were. Almost uncanny! Well the second night at the Sheraton we had no neighbors and it was fine, but the room was still a little shabby. The location is great. The bed was the exception to the rule in the room as it was VERY comfortable. We also stayed at the Westin during our trip and it was far superior in every way but location. And the Westin is a nice location, just not quite as convenient. My advice to any future priceliner, or anyone else for that matter, would be to avoid the \"Cabana\" sales pitch at check-in, refuse the \"upgrade\" to cabana and take your chances on something else. If you had no one around you in the cabana it should be OK, but if anyone is next door - watch out! Our neighbors were relatively quiet but we would have much rather not felt like we were sharing a room with them.

What a view! The large room was newly decorated and in perfect order. Lovely plush fabrics and decor and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Had both breakfast in the hotel and dinner in the Le Biftheque steakhouse - both very good. Great location with both the Eaton Centre and The Bay both just a few yards away. There is also access to the PATH (underground shopping) System from within the hotel. Good sized pool and hot tub. Coin operated laundry facilities also available. Would highly recommend the day trip to Niagara Falls which also includes a large buffet lunch at the penthouse restaurant in the Sheraton on the Falls hotel. This trip also includes a ride on the Maid of the Mist, visit to the whirlpool rapids and a drop off at the heliport for an optional flight over the falls (stunning). Finally, there is a stop off at Niagara-on-the-lake which is very pretty and not to be missed. Our tour guide was a total gem, she helped make our day very pleasurable. I would also recommend Mamma Mia at the theatre and a visit to the CN Tower - go all the way to the Skypod! Lots and lots to see in Toronto. Lots of great places to eat.

The hotel was wonderful during the blackout, offering chilled water and bags of ice at no cost and did checks on everyone at infrequent intervals. I am writing this review now only because I just recently discovered tripadvisor. I booked my room using Hotwire and spent $49 US a night Sun - Fri. All I can say is my wife and I thought this place was absolutely one of the best rooms we have ever had. Down comforters, pillow-top mattress, extra throw pillows, two sitting chairs. We were given a corner room on the 27th floor overlooking the CN Tower ... whew, what a view, and whew ... what a walk up the stairs during the blackout !!. If you go, check and see if you can get a corner room. You get an extra sliver of glass on the side of the building, just enough to create a slight \"panoramic\" view. This hotel is centrally located, Eaton Centre half a block, Theatre District about 5/6 blocks , Chinatowne 5/6 blocks, Waterfront /Skydome/ Air Canada Centre all 6/7 blocks, as is the Hockey Hall of Fame. Bus and Trolley run right in front of hotel. The one bus that I mention will take you right to the ferry dock for the Toronto Islands Beaches (work on not having any tan lines ;-). Same bus taken from just across the street from the ferry unloading exit will get you back ... how easy is that? What is there not to like about this place ?? Sure if you overpaid for the room, maybe you would find fault. I honestly would pay up to $150/night US and still not complain about this place. Oh , which reminds me ... I do have a slight unhappiness (not really a complaint) ... the pool does seem a bit small for such a large hotel, but it was never overburdened while we were there. But then again we liked the half in / half out of the building pool design and there is a pool bar AND jacuzzi !! Didn't try the restaurants in the hotel. (we like authentic Chinese, Pizza, etc. from the neighborhoods) Believe me, I'm not bragging here, I can easily afford this hotel at published prices ... Hotwire is why I can, but won't ...
