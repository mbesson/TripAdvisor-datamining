I chose Rydges because I have stayed with them before at Rydges Parramatta and also for the package they offered which included buffet breakfast for 2 and free parking. I was not fussed about location, as the sole purpose of booking this hotel was to spend time with my partner who is a medical student visiting home from Victoria. However North Sydney makes a very suitable \"home away from home\" location, as I'm from Liverpool. As I drove to the location, I did find the driveway leading to the car park narrow but that is a minor issue to me. During check in, I was greeted by the very friendly front desk manager (?? From memory that was his title). After the quick and easy check in, we went to the elevator and was so happy to know I'll be staying on the tenth floor (there are 12 floors in this hotel). When entering the room, my partner and I was very surprised at what we were offered. I initially booked a park view queen room. simple. unknowingly, the gentleman who checked us in gave us a 2 bedroom apartment suite! Whilst the extra bedroom was not required, we were very happy to know of the upgrade and to have a balcony and roomy space. the next morning when we went down for our buffet breakfast, the we walked past an Indian male housekeeper who staffwas very courteous and quickly moved his trolley over to let us through, which wasn't necessary as there was still a lot of space, but he was nonetheless very customer centric. at Rise, the staff greeted us with Good Morning which I thought was very courteous. to Jon Ackery, I'm very happy with the friendly smiles of the morning staff at Rise on the morning of Wednesday 11th. The lady making the coffee asked for our room number then asked if we dined here before. we said no, so she told us where things were and if we needed anything, to let her or the other staff know. the lady on Thursday 12th was quite disappointing as she hardly had a smile on and just asked for our room number. the buffet breakfast is the best I have ever had. its the first time I have seen fresh fruit smoothies and Wheatgrass juice! There is so many hot and cold breakfast varieties and I was really spoiled for choice! Whilst there has been mention that the bathroom is old, we did not find that an issue and the bathtub was large enough to fit two people. I only have two faults from my stay.first, there was an unpleasant stain on the curtains in the main bedroom of 1013. Secondly, whilst in the foyer using the free WiFi to book movie tickets, the phone rang and prior to picking it up, Roman from front desk made a rude remark prior to answering, along the lines of \"for Christ sake\". other than that, I had a perfect stay and Rydges North Sydney is definitely the hotel of choice for me.

It's in a wonderful setting and great position (close to Luna Park only 15 minute walk with kids) and the one bedroom harbour view apartment we had was very very comfortable. We were lucky enough to have two sofa beds for my three children to sleep in and they were extremely comfortable sofa beds. The queen bed in the bedroom was probably the most comfortable bed I've slept in and I have travelled all over the world and have never found a better bed. I have viewed them now on the Rydges website with intention to buy one. The bathroom was user friendly, and usually when it comes to water saving shower heads they are generally hopeless, but this water saving shower head was probably the best I've used (good pressure and good water coverage) someone really did their homework on them. A small amount of minor maintenance/housekeeping in rooms wouldn't go astray. Minor things as tightening kitchen door handles, vacuuming under beds (lots of stuff under there from days gone by). a good clean of the fridge and supplying a utensil drying rack for the washing up to dry on. All in all, you wouldn't be disappointed staying at this motel in any respect. I would highly recommend it to anyone with a family too. I am disappointed that we didn't get time to eat at the restaurant or get the room service food it looked fantastic, NEXT TIME FOR SURE!!!!!

The view and location is the saving items for the Rydges, although getting a westerly facing room without the harbour view wouldn't add any further appreciation to the hotel. The rooms do have a good bed, comfortable and resting after a long day at work.

The dining room on the ground floor is satisfactory, and the lounge bar was pleasant for after work drinks with colleagues.

I last stayed at the Rydges Nth Sydney about 10 years ago and was disappointed as it was very run down but thought I'd give it another try. The good news is that the rooms have been refitted recently and are looking much better. However they still look a little dated. On checking into the room neither the standing lamp nor desk lamp worked. They came and replace the bulb in the standing lamp, but could not fix the desk lamp, which made it difficult to get any work done at the desk. Bathrooms have had a fresh coat of paint and new taps but tiles were dated and cracked. Rate I paid at the Rydges for a mid week stay was AU$290 per night. I stayed at the 4 Points Sheraton right on Darling Harbour last week for $220, as a comparison of what's available right in one of Sydney's very popular central city areas. Rydges being in Nth Sydney is a $15 taxi ride to city dining or shows, and nothing happens in Nth Sydney after 6pm. Rydges also does not have a gym/health club which I believe is important for business travlers and is a disappointment, especially at the rate I paid. However a short walk up the road is Sydney Oval and a park which is great for walking or jogging. Dinner was room service and I ordered a steak sandwich. Service was prompt but for $22 the meal was small and average at best. Staff were friendly and helpful enough when engaged. In conclusion I think I'll go back to the central city hotels for my next stays. Unless you're doing business in Nth Sydney and don't want to do the 10-15min commute back and forth to the city, Rydges is an option, but you can get more for your money in an area with more restaurants, action and scenery in the city.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cStaff were fantastic and the food was wonderful\u201d", "Author": "Victoria B", "ReviewID": "UR126359032", "Content": "I recently held a Corporate event at Rydges North Sydney.

There was no dressing gown in the wardrobe but there was an iron and board, mini-bar and fridge. Free wifi was available in the lobby but not in the rooms. I had room service for dinner and it was a big disappointment - chicken that was meant to be grilled bore a strong resemblance to a fast food outlet's chook, the Caesar Salad was 99% lettuce leaves and the steamed vegetables were probably frozen, microwaved warm because the broccoli had microwave burns. This otherwise very nice hotel should do something to improve not only the room service food but also the selection on the menu which had four choices or pizza. Not what I'd expect in a four star hotel. Check-in was speedy but I discovered in the morning (arrived after 8pm) that I didn't receive a free newspaper nor was I offered a paid delivery of newspaper at check-in. There were no papers in the breakfast restaurant. Breakfast was very adequate, with fresh fruits, hot meals, toast/pastries etc and proper fresh coffee (cappucino machine operated by staff member). I'd stay here again but I wouldn't get room service, because it's close to my meeting base, but there aren't lots of restaurants or shops in the vacinity.

The room had obviously undergone a facelift not too long ago and this made the whole experience really enjoyable.

Will somebody please tell Rydges that when their rooms undergo a facelift include the bathroom. The rooms look as if they are from 2011 however the bathrooms look as if they are time warped in the 70's. Cracked tiles, old toilet, old light fittings etc etc. Really disappointing as spending that little extra would create an experience that could quite easily be rated as 4+ star. The restaurant is really nice and the food and service is excellent. I would highly recomend the set 3 course menu but if you are a Priority Guest you will not receive the 20% food discount which I thought was a little deceiving as from what I have read the discount applies to everything excluding breakfast only.

I live on the Gold Coast now. I had already had terrible experiences at an appalling accommodation place in Cremorne (north shore) and the wotif.com.au organisation had changed my booking for the rest of my stay to the Rydges Hotel at North Sydney. This hotel is over 30 years old. It is in need of a good clean and some changes made. My room was on the first floor. When I got out of the lift, the carpet was really dirty and looked like it hadn't been vacuumed for a week! It was an old, stained, red striped carpet. In the bathroom there was black mould on the tiles behind the bathroom sink. I had asked a cleaning staff member to clean it, but he could hardly speak English and told me to report it to the reception desk. I did this and reception told me that they would send someone to clean it while I was out. But this did not happen. I again reported it. They did clean it this time, but only very 'half heartedly'. The mould was still there. The power point for 'appliances' in the bathroom was not working. The carpet around the bed etc had not been vacuumed properly. The air conditioner controls on the wall had no cover and would not change from 18 degrees. This was too cold, so I had to sleep the entire stay 'sweltering' instead. There were not enough coathangers in the wardrobe and nowhere to hang my formal dress (that I was wearing to the wedding reception) so that it did not crush on the bottom. When I came back to the hotel after the wedding service to get changed for the formal reception, my room had not been made up despite it being 2.00p.m. While in the shower with a 'do not disturb' sign on the door, a maid simply opened the door to my room and came in. When I told her that I was getting changed and could she come back in half an hour, she could not understand me and obviously did not understand the sign on the door! I ordered room service for breakfast and my eggs were still raw on the top!! The bacon had not been fried but simply 'microwaved' and tasted just awful. When I got back from the wedding reception, the lifts were out of order. The Russian woman on reception argued with me and another guest telling us that the lifts were working. When we could finally get her to get up off her chair and come out to look at the lifts, she said that they weren't working! No apology to us for arguing saying that they were. She then took myself and the other guest to our respective floors in the service elevator with all the rubbish!! I would NEVER stay at this hotel again. It is old, dirty, staff that don't speak good English and a 'don't care' attitude. They also tried to charge me for my room for the stay despite me telling them that I had already paid via the wotif.com.au website.

The rooms are comfortable, several lamps, modern flat screen TV's, new desks etc. They have some nice little touches in there like having a little input panel where you can plug in a USB cable, HDMI cable as well as your standard audio cable so if you want to bring a game console, or output your computer or charge your devices you can. The hotel is located quite near the highway, but noise is absolutely not an issue. The rooms seem extremely well insulated and blackout curtains reduce an further ambient noise to nothing. The new beds are extremely comfortable, I stayed for 4 nights and had a wonderful nights sleep each night. Other facilities in room are what you expect to see with internet/room service...all the standard fare you'd expect. Rooms were well cleaned and organised. Mini bar has a decent array of snacks and drinks. Big positives, every single staff member I dealt with was EXTREMELY professional, meticulously well groomed and helpful and genuinely friendly and this is a very big point. We ate at one of the restaurants downstairs which was very nice, and had a great atmosphere and was well priced. We stayed 4 days, they changed us around on the second day to a room on the eleventh floor with great views over Neutral Bay. Location is excellent. You're 10 minutes walk or less to the heart of North Sydney, buses are about 3 minutes away that can take you to the city, or to the zoo, train station is 10 minutes walk and you could walk to the ferry in about 20 minutes, the same with Luna park and the Bridge etc. If you're driving you're about 1 minute away from the Freeway heading north/south. North Sydney itself is a very pleasant place to stay, its very quiet, very leafy and a nice respite after spending the day in central CBD. Negatives: The only thing I would point out for negatives would be the bathrooms. The renovation seems to have been limited new carpets, beds, furniture, fixings, new paint etc...but the bathrooms are old. There are chips in tiles, the baths are very small and shallow and the pressure not so great. They are without doubt a bit tired. They were not dirty or mouldy - just showing their age. For me, a relaxing bathroom is pretty important to me when I go away because I like to have a soak in the tub etc and to be honest, this is a purely functional bathroom, you won't be sipping a glass of champagne in their with your partner. However, given the price of the rooms and everything else it has going for it, it did not massively detract from the whole experience. Summary: Overall, this is a really lovely hotel to stay in, the grounds are beautifully manicured, the rooms cosy and friendly, the restaurant good quality and inviting and their staff a real asset to the them. My overall impression is overwhelmingly positive and I would recommend a stay to anyone...", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing & convenient\u201d", "Author": "Denise255060", "ReviewID": "UR103566759", "Content": "I must admit we weren't expecting much after reading some of the reviews but were pleasantly surprised.

The room was clean (the furniture was a bit dated) and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The bathroom was large and the bath products provided were very nice. The major issue was the elevators. The hotel was at capacity that weekend and we were waiting up to 15 minutes for the lift to get to the lobby. We tried to take the fire stairs but they did not let off at the lobby and instead lead into the parkade. I am sure that if the hotel was not at capacity the elevators would have been much quicker. The next day we went for breakfast, which was included in our package. It was first come, first serve and was complete chaos! As we were a large group we were told we would not be able to all sit together. When I asked if we could sit at the empty bar the host said yes so at least we all managed to sit together. The kitchen was understaffed for such a large event. The food they were preparing was very tasty but there were food items missing from the buffet. When I went up to get my breakfast there were no eggs or bacon and no coffee. Others in our group found there were no tomatoes or mushrooms when they went up. If the hotel had planned better for being at capacity and schedule seatings for the guests for breakfast it would have been a much more relaxing experience. I think that Rydges would do well to have the appropriate number of staff on when they market an event and know that the hotel is going to be at capacity.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blue Mountains", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, dirty room, overcharged breakfasts.\u201d", "Author": "TimberBlueMountains", "ReviewID": "UR95974870", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights after seeing a \"sizzling hot summer deal\" in our local paper.

A cleaner knocked on our door on the second day about 2 in the afternoon, and asked if we wanted the room cleaned, we had just come back from the city, it was a hot and humid day and we had no wish to go anywhere for awhile, so we declined. Why it wasn't clean to start with we don't know. When booking over the net, we had the option to pre-pay for a number of things one being buffet breakfast. The listed price was $12.50 per head. We did not know whether we were going to have breakfast on both days so decided not to pre-pay. There was no notice that failure to pre-pay would cost you! We had a buffet breakfast on one morning only and when checking out were slugged $50. This was queried, the reception person had no idea what the prices were on the website and we were left to pay the $50. On returning home we sent an email to the head office, and received a phone call from an employee 2 days later. He said he could see how we had become confused and he would have his IT people look into it. No apology no offer of a refund.

When I stepped into the room I saw that the chocolate dipped strawberries were on the table - phew I thought, luckily that was done otherwise I'd have to ruin the surprise for my partner and call reception ): The hotel I admit is a little bit dated. Our room was a little dusty. When I grabbed the kettle to boil water for tea I realised there was still water in it, had to wash the kettle because I didn't feel like calling reception for another one. We decided to call reception to ask for a list of nearby restaurants, they had someone bring it up to us. At the end of it we thought we'd just order room service. Unfortunately being a vegan, I was unable to have a hearty meal so I ordered the steamed edamame beans to snack on. They were pretty gross ): I'd never had edamame beans before so I don't know how theyre supposed to taste but they were furry and hard. My partner on the other hand had a burger and he absolutely loved it. I had the best sleep in a hotel I've ever had in my life. The bed was so amazing I am planning to buy one. I knocked out so hard and fast when I jumped into bed I didn't want to wake up when the alarm went off for breakfast. Breakfast was another drag - had to have cereal & soymilk with bread & peanut butter (being a vegan). My partner seemed to like the breakfast buffet though he thinks there should be more options!

I actually fall back asleep soon after then by the time they could get a hold of me she came up to give me my breakfast at a comfortable price of $10 for 2 hot poached eggs on toast with 2 hash browns delivered to my room! I checked out early around 5pm on my second night to stay closer to central sydney, the hotel advise me that next time if I tell them before 3pm I could get my money back for this night I paid for. Most hotels wouldnt dream of advising such a thing right. Overall the rooms are very cosy with a good enough parkside view as well, very quiet and spacious bathroom sink area, bath. all for a great Priority Guest Members rate of $119ASD.

I chose the family taronga zoo/luna park package, as we googled and found this package and thought it seemed pretty reasonable value for money and a good family trip away for the weekend. The following is our feedback for the two night period of stay- *We went to the room with the key card obtained by reception and the door wouldn't unlock. I went back to reception and lady began to say \"how\" to put the card in (i guess thinking we did it incorrectly) I told her I did it correctly. I went back up to the room after she had reset the code and it still didn't work! I went back down and saw another lady and she said it had a block on it ? She removed this block. I went back up and it worked. *You may find the lift a problem at certain time frames. Most of the time we found it was quite slow. There was one instance that we were trying to get to breakfast and were waiting for the lift for a minimun of 15 minutes and it still didn't come! so we decided to take the stairs but this is a problem as when you get to the only door below level 1 it has a sign, saying the door is alarmed? So we went back up to level 1 and waited another 10 minutes and finally got the lift. I can appreciate times can get busy but surely there should be another option instead of the lift that can get you to the ground level without any hassle? *The sliding door to the balcony didn't slide very well. maybe needs needs new rollers? or maybe this was to stop any kids going onto the balcony as the door didn't have a lock - we have two children aged 9 & 6? *The bedroom lights didn't work. *The bathroom fan was constanly on. *The shower has a mind of it's own, the hot water plays up and on 2 occasions had no water at all with both taps full on - not fantastic when you are half way through your shower with a head full of shampoo trying to rinse it off!!!. *It was ironic that at one stage we were in the lift with another family and the husband said how good the breakfast was and the wife commented about the \"noisy sheets\" , this was after my wife saying the same thing prior. It didn't worry me but my wife said every movement was like a rolling in leaves sound. Also the actual dooner cover were just sheets covering it no actual cover. I suppose this might be quicker for cleaning? *My wife was dissapointed that she had brought her own hair dryer as there was already one in the room. She went to use the one in the room and it worked but the only disapointment was the thick film of dust entailed. *As part of the room package we ordered three beers on ice.This is correct it was only on ice with very minimal ice around the actual beer, so beer wasn't very cold. So no worries I went to the fridge and it was the same sort of temperature as fridge turned to lowest setting(I suppose to save power?)- Freezer was good to cool drinks! *The breakfast was part of the package and I was ok with it, the only grief was with the bacon. When the bacon was changed with new, they left the left over oil in the tray which was quite substantial. Maybee drain the oil before putting in the new? *The car park only has limited numbers, you are not assured of a spot. There are some limited ones outside and not part of the complex. You don't need to pay for these on weekends and after 6.pm and before 8.am Weekdays but there is a 2 hour limit parking limit during 8.pm to 6.pm. *I hope this helps for future improvements.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cNot as bad as everyone said\u201d", "Author": "7DC", "ReviewID": "UR38592236", "Content": "I stayed at the Rydges World Square for business a few days earlier and chose Rydges North Sydney for a week-end break with my wife. I must say I had some reservations after reading all the bad reviews on this site about the hotel and considering how good World Square was. We took the train from the airport to North Sydney station and walked from there to the hotel. It was a bit of a hike uphill but we were there within 15 minutes (it took 10 minutes after that as we knew exactly how to get there). You could also take one of many buses from the station/shopping centre and it's two stops from there on Miller Street. Our first interaction with the staff was to leave our luggage with the hotel so we could go out and explore Sydney. The lady who wrked there that morning wasn't particularly welcoming but I wouldn't say she was rude, just dry. When we came back in the afternoon, the male staff was much more welcoming and we were given a room on a high floor. OK, so the room is a bit tired (ie. carpet and furniture need a makeover) and the window seal wasn't working well when the wind was blowing hard at night. But apart from that, there was nothing else we would complain about. It was a clean hotel room and the bed was comfortable. As it was not in the centre of the CBD, we had to plan our days out carefully as we just couldn't come back when we felt like it but there are enough caf\u00c3\u00a9s, parks and shopping centres in town to have a breather when you felt like it. On our last night, we went to the Rag & Famin pub nearby (200metres) and had their famous 'crusty lid pies' for dinner. There are a lot of restaurants in Crows Nest and that's a $7 taxi ride or a few bus stops on the Pacific Highway. So, overall, it was a comfortable and pleasant stay.

Rooms have Queen size beds (including the 1 bedroom suites), facilities in the rooms are at best mediocre - as other reviews have called out, there are new LCD TVs, but that's where anything modern ends. The clock-radios in the bedheads look like something out of a 70's erotica film!

There is ample car parking (for a fee), so if you're on a driving holiday or working on the road, I guess that's a strength. Obvious question - Why did I stay there for 8mo if it was so bad? Answer. Location/proximity to my office, it was summer so I could exercise outdoors (gym wasn't an issue) and at the time the rate on offer for corporate guests went a way to justifying the place. On the price front, whilst the rooms are often available at competitive prices, the Rydges model is comparable to Formule 1 hotels - EVERYTHING extra comes at a cost. Internet is exorbitantly priced at ~$25 a day, mini-bar is more expensive that a coke at the movie theatre - generally, what you save in room rate, they'll try get back from you somewhere else. To be perfectly honest, the best summary I can give of this place is that it is the [maybe] the best choice of 3 large hotels in North Sydney, and don't they know it...

I parked on the street behind the hotel for 3 nights and then 1 night in the secure car park. The hotel itself is ok. Things are a bit dated, but overall acceptable. The lifts have been renovated. The room I stayed in was on a high floor and had a great view. The room itself looked exactly like it did in the pictures on the Rydges website. The mini bar fridge was very big and empty(just the way I like it). The carpets could have done with a steam clean/ been replaced. The bathroom had been repainted, but really needed a renovation. The paper cup place holders near the bathroom sink looked like they had not been changed for ages and had been reused over and over. The hotel had problems with the hot water for most of my stay. Like all other Rydges Hotels, the bed was very comforatble. The new flat screen TV was... fantastic... except if the sound on it actually worked. I had called the reception about this problem every day of my stay. The first time I enquired I was told it would be fixed. Went out to dinner, came back, TV sound worked.... for a few minutes. I had to call reception every day regarding the TV as the sound did not work. They would tell me to reset the TV, which I kept on telling them didn't do anything to solve my problem. There was one night in particular that I need to mention. I had come back very late that night after dinner in the city. I called reception at around 12midnight. There were only 2 people on night shift. The staff member that came up at 12midnight was very courteous and tried to do everything that he could for me at that time of night to try and fix the sound problem on the TV. Being a long-weekend, there was really nothing that could be done, and changing rooms was out of the question as the hotel was fully booked out. The staff member was the most pleasant and corteous person that I have encountered at a Rydges Hotel. Apart from this very nice staff member, the hotel was a very painful experience. Try showering in luke warm water for 3 nights in a row and coming back to a room with a TV that doesn't have any sound. Check-out at around 7pm was just as unpleasant, but unlike everything else, the problem was sorted out on the spot. I ended up checking out about 15hrs earlier than what I had planned as I had had enough. I have stayed in other Rydges Hotels before without any problems.

As well as offering room service for breakfast they also offer a take away service which can be ordered the night before. The hotel offers a free shuttle service which runs within a 5km area and the hotel is in a great location, 5-8 minute walk to the North Sydney CBD. If travelling on business I would definately stay at the Rydges again.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cIts OK, if you don't mind...\u201d", "Author": "Unsatisfied12", "ReviewID": "UR25838527", "Content": "My children gave my partner and I a gift voucher for the Twilight Concert with an accommodation package at Rydges North Sydney.

As I have read in past reviews, the lukewarm water is still evident and nothing has been done to rectify this. I had the second shower after my husband and the water was not only lukewarm, but merely a trickle. No pressure!!! I have long hair and didn't bother to condition it as there was barely any water. The air conditioning was very noisy and wouldn't turn off! I called reception, about 9pm. A rude young madam attended my room promptly, but couldn't find the switch. So couldn't find the problem and didn't offer any alternative!! My husband later found the switch was behind the headboard, after he rolled the bed out. The concert was wonderful and I am attending another package in the up comming weekends. If I hadn't already prepaid for this package, I would definately like to cancel and book accommodation elsewhere. The bed was comfortable, but a pity everything else let it down.

This time, we have a niece and family living north of the city. We decided to stay at the Rydges North Sydney because it would be walking distance to the harbor north of the Sydney Bridge, where we wanted to watch the fireworks on New Year's Eve. It was a great decision. It was about a 20 minute walk to a nice park along the harbor. It was a wonderful experience. As for the hotel, it was in a very quiet neighborhood. The room was nice, with a view of Sydney Harbor (but not the bridge). Breakfast was included, the people were nice, and the bed was comfortable. The only problem was that there was no hot water at all - for the 3 nights we were there. They were sorry, but did nothing to solve the problem, which they said was due to the fact that the hotel was full. Humm, you'd think they'd be prepared for such a strange event. They said they were going to meet to discuss this issue. They also did absolutely nothing in term of lowering our rate, offering us a free night, etc. Contrast that with the Hilton Corporation - see my review of the Fiji Spa and Resort Managed by Hilton (which I'll post soon).

The room was spacious and fairly clean, now Rydges isn't a five star hotel and i think its unfair to compare it to one but I was pretty impressed with the overall quality of the rooms. There are two plasma tv, one in the bedroom and one in the livingroom. There was plenty of towels but not as fluffy and soft as I like them to be. I guess after reading all the negative reviews I was kinda expecting a really rundown and dirty hotel so it was a pleasant surprise. Room service was efficient, althought the prawn on skewers and bed of jasmine rice wasn't so tasty. The underground parking is a bit bland, yes its good value but I don't feel safe when I park my car there (the lighting isnt so good) It was also disappointing the bar downstairs closed at 10pm on a weekend! During our stay we had breakfast @ the hotel, the buffet was simple and it was nice to have freshly made smoothies and 'real' coffee made by baristas.

Water pressure or lack of it was a joke, the mould, cracks and dirty areas made it a shocking sight. Mini Bar was overpriced with a small chocolate bar being $4.50. The TV was very slow between channels - a 3 - 5 sec period before it changes - it did freeze on one channel and would not even turn off. Reception said to turn off and leave off for 7 mins as it happens all the time in all the rooms. Beware if ironing as well as dirty and may leak and stain your clothes...

My party was spread over four floors. Problems (not purely the fault of the hotel) began at check-in.

What followed was a slapstick-style jump up and down from floor to floor only to find myself (after more than an hour of going back and forth between floor) back in the original room. Before I left for Sydney I read some reviews saying the beds are the best thing about the hotel. I remember thinking \"Oh there has to be more to it than just the beds.\" No, not really. Apart from the hotel's proximity to the theatre we were working in, there was nothing else much to Rydges. The service was ordinary, the hot water pressure was the WORST I've ever experienced and the room service pizza tasted like it had been boiled. I would have gladly eaten elsewhere but Nth Sydney shuts down at 5pm, with little exception.

It is a little off the beaten track however my partner and I travelled into the Sydney CBD on a daily basis with no issues. An advantage to this though is that the hotel is very quiet - no road noise etc whatsoever. We always felt safe walking back at night, however if you were by yourself I am sure it would be fine, but might not feel that way! The hotel itself has a nice lobby. The room was nice and average size (don't expect any views). The bathroom was reasonably clean. We stayed for three nights and on the first day the hairdryer literally blew up (well it smoked and died anyway). I rang reception to get it fixed straight away. It was still not fixed by the time we checked out (I rang a couple more times during the stay as well). That did tarnish the stay a bit (more so if I relied heavily on a hairdryer!), and to be honest reception really did not seem to care. They were not 'rude', but they were not interested in the least either which is a shame. I would recommend this hotel only if you don't mind walking AND you get it for a good rate (or need or prefer a North Sydney location).
