It is in a quiet, primarily residential, area. It is a pretty good walk to a grocery store (1.3km) or a restaurant (about 1/2km to nearest) outside the hotel. Public transportation is about a kilometer walk away.The room appeared clean. It is quite small fitting a king size bed and maybe a meter on each side. Our small bath had a very small shower.The website says parking, but it is 10 euro extra. We were lucky to find a street parking spot and walked about a couple hundred feet into the hotel. I suspect the street spaces would be full after five or so. The website also mentions business traveler friendly but there was only fee based (T-Mobile) internet. Also, the front desk person told us there was a 24 hour advance requirement for the airport shuttle and it only went from 8 to 9 AM. However, the room information mentions a 12 hour advance requirement. Also, they said only one direction is included, so if the van picks you up at the airport, the return is not free! This is also very misleading on the website. I couldn't make an 800 number (calling card access number) call directly from my room. I called the front desk who strongly implied I would need to go to the front desk to make a call. After some inquiry, I was told they could make the call and connect me in the room. I wasn't called back at first, waited about 30 minutes, then called again and was connected shortly which worked. The phone issue is baffling. It is about an 11km drive to the airport so that is, in my opinion, reasonable for a major city like Frankfurt. The bottom line: I wouldn't stay there again unless I was desperate.", "Date": "Aug 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR908901100", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "B8thoven"}, {"Content": "Sleeping at airport is more convenient A hotel with airport in its title makes you think that it is focussed on airport travelers.

When we arrived at the airport and called for the hotel to send a shuttle, we were told that we had to give 24 hours notice. This was not stated anywhere on the information when we booked the hotel. So we paid 20 Euros plus tip for a taxi to the hotel.We then found that the air conditioning in the hotel did not work, and it was quite warm in the room. We also found that when we turned on the cold water faucet, we got hot water for about 5 minutes. (This is not an exaggeration. We actually called the front desk thinking we would have to switch rooms.)The equipment in the fitness room did not work. Maybe needed new batteries?We are fairly tolerant people and would not be writing this review except for what happened when we checked out. We were told that we owed 29 Euros for breakfast. First of all, breakfast had been listed as an amenity when we made our reservation. Second, no price was listed in the dining room,and there was no indication that we would be charged for breakfast. When we protested, the clerk said that the could not do anything about it because we had paid for our room ahead (required by the hotel). I wasn't sure what difference that made! I told him that a hotel's good name is worth something, and that I would report what had happened. I also told him that we would not stay in the hotel again. We could have stayed in the Steigenberger Airport Hotel by the time we paid for our room plus taxi and breakfast. My husband did finally pay for the breakfast before we left. We were both very upset by these fraudulent practices.", "Date": "Jun 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR277472682", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "MinnieMadison"}, {"Content": "does not live up to expectations stayed recently at the hotel May 15 through 20- 2006, and while the rooms are very clean and nice, the hotel did not live up to expectations. The telephones did not work, and there is no on site laundry service. In fact any laundry sent out takes days and days to get back. The hotel does offer a very nice morning meal but the restaurant is dead in the evening, you are better off looking elsewhere for an evening meal. True the location of the hotel is off the beaten path in a very quiet neighborhood, you end up walking some distance to the nearest train and it is nearly 20-minutes by train to the main station. The hotel is nice but the service was poor. The front desk staff are of little help when it came to problems.

We managed to get two rooms for the price of one, so try to get a deal.I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for something that is modern, clean and comfortable.
