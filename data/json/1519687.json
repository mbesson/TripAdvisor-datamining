Also very close to Roma National Museum and other attractions. The building is pretty old & there is not a big sign of the hotel name.(There are 5 different hotels in the building,1 on each floor).The most noticeable sign from afar is for hotel Argentina (which is a floor down from Marcantonio.) The entrance of the building doesn't look inviting, however the hotel was better than what expected.(As the it seems to be renovated recently). The elevator is old, slow & small. Our room was not something special, dark with a view of some tunnel or so( but at least quiet), fair cleanness, poor lighting. Bed was small for someone taller than 190cm. Mini bar/Fridge was completely empty & not working. We told them & they said yes, it should be repaired! (while we were staying just one night & it should be checked before our arrival). The bathroom was tiny especially the hand basin, but clean. WiFi signal was poor in the room. In room breakfast was fairly basic & didn't delivered on our desired time. The staff tried to be helpful but not enough. Price was a bit expensive for their service. Totally Marcantonio hotel is Ok for 1-2 nights.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wirral", "Title": "\u201cgreat value and central\u201d", "Author": "sltWirral", "ReviewID": "UR118928623", "Content": "We stayed just one night before a cruise so the location was our main reason for choosing this hotel (and the price!!).

Staff were warm, friendly, spoke little English but went out of their way to assist and try to answer questions. Great hotel to base day trips in Rome, several small restaurants near by with excellent food. Continental breakfast provided was packaged sweet roll, melba toast, juice box and expresso.

The location's OK - a 15 minute stroll to the Colosseum, a 50 minute stroll to the Vatican (whilst passing sights). The staff don't speak too much English, but they try very hard and are very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast is brought to your room in the evening and is, in comparison to other hotels, poor - but you cannot expect a three-course breakfast for such a price. There's a fairly-sized minifridge in the room, a supermarket less than ten minutes' walk away (for the chocolate addicts!), and plenty of restaurants/bars in the vicinity to suit everyone's need. There's also a vending machine and coffee/tea machine in the reception area - the coffee/tea machine is free between 07.30 and 10.30 to allow you to get your fix with your breakfast. The hotel is on the 5th floor of a building with other hotels/residential apartments, but that was OK for us. It's non-smoking, however, they do accommodate smokers: if you want a cigarette, you just go outside of the doors (on the same floor - you don't have to go on the street 5 floors below!) and enjoy your smoke. Personally (as a smoker), I think it's a good thing the hotel is non-smoking and you have to go outside of the actual rooms to smoke: I wouldn't want some idiot setting his bed alight after too many beers! Thankfully, there are also smoke detectors in every room. The bathroom is a bit small, but clean and good enough. You don't exactly have to wiggle past the shower to get to the sink: unless you weigh 600 pounds, you'll manage! The rooms themselves are a decent size, too, and so is the double bed. The only downside is the traffic on Via Cavour: even on the 5th floor, you can hear the infamous Roman traffic speeding up, screeching their brakes, and honking. But I guess that any Roman hotel has this exact same problem, unless they're located well outside of the centre! This hotel simply must be one of the best budget choices: it's very good for the price you pay, quite centrally located, the staff are great, and you can sleep and wash there (and keep your biscuits nicely refridgerated). All in all, we were very happy we chose this hotel. There are other hotels which are nothing more than a floor in a shared building that charge a lot more - but they do really offer more? At the end of the day (literally), you need a place to sleep and wash, and Marcantonio is exactly that at a fair price. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. You're out all day seeing stuff anyway, why pay 500 euros when you can pay 250 for a place to rest?", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marcantonio Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1519687-Reviews-Marcantonio_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$69 - $264*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Cavour 47</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00184</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1519687", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/eb/2e/d8/getlstd-property-photo.jpg"}}
