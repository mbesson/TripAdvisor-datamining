I have to wonder. Cell phone signal was poor to non-existent if you have Tmobile; AT&T was fine. The showers.... WAO! Seriously, it was either freezing cold or boiling HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT Consistently switching from one extreme to the other... Not enjoyable at all. BTW, the water regulator does not help. It would have been nice, or perfect if the rooms had a mini-fridge; but I purchased a cooler and kept my drinks and snacks cold. The sofa-bed was old, dusty, not comfortable at all. Now for the good stuff: the rooms were clean, beds were very comfortable, the rooms were spacious, the staff~ very friendly. The pool was very nice, private, the water's temperature was right, I felt at home :) My kids loved it. Business wise... the post office is across the street. There's also a dry cleaners nearby. The location was perfect, in the middle of el Condado. Great restaurants within walking distances. Lots of places to shop, the beach is walking distance too.

When we first checked in I noticed they were telling 2 other couples that they had overbooked and couldn't place them in a room. They then proceeded to get them a taxi and take care of paying for their rooms at another hotel down the street! Come to find out they were relocating some of the guests who weren't part of our party so that we could all stay together. Apparently we took up most of the hotel rooms. I thought that was very nice of them to ensure that none of our group got seperated and even tho they inconvienenced the others, they more than made up for it by paying for their new accomodations. When we entered our room I was quite surprised at how amazingly comfortable the beds looked. Unfortunately I can't give any feedback on them because I was designated to the pull out couch (which wasn't too bad). But I heard they were super comfy. The room was very clean and accomodated all 6 of us and our mounds and mounds of luggage nicely. The staff was super helpful in helping us find great spots to get a few drinks and some good eats! Even after our long night of delicioso margaritas at the bar behind the hotel the staff let us use the pool after hours. When one of my friends slipped and cut her leg the staff was more than helpful in providing first aid and making sure she was ok. They gave us directions to the nearest walgreens for some extra bandages and ice packs. The next day they let us store our luggage for the time between checkout and boarding the cruise ship while we explored the area. The only complaints I have about this place were the shower didn't have a warm temp...you either had really hot or really cold, the hot tub by the pool wasn't warm it was the same temp as the pool and the rooms don't really have any views except for the houses and businesses next door. Our group had a variety of ages from 18-70 & everyone loved their experience. I wouldn't suggest the area for children as it has more of a party atmosphere then a family one.

The overall furniture was really really bad. The bathroom counter was particle board that had bad warping and separation and a miserable caulk job around the sink -- looked ready to be thrown out. I used tripadvisor to research this hotel, and I was a bit taken aback by how much shabbier the room was versus the photos I saw. The room was small and it had no view. The walls looked discolored. There is no lobby, this isn't even a \"boutique\" hotel as much as it almost feels like a pension bordering on hostel. The breakfast -- there isn't any. They do offer a muffin, but it's the kind of prepackaged long-shelf life muffin you'd get at a gas station. Now having said that, I will move on to the positives: The bed was absolutely comfortable and I slept very well. The linens smelled clean and were not dirty as some other people cautioned. The air conditioning, while a loud wall unit, did drown out street noise. I found the staff to be very friendly and super helpful, and their pool, while very small, was refreshing an in a nice, quiet courtyard. I hate dinging nice people, and I want to stress again I had very positive experiences with the staff, and the room was clean. But I simply felt that FOR WHAT I PAID (and I did book this through Delta vacations) I did not receive the value I was expecting. I feel that if I spent a little bit more money I could have stayed in a much more comfortable hotel with far more services. The simple matter is, Le Consulat is a one star hotel. And if they marketed themselves as a one star hotel, I wouldn't have been as surprised and probably more accommodating in my overall perception.

We were in room 106 at the rear of the hotel. The hotel is located within walking distance of many restaurants, a Walgreens a mom and pop grocery store, high end shopping as well as your run of the mill souvenir shops. The beach in Condado is about a 3 or 4 block walk. The room/bathroom, common areas (including the pool and hallways) and the patio area we chose with our room were all clean. I appreciated the fact they provided me with a muffin, coffee and orange juice in the morning because I expected nothing where that was concerned. I appreciated the fact that when we showed up 3 hrs prior to check in that we could leave our heavy bags and found them in our room when we properly checked in. They were also curteous enough to hold our bags after we checked out so we could enjoy more time before our afternoonflight home. I have gotten smart enough to bring ear plugs with me for sleeping purposes because no one can control if your neighbor wakes/keeps you up if you are a light/medium sleeper like me.

(We were on our way to Vieques for 2 weeks and this was the first time in 4 trips we had decided to try the ferry vs. island hopper planes.) LeConsulat is a funky mid-60s kind of place, in a neighborhood that seems to be getting rejuvenated. I was ready for a major disappointment, but --surprise to me from my husband!-- there was a lovely private patio outside of our room with two chaises and a little table and palm fronds providing shade! However, the only window was a tiny one in the bathroom, so getting natural light was tricky as there's no screen on the door. Without the patio, my claustrophobia would have kicked in: very small room, but big enough for our purposes for one night. We were in the very first room off the tiny lobby. We had no problems with noise (maybe we were just too tired!), even though the younger crowd (20s-30s) started going out for the evening at about 10:00PM. We never heard anyone come back in. Also, there seemed to be a jump-up (Friday night party with loud music, like in St. Lucia) nearby, but it was no bother. When in Vieques, we use 95% DEET -- and still get bites. (95% is not a typo!) Mosquitoes were really no problem at LeConsulat. I think I just rubbed a sheet of Bounce fabric softener on exposed skin for the evening. LeConsulat reminded me of a place I've stayed several times on Gov. Nichols Avenue near Burgundy Street, in New Orleans. It looks like nothing from the outside, but there's a courtyard at the rear with a small swimming pool, including a little waterfall. We considered using it, but it didn't seem all that clean: apparently, it had rained at some point, and there were leaves and insects in the pool (not a lot, but enough to make it less than enticing). Between the communal patio, French and louvered doors and being on the outskirts of where it's all \"really happening\", it reminded me of the outskirts of the French Quarter. My husband reconnoitered the neighborhood (he didn't listen to me, failing to bring any sandals and was already regretting it), while I hung out and read on the patio. It had been a long trip from Chicago and my sprained ankle and bad back were not happy. He checked out the beach and liked it, but said it's not like Vieques (well, nothing is) nor the beach in our town on Lake Michigan, and found some boutiques and a Walgreen's, at which he bought his sandals. He would've been up for going to the beach if I wanted to, but I was just too enervated after a long day traveling from Chicagoland, with my maladies. I just wanted to chill out and get into the \"island mode.\" We are talking November in Chicago, and a way-too-cool summer. By the way, the art is most unique, such as a screen print of a handgun on the bathroom wall. Someone obviously picked out interesting pieces one by one, vs. \"regular\" hotel art that's all the same and bland. Upon our asking, the young man at the desk recommended the restaurant next door, Puerto Peru. OK, this is one of the very best restaurants ever, anywhere! It had been open only a month and the emphasis is on foods from Lima. I've had other Peurvian food and it was nothing like this. We ate outside on the lovely, comfortable deck with a view of the street and the other restaurants nearby: they were very crowded and loud, and there was a major police car presence, i.e., lots of police cars driving by with their lights flashing. Nothing really opens or gets going before 8:00PM, and we were ready for dinner at about 6:30PM. (Yes, that's remarkably early, but all we'd eaten all day had been over-priced airport junk and some stuff we had brought with us.) We had certainly made the right choice: the owner/our server recommended the ceviche as an appetizer and I wrinkled my nose. He said, \"Oh, everyone says that until they try it. This is Lima-style.\" Well, my fish and seafood-hating husband ate way more than half! It was fabulous! After the ceviche and drinks, I signaled the owner: he thought we wanted our bill. No way! We wanted to order entrees. I had some kind of shrimp dish and my husband had some kind of chicken and we were each delighted! It was so gorgeous out, we decided to walk around the block before returning to LeConsulat. Big mistake: this must be one of the longest, biggest blocks anywhere! It's essentially a residential neighborhood with businesses on this block (well, 3 sides of it) and the block behind LeConsulat, across the street, closer to the beach. The side with LeConsulat is the \"happening\" side, with resturants, clubs and some stores. Then it gets \"interesting\" on the side behind LeConsulat: older (50+) women and young boys \"working the street\" -- quite blatantly. Funky (in a nasty way) bars and tee shirt shops, knick-knack stores with a couple of tatoo parlors and a designer boutique that actually looks expensive occupy that side. (All but the tatoo parlors and bars were closed by that time of the evening.) The fourth side is residential and construction. By then, my back and ankle had had it and making it back the long third side of the block and down the block to the LeConsulat (both residential) was torture: didn't think I'd make it, but no other choice. However, if you're in decent physical condition, this should be a snap! When we go Vieques next time, if we have to spend the night in San Juan, I'd consider it.

Our room had a flat screen TV against the wall opposite the bed (17 channels of basic cable, 4 of them spanish, the rest in english), a desk (with a lamp) a rolling office chair, an overstuffed easy chair (not a recliner though), and two end tables (one with a lamp). The floors were tile, and mopped daily by the maid. The only trouble we had with the room was that the first night we were there they had forgotten to give us wash cloths with our towels, but a quick trip to the desk solved that. Service was excellent, and the desk clerks (all of them) were extremely helpful in giving us directions and maps. they have a very small pool in the back of the hotel, but it is only big enough for a family or two, and we never did use it - with several incredible beaches within two blocks, it seemed kind of silly to go sit in the pool! The location is excellent, between Ashford and Magdelena streets (a half block before they come together on their west end), with plenty of restaurants, stores and the beach within a block or two of the hotel. There is a Walgreens a half block away, around the corner, and a 24 hour mini-mart diagonally across the street by the post office. Parking is available for hotel guests for a small fee (I paid $5 for the entire week we were there). The lot is behind the hotel, and you must walk about a half block around the corner to get to it from the hotel - but it's an easy walk and well lit. The lot is secure and well guarded at all times. There is a bus stop right around the corner ($0.75 per person to travel to/from Old San Juan), and a taxi stand that always has a few taxis waiting (day or night). All in all, this was a great little hotel for us to stay at while we ran around exploring Puerto Rico.

They literally picked up our dirty, sandy towels off the floor and folded them up and put them back on the towel rack. That is just unacceptable to me.

Travelers included me, my wife, and 6 1/2 year old twins. We were looking for a good, solid, clean place to hang our hats while enjoying everything that San Juan and the surrounding area has to offer. We chose Le Consulat based on it's location in Condado near the beach, its affiliation with Choice International, the reviews we read on Trip Advisor, and the price. When we travel we look for hotels that offer a great value since we spend very little time there outside of sleeping. The room we stayed in could have slept six, which makes it an every better value. For $135/night we received: *two comfortable queen beds, *a spacious sitting area with a pull-out sofa, *a large shower (no bathtub), *a large closet adjacent to a desk/work area, *a new 42\" Vizio LCD TV, *a large private patio (the only one in the hotel), *close proximity to the pool, which was never used, *a great location in the heart of Condado near numerous restaurants, nightlife, beach, post office, highway access, *free parking one block away in a 24-hour valet-attended lot, and *free daily breakfast vouchers for everyone in the room at a local bakery. Service The service was great. The staff was very attentive and helpful with local recommendations, especially when we had to take our son to the Ashford Hospital to treat his pink eye infection. The Room Room 108 is the best value in the entire hotel due to it's size, spaciousness, and private patio. The room was clean, but not fancy. The shower and bathroom were a bit dated, and the hot/cold water was a challenge, but we did not complain. The room has two windows and the sleeping area is somewhat separate from the bathroom area. The only drawback about the patio was the late night noises that crept through the metal non-insulated door. We only had a problem one night when a local dance party woke us up. Otherwise, the sounds of the coqui \"tree frogs\" might annoy some people. Location and Amenities The hotel location cannot be beaten. It's literally two blocks from the beach, a Walgreens/grocery, numerous high-end restaurants, and easy access to the highway. Parking and breakfast are included, which cuts down on costs significantly. Several people complained about the breakfast (more European/lighter fare than American), which we thought was adequate to get our days started. The vouchers allow you a choice of drink (juice or coffee), and a choice of pastry, ham/cheese croquette, or oatmeal. We supplemented the free choices with eggs & toast one day and pancakes on another for $5 each. The bakery is frequented daily by locals who convene to laugh, joke, and enjoy the good coffee and companionship with one another. A few of them chatted with us after recognizing that we had been visiting their morning gathering place for a few days in a row. Suggested Improvements We would recommend soundproofing the patio door in room 108, which would create a better sleeping experience. We would also suggest that the staff test the water heaters/pumps in each room prior to each guest's arrival. The shower temperature often fluctuated between very hot and very cold every few minutes. Travelers Who Should Stay at This Hotel Stay here if you are seeking a great value without the over-the-top Ritz-like service and amenities. If you are looking to simply use your hotel as a place to rest and sleep and you want great value, Le Consulat is the place for you. If you want a big resort-like feel with extravagant surroundings and amenities, then you might consider La Concha a block away.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cDo NOT stay here, unless you don't mind roaches and loud noise at night.\u201d", "Author": "amyn13", "ReviewID": "UR55017757", "Content": "The hotel looks cute from the outside, but the rooms are not clean- there was hair all over the shower, the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty and some were broken.

She gave us a new room that was again dirty, but fine enough to spend our last night. The only good things I can say about the hotel are that the one woman is very friendly and gave us directions to the bus and nearby restaurants. She also called taxis for us. Each morning, you get a voucher for a coffee and tiny pastry at a cafe up the street.

The lady that was at the reception was really nice, but run down. She said she had already been there for 8 hours- we got there at 12 pm! In any case, our room was not ready, and I also wanted to have a room in the back of the hotel and not on the first floor to avoid any \"noises\" as others had mentioned. We got a room on the third floor in the middle of the hotel instead. It looks more like an apartment building from the inside... The room- it smelled when we got there, like some cleaner that was used to clean the room. We tried to open the windows, but then bugs were flying in, so we had to close them. Luckily, I had a body spray, that doubled as an air spray (for us anyway), and it helped. Sheets were all stained, as were the towels. The shower was not clean....both my boyfriend and I wore flip flops to take showers. The shelf in the shower was rusted, as was the toilet paper holder....so i actually used a hanger to hang my loofah! We didn't use the closet because as we were looking around the room, and I opened the closet door, it became unhinged! Yikes! Also didn't use the safe, as they charge for it?? and it didn't seem very safe. We were there for only 1 night, but I didn't realize how bad it was. The air conditioner was very noisy all night, and there were pipes in the wall or something, and were very loud, and would go off. It sounded like someone next door was taking a shower, but they might have been pipes to go up to the 4th floor? Also, we didn't get any breakfast vouchers as others had mentioned, and when we asked, they didn't have towels for the beach! Odd, since the website says they have an outdoor pool!!

Nice! This was Room #314 and we liked it very much. The final night was in #310, which was still nice but definitely smaller. Regarding previous postings about noise, we had no problems with noise on the third floor. Also, the hotel is located on more of a side street which reduces overall noise. Pool was a huge plus for our young daughter -- it is a small pool but nice and clean. I felt very comfortable walking around the area at night -- going to Walgreens or nearby Internet cafe. My wife did not feel comfortable alone, however. The breakfast at a local restaurant is good, though we always supplemented it with additional food -- was still a good deal. As other posters have mentioned, staff was very good and helpful. If the staff is inviting friends to hang out in the evenings, as noted in previous reviews, I hope that stops. We did not notice anything like that, however. Parking is do-able, but you may have to search nearby streets for a space.

Taxis are crazy expensive on the island (what else is new in the Caribbean)? The staff was moderately friendly (some much better than others) and housekeeping was fairly attentive. Nothing special, but worth the price. The beach was right around the corner, along with a Walgreen's that we visited several times.

You can get danish, pastry, 2 croquettes or 2 pasties, a bowl of oatmeal, or toast with butter. And you can have coffee, juice, water, or hot chocolate. And they have more you can buy.

This is a very small, very basic hotel, that only has a bed, night stands, TV and one chair. No dresser, no mirrors except the one in the bathroom and a large close up mirror in the bathroom that was rusty. Very disorganized on check out mornings on weekends before a cruise, and when cruisers are returning post cruise. Check out time is 11AM and they would not give an extension for another hour, so you have everyone in an 8 ft. x 8 ft. lobby trying to check out and those coming from a cruise trying to check in all at the same time, and luggage everywhere and no secure place to store it. On the return post cruise, we arrived at 10:30AM and no rooms are available until 3pm. They opened a room for everyone to store their luggage but it was not secure, and my husband ended up having to carry a HUGE camera bag and all of his camera equipment around with him into Old San Juan because of not having a secure storage place. It is very convenient to get the bus for 75 cents into Old San Juan. Make sure you have coins only. Wendy's and Walgreens right around the corner, and staff was helpful. When taking taxis from the hotel to the port and from the hotel to the airport, the hotel staff called the taxis for us and they were prompt; however, since the rates were not regulated by the taxi stands and we were not given a paper with the written price, both taxi drivers charged $5 to $8 more from the start as they made up their prices as they went along, so be prepared.....many taxi drivers did not know the location of the hotel, but just tell them on Magdelena Ave, right around the corner from La Concha hotel. I agree with a previous post that the rates should be in the $80 price range for such a basic hotel. Two small plastic cups provided in the room and ice located only on the first floor. Not many amenities and we skipped the \"breakfast\" because of the bad reviews it received. I would stay at this hotel again since it seems to have a good price for the location. It would be a lot better if they allowed for a 12 Noon or 1PM check out and at least have a secure place for luggage to be stored when coming or going. I would recommend the hotel only if you know in advance and are OK with a place that is VERY small and VERY, VERY basic. Another note: the designer stores in the area on Ashford Avenue such as Louis Vuitton, Cartier, etc. are all closed on Sundays. The shops in Old San Juan are open from 11AM to 5PM on Sundays.

They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have sufficient cleaning people to keep up with the ridiculous demand. What I have discovered is San Juan, Condado area is a port city clearinghouse for cruise ship travelers and therefore makes it very demanding on hotel personnel to continue to rotate people in and out of rooms everyday for God sake. If they can somehow, get better cleaning staff, a place to store luggage, electrical outlets in the lobby for people who must wait four (4) hours for their room to be ready, and if they can change their check out time to 12:00 instead of 11:00 a.m. which is way too early, and if they can dump their \"so call\" breakfast provider who provide that ??? continental breakfast which is horrible, and if they can do a great job scrubbing the floors, and the bathroom shower floors and walls well because of all the traffic in and out and in and out and in out of there and if they can do a better job of quality control on laudry, towels ect\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they will be and do just fine.
