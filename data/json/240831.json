Having lived in Rome previously we were familiar with the area and it was just as we remembered it. The hotel was on a reasonably quiet street and is only a short walk to the ruins. We had a room on the fourth floor with a view out onto the street, at the end of which was the Colosseum! The rooms were really quite charming, with flocked wallpaper and comfy beds. Yes, the bins do get emptied quite early in the morning, but we only heard it because we had the windows open. The windows, when shut, were well double-glazed, meaning that there was not a lot of noise for a city centre location. The staff were lovely and very welcoming, arranging a taxi for the airport for our return home and very willing to offer recommendations for restaurants if you needed them. There were plenty of little grocery stores and shops on the street, so you were never short of a gelato or two. The mini bar in the hotel room was also very reasonably priced with room to put your own bits and bobs that you wanted to keep cool. Breakfast (served from 7am - 10am) offered a range of croissants, pastries, bread, cereal and the continental style selection of cheese and ham. By far the best part was the cappucinos prepared for you on request. In all, there is going to be something for everyone and the atmosphere of the breakfast room was really lovely on the sunny mornings. Not far down the street was the Forno de' Serpenti, a little bakery that offered a fantastic range of pastries, treats, bread and sandwiches and is absolutely worth a visit. Everything is paid for by weight, so it's really good value to grab a few things before venturing off into the city, particularly as you will pay a real premium for snacks in the area around the Forum and the Via del Corso. A small drinking water fountain can also be found on the street, so it's easy to fill up your water bottles. The Cavour metro stop was only a short walk away. We had an absolutely lovely stay. The only reason we could not give a full five star review is because we thought that the hotel could do with some new bath towels - a few of ours being quite extensively ripped when we came to use them - but this really should not over shadow just how wonderful this little hotel is for a stay in Rome. We would be very happy to return in future and, having stayed in several 4* hotels in the city, I would quite happily choose this hotel over them purely for the better value Hotel Apollo offers for a stay in the city.

We (my two teenage kids and I) stayed at the Apollo hotel for 3 nights at the end of June. We chose the Apollo based on TA reviews, location, and relative price (what we assumed we had to pay for a 3-star Rome hotel in June). The good: The Apollo is close to the train station (15 minute walk) and the Colosseum (5 minute walk). It's located on a side street off of Via Cavour and Vai Nazionale, and is a short walk from the Forum. Pantheon, and Trastevere. The hotel itself is well maintained, and provides a nice continental breakfast in a fairly large sitting area on the top floor. The not so good: Our triple room was expensive, over $300 a night for a room that was (1) small (about 180 square feet) and somewhat darkly lit (2) poorly air conditioned (the air conditioning turned itself off every night such that you woke up sweltering), (3) did not have free wi-fi (we ended up paying 30 euros for 6 tickets that gave us 3 hours internet access per ticket). (4) had a staff that was neither very fluent in Englich nor very friendly (they never asked us how they could help in our stay) (5) had a very small bathroom (30 square feet) (6) had a small 22\" flat screen TV Again, I'm basing my lukewarm review on the fact that we went on to stay in much nicer, cheaper hotels in Florence and Venice. If the Apollo is typical for this price for a 3-star hotel in Rome, take that into account while reading this review.

Those are the only 2 negative things I can say. The rooms were, by european standards, a decent size. It was close to the things we wanted to see most. There was in internet cafe just a few doors down as well as several small cafes. We tried several and they were all good. Just don't bother making a special request. I did. I didn't get the \"away from the main street\" room I asked for. Though it was nice, being a small hotel, there were only 5 rooms per floor. Almost no hallway noise.

It's located in a safe area on a narrow street within walking distance to most of the major historical sites you'll want to see if you're on your first trip to Rome, there for a short time or both. Termini is a walkable distance away, we got off route because of having to avoid a very large public protest crowd and walked all around, street signs are not on every corner and sometimes names change or don't appear on the map. Later that pm after we'd had time to recharge, we couldn't believe how much out of way we'd acutally wallked I don't speak any Italian and the few people we met at the hotel didn't speak English. We were fortunate to meet up with the evening deskclerk who was able to offer suggestions and help in our language. .The language barrier generally was not an issue, everyone was polite and pleasant. There's an new 2 person + luggage lift. Don't expect a large room however it was clean, comfortable and adaquate for our 2 night stay pre- cruising. Speaking of cruising, the Port is approx 1-1/2 hr drive from Rome. I must mention a very effecient English speaking hotel desk employee kindly arranged for a taxi to pick us up @ the hotel and drive us to the Port, ( it was a eye-opening journey, the driver drove like a race-car driver, the car was a lovelynew BMW & he had us there in 45 min. The desk employee compared a Taxi fare to taking the train considering train fares & taxi's to from station it was only a few more $$. The convenience and excitment couldn't have been topped. Getting back to the room, the bathroom seemed relatively newer, it's white tile, bright & clean. Don't be expecting the fluffy terrycloth towels or an abundance of soaps as we've grown used in N.A., however we had what we needed and it was perfect. It has european power so bring along a converter. The roof-top breafast dining area is pleasant and you'll find enough good food and beverages to get you started on your day. They were kind enough to let us in before opening on the morning of our departure and this was appreciated. Our helpful deskclerk, in addition to arranging our transfer, also advised and arranged our St Peters & Vatican tour which we never thought we'd be able to do.

The room was clean, comfortable, and very quiet - the only noise was nightly trash collection. The area that the hotel is in is clean and it is quiet at night. We walked around and always felt safe. Breakfast was served at the quaint rooftop terrace with a personally made delicious cup of cappucino. Breakfast buffet consisted of juices, cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit, sweet rolls, cakes, breads, butter, jams, ham and cheese. The breakfast was tasty and filling and the atmosphere relaxing and not rushed - a great way to tool up for a full-speed-ahead day touring Rome. This hotel is very well located within walking distances to many of the central historical areas of the city - recommend good sturdy walking shoes. There is a very nice family-run small restaurant just a few doors from the hotel called \"The DoDo\". We enjoyed dinner there several nights. The restaurant is sparkling clean and tastefully decorated with polite staff, very tasty food, and fantastic tiramasu. In all, we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at The Apollo Hotel and we would highly recommend this charming hotel to friends and family. We definitely hope to return to the Apollo again!

Was still concerned when we pulled up to the hotel. We had booked the triple room, but when we arrived, we were in room 502 or 504 in the adjoining building, which was a huge double with a king bed, couch and very large bath. Looked a lot nicer than the photos of the triple we had seen, so we were happy. It looked like it had been recently renovated (there was still plastic on one of the chair cushions). The bath had only a shower stall (looked new) but that was fine with us; though it's a bit of a tight fit, and neither of us is a large person. There was a built in ledge stool in the shower, which made it yet harder to move around in the shower. We had read about the towels - not plush terry, but thin like large dishtowels, but nevertheless quite absorbent. The breakfast buffet is a nice option, nice way to start a long day of touristing about - frees you up from having to find a place to go, good selection, cappuccinos are great. The family that owns/runs this hotel is extremely nice and seem to truly care that their guests enjoy their stay. The location is very convenient, the neighborhood is okay. Seems perfectly safe, with some cute restaurants and shops along the street, but not upscale by any means. On the second part of our trip we returned to Rome and stayed at another hotel near the Borghese Gardens and Spanish Steps, which is a nicer area and the hotel was more upscale. That room was also very nice, though smaller and notably more expensive and not as convenient to the Metro. So think it depends on what you will be doing during your trip - if first time/visiting a lot of tourist sites, the Apollo is a great option - inexpensive, walking distance to many sites, near 2 metro stops to get to other areas easily, clean, nice ownership.

We just needed a clean and central place to stay for our short time in Rome. We loved that you could just walk outside the front doors and the Colloseum was right there - beautiful! Check-in: We pre-paid our hotel stay through Expedia and check-in was quick and the staff were very friendly. The room: CLEAN! I work at a non-profit that has an Emergency Shelter so I'm very aware and on alert for bed bugs (a current epidemic in the states), and I'm very happy to say that there were no bugs of any sort in my room. The room was actually a lot bigger than expected considering European standards. It was very clean and the bathroom worked for two of us. We didn't need anything extravagent, just a clean place to lay our tired bums after days of sightseeing and for much-needed siestas! So the room definitely met our needs. The complimentary breakfast: OMG :) Much better than anything you'd find at a comparable hotel in the states. The breakfast included fresh deli meats, sweet breads, fresh fruit of a wide variety, a couple of juice and cereal choices, and best of all, any espresso-made drink your heart desired! We enjoyed mochas and cappucino's every morning. AND the breakfast buffet is located at the top of the building with a charming outdoor patio to cool off in the warm summer mornings we had there. Since this was my first visit to Europe, I'm not sure if this type of breakfast spread is the norm, but we had stayed in a couple cities in the suburbs of London, in Paris, in Venice, and in Lake Como...and only at this hotel and the Hotel Villa Marie (in Lake Como) did we have such a nice breakfast spread. Location: I found the location to be really good considering the price of the hotel. We were just a few blocks from the train station, from the Colloseum, the Trevi Fountain, and from the Piazza Navona. One night it only took us 30 mins to walk across the river to the Trastevere neighborhood. Also nearby were great little restaurants and a small wine/mini-mart-style shop (where we were able to pick up beer, wine, and snacks). Overall: I think this hotel is a great bargain for the quality and location. Also, our last day in Rome, our flight wasn't until 8pm at night, so the hotel kindly kept our luggage all day after check-out so we could sightsee without lugging everything around with us.

The family room in next door building does have two rooms but are rented/charged separately. Despite prior agreement we had to pay totally extra for the the additional room. The apartment is in 3rd floor of adjacent narrow residential building and can get lift from first floor and will have to come down one flight of stairs to get into the room! The stairs are remarkably narrow with acute bend and certainly not easy to manipulate suitcases or prams around. Shower is absolutely terrible remember to keep it running for about 15 minutes to get warm water from this tacky looking shower. Both bedside table lamps in our rooms were faulty. What`s the point of a large room where the only place you can sit is your bed! There is an apparent bar which is does not function (speacifically asked at the reception), probably it is there just to dodge the star raters.

We paid almost exactly the same amount per night for each of the four hotels, and all were selected because they were pretty highly rated on TripAdvisor and appeared to be in convenient, central locations. Positives: 1. We were able to walk to the Apollo from the train station. 2. Breakfast was good, and the rooftop setting was nice, 3. The hotel was clean. 4. Our room was quiet, perhaps because I requested a quiet location and we faced the back rather than the street. Negatives: 1. Very low level of service. Although we do plenty of research before traveling, we also like to get suggestions from hotel staff about how to get around town, where to eat, etc. Furthermore, there are inevitably questions and problems which come up once you are in a foreign country, and at that point you are dependent on local input, which usually means the hotel. In this case, I had emailed the Apollo ahead of time with some questions; I usually didn't hear back, and if I wrote again, they would simply say \"we'll help when you get here\" (even when I asked about reservations for popular attractions which clearly require advance planning). All of the other hotels answered emails promptly, provided useful info, and were happy to make arrangements for us. Things didn't improve once we got to Rome: For our entire 4-day stay, the only person on duty all day was an older gentleman who barely spoke English and responded to all requests by saying either that he didn't understand or that we had to take care of it ourselves. Not only did this make things harder for us in Rome, but it was vastly different than the experiences we had with the other three hotels. 2. The room was small and dark. 3. The water pressure was VERY low, and the bath towels were embarrassingly bad - they were normal in size but were so thin that they could better be described as very large dinner napkins. 4. The location and neighborhood were OK but not great. The hotel is, indeed, close to the Colosseum and the Ancient Rome area.

The room was dark (the one window let in very little natural light). The hotel appeared to be familly-run, and we also experienced the pushiness of the staff. You have to leave your room key at the front desk whenever you exit the hotel which required interaction with the staff.

It was one of the many small quality restaurants in Italy where you can eat plenty for dinner (with wine) for less than $50 for two. And we never found a restaurant in Italy that wasn't perfectly happy to let us share a serving of food. The worst part about the Apollo Hotel was the location. Although it was fairly convenient to the metro (the best way to get around the city), the neighborhood seemed seedy and run-down. The streets were very crowded and many were under repair, and there seemed to be several local gatherings of men blocking the sidewalks. We also stayed in a hotel by the Barberini fountain and metro stop, and the location was very different. It felt quaint and friendly compared to this hotel. As for the walk to the Termini, it all depends on time of day. If you are walking there early in the morning, it is a breeze. If you are trying to get there in the late afternoon, you will have a much harder time trying to negotiate the sidewalks and getting across the ever-busy streets.

Its central location makes it easy to walk to most of the major spots, including the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Spanish Steps and more. It\u2019s a fairly basic no-frills hotel, but it\u2019s comfortable and clean. We were in room 404 which doesn\u2019t face via de Serpenti and was very quiet at night. My only complaint with our room was the bathroom. The shower was so, so teeny. It was nearly impossible to move at all while in it, and I\u2019m a normal-size person! There wasn\u2019t an exhaust fan, either, so it took forever to de-steam after showering. Also, the \u201ctowels\u201d were a bit odd, in that they were extremely thin (like a dish towel, literally). The staff was pleasant. We got a lot of great tips on where to shop, where to go for nightlife and just answers to general questions from Alessandro, who is very helpful and there in the evenings. Complimentary breakfast was included in our rate and it\u2019s served on a cozy shaded patio on the 5th floor. The selection was good (pastries, breads, meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal, etc.) and the cappuccinos were of course delicious. There\u2019s also a small bar adjacent to reception, but unfortunately it was never open during our stay. It would\u2019ve been nice for a casual drink after a long day of sightseeing. There\u2019s also a computer with internet access in the bar area, and the rates are reasonable (I think 2\u20ac or 3\u20ac for an hour). The best part, though, was the location. There\u2019s a cute little square just down the block with a few cafes/restaurants that we went to for a drink everyday after sightseeing. There\u2019s also a fantastic restaurant in the square, Gli Angeletti, which we liked so much that we ate there twice during our stay. Definitely give it a try. There are also a few nearby delis and gelato shops in the area are plentiful! It\u2019s also a cheap cab ride to Trastevere, a fun area with loads of restaurants right on the river.

And walking distance to the Coliseum/Forum and Trevi Fountain. The staff always made us feel welcome and communication was not a problem. As another reviewer pointed out the immediate neighborhood is quiet and not touristy.

A lot has been written about the various tour groups that take you around the Colosseum, Angel tours beating the queues etc but I did not really see any evidence of this as all the tour groups had to join an equally long tour queue to get in. We did the Official Colosseum tour (go to the left past the tour groups queue) and buy your tickets from the ticket booth which where 50% cheaper than other unofficial tour group prices. You get a one hour guided tour with a very knowledgeable tour guide and the option to spend as much time in the Colosseum as you want, the ticket also covered the price of entrance into the Parthenon which is close by.

I must say though, that the shower was a bit on the small side. We had a lovely view from the window (if you poked your head out and looked left!) of the Collosseum. Unfortuately the owners didn't speak much English, but the staff had a much better grasp of it, and everyone was very friendly. The rooftop terrace where breakfast was served was lovely, and there was a good mixture of continental offerings i.e. bread rolls, cheese, ham, cereal, yoghurt, fruit, pastries etc (what you would expect from a European hotel). The only thing my boyfriend and I were a little disappointed about was the fact that it was a little too quiet for us in the surrounding area. There were lots of little cafes, and restaurants down the side streets, but no nightlife at all, so if you are looking for a lively area, do not stay here! Overall though it was a perfect break, and I would definitely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cCannot be faulted - Perfect hotel!\u201d", "Author": "carginman", "ReviewID": "UR5788920", "Content": "This hotel is a gem.

The room was very comfortable thanks to the well controlled air-con. In terms of location, its hard to imagine any better. A 5 min walk along the via Nationale from the metro stop meant that any city location was at most 10 mins away! A dozen doors up the street and we found a lovely restaurant and a dozen doors down the street a large ice cream parlour! It cost us just 105 euro a night, and for the quality of the stay they could easily charge double.

When you look down on window you can see the great Colosseum at the end of the street. The rooms are big ad comfortable and have good bathrooms (Which they clean daily). The second thing is the staff is greast. They dont know English that much but they're really friendly and helpful people. They made our trip even more joyful. So, thanks to all of them.

Most who stayed in the hotel seemed to be Italians on vacation. After booking the hotel through an online booking site, I called both the booking site and the hotel directly to confirm that they would have a crib for my son. Despite assurances otherwise, upon arrival, I found that the hotel had no cribs. To their credit, the owners offered us a single room for my mother for a reduced rate, so that I could sleep with my baby in the full size bed in the double room. They definitely went out of their way to make the situation right.

The Apollo was a very pleasant surprise. The location is truly central, in sight of the Colosseum and just behind the Bank of Italy. We spent 3 days exploring Rome from the Colosseum to the Spanish Steps and from the Trastevere to the Via Veneto all on foot. The hotel is nicely decorated with a small reception area and good recently re-fitted rooms and en-suites. We had front facing rooms and with windows open for air at night you do get an idea of the sleepless nature of city life - not unpleasant just there... Breakfast is taken up on the roof with enclosed and open areas. The buffet is very good with proper coffee (of course) and fruit, cereals, pastries, bread rolls etc. Staff were friendly and very helpful and our lack of Italian was not a problem.

Again like the other reviews the bathroom towels were very thin, but they dried you OK. The best way I can describe it was like getting dried with a table cloth. The hotel is ideally situated for all the tourist attractions. The Colloseum is about 10 minutes walk and likewise to the forum, Pantheon, Spanish Stps and Trevi Fountain. The Vatican is around a 40 minute walk, but we queued for one and a half hours to get into the Cistene Chappel, best to get there early. Best advice, get a good map. There are many restaurants in the area all of a similar sort of price. We paid around 20 Euro a head for 2 courses with a bottle of wine. Forget about driving, it would be horendous just to try and park. Rome is not very pedestrian friendly and you have to be careful crossing roads even on a crossing as most motorists especially motorcycles still keep coming even when you have a green light to cross.
