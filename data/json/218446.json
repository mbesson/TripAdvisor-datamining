Hotel is very centrally located with easy access to just about anything in Vancouver. Rooms come a bit scarce during Hockey season as I found out. My room was clean, comfortable and basic. Bathroom was rather small and cramped. Toiletries and towels were readily available. The room contained a mini fridge which is nice so you don't have to rely on the $2.25 price for a beverage from the vending machines. There are several 7-Elevens and stores within comfortable walking distance for all your needs. One view from the room was of the Stadium and the other, of an alley and rooftop of adjacent building. Which wasn't a major concern. Elevators can be tricky sometimes because the card reader fails quite often I found in my 4 day stay at the hotel. Great bar area, and the other attached bar is great for watching sports, especially hockey. But get there early for there is standing room only once a Canucks game is on. Staff was friendly, lobby was clean and open, and free WiFi was a definite plus. I definitely would recommend this hotel if you're needing a clean, comfortable room within in close proximity of the stadium and arena, and also a good choice for a centralised hotel in Vancouver.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Choice (If you have any need for Internet access...)\u201d", "Author": "room317", "ReviewID": "UR127961168", "Content": "I stayed here on business for a week with several colleagues.

This time we got a double room for $99 as we were going to a concert at Rogers arena. It is located an easy walk of 2 blocks to either Rogers or BC Place. Check in was smooth and since we had a large truck the parking attendants let us park in valet temporarily until we checked in then directed us into the correct lot for over height. $15 to park which is standard in downtown Vancouver. The room was clean though alittle run down, broken shelf in bathroom and poorly renovated and not enough towels for 3 people. We did find 2 pool towels in the dresser. As the kids wanted to swim before the concert(we were traveling with 3 others) we headed down to the pool. Good thing we read the directions as its confusing to find. We arrived to a big disappointment. The pool was fine, very deep in fact though the kids are teens, but the hot tub was cordoned off and under construction. Would have been nice to have known prior by a sign at the desk or in room. There is also no seating to watch the kids, had to sit on the stairs. This could do with improving. The elevators are extremely slow, and as we were on the 9th floor stairs were only an option going down. Waited 3 to return home after the concert as this hotel is one of the top choices for its location. In fact you have to sign a waiver on event nights for complaints and damage. Our only noise complaint was the stairwell door slamming shut, as there was no ice machine on our floor so people used the stairs to go up to the empty ice machine. The 7th floor had a working one. Beds were comfy and we were able to leave our truck till 2 pm though we left earlier. This hotel offered free wifi slow but at least it was free!!!! No free breakfast though. The restaurants were a bit pricy so we drove to a restaurant for brunch instead.

Well only one of the 2 were in service and a tour bus loaded with people had already checked in. There was a line up of people already waiting for the one operational elevator. As I was standing there with my family, finally next in line for the struggling elevator the bellman approached the elevator and announced that he had to get the luggage from the tour bus up to each of the floors. There were at least 20 full size suitcases in a row down the hallway that he alone began loading into the only elevator while my young daughters held their small pink suitcases at their sides. I could see that this fellow was having a tough time so I began helping him get the suitcases into the elevator. Soon after another man joined in as he was also becoming inpatient with the slow progress of the bellman. Once the elevator was full to the ceiling the bellman stepped in and the doors closed. We stood there now with a long line forming down the hallway wondering if we would ever see those doors open again. 15 minutes later it did come back and we squeezed as many of us in that elevator as we could. It proceeded up towards our 7th floor destination and passed right by it, even though we had repeatedly pushed our number. we were met on the 9th floor by a very frustrated woman that insisted on wedging herself in with us for she had also been waiting for 15 minutes. She had been staying in the Hotel for 2 nights and finally got so upset with the one intermittent elevator that she demanded to be moved to another room in the other tower that had a different elevator system. We did make it to our room and stayed 2 nights. What time we didn't spend waiting for the elevator we were walking up and down the 7 flights of stairs along with many other frustrated guests. We booked the room 2 weeks in advance and we had requested a refrigerator, well when we got to our room, no fridge. Manager said no more fridges.

The area in which this hotel is, is pretty much on the border for the worst part of Downtown Vancouver, (Hastings) which suffers from a great deal of people on drugs, alcohol abuse and homelessness. On one occasion, in the morning, we were sat in the hotel lobby awaiting a representative from our tour company and we met a girl in the lobby, who clearly was a drug addict, seeking refuge (a warm place to relax) and the hotel staff did nothing about it. I am not saying that they should have called the cops, but having her there, just showed that they didn't care who used the hotel lobby as a half way house. It was an uncomfortable feeling and we left quite promptly.

Clearly in a mad panic, the receptionist took control of the situation ringing round a number of different cab companies. Fortunately, after around 3-4 attempts, she located the cab company, the driver and the paperwork and passports - result!

The cab driver arrived within the hour and everything was as it should be - it's not often that people are this honest these days!

Again, the staff were exceptional, the breakfast arrived within what was probably less than 5 minutes and the food tasted just great! We decided to opt for a kids breakfast each, expecting that the 'adult' breakfast's would be too big. The kids breakfasts were more than adequate for what we wanted and kept us full until lunch time. A little on the expensive side, but still worth it. On the night, we had dinner at the Sports Bar in the hotel - not quite as nice as breakfast.

I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the reviews but it was okay. It had a nice lobby, was in a good location for walking to shops and restaurants, and was in a decent neighborhood. The hotel could definitely use more elevators. There were two for each tower. I believe we stayed in the North Tower and there were couches outside the elevators due to the long wait when it became busy with people checking in/out. In addition, one of the elevators broke and it took forever to wait for one. Luckily they do have stairs. The hotel had a sports bar (Shark Bar) that served food. However they were charging $6.00 a person the night we stayed since the Canucks were playing in a hockey game that night. It wasn't a home game but rather for people who wanted to watch the game on television. There is also a restaurant, Moxies's Grill, that I will give a separate review on. The hotel also had a pool and whirlpool which neither of us used. The people checking us in and out were not the friendliest. They did call us a taxi and I was impressed with the speed of their arrival to take us to Canada Place. The hotel did have wireless internet. However, It was constantly busy and I was unable to acquire a network signal at any time. There are two computers available in the lobby which you can pay to use the internet. At the time I got desperate enough to pay to use their computer and internet there were no chairs to sit down on since other customers waiting for a bus or taxi were sitting in them. Our room was not as bad as I thought it would be. It was roomy enough. It had a flat screen television, separate bath/toilet from the vanity area, and overall it was clean. The room did not have a refrigerator or microwave. It was a basic room with no special frills. Overall, it was an okay place to stay. We didn't experience bed bugs, loud noise, or a tiny room where you couldn't walk around. The rooms were not what I would consider luxury nor was it a dump!

When I walk in the lobby I always feel like I do when I enter my best friend's home. The staff - front counter, room cleaners, maintenance - always and as far back as I remember cheerfully greet you and genuinely make you feel like they are happy you arrived. They always look you in the eye in elevators, hallways or even the parkade with a cheerful \"Good Morning\" or \"Have a nice sleep\" . I have yet to encounter any staff at this hotel that aren't bright and cheerful - which is amazing and must be challenging because how many people they must process and cater to everyday - and we know how demanding some of us can be right? Even the managers sometimes come out to greet the customers just to say hi and make sure everything is just right with their accommodations. The rooms are always clean. It is an older building, elegant and nicely decorated. The rooms are comfortable and the decor and furniture are top notch. The hotel offers excellent amenities - full service, excellent pool, a gym, two restaurants - Moxies ( great room service ) and the Shark Club to pick from for dinner. The location is fantastic - the QE theater, GM Place and BC Place are kitty corner. Georgia Street is the main artery of downtown Vancouver. Everything connects to it. Being right at the end of Georgia just before the viaduct makes it perfect for those that want to get in and out of downtown fast by car - just one right turn out of the breezeway and Georgia is right there, another right and you're driving on the viaduct to zip down to Main Street, then First Ave to get to Hwy 1. Turn left to go downtown, to Stanley Park, or over the Lions Gate Bridge to the North Shore. Bottom line is ingress/egress by vehicle to this hotel is awesome because it is on the edge of downtown. This hotel is an excellent jump off point for anyone either tourist or business traveler. For the business traveler like me, rest assured the high speed wireless internet is great.

On arrival Reception staff couldn't find booking (don't know who was to blame for this - we had a written booking form). We were quickly given a room, but unfortunately the bathroom had not been cleaned - the rest of the room had. We called Reception who put this right immediately - the cleaners were apologetic and throughout our stay always friendly and helpful. However, naturally, we were beginning to think we should have listened to the reviewers who did not rate this hotel - and we were to be there for 3 nights!! Fortunately nothing else went wrong - we had a reasonable sized room, no view - we weren't bothered as only sleeping there and the rate we paid was low - very clean and comortable room, good TV and channel choice, excellent air conditioning (we thought it was ok first night but the hotel clearly didn't - on return to the hotel they had installed a new unit - it made quite a difference - well done) and clean towels every day. We used Moxy's bar a couple of times - very friendly staff - didn't have a meal there but what we saw looked good. This hotel is very convenient for downtown and the harbour and within easy walking distance of the football and ice hockey stadiums as well as the science world/omnimax (a great place for kids of all ages - and adults!!!). The lifts are often mentioned in reviews and they can be extremely busy at times causing a wait - but they are ok and the key card access to fall floors gives some added security not found in many upmasrket hotels apaprt from business floors. Checkout was very efficient and a taxi to the airport (more efficient than a 6-block walk to theairport shuttle bus - taxi cost CA$30, Airporter bus CA$27 for two). We were pleased to see the building of a direct train link to the airport, due to open in 2009 - a good spin-off from the 2010 Winter Olympics I guess. Lots of new building in Vancouver since our last visit 10 years ago but still loved the city and its surrounding area. I agree with some other reviewers that there are more vagrants/beggars than we are used to and could be off-putting if anyone felt vulnerable - I note the BC Premier promises to improve the position - he really needs to. Gastown, for example, is excellent but you don't have to stray far away from it to find the seedier side of the city - a pity. With a bit of thought and care there is no need to have any worries we thought. I am sure there are many better hotels in Vancouver than the Sandman but doubless many worse. Overall, we are satisfied that we got good value for money and weren't disappointed, given the low rate for our stay.

It was easy to identify Grouse mountain at nightime as some of it was lit up. The layout of the bathroom was ideal as well! When you walked into the bedroom, there was a small archway on the left hand side to enter the first part of the bathroom! Here you had the sink, folded ironing board and a rail for your clothes. You then went through a door to get access to everything else! This was ideal because if I was having a bath, my mum could still use the sink for whatever! All staff were lovely and helpful! Whenever we bumped into any of the reception staff or maids in the corridors or in the lifts, they always smiled and said hello! Brilliant location as well! Robson St was parallel to West Georgia so it took us no time at all to get there and about 5 minutes to reach the shopping area! Pacific centre was also a 5 minute walk on West Georgia! Chinatown & Gastown were also 5-10 minutes away! If you don't fancy having breakfast in the hotel there as some good places nearby! 'The midnight garden' (I think that's what its called) was a cafe on West Georgia and took about 3 minutes to walk down to. Lovely food and reasonably priced! Then on Robson, you had McDonalds, Subway and another cafe which specialised in crepe breakfasts! Other conveniant places within 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel - post office, sky train, bank and drugstore! The little things worth saying - free apples at reception, touch screen tv in the lobby which gives information on everything from attractions, shopping, restaurants etc and a self check in service!

Following morning we approached a different manager and she apoligised over what happened and ensured our room would be deep cleaned and she would oversee it personaly and offered to give us half rate which we declined stating all we wanted was a clean room which she agreed and gave us assurances it would be sorted, We had not unpacked any of our stuff at this stage and just freshened up to head out for day with the knowledge our room would be cleaned and that left us a bit more comfortable, the clump of hair i had left in the drawer beside bed if I must say dileberatly to see how thorough the room was cleaned and to my own surprise was shocked to find it remained in the room that evening when we returned along with a bottle of wine and an apoligy, on our departure from the hotel I handed an envelope to manager who had said she would supervise the cleaning of the room and explained it had been left in the room through all the supposed cleaning that had been done in room, I also told her that I am by profession a Manager of a 4 star Hotel in Ireland and the main area I am responsible for by choice is Health and Hygiene and theirs I found to be a disgrace, Thank God once you go outside the downtown area of Vancouver that makes up for it, I have to say it is Sp[ectacular", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria", "Title": "\u201cDisco nearby !\u201d", "Author": "fiftysix01", "ReviewID": "UR18255868", "Content": "Not on the airporter bus route anymore, meant a taxi ride.

Lets get this clear right now, they have given us tonight\u2019s stay free with a promise of changing our room in the morning and charging us $130 per night rather than the $175 they tried to charge for this dive of a cramped room. Let me start. The first thing noticed upon entering the allocated room is the strong smell of fresh enamel paint on the bathroom door, which was recently painted, reeked of paint fumes and not appropriately signed \u201cWet Paint\u201d. Do you know how hard it is to remove enamel paint from your hands let alone clothing? Now using water and soap to do this is a time consuming process; but at the Sandman it is a painful process as there is no hot water. That is right, NO HOT WATER. At Midnight the gent on the front counter told me this problem had been rectified. However it is 6am now and there is only lukewarm water, not warm enough to use. Now I am not up early in the morning \u2013 I am still up late in the night; as it seems noise plays a big factor in ones inability to get some rest. In this case we had to sleep with the window open so as to get some fresh air and rest from the paint fumes. However I have coughed all night in reaction to the fumes and now have sore throat and headache. Not to worry, nothing a hot shower and glass of juice wont fix, ha ha; shower, yeah right; well at least I can still have my cold glass of juice; WRONG again as the room doesn\u2019t come with a mini fridge. (apparently there aren\u2019t enough for every room) Which is sad, I did bring juice and milk, oh well I can drink from the carton. That\u2019s how you do it in cheap dodgy hotel/motels, plus the open window in middle of a Canadian winter has helped to keep the drinks and us freezing cold. Mmmm decor and presentation - well I am quite sure the photographs speak for themselves in this one. The wallpaper would have made my Great Grandma excited (during the depression). The beautiful use of British racing green splattered on the bathroom door to cover a very poor repair job where the door has had a hole kicked in, helps to create a sense of claustrophobia in the 1.5m x 2m bathroom, doesn\u2019t even have soap holders in the shower. Perhaps a dropped cake of soap caused someone to slip and put their foot through the door while they were having a cold shower. Actually they could have just slipped on the wet floor; the first thing I noticed when I ran the shower for 10 minutes at Midnight to see if the water would heat up, was how water manages to make its way directly to the bathroom floor, from there the water has nowhere to go as there are no drainage points. Not to worry, we are all adults here - we can just mop it up. Providing one of you is willing to forfeit your cold shower as there are no extra towels. Now my colleague actually seems have fallen asleep; which is a problem as I need to quietly sneak over his side of this shoebox to lodge this rant for publication. Would you believe that the power point on this side of the room doesn\u2019t work. I should just be thankful that we now have Internet access in our room; initially we were informed that if I wish to use the internet I must do so in the lobby where they have wireless. If you do come here, please whatever you do, only come here for the most amazing restaurant \u201cMoxies\u201d is it great, or to party in the downstairs night club.
