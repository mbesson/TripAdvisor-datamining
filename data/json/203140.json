Especially the people involved with the room service.. I wish I had the name of the Girl who I met a couple of times during my stay who delivered the food, as she was extremely nice and courteous... and I would have loved to let the management know directly that they have a great asset in her. The room decor was not really my favorite as I like to get more of a traditional look when I travel to Italy and this was Black & Silver art deco... it was fine, just not my thing.. and the bathroom was good size. I was luck enough to have a small french balcony in my bedroom and bathroom.. but I do not think every room as that, Totally loved that feature though. Breakfast was above & beyond expectation.. with hot and cold options.. and some really nice looking pasteries although I never had them.. the display was very nice. Beautiful cappucinos every day.. i always looked forward to that and the waitress who delivered it was always friendly.. If there was one criticism, it was the concierge service which was really never available when I needed it.. either there was a line waiting to speak to the one gentleman at the desk or no one was at the desk.. but with that said, directions, questions, etc.. if i asked the front desk or the doorman, each was more than willing to assist so it worked out.

(2) Some hotel staff was exceptionally gracious and helpful. The Negatives: (1) Baglioni is the only AmEx Fine Hotels & Resorts property at which I've stayed that did not have an upgrade available for the entirety of our stay. Thus we had to change rooms mid-stay, and got the upgraded Jr Suite for only 3 of 5 nights. (2) During our first day in the Jr Suite, a badly leaking showerhead sprayed water all over the bathroom, and the mini-fridge didn't work -- both necessitating repairs. (3) I asked the Concierge to make dinner reservations at specific restaurants for each of our 5 nights in Rome, but he failed to make any of them. We were able to dine at each of our chosen restaurants, but had a lengthy wait in 2 and were assigned a crap table in 2 others (because they squeezed us in). (4) The hotel restaurant (Brunello) was awful. Although it was nearly empty, we were relegated to a lesser table because most tables were purportedly reserved; but over 2 hours later, the restaurant remained nearly empty. Further, the somalier served us an overpriced bottle of Prosecco, the beef special (about $55 US) -- the waitress's strongest recommendation -- was horribly tough and flavorless, and the seabass was bland.

They failed to give us cards that we needed for the restaurants. Also, the restaurants that came in the package were awful. Big tourist traps. You know it's bad when you look around and all you see are tourists coming from their hotels. My husband and I wanted to skip the meals, but the honeymoon package was a wedding gift so we spent 3 nights in rome with 3 bad meals! Not going to lie, the restaurants that they include in the package are very fancy, but my husband and I were looking for authentic family owned restaurants. We found the best family owned restaurants in Amalfi that tasted a million times better at a quarter of the cost of the restaurants the hotel put us up in Rome. The worse was the restaurant in the hotel- do not go there if you are looking for Italian food. Overall I felt like this restaurant was just trying to find ways to make money off of you. First they charge for the internet. When they try to help you 'plan' activities around Rome, they prefer to push you in the more expensive route. I definitely would not stay here again. P.S.

We booked this holiday through British Airways who usually recommend reasonable hotels. Big mistake with this one and not cheap either. The hotel is not shy charging top dollar for shabby rooms. Room 709 decor very dated, room shabby, grout in bathroom needs replacing, carpet needs replacing, furniture needs replacing. Thick dust covered the vent in the bathroom and in the morning the sewerage smell from the bathroom was overpowering. I don't believe in moaning after I have stayed at a hotel as I am a hotelier myself. If a customer has a geniuine complaint then this should be addressed whilst you are on the premises so that you can try and come to some arrangement to resolve the problem. I went straight to reception after I checked into Room 709 to tell them that I was not pleased with the room that had been allocated. It was dark, very dated bedspread and a carpet your granny would have had in the 40's there was also a loud air conditioning noise outside the window and a brick wall for a view. I was told that it was very busy and the only room that was available was a grande deluxe room which was going to be an extra 250 euros per night this was at a discounted rate as it was selling at 600 euros per night that particular day. Daylight robbery! I was shown this room which I wouldn't have paid an extra 50 euros. We were told that we could move to another room same category that we were in on the Tuesday. We declined that offer as there was no point, all the rooms looked the same except for the colour scheme. The safety deposit box in the room was also broken. The concierge recommended a restaurant for us on the Tuesday and my husband got food posioning so he ended up having to spend Wednesday in bed. I asked at breakfast if I could take a cup of tea to my husband who was sick in bed and they did this straight away at a cost of 15 euros for 1 cup. Make sure that you iron all your clothes before you leave home as they do not have any iron or iron boards for health and safety reasons. However, a maid would come and do it for me. I asked would there be a charge and never got an answer so I decided to wear creased clothes because if a cup of tea cost 15 euros what was I going to be charged for ironing? If you are really concerned about health and safety then why was it possible for me to plug my hair straightners into thye socket in the bathroom? I think that this is just another money making excuse. Breakfast was ok. Anyway my advice is to stay clear of Regina Baglioni as they are trading on their name only. I would really like to know how you were rated 5 star as I have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world and have never encountered rooms like yours. Advice to the manager and front of house. If guests are unhappy with the room that they are allocated for good reasons then I would suggest that instead of trying to make more money from them to actually do what you should have been doing in the first place by offering 5 star accommodation, not 3 star.

Reception basically said \"my computer says its 23 degrees so cant help you\" WOW ! - If you're a business traveller and intend to work in your room - forget it. The desk (if there is one in the room - the pokey ones dont have any) does not have any power plug connectors ! So you have to unplug the table lamp to get your laptop or phone charger connected ! Even in the grand suites ! If you're in a pokey one - like room 226 (writing from there now) there is no desk ! How can you have a business hotel room in a 5 star hotel in a major European city without a desk? Even an Ibis or a HolidayInn would have a desk ! On pricing - this is nuts. I have paid Eur 170 a night (which is my corporate rate) but I have also been the victim of highway robbery last week - asked to pay Eur 536 for a night + VAT ! Ostensibly because it was Fashion Week. However, the Majestic, down the road from this hotel - and way way better by the way - did not differentiate their rates !

Overall, we have been quite satisfied with the room and the hotel in general. The staff was very friendly and almost always smiling. We had booked a grand deluxe room through a website (booking.com) and asked for a room with a view to the streets (and not the inner courtyard) and a double bed. The hotel mailed us, back assuring us that both requests would be met and that upon arrival a bottle of spumante (sort of champagne) would be waiting in our room. Indeed, our room was facing the street to the side of the hotel and equipped with a double bed. No spumante was in the room however, so I asked the person at the reception who said that the maids would probably place it at their 6pm visit to clean the room. Indeed, when we got back later that night the bottle was there. Sadly, even though the bed looked like a double one, when we laid down that night I found out that it was formed of 2 single mattresses placed side-by-side. Our room was no. 211, indeed a grand deluxe room identical to the one shown at the hotels' website (the red one). I am pretty sure that the room shown in that picture is the one we stayed at. My first impression of the room was partly negative: I expected it to be a bit bigger and certainly quite brighter, but I have to admit that I was comparing it to the suite we stayed at back in Greece after our wedding (for one night) which was fabulous, brightly lit and full of windows. Our room at Regina, like all rooms in Rome (I assume), had only one (relatively narrow, yet tall) window, therefore little light was entering the room. But do not expect something different since all buildings in the centre of Rome have small windows because of the old-style architecture. The room was a bit dark, but quite aristocratic and classy; marble floor, marble bathroom with 2 sinks, good quality polished wood and leather chairs, Murano glass lights (and a big chandelier), minibar, safe, TV and a desk. Everything in the room was good quality and overall we felt as we were living in a quite luxurious environment. I would prefer it, however, that we were given the other type of deluxe room since judging from the photos at the website it looked quite brighter. On the second day, I asked for a brighter room with one single mattress, but we were told that there was no other room vacant and that they found it weird since our room was recently renovated and most people prefer it. I guess it must have been one of the hotel's best rooms. Since I was not too happy with our room, we went to see two other hotels in the area (not on Via Veneto but close to it). We asked to see a deluxe room in both hotels. The first one (Eden) was quite lighter and felt more \"happy\". For a moment I was ready to book it for the rest of our stay in Rome. The room at the other hotel (Splendide Royale) gave me a good first impression, but it seemed kind of \"fake\" and using medium quality materials (e.g. the wood looked quite cheap). When we returned to our room, comparing it to the other two rooms we saw in the other hotels, I started to appreciate it more. It was a lot classier than the others and quite better quality. Even though the Eden was brighter and happier, our room was much more aristocratic; it looked more like a luxurious room in a palace, than a lux room in a hotel. The Eden was a lux room in a hotel (moquette floor). So we decided to stay at the Regina Baglioni and I became more and more happy with it. We had a good time and had no problems with the room or the hotel (besides the mattress). It is worthy to mention that the room was cleaned up twice; once in the morning, and a second time around 6pm in the afternoon, where they also left close to our pillows a weather forecast for the next day and a small (bitter) chocolate for each one of us. Nice. The hotel is very close to the Spanish steps, about 10 minutes or so and it is within walking distance to the whole historical center of Rome, if you like walking! At first we thought that we'd have to use the bus or metro, but Rome is a lovely city to walk and we often walked from the Hotel to Piazza Navona, or from Campo Di Fiori to the hotel at night. If you don't want to walk, the metro station is 2 minutes from the hotel, and the bus stop to go to the center is 3 minutes (on Via Tritone, route 62). The location of the hotel was brilliant; Via Veneto must be the nicest street in the whole Rome! A classy area of Rome with restaurants and stores, tall green trees, little traffic and lovely \"atmosphere\". Hard Rock Cafe is on the next block to the hotel. The hotel was not too big. Upon entering, do not expect a huge lobby or the wow-factor. It is aristocratic yet kind of small. A lobby can be found if you walk further inside, an oval room with no windows (I think). The restaurant-bar is named \"Brunello\" and can be accessed either from inside the hotel or from the street. It's nicely (in a modern way) decorated and the food is good, yet quite expensive. Our room didn't include breakfast and we opted not to pay for it since it's quite pricey for a buffet breakfast. Overall our stay at the Regina Baglioni was quite good. Had it been for a real double bed and a brighter room, I would dare to rate it \"excellent\".

The best thing about the hotel was the location on Via Veneto. There are tons of places to eat within walking distance (although they are somewhat pricey - but most things are in Rome!), including many Italian restuarants, coffee shops, and a Hard Rock Cafe if you need a hamburger. It is also very easy to walk to major sight-seeing in the area from the hotel, including the Roman Forum and Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Villa Borghese Park and Museums in the park. My husband and I also got ambitious and decided to walk to St. Peter's Bascilica from the hotel. It was a good hike but it can be done - and it helps work off all the pasta and gelato you will be eating! Although the hotel is rated 4 (or 5...I can't remember) stars, it is not what I expect from an American hotel rated that high, but I think that is pretty standard. It did not have a workout room or pool, although if you like to walk or run just head to the Villa Borghese Park at the end of Via Veneto for good walking/running paths. It also does not have Internet access in all the rooms. Apparently if you stay in one of the suites, you might have it but in the regular rooms it was not available, or at least that is what we were told. There is a business center in the basement where you can use the Internet for 30 minutes free of charge. After 30 minutes you are charged a fee. Didn't try the restaurant or rooms service because it was quite expensive - great restaurants are just a step away so I wouldn't bother with room service anyway... The room itself was nice - had a queen bed with 2 chairs and a small table at the end of it. Also had a flat screen TV and plenty of closet/drawer space. Bathroom also had 2 sinks with marble countertops and separate shower/toilet area. Maid service was very good - everything was kept very clean and they came twice a day to put out new towels and straighten, turndown service, etc. The room also had air conditioning which was nice since it was quite hot while we were there. The Concierge staff was also very friendly and helpful. They set up several tours for us and also made reservations at the Villa Borghese Museum for us. The only bad thing I will say is that Via Veneto is a busy street and it was pretty loud - lots of honking going on outside all the time. They were also doing street construction while we were there and we heard drilling, etc early in the morning. Also, it would have been nice to have Internet, workout room, pool, but overall this was a clean hotel in a great location and if I went back to Rome, I would stay there again. There are several other hotels in the same area though (Excelsior Westin, a Marriott, and a few others) that I think did have pools, Internet so if those things are must haves, you might check on those prices also.

For starters, the rooms can be quite small. I arrived not knowing what to expect, as my company generally books all travel and accommodations: my room was barely large enough to allow a person to walk around the bed. A table and chair were placed in front of the bed, though I really would've preferred not having them there and having a few extra feet of space to move around in. I was originally in one of the few rooms with an accessible balcony and a view of the main street (Via Veneto), yet was unable to find a high-speed internet jack in the room, despite having been told that my room would have one. I requested a move after having the concierge confirm that the room did not have internet, only to be moved to a room that was even smaller, with neither a balcony nor a view, and still no internet. Though the technician who came to my room to find the internet jack was very apologetic for the mistake and seemed to sympathize with my having had to unnecessarily unpack and then re-pack all of my things for no reason, I remain disappointed. Several of my coworkers (all paying the same room rate, mind you) have rooms that would be considered palatial in comparison, WITH internet, no less. Inexplicably, some ~400E/night rooms are larger and nicer than others, and the maids seem to acknowledge this by leaving chocolates for some, while merely offering turndown service to others. Bathrooms are also inconsistent, as some offer bathtubs and separate vanity areas while others (mine) do not. Another point worth mentioning is that the bathrooms are curiously lacking any ventilation, an oversight which for the past week has allowed me the pleasure of waking up to the oh-so-pleasant smell of mold-- that is, when I'm not too congested from having inhaled the ridiculous amounts of pollen and other allergens that manage to make their way into my room at night, past what I suspect to be a filterless HVAC unit. Mosquitoes, too, manage to find their way into the rooms. I've had good experiences at breakfast thus far, though my coworkers complain that the eggs are runny and certain breakfast cereals are offered only on certain days of the week; if bread/rolls and jelly/nutella/cold cuts are more your thing, you'll be satisfied. The concierge, however, as well as all staff I've dealt with so far, are incredibly friendly and accomodating. I'm certain they would've moved me into another room if I'd asked, though I honestly didn't feel it to be worth the trouble. They are quick to offer dining recommendations, as well as provide assistance with taxis, reservations, etc. The location of the hotel is also very convenient to almost everything worth seeing in Rome.
