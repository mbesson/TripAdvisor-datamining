We stayed for 4 nights in November 2011 just after its change to a Holiday Inn. Apart from one little thing we could not fault it, especially for the price paid. As stated it is situated in the Bur Dubai district which is the older part of Dubai, and is a 5 minute walk to Khalid Bin Al Waleed Metro station which gives access to both the red and green lines of the metro. Only one other Metro station has that advantage. The metro is fantastically efficient and cheap and it takes 15 minutes maximum to travel to the Hotel from the airport. There are 4 exits from the Metro and you need to take exit 4 for the shortest route to the hotel. When you come out of the Metro station you will be directly opposite a shop called \"And So To Bed\". Facing that shop there is an area of sandy waste ground to the right of the shop. If you cross that to the street on the other side of it and look right you will see the Hotel with its green facade 100 yards or so along the road. One thing, though, it is difficult to wheel cases across the sand so you could walk past the bed shop and then a right turn and take a slightly longer route on foot. The land oppposite the hotel is vacant and presumably eventually will be a building site, but nothing is currently happening there. As to the Hotel, we had a standard deluxe room which was plently large enough for two. Due to previous reviewers mentioning noise from the bars on the ground floor we requested a 3rd (top) floor room at the front. We had room 358 and heard no noise whatsoever. The twin beds were large and very comfortable with nice clean, crisp linen. The airconditioning worked well. All usual facilities were there (iron, safe, kettle, mini bar fridge, etc.). The bathroom was good with shower over the bath. Usual toiletries provided. There was also a complimentary UAE newspaper every day. The room was very clean. Our only complaint was the smell of drains in the bathroom, not sewage exactly, more like damp, dirty, musty floor cloths left in a bucket for a long time instead of being hung out to dry. We didn't ask to be moved because we had unpacked etc and couldn't be bothered for 4 nights, but did mention it at the end of our stay. However, leaving the plugs in the bath and basin and the airconditioning on helped. We found all members of staff to be very polite, friendly and courteous. We used the free shuttle to the beach park once (small admission charge to beach park) and that was efficient. Probably about a 30 minute drive each way. There was one trip out at 10am and one trip back at 3pm. We didn't eat in the hotel at all or use the sauna or gym. However, we did use the rooftop pool. This is fairly small but there was only ever a few people using it at any one time. Plenty of nice towels which were free to use. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuwait", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay in a great location\u201d", "Author": "MissyQw8", "ReviewID": "UR120478892", "Content": "As regular travellers to Dubai, my husband and I usually stay in the Bur Dubai area as it is so accessible (a) from the airport & (b) to all shopping areas.

Atleast 20 varieties of salads, about the same amount of sauces like hoummus, dijon vinaigrete etc, excellent hot dishes (different dishes every night, a mix of indian, thai, libanese, italian and arabic cuisine) and the most amazing dessert buffet with everything you can ask for. Beer and wine is not included but available if you pay for it. It's not cheap, but the quality is good. The staff is always at your service and they're extremly polite.

The wiev from the roof is not that impressive, so don't get dissappointed. The hotel pub (in which they unsuccessfully had tried to create a british feel) was not too charming. Everyone smoked in there and you coul hardly breathe. The service there was not too impressive either, you had to wait for ages until you got your drink, and the drinks were kind of expensive. TV screens were every where in the pub, and the crowd was a mix of indian, english, arabs (drinking beer!) and other nationalities.

We had a large flat screen TV, huge bathroom with toiletries & 2 large double beds, perfect! Only downside was our non existent view on to an alley facing the neighbouring run down apartment block covered in bird dirt...room was also very dark. It was only that evening around 10pm that we started to hear the disco which was horrendous!!!!!! The bass vibrated through the room so badly that we could feel the vibrations in bed & the sound of the music was so loud it could be heard over the TV. This went on until 3am. Not ideal after a night flight from the UK when you've had no sleep!!! Next morning we asked reception if we could move rooms & expressed our upset at being placed on the first floor, seemingly directly above the club when we had emailed in advance & was assured we would be placed away from it! We received no real apology & was told the hotel was full. The noise & sleepless nights continued & our days were spoilt as we were SO tired! On the third night at 1.45am We were so cross we called reception & demanded to be moved as we wanted at least some sleep before joining our cruise the next day, the reception staff weren't too interested & told us they would ask the DJ to turn it down.at 2.20am the music was louder so we complained again & were finally moved rooms...same room but on 3rd floor where music could still be heard but not quite as loud. This just proves how loud the disco is when it keeps you awake on the top floor of the hotel!! It also amazes me how they managed to find a vacant room when apparently the hotel was fully booked!! The next morning at breakfast they tried to charge us as we had somehow been removed from the list & were mithered 2 or 3 times by different people for the room key back!! We called for the bell boy to help us with our cases down to reception but he never arrived..it was almost starting to seem personal! Upon check out we spoke to the duty manager who was extremely uninterested, made little eye contact, made no real apology & assured us that sound technicians would work on removing the speakers from the nightclub ceiling!!! Not much good to us when we hadn't slept for 3 days or to all the other guests who had been complaining for the past few months!why not remove the speakers then?? We asked for some form of compo as he clearly wasn't going to offer us any & he point blank refused, eventually he offered us a free transfer to the cruise terminal which is about 5 mile away (this didn't materialise as he was off duty come evening when we were due to leave & the other DM who was even ruder knew nothing about it). We did however get a complimentary lunch in the hotel restaurant which was worth about \u00a310 each & we were assured that when we returned in 1 week we would have a quiet room (we were promised that before we arrived)! Checking in again on our second stay at the hotel after the cruise we were told the room wasn't ready (even though it was after the 2pm check in time) we waited in reception for about 1 hour & was given a free orange juice. The Duty Manager took us to room 263, we hadn't been upgraded but there were 2 bathrobes, a Rose & some bath bombs on the bed, lit candles around the bath which was filled with lovely Rose petals & shortly after a large basket of fruit was delivered to the room..we were very impressed!! We also had the view over the front of the hotel which we originally requested. Overall we were quite satisfied with the eventual outcome as the roses & candles were a nice touch to the room but it was a shame that it took an email, 3 sleepless nights & a lengthy discussion with the DM to get it! Overall it's a fabulous hotel & apart from the all night disco, I cannot really fault it..I can't even recommend emailing in advance to request a quiet room because we tried that! At check in just ask for a room that faces out to the front of the hotel as these are furthest away from the club..they just don't seem keen to rent these out?! Breakfast is ok, lots of choice but not really geared up for the Brittish & the pool area is nice, just hardly any loungers so get there early. Reception staff aren't overly helpful but will give you info if you need it. Taxis frequently stop outside the hotel & the metro is a 3 minute walk away & very cheap & efficient.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cA nice place to stay...but as the hotel is new many taxi drivers dont know about this hotel\u201d", "Author": "sourabh1084", "ReviewID": "UR97927520", "Content": "I stayed here for 04 nights and had a pacakge inclusive of veg. buffet breakfast which was jus upto satisfactory.

The location i.e Bank street, Bur Dubai is famous and hence we had to show the hotel map to each cabby to help him trace the hotel. And as the days passed we ourselves came to know about the surroundings which made it easy for us to locate the hotel later. The rules of the hotel are very very strict i.e firstly they had asked us a deposit of 400DHS as security deposit for each room which was not at all negotiable. Secondly we had requested for a late checkout for one of our 02 rooms booked but they did not agree and rather said that if you don't check out before 1300 hrs , then 50 % of the room rent will be charged.

ARRIVAL Upon arrival we were greeted by very attentive staff who were assisting the taxi driver with the heavy suitcases before we had even got out the taxi. The front desk staff were all smiles and we were offered cool drinks whilst we were being checked in. Whilst sitting in the lobby area waiting the reception staff came to inform is that she was not able to give us the twin room we had requested as there was not one available but she would put an extra bed in a double room and would move us to the room we had requested as soon as possible. We had no problem with this. She was really apologetic. We were given a fruit basket for the room mix up but that was only after asking for something for the inconvenience. The staff helped us with our luggage and the room we were given was more than spacious the extra bed was already in there. Even with two beds there wad plenty of room. The furniture and amenities in the room were great. The room was spotless and clean. Nice flat screen TV with plenty of channels to choose from , plenty were in English. Some channels showed a 2 movies a night 9pm and 11pm this was standard TV no extra charge. Bathroom was a good size in excellent condition and immaculate. A previous review said the water was not very hot and we had the same problem but we called reception and they sent someone immediately to rectify the problem and it was just that we had not pulled the tap on the shower/bath far enough to the left. They have 3 phones in the room. One in the bathroom and two in the main bedroom. FOOD We had paid for bed and breakfast. The breakfast was great, full of variety and plenty of it you can go up as many times as you want. They had fresh fruit, cereal, omelettes and fried eggs cooked to order. Beef Bacon was great. They had traditional food as well as regular toast, crossings and jam. We ate at the hotel most evenings. Again the food was great they have the anwar restaurant which serves a buffet meal for 69 dhs per person which is about 16 gbp per head. It included salad, soup, chicken, fish, rice, vegetables again so much choice and really nice. There was desert too and still water was also included. You could make as much trips to food counter as you wanted although one was enough for me!! They have a roof top swimming pool and bar at night they do a bbq which is 99 dhs/ approx 20 gbp per person. Food is cooked to order. Lamb and chicken kebab skewers using good quality meat they have seafood skewers too. This all came with homous, corn on the cob, pitta bread. Again still water was included. It often was not busy up on the roof. I think they served till 11 pm. THE POOL The pool area was really clean and well kept it was a little cold but with the heat of the UAE sun that was soon forgotten. They have a sort of tent area that is great for when the heat gets too much or when you want to read a book.or watch tv. They have good wicker furniture in there too. The staff will get you dries which you can have by the pool and charge to your room. They play music by the pool which is also nice. SPA FACILITIES They have a sauna and a steam room which we used. They have separate times for men and women so if you thinking if enjoying the sauna and steam with your partner forget it , but it is to be expected in a Muslim country and it is to be respected. Personal I took no issue with this. Both sauna and steam were very clean although seats in the sauna are a little rickety and could do with a visit from a hammer and nails! We had a few massages also which were cheaper than it would be in the UK but if you book a few you may get a deal but beware the manager likes to suggest all sorts of other treatments and before you know it your paying to have your hair done when you only came up for a massage. BUSINESS CENTRE The business centre is small but is fit for the purpose, in our case to check-in online prior to going home, again reasonable prices. LOCATION Great location. Literally across the road from a convince store called Orange supermarket, its a 5 min walk. It sells snacks, drinks even fresh fruit and beg. Prices reasonable. The hotel is located 5-10 min walk from Burjaman shopping centre with all the shopping you could want. There are also many currency exchange places, a pharmacy and local resturants. They have the fast food chains such as McDonald's, KFC (they deliver), Nando's and Pizza Hut if you like that sort of thing. The Creek is 5 mins away in a taxi and you can shop till you drop and get great bargains. The metro is a 5 min walk away from the hotel. TIPS This was not my first trip to Dubai so these are things I have picked up on this trip and previously. The hotel has a tourist desk that sells excursions DO haggle the price the give you on some trips ie the safari is not fixed but they don't tell you that. Various companies do the same excursion and take you to a central point but they charge different prices. DON'T change your currency at the hotel you will get a better rate if your prepared to walk 5 mins down the road. Taxi's are really cheap but you will find that traveling from the airport to the hotel in a taxi will cost you more than your return journey as the airport taxi's work on a higher rate. We had no problem with the taxi's finding the hotel but if in doubt tell them to head for the Burjaman shopping mall and its literally across the busy road from the Orange supermarket (open 24 hrs). Dubai has a funny system when it comes to making phone calls. If you call someone and they don't answer after a few seconds the phone company begin to charge you just because it ringing. This is nor the fault of the hotel just the telecommunication company. OVERALL Great holiday, great hotel it's s real gem. I could not fault the service, food or accommodation. Great staff nothing was too much. Great value for money. Did not want to leave would stay there in a heartbeat again.

The lobby of the hotel is beautiful but the room I stayed in was just ok - the furniture and furnishings didn't feel 4 star quality in my opinion. It was clean though and the bed was comfortable. I wanted room service but when I looked at the limited 'hotel directory' provided in the room, the menu wasn't in there. I had to request someone to bring up the room service menu, which is odd in itself. Then I called room service to get an explanation of the different dishes as I wanted an Indian dish & the menu didn't explain what the dish was, only the Indian name. The man on the other end of the phone was disinterested and didn't really explain anything to me - he made me feel like I was wasting his time. Later when I wanted something from the mini bar, I opened the fridge and it was empty - I would have had to request for someone to bring to my room anything I would want from the mini bar. Again, strange and rather inconvenient. I brought my own laptop and used the internet provided by the hotel via cable (not wireless) - I selected 30 minutes of internet. Out of all this time I probably got about 5 minutes worth of usage as the internet went from either not working at all to being excruciatingly slow. I called for an engineer twice but no one came, they did call me but only to tell me that the cause of my problem was because the time I had paid for had come to an end. They didn't have an answer as to why I had problems from the second I logged in and by the time they offered to come up, I was already fed up with it all and had given up. I complained about this when I checked out but I still had to pay for the 30 minutes. Lastly but by no means least - I didn't get to sleep until about 4am on Friday morning. The music from the bar at the hotel literally made my room vibrate with the bass. It was very loud & I couldn't sleep until it stopped. I didn't bother to complain at the time as I was checking out later that day & didn't fancy moving rooms at 1am. When I was checking out they asked me 'so the music wasn't too loud for you?\u2019 They obviously knew when I checked in that the room they gave me would be subject to loud noise from the bar... Nice. Another annoying thing, admittedly not the hotels fault, is that of all the taxi's I took no one knew where the hotel was.

For the mid budget price, the hotel exceeded our expectations. We booked online through their website, and we check in without any hitches or glitches. We found the rooms to be spotlessly clean, well furnished, quiet, and spacious. The beds were very comfortable, with soft duvets, and we appreciated the touch of plush robes and slippers hanging in the closet. The view wasn't outstanding, but perfectly fine, and the nice big windows let in lots of natural light. The bathroom was also sleek, spacious, and spotlessly clean. A nice touch was the scale in the bathroom, though after 4 days of eating out, I wasn't too happy with the readings :) The service was excellent. Everyone we interacted with was polite, friendly, and professional. They really made the extra effort to make sure our stay was enjoyable and responded graciously to all our requests. We only used the restaurant in the lovely atrium one time, for breakfast. The continental fare was fine, complete with an omelet station. It was a bit pricey and I would have enjoyed some more selections from the region itself, though I did enjoy the olives, hummus, and soft tangy feta cheese. There is also an English Pub but we never went there. We did order room service once or twice as well, which we enjoyed. My only complaint was that the water wasn't hot enough. We called to have it fixed and someone came immediately, but it didn't seem to make much difference, it only went from lukewarm to warm. If they are able to give an option for hot water they will keep their western patrons happier. Another strength for the hotel is the location. It is a very short walk to Bur Juman shopping center and the new metro (Khalid bin al Waleed station). It is also near the Bastakia Quarter, Dubai Museum, the Creek, and other attractions. We never had a problem catching a cab near the hotel either.
