We had never been to Ocean City or stayed at a Holiday Inn. We were pleasantly surprized. The hotel is not fancy but the location on the beach makes up for the lack of updates. For us with boys 17, 14 and 7 the pools both indoor and out were a nice option and break from the beach. We could hang out on the beach and take a mid afternoon break for lunch (either at the pool or in the room) and then head back to the beach. The beach was really pretty ( I am from Long Island) with clean water and lots of waves. Even for really littles ones who may not swim the high tides would create tidal pools on the beach for them to play in. The pool has a swim up bar and lots of chairs. PS you need to bring your own beach chairs and umbrella for the beach or be prepared to rent for the day. Rooms are pretty basic with two double beds and pull out double sofa. A little cramped for us when the pull out sofabed was open, but doable. Best was the balcony overlooking the beach (have to rent beachfront view for upcharge when hotel full). We had coffee, lunch and wine out there. Rooms have a small kitchenette which really comes in handy for doing breakfast and or lunch in the room. Room was clean and maids attentive. Folks at the front desk where very pleasant and helpful. Only complaint was I asked for a high floor and when we got there they put us on 2. Front desk said they had not record of the request. If you book online you have to call in this request. I did but they never noted. Turned out okay as we were able to call down to some of our kids to hand up boggie boards etc. View was fine but could have been better with a higher floor.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGood Vibes on the Beach\u201d", "Author": "John S", "ReviewID": "UR138965754", "Content": "Great service even though we had a tough situation - we had to change rooms as availability for our dates was very limited.

I thought the service, amenities, and price where all above acceptable. The room was a little run-down, but about what I expect for such a busy vacation spot. The restaurant was very reasonable (they had a kids-eat-free offer though we didn't take advantage). The pool, game room, and gym are open late. I think the game room was something like 5AM to midnight. The gym was decent with free weights and machines, I used it several times. An indoor pool with 2 hot tubs, a nice outdoor pool, and very close to the beach. We were far from the boardwalk, but having gone to the boardwalk once I think it's no big deal. Much of the boardwalk is hotels and some cheapo stores, then you get to the fun area around the Jolly Roger At the Pier and other (expensive) activities. We spent one day on the boardwalk, and it was plenty. The staff was very friendly, though we had no major problems to ask assistance on. I was a bit worried about the hotel before booking because of reports of the state of the rooms, and ours was not perfect. But, I was really the only one who noticed and I was just looking for issues. The view was spectacular (7th floor facing ocean) and it seems like most of the rooms would have an excellent view (and if not, opened right out onto the pool or dune). We had fears of drunks sitting in the pool at the swim-up bar, but it was all very family-friendly during our visit. I was woken up once be our neighbors at 3AM, but I am a light sleeper and the soon quited down. It is a busy place.

If I sat on the edge, it sank down alarmingly. The next day, I just casually asked the front desk \"when are the mattresses due to be changed out, I think ours is shot\" and they replied they replace them every year. I was not actively complaining or looking for a change, but the next thing we knew, they had a new mattress installed on our bed. What really made this visit special was our balcony that overlooked the ocean where my wife and I could drink coffee and watch the dolphins. Sitting there every morning, we observed the maintenance guys doing the morning pool and walkway cleaning, etc. They followed the same, thorough process every time. It was evident that whoever is in charge of daily mainenance has an excellent training and followup program in place. Every day, there was also painting or some other extra maintenance activity going on. We loved the full kitchen and also appreciated the fresh fruit in the lobby. The staff was the friendliest and most helpful I've encountered in many years of travel. This may not be the newest or a \"flagship\" Holiday Inn, but the care taken by the staff makes it feel that way. We also like the location near Rt.90 - that lets us loop around Ocean City to visit the rest of our family at Frountier Town campground (we give our Motorhome to the kids/grandkids there) and out of the congested mess further south. Parking was good and easy, with very good beach access so we could leave our sand chairs in the car and pick them up on the way out to the beach. The beach is really nice there too. We'll stay there again. Suggestion: I think the box springs on the bed are due to be replaced (room 714). Even with the new mattress, there was a lack of support on the bed. Maybe consider going to a firm foundation with a foam mattress? Foam mattresses have come a long way in the last 10 years. Anyway, thanks for a very pleasant week at Ocean City.

The room we got was not what we would've liked but we made ut work for us as it was a mini trip. Now our last trip which was back in July was one that has/is making me second think my future stay here. Again, the front desk staff, the lady who's name I neglected to capture, was again not the most helpful and sincere person. We asked for a room in one of the top floors but was told that the only room they had available was one on the 3rd floor. We told her that is not high enough for us. We asked her if she had one on the 5th or above and she said no. She then told me that the only other room available was on the 2nd floor. Now, if I'm asking for a room on one of the top floors what in her right mind would think I would even consider a room on the 2nd floor. Then, she proceeded to let us know that the room on the 3rd floor is right across from the ice machine. At that point we were left with really no option but to choose the 3rd floor. Now the one thing she neglected to tell us is that it's a corner room, at the inner nook of the hotel with a very poor view of the ocean.

So, here goes...Upon arrival, the hotel seemed fine. We were taken care of right away at the front desk and went right up to the room. Well, the hotel is older, but that's no excuse for dirty common areas. I understand that this is a \"beach front\" hotel, and guest trail in sand, etc., but the hallways were filthy, the windows seemed like they had not been cleaned in years. My kids were ready to jump ship when they saw the place. There was a huge dust ball that I watched for the 5 days in the corner of the wall when you get off the elevator and it never moved. There was also so much sand on the carpet in the hallways and that too was never addressed-never vacuumed.. The glass elevator looked as iff someone smeared vaseline on the windows. HOWEVER, on the bright side, our room, while older, was clean and had a great set up. I was redeemed when the family saw the room with full kitchen, big beds, fireplace and flat screen tv. We also had a balcony with a wonderful view of the ocean. Luckily, I brought my own febreeze and lysol to kill the musty odor. It was incredibly humid the week we were there so that only made it worse. I went out and bought one of those wax air freshners which did the trick. At least, we had a clean and fresh-smelling environment once we got into our room. The cleaning staff was excellent and kept the place spotless. I even asked that they vacuum the sofa as the previous guests left a bucket of sand on and between the cushions, and they did it with no problem. They would even come around at the end of the day and ask if you needed more bath or kitchen towels. You could not beat the proximity to the beach. We were just steps away with lifeguards and bathrooms and the outdoor grill. The pool was nice, but smaller than it looked in the photos. The location of the hotel on the strip was also good. A grocery store and tons of resturants within walking distance. Ocean City itself was too commercialized for my tastes and I wished I had gone a few miles north to Bethany Beach in DE. So, would I recommend this hotel to others? Depends on your expectations and druthers. We will probably not return to Ocean City, as there are just too many other nicer areas on the east coast. You can take my comments with a grain of salt, or should I say sand, if you really like the area.

The hotel staff was first rate and GENUINELY friendly. We're not needy guests by anyone's standard but the few small requests we made were graciously accomodated. I've been to plenty of seasonal areas where the locals kind of resent the tourists but the people in maryland seemed to \"get\" the fact that us tourists represent the lifeblood of their economy and they truly made us feel welcomed both in the hotel and all over OC in general. There is a restaurant on premises that serves a continental breakfast buffet and doubles as a french retaurant in the evening. The food wasn;t great but we understand that coming from the NYC area our standards may be a bit more elevated than others. I've seen a couple of complaints about this hotel on the site but after staying there i'm thinking the authors of those opinions had unrealistic expectations going in. Ocean City is not the Hamptons and this hotel is not the 4 Seasons. If you're looking for that type of service/accomodations you probably shouldn't be in Ocean City in the 1st place. This area is a family oriented seaside resort town for people who want to bring their kids down to the beach for some good clean fun. plenty of water sports, boardwalk/beach type of stuff to do down here. it's also a very safe and reasonably priced area. as such, the hotel fits in perfectly.

We didn't like the view from the room they initially put us in so we requested another room and they changed our room with no problem and the view from the 4th floor was spectacular, overlooking the entire beach and pool area. Everything was clean & neat. The Reflections and The Sterling restaraunts were excellent! The service was awesome! The food was great! OMG! The honey drizzled biscuits with the whipped salty butter is to die for, later we ordered 9 biscuits to go! The alcoholic beverages were delish and they didn't skim on the alcohol! The other guests were very friendly and respectful. Nice family atmosphere and pet friendly. The hotel wasn't noisy. This hotel is a true beach front, practically sits on the ocean. The hotel was like a little resort. You really don't have to leave this hotel for anything except to go to the boardwalk, which is kind of far, not within walking distance. But it's nice to be away from all the noise and traffic of the boardwalk. Swim up pool side outdoor bar, indoor bar, plenty of hammocks, 2 good restaurants, fast food restaraunt outside, kiddie pool, indoor and outdoor pool, indoor jacuzzi, nice clean pathways complete with trees and greenery that are well kept, very small game room (not very entertaining for kids), gym room, computer room, huge tennis court (which will be renovated into a larger pool area soon according to staff), dvd players in room, flat screen LG tv's, kitchenette has all the little amenities (completed with full fridge, toaster, electric stove, can opener, microwave, coffee maker, dishwasher, we found silver ware!, cabinets, dishwashing/dishwasher liquid). The maintainance crew responds very quickly. There's a liquor store right across the street, along with some other little stores and a roof top club/bar. Beds were clean and soft, we slept very well. My only complaint/suggestion ~ if you want a good view stay at or above the 4th floor. It can be a bit noisy from the 3rd floor on down because of the people traffic. You must be specific about the type of view you want, if that is important to you. The rooms feel a bit moist because it's right on the beach so it can be a littly musty/misty feeling but it's not that bad. It was a little pricey but worth it.

We arrived pretty late... around 12:30 AM... and when we got there I asked them if we could have a room with a view of the ocean. The guys at the front desk were SO incredibly nice and had no problem upgrading us. They also answered many questions that we had about the beaches around Ocean City as well as Assateague and Chincoteague (that's really why we were staying over in the first place... we're from PA and wanted an easier drive in the morning down to Assateague Island). The location was great. It's right off of 65th street... which is not by the main part of the Boardwalk but for me that was perfect because there was less noise. The actual property is literally off of the beach (very clean beach)... where we went for a walk for a few minutes at night before turning in to bed.

Before even getting to the room, we had to walk down the hallway where the floors are so off kilter that there is the constant impression that it will collapse at any moment - easily 5-10 degrees off level down the length of the hall. The door to our room was warped and would not close completely (you have to use your body weight to push the door enough to close the security latch) and the layout of the room was horrible - if you open the front door all the way, it bangs into the table that is in the kitchen area (and dont even get me started on the way that the bathroom is designed). Speaking of the bathrooms, it was very disappointed to see old, frayed towels being hung in a Holiday Inn - we arent talking slightly used...we are talking ones that have long since been donated to the local community college since they are no longer presentable to company. Just embarrassing. The hotel does offer breakfast vouchers for their guests, so we tried Reflections one morning. Only one morning. We were there during the week so it wasnt the buffet and it was highly disappointing. Eggs: overcooked. Potatoes: old, soggy, and tasteless. Bacon: cold, coagulated grease.

I went to the front desk early and told the young woman that I wouldn't be staying another night and needed to check out. She brought up my room and said with a smile that I was free to check out anytime...but I was still being charged for the night. The clerk and her manager proceeded to treat me like I was trying to rip them off by wanting money back on a special rate. This conference rate was the same as the online rate on their website. They were turning away customers that were calling in looking for rooms while they lectured me about policy. Nobody can lecture you about policy like a 20 something assistant manager and her team. In the end they did me the favor of refunding the nights stay but made sure I understood I had to be out by 11. The desk staff was young and inexperienced.

Long story short, neither place was helpful and my children with severe allergies were uncomfortable the entire stay. Please take my advice and do not stay at this hotel and DO NOT use Expedia/Hotel planner for reservations. The hotel itself is a 2 star at best. Very disappointed in the dishonesty and total lack of concern that both Holiday Inn and Expedia displayed.

We were there right before Labor Day weekend in August & wanted a family friendly, reliable name-brand hotel. We go to OC almost every August, so this was one of the better hotels. Room \u2013 it was a nice size room with a wonderful view of the Ocean & pool area. Rooms must have had \u201coutside\u201d entrances prior to the enclosure because there was a \u201clip on the door\u201d to get in & out of the room. Check in was easy & the people were super nice. Kids liked using the elevator that had a large window to the outside. We always found a parking (which was free since we were staygin at eth hotel) space. Restaurant \u2013 Reflections was almost too busy for breakfast. It\u2019s a small restaurant, so they can\u2019t accommodate a lot of people. Kids under 12 eat free, so that was a good deal but the proportions are really small. We ended up driving to fast food places or walking to the nearby grocery store for cereal, snacks & wine. They did have free whole fresh fruit (in the lobby) & free coffee and hot tea (near the indoor pool), so if that\u2019s all you need \u2013 then you are fine. For dinner we would drive to the boardwalk \u2013 it\u2019s wayyy too far to walk \u2013 so we had more choices. Outside Bar \u2013 right near outside pool & beach, so it was easy to get a snack, drink or lunch. The prices are comparable to a diner. Outside pool \u2013 was small and would get crowded quickly. They had some nice hammocks nearby, but none were in the shade so they didn\u2019t seem used much. It was nestled between the hotel & beach, so it had a nice atmosphere. Some other hotels pools face a parking lot or offered no shade, this pool was better. Inside pool & gym \u2013 inside pool was small, dark and unattractive. Many times they didn\u2019t have towels. Free gym is across from the inside pool, but we never used the equipment. It seemed pretty average. Tennis court & kids\u2019 activities \u2013 every day they had kids activities on the tennis court or inside a conference room. Mostly simple things like making an ice sundae, but they were free and it gave our kids another activity to do. Tennis courts were nice & were right next to the outdoor pool. I think you can get rackets for free \u2013 not sure since we didn\u2019t play tennis. Beach \u2013 great beach \u2013 bring your own umbrella & chairs (& towels) \u2013 as they can be pricey if you have to rent them each day.

This group manages several hotels and restaurants in Ocean City. The are long on promises and terribly short on delivery. We encountered them at several points in our planning. We visited many of their sites. We, like most trusting consumers were stupid enough to believe their sales pitch, accept their \"no problem\", and enter an agreement with them. It began innocently enough. We wanted a hotel with access to the beach. Our search led us to quite a few above the Route 90 bridge. After spending a good part of one morning, we had just about decided on one venue and we decided to check with the Oceanfront Holiday Inn. Of course our group was not the largest of the season, but we expected to need between 10 and 15 rooms. The manager took us on a tour of the property, finishing with a visit to the top floor of the Ocean front rooms. There were three of them on the top floor. We wanted a smoking room and were told that these were the only smoking rooms on the Ocean front. The manager said there would be no problem guaranteeing one of the rooms. Lourdes shared phone calls and emails with the hotel staff regarding prices and how guests would be able to guarantee the promised rate. Things were moving very smoothly. Imagine our shock and surprise when we checked in the Thursday evening before the wedding to discover that the room saved for us was on the second floor and non-smoking. The manager on duty began his corporate trained drone \"We can not guarantee any rooms. This is the only room that fits your criteria.\" We pointed out that it did not fit our criteria and it was not what we were promised. The young man, true to the Harrison Group model of \"Kiss my a**, you are here and stuck with what we decide to give you\", began repeating the same mantra over and over again. He told us that if we wanted a top floor room, he had one that was overlooking the pool. He gave us a room key and we went a looked. Lourdes allowed that we had no choice but to make the best of the situation but she would only take a room if she could have the end unit. We returned to the front desk. Friends that had flown in for the wedding were coming in the front door. They waited to check in while Lourdes made her request. The young man replied, \"I'm sorry, the end unit is being held for a member of your party.\" I asked, \"How is that possible, you said you did not guarantee rooms.\" The lad countered with \"No sir, you are wrong. I said we could not guarantee specific rooms. The people we are holding it for requested a top floor room.\" I then asked him if the room he offered and the room he was holding were exactly the same type of rooms, the only difference is one is in the middle of the building and one is at the end of the building.\" He said \"Yes sir, but we are holding the room at the end of the building for a member of your party.\" The room was being held for our guests, they stepped up and said they were fine with a room in the middle of the building. We were then given the room at the end of the building. Lourdes then asked \"Will we be refunded the difference?\" Mr. Harrison Group looked stunned, \"No mam, you will not receive a refund. You are not due any money.\" Lourdes pointed out that the room we were promised and the room we were given were not the same price. She pointed out that we should not be charged the higher rate. The manager looked her in the eye and said \"No. You are wrong. You are not due any money.\" At this point I allowed \"Son, you are in over your head, get your boss on the phone.\" His retort was, \"No sir, you are wrong. I have worked for the Harrison Group for several years and I know exactly what I am doing.\" Lourdes once again tried to point out the error of his ways. He suddenly said \"OK, maybe we do owe you a refund.\" I will not bore you with the rest of the exchange. It involved the hotel being unable to locate reservations and desk personnel speaking rudely when asked any questions. Maybe the people working for the Harrison Group have a problem dealing with people that actually expect to receive what they were promised. The day of the wedding, another of our guests decided to eat breakfast in the hotel restaurant (another of the typical Harrison Group establishments). They were seated. A very pleasant mixed race couple and their two daughters. They placed their order and waited. Several groups of golfers came in a placed their orders. (The Harrison Group also brings in golfing groups). The golfers received their meals and paid and left. Our friends were still sitting there. Finally, the mom stood up and walked into the kitchen and told them it was time to bring out their meal...now. She was met with blank stares. Eventually the meals were served, almost an hour after being ordered. Maybe the people working for the Harrison Group have a problem dealing with people that aren't part of the golf package deals. Our visit came to an end and we began to pack. As I was sitting on the bed, the head board came off and crashed to the floor. Lourdes had her wedding bouquet in a vase and our portion of the wedding cake in a box. I went downstairs to check out and let them know the bed had fallen apart. I stopped in the restaurant and asked the waitress if they had a walk-in refrigerator that we could store the flowers and cake in while we enjoyed on last morning on the beach. She said no problem. I went to the front desk to check out and told them about the bed falling apart. The clerk laughed and said \"Oh, you're the newly weds. Don't worry about it.\" Lourdes came down with the luggage. I went to put it in the car while she took the flowers and cake to the restaurant. She encountered a different waitress that told her she would have to check with her manager first. She disappeared in the kitchen to find the manager. I came in and Lourdes was still standing there. She told me she would be right back and went back into the kitchen. The waitress that had gone seeking the manager was standing in the kitchen talking on her cell phone. Lourdes asked \"I thought you were going to get the manager?\" The girl replied \"I haven't seen her yet.\" Lourdes said \"you have left me standing out front for 15 minutes, waiting for you to bring the manager.\" The waitress replied \"Look lady, I'm not even on the clock.\" and turned and walked away. \"I am the customer here. You can not treat me like this. I only asked you to do your job.\" The girl kept on walking. Lourdes picked up the flowers and the cake and came out of the kitchen as angry as I have ever seen her. \"Doesn't she know I am the customer and I don't know if she is on the clock or not?\" We left...I don't think we will be back. Maybe the Harrison Group doesn't have a problem with anyone. Maybe the Harrison Group doesn't care about anything other than lining their pockets. After all, they make money off of tourists and they have their customers by the \"short hairs\" by the time they show up. It may not put a dent in their business, but it is only fair to warn everyone. This company is horrid and void of any semblance of integrity or customer service.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel for the Off Season in Ocean City\u201d", "Author": "guinn777", "ReviewID": "UR119447707", "Content": "This hotel is great year round; don't get me wrong.

We got to our room and noticed how hot it was. Looking at the thermostat, the room was at 75 degrees with the A/C set to 68. The room was muggy so we turned down the A/C. I played with the thermostat for a bit and found the fans do not really change strength. And, seeing as the room temp didn't feel like it was changing, I dropped the A/C down to 60 degrees to get the room cooler quicker... or so I thought! Hours later, the room temp finally dropped to 70 degrees! We had to keep the A/C cranked low in order to keep the room cool. Second, we ordered a smoking room. There was no ash tray, so we called the front desk. During that time, a large thunderstorm rolled in. A waterspout occurred a few blocks down. When we went out in the hall to see what the commotion was about, we saw a hotel staff member running down the hall to show others the waterspout. After he made his comment about how he didn't care, he lives miles from here and is leaving now, he began to walk back toward the elevators. We noticed he had an ash tray in his had and asked if that was for our room number. He said 'yea' and stood there at the end or the hall with his hand stuck out to us instead of walking it to us at our room door. Third, shortly after the waterspout hit, the hotel lost power. The generators kicked in (which were noisy) and the power in the room flicked back on.... for about a second. We then had to sit in a hot hotel room with no power, no word of whether we should move to another location due to this waterspout, nothing. In about an hour or more the power returned. After that, we decided to get dinner. We returned to the hotel and, at that time, noticed the room had only reached 70 degrees after having the A/C on for 3.5 hours. After feeling very disappointed in Ocean City itself, we decided to go try and relax in the hot tub and pool. While in the pool, a couple came to the locked pool door (which you need a room key to enter - for a reason!!!) and began knocking on the door wanting us to open it and let them in. They were obviously here for bike week (they knew some of the other bikers in the pool). They had to return to their room for their key. Upon entering the pool, the man gave us an attitude saying 'gee, thanks for opening the door for us'. I honestly don't care - the door has a lock for a reason- just use your darn key! Then, he pulls out a martini shaker to drink while in the indoor pool - with signs posted everywhere for no food or drink there! We went to the front seek and complained about his comment and attitude and about how he was drinking alcohol while in the pool.. they didn't seem to honestly care. We also looked into whether we could get a refund and leave this hotel and go back to Virginia Beach which was much more pleasent. The manager, Kyle, came out and COULD NOT look us in the eye while he told us he could not refund the pre-booked room. We called Holiday Inn's customer service line to question this and they said the hotel has the power to do it IF they choose to do so. Well, obviously $$$ here means more than customer service! I work in management - making the customer happy is your number one priority. Also, when you handle a complaint, you LOOK the customer in the eye to show them you understand their issue and problem and you sincerely want to help. Last, we realizes we forgot to put the parking permit back on our dashboard after dinner. Upon returning to our room in the elevator, 4 of the bikers here for the week were discussing whether or not they should have a foresome together that night. A real place to bring a family!

I'm not sure why checking my name and room number against the list wasn't sufficient. The wrist bands seemed tacky and unneccesary (and weird when you're trying to sunbathe) as the only way to get to the pool is really through the Hotel, I guess you could jump a fence off the beach but if you're trying that hard to \"pool crash\" ... more power to ya. The hotel has a restaurant, which is a plus. We had the breakfast buffett on our last day and the service was SLOW but the food was good although not as good as other local restaurants. The rooms aren't set up for wireless. And you have to request an ethernet cable even though the literature says each room comes with one.

Just a short drive from the boardwalk yet far enough not to have to deal with the noise or the crowds there. It's also located near many great restaurants and activites. This hotel is right on the beach so it was a very short distance to the water. The pool is great because it's situated behind the hotel, it's very private compare to the others on the strip that have their pools in their parking lots. My kids loved going to the beach in the early part of the day and then spending the rest of the afternoon in the outdoor pool. We love the food shack next to the pool. Great for a light afternoon snack. On the weekends it has such a festive atmosphere because of the live band that plays in the afternoon by the pool. My kids (17 yrs. old & 13 yrs. old) made great use of the indoor pool every night. The indoor pool was open till 12 midnight. The staff at the hotel are very pleasant and accomodating. They really go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant one. The room was comfortable and large enough for a family of 4. It's great that they have all the amenities of home (kitchenette). The room had free internet service which was a plus. We loved sitting on the balcony with the table and chairs enjoying our morning coffee as well as sitting out there in the evening listening to the waves roll in. The view was spectacular!

In short, here's the Good and Not So Good.... The room was OK, not great, although it had a lovely view of the pool, beach and ocean. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony on the 6th floor and listening to the ocean and enjoying the view. Ask for a room that faces the ocean (some rooms are 90 degrees to the ocean). The common areas are OK. The front desk was prompt and courteous. The indoor pool is pretty dark and unpleasant, and do NOT come to this hotel for the indoor pool. Coffee was available each morning in the game room. My one beef is with the beds. They seemed clearly smaller than \"full\" size beds, as it felt like we were squeezed onto an oversized twin, and that was not conducive to good sleeping. We did not hang out at the outdoor pool but it looked very crowded, with seemingly at least twice as many people in the enclosed area as there should have been. Again, if you want a quiet and mellow pool scene, go elsewhere. On the positive side, they had a good live band on Sat and Sun afternoon that we enjoyed from our balcony. The bulk of people staying there seemed to have small kids, and this hotel seems perfectly suited to that. The beach was excellent - good waves, clean, and a minimum of shells and debris. I give the beach an \"A\". With resepct to Ocean City, I was astounded by the amount of traffic and a 6 lane busy highway running down the middle of it. It would take 3-4 minutes of waiting just to catch a traffic light to be able to cross to the local stores. if you want a quiet shore town, OC MD is not it. Also, we went jet skiing, and I recommend it. However, do not use the marina on 66th street. The young staff there could not have been more disinterested and listless, ordering on beligerant. They acted like accomodating tourists was the worst thing they could be doing that day. At up to $75 a head they should at least try to show a little gratitude.

After going through insurance, I needed a place to stay. Most hotels could only let me stay for a few days, because it was the off season. But I was pointed to the Holiday Inn. Check in was less than desired. I got a room on the 7th floor, and I had to bring all my stuff up to my room myself. That did wonders on my back. But when I got settled in, I found the room was pretty nice, it had a good view of the ocean, and the beds where comfortable. I placed my order for breakfast and went to bed. I woke up realizing that breakfast never came, and that they didn't even get my order. I complained to the front desk, and left to eat elsewhere. Later that day my toilet was clogged... they made me do the unclogging. That night I placed my order for breakfast early and went to bed. Same thing happened, order didn't go through. I went and complained, and they directed me towards their restaurant. The food was actually pretty good. They also closed their pool for a day to contaminate it. Though having a horrible vision problem, I thought the sign was just labeling the indoor pool, just like the signs labeling all the other amenities. I was in there for about 10 minutes before somebody came to get me out. I guess that was my fault, though. I did have time to notice they had a jacuzzi or something like that. If you're on business and you need a high speed internet, their advertised high speed internet reminds me of the horrible days of dialup, minus the actual dialing. And before you ask, no, there's no wifi, unless you're on the ground floor. In your room, you need an Ethernet cable. They'll give you one at the front desk, but if you use a desktop PC or a gaming console, you'll probably have to go out and buy something long enough, there 4 foot chords don't cut it. There's also an HD TV... but as far as I can tell, all they have is basic cable, and a DVD player. So... what's the point? So to sum it up, this place feels more like a fully furnished 2 room apartment (including the bathroom as one room) than an actual hotel... until you look at the prices.

The room we were given was on the 7th floor, and was both non-smoking and came with 2 double beds as I had requested. The had an oddly placed kitchen table in the kitchenette which made entering and exiting the room quite cumbersome. I relocated the table and chairs to near the fireplace and that seemed to resolve the congestion. Check in was simple and the staff were courteous and helpful. There was a large bowl of free fruit (apples, oranges & bananas) next to the check-in desk. Can soda's from the soda machine were $0.40, something I had not seen in a very long time. There was a sign saying that they were putting a new face on an old place, or something like that as I entered the hotel. Yes, well, the hallways are hard and expensive to renovate, which I guess that's why they haven't. The rooms have been touched up. I'm guessing each room now has an LCD tv mounted over a fake fireplace in the corner of the room, it's a nice fake fireplace for the winter, but I think it would seem out of place in the summer. The bathroom looked and felt original. There was even a timer heat/sun tan light in it. I mean the bathroom worked fine, it just felt dated. Parking was plentiful and free in front of the hotel, but yes this is the off season for Ocean City. So the was parking available everywhere. Didn't get a chance to try the restaurant in the hotel, and I was given a discount coupon for it upon check-in, but the prices seemed a little high. I did visit the business center which was free, and did make use of the hottub in the pool area. The timer on the far hot tub was broken so if you set it to 10 minutes, the dial would remain on 10 minutes, even after 20 minutes. There is a common area video arcade with an unlimited coffee maker in the same room, on the Lobby floor. In all, this was a good stay. $0.40 can sodas!

Here are some of my thoughts: 1) Rooms-Were nice but not overwhelming considering the price we paid. Full kitchen was a money saver with two young kids. Our refrigerator broke early in the week, but was quickly replaced by the staff. They even moved all of our drinks and food from the broken frig to the new one. The bathroom was too small.32 inch Flat screen TV was a nice surprise as were the variety of TV channels.Kids were entertained whenever we were in the room. Oceanfront view from patio was priceless. Beds were comfortable. Overall i'm glad we paid extra for the oceanfront view which allowed us privacy in the morning and at night sitting on the patio. 2)Pool-I'm guessing 30 years ago the pool complex was THE place to be in OC, but it is in much need of a makeover or just a good cleaning. The pool bar is a nice addition, but it created some rather uncomfortable scenes with young kids splashing and playing near adults enjoying a cocktail. The restaurant and the sundecks were very nice and the whole atmosphere with the hammocks and palm trees was very nice. The hotel needs to consider getting rid of the tennis court and attaching another pool in that area. Something geared towards kids. With very limited lounge chairs around the pool, it is impossible for parents with young kids to sit in the upper areas while having kids swim. More room is needed. Clean up the current pool/bar but adding more kid-friendly pool space would elevate this hotel. The tennis court is a big waste of space. Hundreds would use the pool on a daily basis, compared to 10 or 12 people a day using the tennis court. Also, really surprised the pool closed at 8 daily. We would have loved to sat by the pool later with the kids swimming. Not sure what the reason was? 3) Gym-used it once. Was average at best. One stationary bike was not working very well. 4) Business center-very nice to be able to go check my work email every morning on one of the two very fast computers. The printer that was available was also a bonus. Very nice. 5) Kids club-Only used it once for a cooking class. Seemed like a nice option but with my kids getting older it wasn't something they wanted to do. 6) Beach-Fantastic access, nice sand, no problems at all. 7) Parking-Lots of spaces in the big lot very close to the entrance 8) Elevators-never waited at all. Overall, the hotel was very nice. My family enjoyed our stay. No real complaints except for the outdated pool area. We paid extra for a oceanfront view, which was a great decision, but the overall price for the rooms were high, which has made us consider going a different direction next year.

This is a remodeled old Holiday Inn. The rooms and lobby have been redone and seem new. Parts of the hotel, such as the indoor pool area, look more dated, but that is not a problem for me. Service is unreal, even compared to four-star hotels I stay at for business sometimes. I got a call about an hour after settling into my room asking if everything was OK. The room had a minor maintenance issue and it was taken care of promptly. The manager has his home phone number in the hotel information notebook and says to call if any problem is not resolved. I received a thank you note after I returned home. Great restaurant recommendations and other helpful info from the front desk staff. We had breakfast a couple of times in the restaurant, and it was fine. Same with lunch at the fun pool bar. A professional clown was present in the lobby during the days we were there to make balloon animals for the kids and have other fun -- the kids loved that. We made good use of the fun indoor pool during some cool days -- there are two hot tubs and a sauna in the same area. It is also nice they have soda machines dispensing 40-cent 12-ounce cans of soda.

HOW ROMANTIC (our 4 little guys ages 6,3,2 and 10 months all liked it too:):):) ha ha lol..... the really nice thing with having four littles here was that we could watch tv and we had a HUGE, thick curtain in between us where the tv was and it separated where the 2 beds were. There was a love seat and another comfy chair and we had gorgeous views of the ocean and we had requested the 6th floor i think it was and it was WONDERFUL. The place was clean, nice, updated and just amazing for a young family on a budget. I can't wait to go back next year. Hmmm maybe even this fall. The only thing that we would've liked would' have been to be right on the board walk but the guy on the phone warned me that with little kids he would stay further up and stay away from sleeping that close to all the partying that would be happening since it was \"Cruising\" Weekend at O.C. I am so glad we took his advice there was drunk people all over the place hanging out windows and on the front of the porches of the hotels SCREAMING at the car's and hey it was fun to watch the people and the cars but I would've been very upset if there loud behavior would've kept my little guys all weekend.

FIRST IMPRESSION: Upon my arrival, I found a beautifully updated lobby and staff proud to showcase it. This is a hotel that is under renovations and the lobby and guest rooms are complete ( I would say that is the most important part!!). What remains is to update the carpeting and wall design for the hallways and the lobby provides a sneak peak into how they will appear once complete. GUEST ACCOMODATIONS: The first room I was given was HUGE and from what I understand they are all the same size with small kitchens, flat screen televisions, clean updated bathrooms and comfortable beds. The rooms all feature a sitting area near the television with a balcony. If there was one drawback to room placement it would be the distance from the bed to the television...But the quality of the televsion compensated for that as it was easy to view from a distance. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I contacted Ryan at the front desk because the area I was in was a bit noisy with all the children from the conference I was there to participate in. He called me back within 2 minutes and arrived a short time later to escort me to a more upgraded room in a quieter part of the hotel...and for the same conference rate!! My new room was quiet and tucked away with a balcony that stepped out directly onto the beach. INTERNET ACCESS: The rooms do not have wi-fi, so I recommend bringing your hard connections (cat 5) to use the internet on laptops. However the connection is close to the kitchen bedroom area, where a small table functions perfectly as a desk area. ADDITIONAL AMENITIES: Did I also mention that this hotel has a FREE business center that includes 2 desktops and a printer?! For business travelers that need to print a few things on the go, it is perfect. The printer is not a laser, but an HP multifunction that can get the job done. This hotel also has a game room with arcade games, an indoor heated pool and jacuzzi area and a fitness area on the bottom level. FRONT DESK STAFF: Both Destiny and Natasha at the front desk were DELIGHTFULLY nice and helpful when helping with good places to eat. Without prompted, when they saw me leaving in the evenings they would ask \"Are you on your way to get something to eat?\" And then the suggestions followed.

We aren't Bikers but we wanted to go on a last minute vacation and we decided on Ocean City. The Hotel: When you are driving down Coastal Highway you get to 65th street and you see the hotel and the outside looks great. Grounds are clean, landscaped, and you breath a sigh of relief that you are at a nice place. Lobby: Very clean and a very friendly staff was waiting. Check in is 3:00pm and we got there about 4:30pm so we were in and out. I got a nice little welcome bag and we ready to go to our room. The Lobby also is where you enter the Hotels 2 restaurants. More on them later. Elevators: There were 3 elevators that worked fast, and had a nice open view of the Bay as you went up. Hall Way: We stayed in the East Wing Ocean Front on the 6th floor. Got out of the elevator to this strong smell of Lysol. The Hallway was the worst part of the Hotel. The rug was dingy and the smell of Lysol just was to much. Room: We opened our room to find an overall nice room for the money we paid. 2 double beds with lots of pillows, Sofa that turns into a bed, a whole kitchen (Oven, toaster, fridge, sink, and pots and pans, utensels, dishwasher) Very nice private balcony overlooking the beautiful Atlantic Ocean. The bathroom was small but as my wife said (\"it works). Overall the room was spacious and clean and that is what is important. I'm at the Ocean I'm not hanging out in my room, but if we had to the room was nice Hotel Ammenties Out door pool is very nice, lots of chairs to sit, and has a swim up bar. Bar is reasonably priced. There is also an outdoor bar/restuarant. There is a nice Tennis court (not sure if the hotel provided equipment) Also a nice place above the pool where they have hammocks set up. We took advantage of that. Game Room and workout room that has a tanning bed. My wife used the tanning bed in the morning and says it is great. She used it to hide those tan lines! LOL! Indoor pool, hot tub, and sauna. Indoor pool is shallow and was more busy then the outdoor pool. The indoor pool has towels for guests. Sauna worked very well. There are 2 hot tubs. The first one you come to doesn't work and hasn't but it does have nice hot water. The second one is awesome. Only drawback to the Indoor Pool area is the ceiling is rusty and they tile needs to be grouted. Basic up keep needs to be done. Location: for us it was perfect we were about 5 minutes North of the Boardwalk and Inlet where all the Bikers were. Plenty of shops and restuarants in walking distance. If you want to be closer to the boardwalk then I would try the other Holiday Inn. Restuarants/Shops: Acrross from the hotel we found was the best gift shop and a nice litte wine store. Also a great resturant called Castaways. I 100% recomend Castaways to anyone. We also ate ate at Doughboys which is a chain that is a step up from a Diner, but overall not bad. I have to give a shoutout to Paisano's on the boardwalk. Best Pizza on the Boardwalk! Give them try.l Overall the Holiday Inn was a nice place for my wife and I to stay at. We liked it so much we will be coming back in 2009 during Bike week. Bike week is cool for a few reasons. Its not peak season so the prices go down, but all the atttractions are still open.

They tried to give a room with a different view - with no price break - so we decided to wait - and wait we did. (The reason we called first was so we wouldn't be waiting, since I saw that people had problems) There was no sorry, just a surly attitude - so as we were waiting and waiting -- in the parking lot we saw a car with its window smashed. We told them there was a car with the window broken and asked if there is any type of security for the parking lots - all she said was hmm.. thats the first I heard of the broken window - but we're not responsible for your car. Just plain rude. We made sure to park in the front lot - not the side one. The hotel has an awful stale odor - a mix between a dog kennel and dead fish.

Once in the room - I will say that view was nice, but the room was hot and muggy. The tile floor - right when you walk in was damp & I almost killed myself when I slipped - and I was wearing boat shoes! Air conditioning was barely working - but at least we could open the door to try to air the place out. The room was also so smelly and run down.

The pool area was nice, with a great bar, and a nice feature were the 8 to 10 hammocks the hotel provided next to the beach. The staff was friendly. There was plenty of parking, and a small grocery store directly across the Coastal highway.

Hotel looks very dated and is in need of a complete makeover. Carpet was nasty & dirty and was always wet in front of dishwasher. Paid for oceanfront (was told I got an oceanfront) -- but I really got a 2nd floor garden view-- could see water (but not beach) if you looked between trees, tennis court & pool. Read the fine print. Not all rooms have dvd players, room dividers, fireplaces, or in-room safes. Kitchen utensils were sparse. Came back to room after it had been cleaned to find deadbolt on door set so door wouldn't close. Fortunately, nothing was taken. Inquired with management about security. Was told it was a very high priority & would be addressed. Next day, observed maids doing the same thing. Also, had to evacuate the building at 2:15 am, due to an emergency in the building. Although, it's not the Holiday Inn's fault, I didn't appreciate having to take 2 small children out of bed. On a positive side, \"kids eat free\" was nice and I liked the free fruit available all day in the lobby.

We got there before our room was supposed to be ready, but were allowed to check-in anyway. One of my friends is a platinum member and asked for an upgrade. The clerk upgraded us from a gardenview to an oceanview (which was nice...but no need to spend the extra money on oceanview in my opiniom). We got some coupons, discounts, and freebies upon checking-in as well. We were also given as many parking passes as we wanted! The room we booked had 2 beds, a fold-out, 1 bath, tv, balcony, and full kitchenette - as advertised. It was all in one long room rather than divided up, which was a little surprising, but not a big deal. We needed more bath linens and pillows for the 6 of us and the service at this hotel consistently proved to be great. They delivered anything we needed right away. Housekeeping was very tidy. The front desk was friendly and well-staffed. In terms of amenities, the hotel had just about everything - beach access, outdoor pool with multiple lounging areas, pool bar, outdoor bar and grill (open for lunch), shuffleboard, tennis court, video games, ice and vedning machines, indoor pool, exercise room, and more. There were also two restaurants near the lobby - an upscale \"French/American\" and a seafood/raw bar. We didn't eat in either of those so we can't comment. One of the restaurants also served the typical Holiday Inn breakfast (Since we had the suite, we bought our own breakfast fixings and ate in the room each morning). The outdoor bar and grill was good for lunch. The hotel could have used a more \"pedestrian\" restaurant open for all three meals, though there are no shortage of restaurants in Ocean City! It is across the street from a supermarket, restaurant, candy store, and surf shop, and you can catch the bus right there as well. In summary, the service was outstanding, the room was as advertised, and there were a good amount of amenties; I would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salisbury, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNice experience\u201d", "Author": "JTone_and_the_Mrs", "ReviewID": "UR7226146", "Content": "We spent the weekend at the Holiday Inn Oceanfront and were very impressed. We were in the East Wing Oceanfront (I think that's what it was called) on the 7th floor, in the middle of the wing. If we were staying there again I think we would ask for a similar room, if not further down the wing toward the end. From our balcony we had a fabulous view of the ocean. Had we been lower we may have been somewhat obstructed by the trees and the outdoor pool area. We also had a great bayside view in the hallway outside our door. We opened the door one evening and watched the sun set while we made dinner. The Kitchenette was top notch! Had a dishwasher, oven, microwave, even an electric can opener and toaster. It came equiped with dishes, silverware and cook ware. We were set to be able to cook on our own. Very important for us, due to the fact that we have a child who has serious food allergies and we have to prepare ALL his food ourselves. The room was a nice size for a hotel room. There was an area with a pull out sofa and TV along with the bed area and kitchen area. It was very comfortable. The room was pretty clean, and I'm VERY picky. I've been in top notch hotels and some that well...once were top totch. I would recommend this hotel to someone looking for a clean, comfortable room. The arcade, indoor pool were a great plus. Our kids spent quite some time enjoying the pool. The arcade had a pool table that was quite some fun for our 8 year old. We ordered room service during our stay and it was very nice. Great service and timely. A nice treat! I would recommed this hotel. We live nearby and often are looking for good places to suggest to family and friends to stay. This one is on our list.

They have added some hammocks overlooking pool on one side and beach on the other. A private oasis. Not glitzy or swank. But functional, clean and very nice. Small but useful indoor pool. They have upgraded the hot tubs to have a separate, private area. Game room for the kids. Far enough away from boardwalk to offer some quiet and less crowded beach and roads. But, close enough so you can get there easily if you want to. A little price, but that comes with a beachfront hotel. Only complaint was that for some reason they could not get our phones to work.
