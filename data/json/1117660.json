I wasn't initally convinced about the area (our taxi driver from the airport couldn't find it!) but it beame clear in the morning that the area was fantastic. Just minutes away from Repubblica underground station and on a street lined with loads of shops, restaurants and fast food joints (2 McDonalds and a Burger King). Can't fault the location, or the staff at the reception who were lovely and were more than happy to help us with directions or anything else. However, everything else wasn't wonderful. While the reception staff (who are interchangable with the bar staff) were lovely, none of the staff in the bar were nearly as nice. Our Italian was terrible, but they automatically spoke to us in English but were very curt and aprupt. Breakfast itself wasn't bad for the room price, very basic. The room we had was very basic and the hot water failed us on the third day. The wheel on my bed also broke on the last night It was quite warm but for some reason the windows wouldn't open. Add to that the building site that was the church next door and the noise from the pub until 3 in the morning directly beneath us it wasn't the quietest either! I think this would be fine for students or interrailing travellers who want something fairly cheap, but anything else wouldn't really suit!", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cnot good\u201d", "Author": "mario m", "ReviewID": "UR125532946", "Content": "Just few rooms over a pub.

The underground is a couple blocks away and there is some stores at walking distance. The only inconvenience, if you could say so, is that we check in a few blocks away from the actual building, and with suitcases, it can be a little overwhelming for some people traveling with many items. If you want a great restaurant suggestion: la taverna dei Monti, Via del Boschetto, 41, 00184 Roma - maybe 6 or 7 blocks away but we had dinner 3 out of 6 days we stayed in Rome.

The location was perfect for me, 100 metres from the Republica Metro station. But this isn't a hotel, it's like a half pub half hotel, so the staff seem to be from the pub. If you need anything you have to go to the pub and get their attention, in between them serving people at the bar. The room had no windows, well there was a 2x1 foot window above a locked door leading out to the roof I think. The room was clean enough, en-suite, TV with plenty of stations ( only found 2 English TV stations), safety deposit box and small chilled mini-bar. The air conditioning unit in my room didn't seem to work well. At night, there was a lot of noise from various machinery/air conditioning units/fans etc outside. ( which was behind the hotel on various flat roofs ) I had brought foam earplugs which solved that issue. Then there were about 4 mosquitoes in my room, and when I turned off the light to sleep they took turns biting me. I have 12 bite marks at the moment. I'd be worried about the same mosquitoes biting numerous guests and transmitting disease between them. There was the red blood splattered remains of 5 other mosquitoes on the ceiling were other guests had the same problem.", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBring an alarm, an accurate clock, and good walking shoes...\u201d", "Author": "AllAround24", "ReviewID": "UR32601540", "Content": "The room was a 5 minute walk from the check-in.

They have only 11 rooms 4 above the Irish bar and the other 7 are across the road around a side street. You go through a main door and up a lift to the second floor and then another key to get into the foyer area rooms are off this We were first given room 104 which was very small and dark due to being in the center of the building so your outlook was into the well of the building. Not good Tonnio arranged a change of room the next day. Room 103 this one looked out onto the street with a small balconey. My friends were given the family room which sleeped 3 comfortable over looking the quite street. We were awoken to the sound of church bells every morning Fab. Rooms are small but very clean and modern. Good shower although small so do not drop your soap.If they wanted to improve their rooms l would recommend they put in a tall mirror for us ladies and please tea/coffe making it is a long walk in the morning to get that first coffe fix.. Breakfast is taken at the Irish bar and is the bog standard coffee,orange juice toast and croissant all waiter service if you want to upgrade to a cooked breakfast there is only a small charge. Best of all you can walk to all the sites. It is in a safe part on the city.
