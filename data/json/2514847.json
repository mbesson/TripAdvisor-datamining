Amazing staff, we were there for a special occasion and they were absolutely perfect, present but not overbearing, relaxed but pro, and excellent advice from the sommelier. Beautiful restaurant (despite the noisy marble floors!) with gorgeous crystal water glasses that hypnotize. So now on to the VERY disappointing hotel, for us in any case. Last year we stayed at the Ritz and the George V, excellent hotels, both at entry level categories that were then upgraded. So when the \"palace\" category was announced and we saw that neither hotel was on the list we thought, wow, a palace worthy hotel must be even better! So we reserved at the Bristol, again entry level category that was upgraded. Immediate disappointment: lobby and hallways much less elegant than the other two hotels, room sad looking, much less opulent than expected, fabrics faded and banal. We had a small balcony with two almost plastic looking chairs and peeling paint here and there. Large bathroom but space gained at the expense of a tiny dark claustrophobic shower, ONE plug only, when seated in the tub (which could have used more scrubbing in the corners) you could see under the sink the plastic tubes that had been hastily covered with a bit of flaking paint! Bath products: Herm\u00e8s soap, great, but that's it- the other products are Anne Semonin, AWFUL smell and conditioner so sticky I had to re-wash my hair with shampoo. Turn down service- person came in while we were still in the room, didn't bother to offer to come back later, did everything around us, didn't replace the products we'd opened, and put away the cushions on our terrace chairs without even asking us! Her behavior was so unexpected versus what we'd experienced before we didn't even know what to say. Last note: nice pool, but products available disappointing compared to other hotesl- no combs, razors, etc. All this would seem trivial in another category, but this is supposed to be a \"PALACE\". Maybe you get that feeling only if you stay in a suite, but then, the suites at all the five stars are relatively opulent, we thought that we'd really feel the difference in a lesser category. We voiced our concerns at check-out, met with cold indifference (even told \"yes, others have complained about the products!\") without any offer to improve our disappointing stay. In the two other hotels we left our rooms with regret and one wish- to come back asap- not at all the case at the Bristol.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent.superb-breathtaking\u201d", "Author": "Paula G", "ReviewID": "UR126978189", "Content": "We cannot praise this hotel and their staff highly enough.We were treated wonderfully from the moment we arrived.Everyone spoke english and just made us feel as though we were their only concern. my husband was celebrating his birthday and after a busy day sightseeing we returned to our suite and there was a beautiful chocolate cake and a letter of congratulations there.

It was a rainy day and our taxi stopped outside the hotel, 2 staff was standing ready with umbrellas open and covered us until until we reached the door. Check in was as told from 3 and we arrived a bit before 2 so we were told our room should be ready at 3, totally understanable we went out for lunch. Came back at 3:30 and our room was getting ready so thay said to have a drink in the bar, we did and 5 minutes later was told that the room was ready and the bar bill was picked up by the hotel. Very nice gesture. Our junior suite was stunning, completly refurnished and very fresh. Big livingroom, big bedroom, walk in closet, pink marble bath room and etc.. And a chilled bottle of sancerre on the house. We felt pampered. Throughout the stay we where only met by extremly nice staff smiling and wanted us to feel at home and to our service. This has to be the best hotel experience ever and i have stayed at lots of hotels like this, but they are best in class i think. You cant beat location either.

Being a student, staying at Le Bristol was a special treat so I wanted to make sure it was all perfect. I emailed the reception explaining the occasion asking if there was anything they could do, and also the restaurant about my lunch booking. Upon arriving at the hotel at 10am (5 hours before check-in time) the door porter walked up to the car, opened the door, and said good morning Mr Gibbs. My instant reaction was how did he even know I was Mr Gibbs?! He hadn't seen my luggage, didn't know what car I was arriving in, nor the fact I was arriving in the morning. I could have been any young man turning up that morning. My luggage was taken in an instant, I was lead to the reception, where every single member of staff beamed at me. This lobby is like a dream, and you can see why it received palatial status and also featured in midnight in Paris. It's beautiful. The friendly receptionist told me all I needed to know, took my luggage etc, and confirmed our lunch reservation. I asked to go to the toilet, and as she walked me down the hall we passed the restaurant. Again, I could have been anyone, but the lady at the podium instantly said, Hello Mr Gibbs, just to confirm your reservation is at 1:30pm. How did they do this?! The receptionist also overheard me talking to my partner about our Louvre trip, and offered to give us a map, tips, etc. When we came back to the hotel we went to eat in the 3 Michelin star restaurant. This was BRILLIANT value for money. We had 3 courses, with probably another 4 mini courses if you include the extras, all for 80 something pounds. The restaurant was beautiful, the service was incredible (the woman raced me to get back to my chair first when I returned from the loo, just to pull it out for me, they regularly swept crums away and service was like a military operation it was so precise). The food was something to die for, and the staff overheard us saying how much we liked the sweets at the end, and brought us out boxes of them to take back to the room. They even wrote a message to my partner on his desert to celebrate the occasion, complete with gold leaf. We enjoyed some wonderful afternoon tea to finish. When we left, there was a lady ready to take us to our room instantly. We walked through the beautiful hotel, up the famous lift, to our room. We had been upgraded to an incredible suite with a separate lounge, huge bedroom, huge bathroom. I have been to some nice hotels, but this was just incredible. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever experienced. And waiting in the lounge, was a beautifully crafted desert, with gold leaf, a chocolate plaque on which Happy Birthday was written, petals with sugar dew drops, leaves made out of chocolate. And a vintage bottle of champagne, all on a neatly laid out trolley with white table cloth and fine cutlery, and a message from the manager. Just incredible. We went to the pool where the changing rooms had their own little steam rooms, and that was lovely. When we went back to the room, the bed had been turn down with roses and petals spread all over, each petal evidentially placed very precisely, rather than just chucked on. Amazing!! It got better. On several occasions they sent someone just to replace the ice bucket for our champagne, and they even made the desert all over again so we didn't have to eat a half finished one when we fancied it again. We called and asked for some bags and shaving stuff. The hotel brought up a huge selection, and about 5 different typed of bags to choose from. I have no idea how they got to the door so quickly - they must have someone waiting on each floor?! We also left our shoes outside to be buffered up. The hotel didn't just clean them, they changed the laces, and even fixed my heel, then painted over any scuffs so they looked brand new!! The next morning we had breakfast, which was lovely, and then checked out having spoken to the manager who spoke perfect English and was a very friendly man, clearly taking the time to get feedback from as many people as he could. And not just to look good, but to listen and constantly improve the hotel. If you want to stay somewhere that will make your dreams come true for a little while, and will make you feel like you're in a romantic film, then stay at Le Bristol. The service is on a level of its own compared to any other hotel I have stayed at in the world. You will be amazed, fact.

Renovations were still underway whilst we were there contrary to some reviews but they did not affect us too negatively (we were warned about it in the room we selected and the rate was adjusted accordingly I believe). Yes, there were hick ups (car sent to pick us up was WAY too small). When we returned for the second time, our room was not ready. However, the bunnies and aprons and freshly cooked rabbit biscuits on the bed all made up for any of that. There was a language barrier after all. We loved the location, so close to the Champs Elysee, Le Louvre and the view from the rooftop pool over to the Eiffel tower was incredible. The pool area is small and, contrary to what one reviewer has said about a life guard, I would prefer to watch my own children in the pool and read the paper in privacy as it is not a large space like the Four Seasons pool in HK for example.

She just loves the place and wants to come back again. We booked through LHW and used a free night earned for the first night. We should have had a room move as a hotel cannot provide the free accommodation in prestige room, but luckily we were accommodated in the prestige room from the first night. And it was really awesome. I stayed at deluxe junior suite in 2010, very huge, with huge bathroom. But this one was not small, and I even liked it more. All blue and beige fabrics and nice bathroom and the huge bed, that I decided not to make up the sofa bed for Maria. We had a room service the first night and it was really great, I just could not resist grabbing the champagne from the mini bar. We had breakfast in both the restaurant and in the room. But Maria really loved the restaurant with all the great people caring for your needs and perfect eggs and soldiers! We tried the Fabourgh 114 at one of the nights and had the perfect meal! Maria's favorites were the pool, and finding Faraon around. The concierge service at the Hotel is perfect and the doorman is very helpful with organizing the transportation.

The elevation is well deserved. Although our room was not quite ready when we arrived, we were well greeted and treated to a cold drink in the beautiful lobby while we waited. The reason for the delay was obvious when we entered the room, as housekeeping were just exiting the door and had plainly been keen to ensure everything was perfect for our arrival. The room (we were lucky enought to be staying in one of the Royal/Presidential Suites) was simply incredible, and beautifully complimented by flowers and fruit baskets. As it was our honeymoon we had a touching handwritten note from the management. It took us some time to come off the high of just being in our room. We spent more time there than we usually would, enjoying excellent room service (I personally recommend perfect poached eggs for breakfast, the exceptional salade nicoise, and, the true test of any hotel, the burger and fries!). The hotel excels at service - any query or problem was promptly addressed, room service quick and impeccably polite/discrete, exactly as you would hope for from a hotel of this status. If you want to spoil yourself order some of the pastries or afternoon tea - all simply heavenly. We can also thoroughly recommend the 3 Michelin starred restaurant which we enjoyed thoroughly on one evening as a special treat. Simply one of the best restaurants I have ever experienced, possibly the best in terms of food and service. One minor downside for our visit is that the hotel is currently undergoing major refurbishment but, notwithstanding the fact that some renovation works were ongoing in the courtyard and on the floor below us - all disruption was kept to a minimum - if only all builders could be managed and behave in this way. All in all an incredible stay in an incredible hotel - I cannot recommend it highly enough. I should reiterate, of course, that our room was a particularly special one for a particularly special occasion, so I am unable to comment on what other rooms may be like, but if our experience was anything to go by I am sure they will be right at the top of the luxury experience available within Central Paris. As a final note I will mention that we were due to add one final night to our honeymoon on our drive north back to London - we intended to book La Ferme Saint Simeon which I have also reviewed. As a consequence of our wonderful experience at Le Bristol and the absolutely dreadful telephone manner of those working at Saint Simeon (despite both of us speaking good French) we went straight from le Bristol to London to avoid the inevitable disapppointment of going from some of the best service in France to some of the worst. It is not often that you can say that being back home and doing the washing is better than staying at a hotel, but in the case of La Ferme Saint Simeon we were so certain that would be the case that we avoided it altogether.

If you\u2019re planning a visit to Sarko or Carla, it\u2019s very close to the Elysee Palace. The nearest Metro station is a 10 minute stroll. Not bad, but for culture vultures, you are better off in the first arondissement as you are close to everything (Louvre, Notre Dame, Marais, Musee d\u2019Orsay etc). We were there to have fun after a big cultural tour of France and Spain so it didn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s start with the room. We had some sort of upgrade deal with Amex and got a room in the new part overlooking the garden courtyard for about E750 (if you have to even ask the price, don\u2019t go here). The room was large, beautifully decorated, comfortable bed, masses of hanging space and a massive bathroom, soap from Hermes, with a small corridor to the outside world, which you could shut off. In short, a room you could move into, pack all your travel crap away and feel as though you had lived there all your life. One criticism: low ceilings, which spoilt the effect a little. One other small criticism on turn down \u2013 no free water. The public areas are just to die for. The three star restaurant which I rated good rather than brilliant \u2013 I\u2019d have given if it 1-2 stars \u2013 is located on one of those delightful terraces in summer and in a beautiful inside oval room in winter. The bars and lobby are simply sensational. The free breakfast is in a very sweet new restaurant on the Rue St Honore, was OK, but not quite up to the standard of the rest of the Hotel. Do the a la carte breakfast in the main restaurant for about E100 a couple just once \u2013 extravagant, but worth it. The concierge staff were endlessly helpful about a zillion small things. Cars to Rolland Garros, window tables at the Jules Verne and an airport transfer service which has a meet and greet at the airport accompanying you right through to your lounge or gate, as you prefer. It all comes at a price, but they really make life easy for you.

The service was impeccable almost like us feeling King and Queen for a day. Every single treat and dish exuded fresh flavour and was unique. The bread was an outstanding beginning. We both had pigeon as a main course, as the the alternative was sea bass which we had the previous evening at Le Chiberta (see my review). The portions were good size. The service including our personal waiter accompanying us to get our coats was itself memorable. One word of warning though is that once seated the champagne trolley comes round (before you see the wine menu) and we impulsively accepted 2 glasses of rose champagne which cost 28 euros each glass - a bit steep as the cost the Moet and Chandon is only 42 euro a bottle. The wine we chose was only 50 euro a bottle Bourgogne 2003 Henri Darnat which seemed reasonable in comparison and tasted nice. There were lovely finishing touches like the wine waitress sampling the bottles herself before pouring! We did not have cheese on our set menu but we could see a specialist cheese waitress enthusiastically describing each one in detail on a nearby table. We stayed four hours for our Sunday lunch and enjoyed every minute. These people are true professionals where teamwork was evident. The final bill came to 292 euros but we felt it well worth it. A truly memorable experience. We are definitely returning for our 25th anniversary. We booked two days before from London and there were plenty of tables but I suspect that evening would be a lot more difficult (and expensive!).", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cMr Grumpy is left speechless.\u201d", "Author": "Hamefarin", "ReviewID": "UR34597023", "Content": "I booked this hotel based on being the 'best of the best', according to the reviews I had read. This was for a surprise romantic Valentine weekend stay treat for my wife. I clearly told them at booking prior to the trip, that this was the occassion. I fully expected them to be cool on reception, and to totally overlook the reason for the visit. The kind of treatment the some Tripadvisor reviews tell you you'd experience at the other top hotels in Paris. It's 'the some' that I often double check to get a more realistic view. Also; I am not shy about critisizing bad service myself.. The trip was going to set me back a pretty packet too. How very wrong I was about my fears. From the moment we arrived, we were treated as if we really mattered to them. I am sure we were given an upgrade and every single member of staff we encountered, was truly polite helpful and cheerful. The door staff welcome you and the reception greet you with a smile and don't answer the phone during the conversation with you. You are then taken to your room by another member of the their staff and shown how everything works. My wife was spoilt with many Boucheron perfume extras in the room and the view and decor were delightful. The bed was sprinkled with yellow rose petals in a heart shape over the bed and other fresh flowers were in the room too. In the first evening, we had a surprise visit from room service. Complements of the hotel, an amazing multi layered cream and strawberry biscuited style cacke with a fruit sauce and heart shaped chocolates around it. Also, a bottle of their finer champagne. All this on a silver service. And there had been I, hoping to see, and more then delighted with, a wee card and maybe a low end bottle of Champs in the room on arrival. Breakfast at the hotel has to be the most sumptuous I've ever known. We were treated with the same dignity and service that the others (dripping with gold) were. On checking out, I paid a bill that left me thinking that it had been well worth the expense. I particularly asked to see the manager to thank them all for giving us such a fabulous time. Trouble is; now that we've been there, no other Paris hotel will do. So future trips will simply have to be saved up for. Without all the razamataz next time; this hotel will surpass all our hopes just as it is. Now if you think this revue is too good to be true; read some of my others. I am struggling to balance my comments with a criticism of the 'Le Bristol' experience, but I can't think of a one.

Of the three hotels, Bristol is the property to which we will return. Yes, it is quite pricey, but at the 5 star level it is actually priced on the lower end of the spectrum. The lobby is beautiful, rooms are elegantly appointed and generously sized. Concierge was friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the garden restaurant is lovely and tranquil.

On my visit to Paris last summer I stayed at Four Seasons George V, based upon the many stellar reviews on this sight (and I love FS Hotels in general); the FS George V was flawless in many ways and exciting and beautiful and the staff were positively friendly beyond being professional and efficient. The Bristol, however, is an elegant hotel which is unique. It is not so flashy, but entirely beautiful. It's location is superb because it bridges the neighborhoods where the George V (Camps Elysees) is and the neighborhoods in the opposite direction (Louvre, Opera, Tuilleries). Also, its a quicker walk to the Left Bank. The George V may have a flashier lobby and more interesting and attractive venues for eating/driniking but the Bristol has the most beautiful Parisian Park and Gardens as the centerpiece of its public areas. The buldings which surround the gardens comprise the rooms in the hotel and the garden is a fabulously beautiful spot for dinner, breakfast or a drink. The lobby is understated and in all honesty could use some new soft furnishings. The structure and architecture itself is faultless. But the service. It is truly personal, elegant and very discreet. The hotel is not on a huge square or major avenue although the Faubourg St, Honore is a street which is renowned for its fabulous shops. It is also very close to the Palace d'Elysees and everything that is beautiful about Paris. The room we received was lovely. Freshly renovated, the style would disappoint some who like a more overtly opulent style or, who, on the other side of the spectrum love cutting-edge modern. The Bristol room was elegant, yet restrained. The bathroom is all marble and huge...the biggest bathtub I can recall....you need not spend your money on a spa treatment once you soak in the beautiful tub infused with the special bath products provided which come their own exclusive spa. We had a \"junior suite\" (mind you, not a deluxe junior suite and we could not stop taking joy in the beauty of the room.) We also had two huge, flower-bedecked, windows which opened onto the magnificent Garden. The soft sounds of the fountain were sooothing...and the beautiful view was pure indulgence. Everytime I have stayed at the Bristol, the service has been impeccable. I am always recognized, even after an absence of a few years. I am know by name before I even reach the reception desk (and not because some driver or staff member calls ahead on his discreet walkie-talkie.) Don't get me wrong, the service at the George V FS was great in the wonderful FS style, but Le Bristol is truly old-school. It is perfect in the way great European hotels have always been perfect. Of course, there was a huge bouquet of roses and lilies in the room, perfectly matched to the color scheme of the decor; of course there was a large pedalstal of fresh fruits, and a large platter of petit fours for our enjoyment. These are not just \"amenities\"...this is the Bristol style. And this is the manner in which the Bristol thanks its loyal customers for returning over the years. The breakfasts are delicious...the buffet in the summer garden restaurant or room service...the best baguettes, croissants, coffee, hot chocolat, etc. Elegant, perfect service and discreet are the words I keep coming back to in order to describe Le Bristol. Not as haughty as the Plaza Athenee, not as busy/glitzy and as \"American\" as the Four Seasons George ; I enjoy the neighborhood of the Bristol better because it is less hectic neighborhood than the Meurice or Crillion (although the latter is located on the most beautiful \"Place\" on earth. and the former faces the Louvre and the Jardin de Tuilleries) I will go back to the George V again because the public spaces and restaurants are impossibly beautiful and the hotel is abuzz with excitement. The rooms are excellent too. But for classic French style and service, when I am in the mood for that, I will stay at Hotel Le Bristol. Of course, one cannot go wrong in Paris with the small \"hotels de charme\" which dot the right and left banks these days. But if service is important, and extra space and unique elegance are appreciated the extremely high price of the Bristol is an excellent choice.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fiji", "Title": "\u201cPerfection\u201d", "Author": "h0telmad", "ReviewID": "UR19022596", "Content": "I am in the hospitality industry and run a luxury hotel company.

The staff is absolutely perfect, kind and attentive without the robotic attitude found in other luxury hotels, warm without being familiar . The rooms were just what one would expect of such a place, traditional, exuding old charm but extremely comfortable and grand. We had a suite and my partner just loved it, chintz and opulent french style furniture but with plasma screens in both the lounge and the bedroom and a remarkable small business center. We are both foodies and had reservations in some special places in Paris (Jules Vernes, Robuchon, Lipp) so we only experienced room service but it was perfect, the best onion soup ever and service was extremely fast. We are looking forward to our next stay so we can experience the restaurant. The gardens, the largest in Paris for a hotel, are magic and a great place to have breakfast or lunch and the pool and little tanning terrace are adorable.
