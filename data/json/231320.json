ID#: 38056587 I actually read reviews for this hotel on TripAdvisor before I stayed at this hotel with my teen son that a travel agent booked for us. The agent assured me that reviews online should always be taken with a grain of salt. At that point, I should have relied on my gut and TripAdvisor. This place is a tourist trap, and they prey on those who don't know any better. The front desk was a table in the back of an Argentine restaurant, and you have to lug your luggage through tables and chairs. The room had no sheets on the bed, no outlets in the room or bath, mold, broken furniture, and worn carpeting. I asked for a new room after telling the front desk I was in Amsterdam with my teen son and not for sex or drugs. It seemed it was assumed those were the only things one would need a room here for. Power in the room wouldn't work if I took my room key, so my son couldn't watch TV or read if I went to get a cup of coffee. I asked for a new room, and the second one was only slightly better because it didn't have any carpet at all. I felt so guilty bringing my son here, we left after two nights and I spoke with the manager about getting my money back for the next two nights. I filled in a ton of forms for the owner who was not on site, and the manager said his hands were tied. After I realized I was probably going to get charged for all four nights, I did let them know I would write an honest review here, but if I got the refund, I wouldn't be so brutally honest. I walked down the road to the classier Swiss Hotel and got a rate that was LESS than at the dumpy hotel. I was also greeted by uniformed guest service reps in an air-conditioned lobby.

Breakfast was boiled eggs in a dish to help yourself. A couple of trays of meat and cheese. Two toasters to make your own toast. Orange juice, tea and coffee. We were more than happy with this, if we wanted cooked breakfast we'd go to a cafe. One morning though we came down for breakfast at 09:00 and there was no ham, no cheese, no tea, and no bread. They said they'd run out of bread and someone had gone to get some. No sign of anyone after 15 minutes so we went for a cooked breakfast. The restaurant was n't bad, food was very nice. They need to invest in some new crockery though the plate they served my dinner on looked liked the end had been chewed off by that man from the James Bond films with the metal teeth.

Yes, it's grim and dark and old, but that's part of the experience. You don't go to Amsterdam to stay at a Marriott. If you don't want any surprises, then yeah, go for your chain hotel and be pleasantly bored. The Damrak is definitely anything but boring... I would say the best thing about the hotel is the Argentinian restaurant downstairs, where guests receive 10% off of their meals. Also, the wireless was faultless. I'm a student and rely on the internet to stay up to date with my classes via Blackboard, so internet is always a big deal for me. I never had a problem. Finally, the location...you really can't beat it. You're smack in the center of the city, less than a five minute walk from the Central Station, and you can just step outside and have your choice of dozens of cuisines and things to do. Definitely a touristy area, but convenient. Now onto the \"grim\" - there are no smoking signs in the rooms, and I requested a no smoking room...but what they don't tell you is that smoking IS allowed in the hallways. So everyone on my floor stepped out at all hours of the night to smoke, and that stench seeps into your own room. I woke up sick one morning. Really not healthy. Also, my sheets looked clean and new, but the comforter had an odd smell to it. I did without. The rooms are old and the carpets and decor are definitely from the 70s, but that kind of adds to its charm. Parts of the carpet are warn down and gritty, but I wasn't going to let that ruin my trip. I wore flip flops. The bathroom was definitely clean and the water pressure was really good. My other complaint was not really the hotel's fault, but the guests are SUPER noisy. The walls are thin (old building), and it felt like the adult guests here were more ridiculous than any of the guests I encountered at various youth hostels. They were coming in at all hours of the night, pounding on everyones doors for fun, screaming in the halls, etc. For about three hours on Sunday night I had to listen to a sports game blasting and the groans and cheers of the men watching. There's only so many times a staff member can tell people to quiet down, so it's not their fault. Another thing I thought was weird was that you had to leave your key whenever you left the building. You left it with the front desk clerk and picked it up when you came back. To me, it wasn't really an inconvenience, except for when one clerk was more interested in the internet than helping guests. But another clerk knew who I was and what room I had, so when she saw me coming she had my key ready and waiting, which was very nice. But then when I was thinking about it, I realized that it means the hotel staff knows exactly who is in their rooms and who isn't at all times, which didn't really feel secure to me... When it boils down to it, if you want convenience and a low cost and aren't afraid of a little grit, the Damrak will exceed your needs. But if you're the type to complain about every little dent in the desk or chipped paint on the wall, go to a chain so you feel like you're back in the US.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doncaster", "Title": "\u201cVery good experience\u201d", "Author": "TheLickster", "ReviewID": "UR20144801", "Content": "I booked the Hotel Damrak for a 1 night stay for my wifes birthday in May 2008.

Cases were left in the luggage room which was cool as we couldn't get into our room until 1pm. We were in room 36 which was excellent and a double room. No view from the window other than the escape exit stairs but it was clean with clean towels and floors and clean walls and the tv worked perfect and had a remote. The bar and restaurant were cool with plenty to choose from. Breakfast is NOT bacon and eggs, lol, which was a litle disapointing, but when in Rome.....eat the continental crap they serve for breakfast. Location is 100% awesome.

The on-line reviews seemed fair for the price and we booked a single room each. I really don't know where to start describing what we were presented with. The rooms were shocking - very tiny and dark. If I'd had a cat to swing it would have hit its head on the way round. A small single bed was pushed up against the wall with a pillow and throw/duvet folded on top (it was a make your own bed up style). The sheet however was already on the bed and I noticed a rather dark curly short hair on it - grim. There was a TV but it had wires sticking out the front so I wasn't going to touch that. There were cigarette burn marks in the walls and ripped furniture. The only ventilation was from a small window that opened out on a small smoking area in the middle of the building - this was filled with rubbish and pigeon excrement. If you opened the window then mosquitoes and flies came rushing into the room. The cleanest place was the bathroom, but I was not going to sleep in there. I refused to unpack and preferred to carry all my valuables in my handbag than leave in the room or safe while we went to find alternative (and much better) accommodation. I can't comment on the double rooms - the pictures of which enticed us in the hotels advert, if I had been aware of what the single rooms were like I would not have considered this hotel for our stay at all. Even the location leaves a lot to be desired, what the reviews don't tell you is that Amsterdam is having a new metro system built. The street the Damrak is on, and area from which the canal trips leave from, is filled with large cranes and noisy diggers obscuring the view of the canal and historical buildings.

The elevator was a great sight to see! :) No need for steps with luggage. 5. The room ( a single) was adequate, although small (but it WAS a single). 6. The room, bathroom, closets were clean and well prepared. Good water pressure. 7. The continental breakfast (coldcuts, veggies, cereal, eggs, cheese, juice, milk, etc.) was different and pretty good. Kept me healthy and full at the start of my day(very important as that meant that I had more Euros in my pocket!) 8. The maid always came early (good). She always brought her two kids who played tag and games in the hallway (bad). 9. When you left the hotel, you had to leave your room key. ( good? bad?) 10. You could not have any overnight guests (bad). One of the staff members told me about this, the morning after I left with my overnight guest (GREAT!) 11. Very friendly and helpful staff. 12.

Breakfasts are about as basic as they come. If you'd like a break from the hotel breakfast, I recommend De Vergulde Lantaarn, which opens at 9 most days (10 on Sundays, I think). It's on the street just behind the hotel (red and white awning). (Go north from the hotel, hang a left at the first alley -- it's a narrow street, then left at the first street. About 100 feet down on your left.) Basic accommodations (I had a single room) and that's about it. You get two towels and the soap comes in a dispenser (no swiping bars to take home). Housekeeping, heaven knows why, likes to come in a lot -- it wasn't unusual for them to show up three times a day. Though the rooms had deadbolt locks, housekeeping had no way of knowing I was trying to get some sleep -- no Do Not Disturb tags. So, they'd constantly knock to get in. I got the feeling the same people own several of the hotels along the Damrak -- I seemed to see the same people in several of the hotels. Pretty good sized room safe (enough for a laptop computer and a couple external drives with room to spare.) If you're looking for a basic room to serve as home base, you'll do OK here. Things got a little noisy in the halls in the evening but nothing that disturbed me too much. If you need somewhat better accommodations, try the Hotel Inntel, the Victoria or the Golden Tulip (all within a stone's throw of the Hotel Damrak). I wouldn't recommend this place for a honeymoon but, for what it is, you'll be OK. (FYI, the Inntel is directly across from the Betty Boop Coffee Shop -- where Quentin Tarantino wrote a good bit of Pulp Fiction.)

After reading the reviews here I was worried to say the least. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the central station and is very easy to find. The girl at reception was welcoming, informative and friendly. We were given rooms 15 and 16 and they were sadly what I had feared from reading the reviews here. The furniture was old,dark and in a bad state, the carpet was so old and dirty that you wouldnt want to walk on it barefooted. There were electrical wires hanging from an old hair dryer in the bathroom. The rooms both stunk of stale cigarette smoke. We told the receptionist that we were non-smokers and would like to change rooms and she was really obliging. She immediately offered us some other rooms - 45 and 55. We checked these out and it was like a different hotel. The top 2 floors are completely renovated. New floors, carpets, beds and furnishings. The rooms were light and modern. We were so relieved and really enjoyed our stay. Strangely though they didnt seem to have really bothered to do up the bathrooms, but they were fine albeit really tiny. Breakfasts were Bread rolls, ham, cheese and jam. Cereal, Coffee and juice. Not great but ok for a continental breakfast in a budget hotel. Cooked breakfasts were available at the menu prices. We tended to have a quick bite and then brunch somewhere nice a bit later in the morning. Dont miss the 'Pompadour' in the Nine Streets for amazing cakes and coffee ! Do miss the Metz restaurant with its uninspiring and overpriced food and inattentive staff. The reception staff let us store our bags all day in a locked cellar room on the day that we checked out. The Damrak has a great location: Central station just a few mins away. Trains run directly from Schipol airport to central station regularly for just a couple of euros. Hollands No 1 chip shop is a few doors away. Very good! ATM less than 100 yards. Red light district with loads of bars, coffee shops, restaurants and... well... everything and more is just over the bridge opposite the hotel. So, if we hadnt changed rooms it would have been pretty grotty. It would have been a grin and bear it hotel experience. As it was we were well pleased. I would recommend that you stay at the Damrak if you can book a room on the 4th or 5th floor.

Would stay again despite the high price.", "Date": "August 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cStay Away!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Exoleen01", "ReviewID": "UR3496713", "Content": "In all my years of travel, this is by far the worst hotel I've stayed in. The 'non-smoking' room reeked of cigarettes. The linen and bedspread were full of burn holes and - of course - reeked of cigarettes. Complaints to management were met with a shrug and a 'there's nothing I can do'. The walls in the room were chipping apart. Worst of all - About 15 minutes after midnight, we started hearing a very loud hammering and sawing - and we were on the 3rd floor. After 30 minutes, I went back to the lobby to ask for a new room and found - to my suprise - that the noise was coming from the hotel itself! They were replacing their restaurant bar at 1 in the morning! Please avoid this place if you are traveling to Amsterdam.

If it wasn't for the time of night, and the fact I was with my 8 year old daughter, I would have left the moment I saw the room! Anyway, I'd already paid, I can't afford to pay for two hotels! The bathroom was disgusting - mould covered the ceiling and the stench of it was not covered by the thoughtfully supplied air freshener! This smell was complemented by the reek of chip fat emanating from the sheets. Although the rest of the room had been cleaned as much as the cra*** state of things would allow, there was no pillow for my daughter or toilet roll in the bathroom (although to be fair, when I requested them they were supplied). I could not sleep at all the first night because of the row of people coming back from the bars etc all night long - please don't believe the reviews that say it is a family hotel! After an unwelcome ( but ultimately harmless) encounter with a fellow guest who seemed to think that as I was female in Amsterdam I must be up for it, I was very glad of the chain on the door! The location was excellent for sightseeing and everything else. Although it was very close to the Red Light Area we managed to completely avoid it - handy to know if you aren't looking for that side of the city, but handy if you are! Ultimately I loved Amsterdam - absolutely hated the hotel. If I had paid the normal going rate I don't think my sense of outrage would ever recover! Avoid it like the plague! P.S. 5 Euros for half a cup of hot chocolate in a paper cup - despite what it said in the bar list.

For the advertised \"low price room for one\" ($115) I got a \"shoe box\" with broken everything: air-conditioner, fan, desk lamp and even the bed frame. My window was looking straight into the dark well (6/8 feet) thickly covered by pigeon's guano. By the way, people who were just walking in without reservations, got a much better deal for the room for 2 (just $70, twice cheaper than on the internet!). I was having breakfast right near by the front desk and overheard all conversations. But back to the room, I counted more than 20 dirty spots, scratched and torn paper on the walls, few holes (like somebody was kicking or punching them). My mattress was so old, thin and bumpy ( few springs vere almost piercing me) that the only way to lay down was by using my blanket that I had to fold few times. The furniture was, probably, 30 years old and scratched. Another thing: when the cleaning person comes (usually, at 9-9:30) he opens the door wide open right after he knocks, without waiting for a response. There is no such thing as a tag with the privacy sign that you can hang on the door. As a matter of fact, there was no privacy at all: you could hear every word people say in the hall, behind your closed doors, or in the neighboring rooms. The air in the room was always stuffy and the smell of tobacco was always there, despite all of my attempts to get rid of it using the window and a little fan, which I received as a substitute for the broken a/c unit. An included breakfast was very simple and had never changed during my 5 day stay there: bread, boiled eggs, salami, one kind of cheese, cereal, milk, coffee and orange juice. No more delicatessen surprises. And I always had to ask for water. The only one good thing about this hotel is location: you can not beat it. So, for perfect location and accessibility, I can give this hotel one star. Three stars that can be seen on the wall behind the front desk is just a hoax! So, dear traveller, try to avoid price and location temptation and try to find something else.", "Date": "September 10, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Damrak", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d231320-Reviews-Hotel_Damrak-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$92 - $211*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Damrak 49</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1012 LL</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "231320", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ae/0e/ae0e6b6fb3f172dbcb032cd62542d4c01large.jpg"}}
