Two points keeps the hotel from being perfect: We were in Berlin during warm summer day's and this means a lot of loud talking an shouting people on the terrace in the street until deep in the night.

First time travelling through from Italy back to Denmark with the family. Later on, on a weekend break with my wife. Both times it was a very nice time we spent at the hotelas well as in the city. The rooms are suitable for couples as well as small families. This is a nice little cosy botique hotel close to everything. Kudamm is only a minute away from the hotel and the U-bahn 5 minutes on foot. The rooms are modern and with free Wifi equipped. Parking is available in the backyard, believe it is 15\u20ac a day. The breakfast is superb and not to be missed. We will definitely be back this summer! P.S: there is a petrol station further down Schluterstrase, and they have Ben & Jerry Cookie Dough icecream at a reasonable price.

We had never been to Berlin before and had no idea of the hotel's location. It turned out to be very central (in the City West) in an area known locally as KuDamm. It appears to be a fairly new hotel, apparently a one-off, and occupies 4 floors of a renovated block. The communal areas are limited to a small reception area, very small bar and a nice breakfast room. We had a delux room which was spacious and clean, decorated and furnished in a contemporary style. The bed was comfy and the room was nice and warm. Small flat screen tv, free wireless inernet access and mini-bar were available. No tea/coffee making facilities. Nice modern bathroom with swish fittings. The only downside to the room was that it you could smell cigarettes a little - the smoking ban hits Germany in 3 month's time. The breakfasts consisted of cold meats, cheeses, cereals, fruit, yoghurts, different types of bread, boiled eggs, smoked salmon - more than adequate and very tasty. Staff were friendly and the atmosphere was informal. Our room was ready when we arrived at 11am which was great. Overall, it's a funky small boutique hotel in a good location and we'd definitely stay there again. If you like hotels with big communal areas/restaurant/bar etc, this won't be for you but if you're looking for an intimate, cool hotel in the city west area, give it a try.", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNul !\u201d", "Author": "lucon", "ReviewID": "UR8274293", "Content": "We were ready to enjoy the Casa hotel, especially after reading the good reviews on this site but we were really disappointed. First we arrived around 11.00 am in Berlin and asked for our booking but we were told by the girl at the reception (who was really unfriendly) that no room would be available before 3.30 pm. She explained that the cleaning staff was not present at that moment and that there was no manager either. I gave my mobile number to the reception girl and asked her to call me when the room was ready (hoping that this would happen before 3.30 pm). We were encouraged to have our welcome dring at the bar of the Hotel (on the ground floor) in the meantime. We visited Berlin for 4 1/2 hours...exhausted (after getting up at 4.30pm in London)...When we came back to the Hotel...no room was ready yet...so we got a little upset but we decided to go to the Bar as suggested. Down to the Bar, we gave our 'welcome drink vouchers' to the Barman. He said that the welcome drink was sparkling wine. We told him that we did not drink and he said that we would have to pay then. I argued with him that an orange juice or a glass of water was less expensive than wine but he refused my version. We also said that we would complain to the manager of the Hotel but he said that he did not care as the hotel had nothing to do with the bar... I then got a little more upset and told this barman that it was discriminatory to impose the wine on us because if I had been a muslim he would have had to serve me something else. The barman got extremely nasty, called his boss and decided to serve us one single glass of water for two... Then the nightmare went on and on and on...The service was nul and despite the great location, it takes a little more than that to make a genuine 4 star hotel. The difference always lies in the service.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Angus Scotland", "Title": "\u201cViva Casa\u201d", "Author": "dunnard", "ReviewID": "UR6174010", "Content": "We enjoyed our 6 night stay in this hotel, which is centrally located in a side street off the Kudamm.
