From the first encounter the staff were friendly, attentive and polite. They would try to cater for every requirement that they could. We were shown to our room (no.67) which was on the 6th floor and I couldn't fault it. It was a decent size with a nice bed for my son. The bedding was lovely and the beds firm and comfortable. The bathroom was really big and had a bath and a seperate shower . The view from the room was of one of the side streets and was very Parisien, which is what I wanted. We didn't eat at the hotel but there are plenty of little cafes for breakfast and a huge variety of bistros and restaurants for lunch and dinner. Try Asian for a unique dining experience, just along from the BMW Showroom round the corner from the hotel. Bring plenty of money though because even though I was warned that Paris was expensive it was still a hugely out of pocket experience. A main course and 1 drink can easily set you back \u00a3100. The location of the hotel was what made the holiday for us though. A 2 minute walk one way brought you onto the Champs Elysees, turn right and after 5 mins you have reached the Arc de Triumphe. Turn the other way and you will reach Place de la Concorde, the Jardin des Tuileries and then the Louvre. From the hotel walk straight down and in 20-25mins you will reach Les Invalides and up from there the Eiffel Tower. Perfect! This area is also great if you enjoy a little retail therapy at the more expensive end of the market. You are spoiled by choice with all the designer shops like Dior, Vesace, Jimmy Choo, Chanel, to name but a few. If you go further afield you will find plenty of more reasonably priced shops, for Paris anyway. All in all we had a great trip away, just wish we had longer and more (much more!) cash. I will definetally stay at The Claridge the next time I go to Paris.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cLovely French Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nell188", "ReviewID": "UR127320770", "Content": "I got a Groupon deal to stay at this hotel and it was a fantastic deal.

This is an excellent hotel in a wonderful, central location. After our first night we had to change rooms because of noise coming from builders renovating on the sixth floor of the building next to the hotel.This was the floor we were on. We changed to a room on the fifth floor and couldn't hear anything. Our second room (53) was smaller than the one on the sixth floor, but I liked it better, it had double doors that opened onto a little balcony. It was beautifully decorated, comfortable bed and bathroom had double sinks everything was spotlessly clean and fresh. All of the staff were excellent, friendly, helpful nothing was a trouble. Breakfast was a little expensive but good. There are lots of good restaurants nearby and the Champs Elysee was about a three minute walk.

Location? Perfect. Cheap taxi ride (Eur 12) from Gard du Nord station. Located just off the Champs Elysses, the road is quaint and perfectly Parisian. We were amazed by the lack of tourists and business of the street, given that it is close to the Champs Elysses. The Chanel boutique, which is featured in the advert with Charlize Theron, is situated at the bottom of the road, which gives you an idea of how picturesque it is. Within a few mins of the metro, we didn't plan to use this but, having often walked across the whole of Paris to see Notre Dame and the Marais district to name but a few, we decided to go with it and thought it was fine and the quickest means of travel at busy times. Room? Perfect. The room which we were given by far surpassed our expectations. It was clean and surprisingly spacious. I think people who complain about the size of rooms in Paris are perhaps used to U.S hotels, where floor space is just thrown at you. It is not necessary for us and we had an abundance of room (i'm 6 ft 2\" so would've been aware if it felt cramped). Staff? Superb. They were always extremely helpful and friendly. They gave us advice on places that we might (and always did) like, without applying any pressure. Took a good few tries until they understood that the kettle was broken and needed to be replaced. But that is our fault for not speaking French in their own country and my partner and I must say that this was literally the only thing which was anything but perfect! A truly stylish, romantic and artistic city and, having loved every minute of our stay here, we have to say the Hotel Claridge is all of these things.

We were travelling en masse as a family and my parents in law were having one night there as were my husband and I the next night to take a romantic break from our travelling party of 11. The first night we were told that they were fully booked and a patron was ill so they were sending us to another hotel with an upgraded room. The other hotel, the Alma Royal Melia, was quite a walk away with luggage heading away from the Champs -Elysees, the room my parents in law got was nice but it was hard to tell if it was an upgrade as you can't compare it with a room you haven't seen. I had left my luggage at the Claridge and went back there after settling in the in laws and checked that I would be staying at the Claridge the next night as I didn't want to be doing the luggage moving thing again and was told, \"Yes, see you tomorrow night.\" Then next afternoon I rang the Claridge to confirm again and was told that they weren't sure if we were coming (???) so they had booked out our room but they could arrange other accommodation at the same rate and he would call me back. After waiting for half an hour with our luggage in the lobby of the Disneyland hotel we were staying in, I rang the Claridge back to find out what we were doing and he said he couldn't get on to my mobile phone (yet, I could call him) and he had accommodation for us. I stupidly agreed to this only to find we were at the same hotel my in laws were put in. I was dissappointed at the location but I had seen the inside of my in laws room and was a little comforted as it was quite nice (although I had expected more for over 200 Euros/night). After travelling for an hour on the train and getting a taxi to the hotel, we got into our room, our noses were immediately assaulted by cigarette smell and I saw that we had the budget room of this hotel, a bathroom you could barely open the door into with and a hard, double bed with one pillow each. I rang reception and told them that being a non smoker, I needed a non smoking room and they told me that they didn't know this and the only room they had available was on the smoking floor. No, they didn't have air freshener either. It was clearly stated on my booking at the Claridge that our room was to be strictly non smoking but apparently there's a communication problem there. Spent the night sneezing which eventually diabled my ability to smell, thank goodness, but swollen, irritated eyes and a running nose are not romantic. It makes me sick to my stomach every time I think of the amount of money I spent on this experience and what was possibly my only visit to Paris.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg City, Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cNice Parisian Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DoDoo", "ReviewID": "UR60577969", "Content": "We stayed in the Claridge hotel for 2 nights and should admit that it was a nice surprise to discover a spacious typicaly Parisian-style decorated room with a big comfortable bed, big bathroom with bath tube and double sink.
