{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Value, Roomy, really enjoyed this place We stayed here for a week and really thought that it was great value. Plenty of room, clean and three level (bedroom at top). Probaby wouldnt be too good for the elderly with the three level but great for us. Really close to lots of top restaurants, and it was like walking into a quiet oasis after the hustle and bustle of Florence. Lovely courtyard with olive trees and outdoor settings.Loved the breakfasts, internet access and room service each day. It was right up there for value in Italy and friends of ours just up the road, shared a room (very pokey hotel type room) and paid similar price to us.Liked the staff, who were helpful. and obliging.Great place we thought and I am very fussy.", "Date": "Apr 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR569821180", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sharni123"}, {"Content": "Will definitely return next time in Florence       Looking down from the second level onto the living area", "Date": "Apr 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR973951221", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MacBluenoser"}, {"Content": "Lots of room for the money We booked rooms at the La Contessina primarily for the location a few blooks from the train station and close to all the Florence sights. We were surprised to find our rooms to be tri-level suites with a specious living area in the middle. The only complaint was having to go down two half flights to get from the bedroom to the bathroom. The beedroom overlooked the livingroom which was fine for day, but not to great for a nap or when one of us wanted to sleep and the other wanted to do something else, such as watch TV. There was a nice courtyard outside our room, but that could be loud at night if the guests were not considerate. That wasn't a problem while we were there, but I could see how it could be. The staff was very nice and helpful. If you don't mind walking up and down steps a lot, I recommend the hotel.", "Date": "Jun 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR377817626", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "fensu"}, {"Content": "Not impressed by Residence La Contessina I have just come back from a 4 night trip to Florence and stayed at these apartments for one night (the place we stayed the other 3 nights was full for the 4th and the same company recommended it). Although the apartment we had was clean enough and had the upstairs bedroom and downstairs living room I wasn't too terribly impressed with it - there were no windows/shutters that could be opened so it was quite stuffy and very dark. Although it was set in a pretty courtyard back off the main road it was pretty noisy - we could hear every single one of the other 20 or so sets of guests coming home all through the night and the walls were pretty thin (could hear every word/noise from room next door including the bathroom and bedroom - and it's inhabitants were actually being pretty quiet).The staff were friendly enough, but being up in the duplex part of the apartment felt a bit cave like and not the adventure we had hoped! To add insult to injury they tried to add 25 euros on top of the agreed amount for use of the kitchen downstairs beside the living room (it had been advertised as an apartment with gallery kitchen). I've travelled a lot round Europe and never heard this before! For the previous 3 nights and another 30 to 40 euros a night we had an apartment that was directly next to the Duomo with a view of it on the second from top floor - I would recommend it highly (it was called RESIDENCE SAN LORENZO on the Via de' Martelli)", "Date": "May 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR792358534", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "A very nice apartment I really wasn't sure what to expect and was delightfully surprised at how nice this accomodation turned out.. Our apartment had an upstairs bedroom and downstairs kitchen, living room and large bathroom. A great value for the money, especially compared to a normal hotel room. The apartment is within easy walking distance of all the Florence sites, and in particular, the Central Market, with fabulous fruits, vegetables, bakeries and meats and cheeses was just a block away. A world class place to stock up.
