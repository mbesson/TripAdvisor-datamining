Despite being told by the young man that we could ring on the i'n house' phone to communicate at any time this service did not work and eventually we managed to contact someone on the number given via mobile! The gentleman was adamant that Casa Pisani was nothing to do with Locanda Canal, despite me saying this was the number I had been given...eventually when he realised I was telling him that we had no electric(it was night time!) he said he would come over...We were so pleased to see him, but i'm afraid his attitude was aggressivley unfriendly.It took some while for him to locate the fault but again we were so pleased he did!! Thinking nothing more could go wrong we were amazed to be met by open unfriendliness from the lady serving the extremely inadequate breakfast the next morning!! We had offered no complaint and were genuinely pleased somone had come to sort the problem out but I'm afraid the attitude of this lady quite spoilt our stay.I would definitely not recommend-by the last day we were being served small hard slices of bread-tea and coffee were undrinkable!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bexley", "Title": "\u201cVisit march 2012\u201d", "Author": "Linda A", "ReviewID": "UR126111140", "Content": "The hotel is compact but very nice and totally suited our needs.

There was still enough room in the room to move around, but the extra bed was a bit short for our son. The room had two large windows facing a canal with lots of gondolas and other boats passing by. It was really nice to sit in the window and watch the boats. There was a fridge with some minibar items, but with enough room to keep our own drinks cool. The bathroom was very nice and clean. We enjoyed our stay very much, but as mentioned by some other reviewers the breakfast room was very small. If many guests would like to have breakfast at the same time there might be problems. However, during our stay that problem did not occur. Breakfast was quite good for Italian standards. There is no one in the reception but there is a sister hotel five minutes walk away, and on our arrival staff arrived in five minutes. On our arrival day we could leave our luggage in the hotel, but when we wanted to collect it noone answered the buzzer. I walked to the other hotel where I was told that I just should ring the bell, which I had done. When I walked back it worked as it should. Instead of taking the vaporetto to Rialto on arrival, I would recommend going to fondamente Nove instead since it is much less crowded, and you can walk much more easily with your luggage even though the distance might be a bit longer.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201crick steve's goof\u201d", "Author": "biennalebooster", "ReviewID": "UR113744291", "Content": "we arrived towards the end of our trip in italy, so we thought we understood reasonable expectations of service (towels, breakfast, second cups of hot liquids at breakfast). the casa pisani provided no services and were unpleasant bordering on hostile towards its guests at its one service, breakfast. each breakfast brought another unpleasant exchange with guests. if it weren't vacation, it would be almost a hoot to wonder what requests would be thwarted next. it reminded me of my student travels in hostels which seemed policed rather than administered. since this place is also difficult to locate, just as well to pass on it despite it's mention in rick steve's guide.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cymru", "Title": "\u201cfabulous room, excellent for a romantic stay, but no front desk or general hotel facitities\u201d", "Author": "gwenllianCymru", "ReviewID": "UR42665365", "Content": "We had a junior suite, which was a large and beautiful room with a comfortable 4 poster bed, windows that looked out over the canal with gondolas passing by , damask fabric on the wall and a clean bathroom. however it is really an annexe of the locanda canal hotel, and there is no reception area .

The rooms are clean - note that they are up one long flight of stairs and there is no elevator so if you have a lot of luggage, you may be in trouble. The rooms are clean and so nicely decorated. The location is not far (10 minutes) from San Marco but is off the beaten path and as a result is so quiet. Staff is only on-site until 13:00. So, if you arrive after, you will have to wait a few minutes for someone to arrive from the other location. You just buzz the front door and it will automatically go to the other location for someone to answer. Have a good map with you and print off the directions from the internet on how to get here since it is hidden. We found it without a problem but closely followed the directions. Also, don't be fooled by the advertised internet access. Tehre is a computer but you will not be given the password to use it - so you must have a staff member log in for you. But, since staff is only on-site part time, that is the only time you can use the machine (this is due to the Italian anti-terrorism laws that require a business to know who is using the computer and when they are).

Because of the bridges over the canal ...walking from the water taxi to the hotel is cumbersome. If you travel light, you will have no problem, if you are carrying or rolling several bags, hire a porter at the water taxi stop. the hotel is located in a more residential area, so it is very quiet day and night.

We had a gr8 experience at the Casa Pisani Canal. It is an excellent hotel at a decent price. Our room was spacious and had amazing furnishings. The bed and curtains were golden brocade. The walls were golden too and the bed was super soft. It all gave us a feeling of being some kind of Royalty!! The breakfast was good also. I could have a cafe` Latte everyday. The best thing of all is the bathroom. Firstly it is clean and looks brand new. Secondly the shower is a full body shower with a foot massager attached!! What more would you want!! Though it is a small hotel with just 5 rooms it is very well maintained. You might wanna learn a few words of Italian to communicate with the help in the breakfast room though, as they speak no English whatsoever. The free internet access is a boon specially to check train schedules and weather. Our room did not have a view of the canal but we toured the room with that view and it was out of this world. Not only the room was bigger with a canopy bed, the view was awesome with the gondolas floating by. Anyways we figured it was not worth the EUR 60 extra per night as we hardly stayed in the hotel during the day. I would give a big thumbs up to this one.

I wouldn't worry too much about sales pressure. The Cenedese factory is so ungodly expensive ($600 for one glass) that no one staying in a hotel for 80 bucks could possibly be expected to buy anything there. Take the tour and enjoy it. The staff was very good and friendly. The hotel is nearby a lot of nice and inexpensive restaurants and a couple of grocery stores. The Fondamente Nove waterbus stop is more convenient than Rialto in my opinion. Only a couple of turns so you are less likely to get lost. One tip, check to see if the website you book it on allows you to pay in advance or only books the reservation. I thought I paid in advance and got charged on the way out.

Our travel agent had heard of this gem and recommended it. It's the first time we've stayed somewhere not rated on TripAdvisor. Despite our reservatinons, we were very, very pleased.This small (5 room) hotel is in a former Palazio that has just been renovated. It's a short walk from St. Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge (5 min. each). Like many small hotels, it is hard to find initially, but the locals directed us. The directions on the hotel web site at least got us to the approximate area.The hotel is magnificently decorated. All of the walls of the b'fast and guest rooms were scrumptiously covered with beautiful Venetian fabrics. Our room (105) was a second floor room (as they all are) taht overlooked two canals. We enjoyed keeping the windows open and hearing the gondolas float by.The room had a marble floor, 10 or 11 foot ceilings and was very quiet. The fabrics that could be loosened to cover the windows allowed us to completely darken the room.There was a luscious French double bed with four posts and Venetian fabrics. The chandelier and scones were expensive Murano glass. The sitting area was nice and overlooked the canal.The satellite TV was small, but adequate. There was no alarm clock or clock radio.The bathroom was scrumptious. Nearly completely tiled and totally modern, it featured a toilet, bidet, single sink, hair dryer, heated towell rack and an incredible shower.The shower had a foot massage unit, a hand-held unit, and a six-nozzle European shower massage. The tub part of the shower unit was small, but adequate for one.The hotel staff were very helpful in orienting us. However, we have one complaint -- they pushed a local restaurant, which we found to be only average. The restaurant did give a small discount, but we suspected also gave the hotel a kick back.In addition, the staff tried to get us to take a \"free boat\" to the Murano glass factories. Most guide books we read do not recommend doing this, as the factory to which you are delivered places great sales pressure on you.Therefore, we felt the staff was more interested in their pocket than ours.The other negative for us, and what knocked our review from 5 to 4 stars was the breakfast. There was only one juice, one cereal, one milk and two pastry choices. On our first day, the milk was rancid. The coffee tasted like it was instant. If you need a hotel with a fabulous breakfast, this is NOT for you.Nevertheless, if you want a luscious, quiet-as-a-mouse room in a new hotel that is off the beaten path, yet close to everything, and is still a great value for the money (as everything in Venice is expensive), then this one's for you.We plan to return in the future and hope these minor complaints have been rectified by the small but gracious staff.", "Date": "April 24, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Casa Pisani Canal", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d320868-Reviews-Casa_Pisani_Canal-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$152 - $265*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Cannaregio 6105</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30131</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "320868", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fa/48/fa48477b0d9aaaeda29f947e85090e659large.jpg"}}
