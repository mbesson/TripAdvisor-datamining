There also were some grocery stores and convenience stores on Chausseestrasse. I recommend the larger Rewe grocery store (Chausseestr. 118-120), which is about a 10 minute walk northwest of the hotel. It was fun for buying local products such as German cookies and chocolates. The CUSTOMER SERVICE was also great, with staff being knowledgeable and very helpful. They were particularly helpful in trying to figure out how we could get to Tegel airport which does not have a train station connected. They recommended taking the U6 from Oranienburger-Tor (towards Alt-Tegel destination) and get off at Kurt-Schumacher-Platz, then take the bus TXL 128 to the airport. You may want to give yourself added time on the weekends as the buses/metro don't run as frequently early Sunday morning. The ROOM itself was super spacious for the 2 of us, with a tv, couch, closet and large bathroom. Although neither of us were physically challenged, I think we some how got the handicapable room which made it extra spacious in the room and bathroom. Not complaints on our end as we were free to spread our things around. Wifi access was great, as other hotels I've stayed in either had a weak signal or no signal from our room. We also had a quiet room facing the interior courtyard away from the street which was fantastic. As an aside from the hotel, if you're big on museums, I would recommend getting the MUSEUM PASS BERLIN card (19 Euro) as going to 2+ museums (each museum about 10 Euros each) pretty much pays for the card. It's a 3-day pass to visit to visit a ton of museums (which you can purchase at the museums) (for more info: http://www.smb.museum/smb/service/preise.php, and click on the link for the specific museums). You should know that some museums have special exhibits which are not part of the pass, and then strangely enough, there are some museums that the special exhibit must be paid for with an extra euro or 2 to enter even the main collection (e.g., Alte Nationalgalerie). Also you should also know that for each museum you get a FREE AUDIOGUIDE as part of your entrance fee (this is not true in many US museums were you often have to pay separately). Unfortunately I missed that at the first museum I visited (the Pergamonmuseum of all places) and was told when checking in at the second museum. Some of the museums also have late nights on Thursdays (until 10pm) or Saturdays (until 8 pm - Neues Museum), which is partly eery as it feels like you have the museum all to yourself with only the museum security about. So you may want to note the times of the museums you're interested in to maximize time at the museums.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portugal - Norte", "Title": "\u201cGood price/quality relation\u201d", "Author": "Biajante", "ReviewID": "UR121491208", "Content": "Positive: -Hotel's localization in a nice near center area -5 minutes waking to subway -No time limit for check-in (the only way to hand late flights as ours) -Rooms good insonorization -Good price/quality relation Negative: -We asked on booking.com for a double bed, but we got two single beds together.

The neighborhood is fun and cool, if you get a chance check out Clarchen's ballroom down the block for dinner and dancing.

So, I cannot avoid mentioning its superb location as well as other reviewers did. Thirdly, the hotel staff - very welcoming, modest and conscientious, very nice and helpful people. The only disappointment was breakfast - I didn't mind it was very basic but it was just absolutely not tasty, even the bread and butter.

The hotel staff were helpful even before we arrived by dealing with my room queries beforehand via email (in English) and then accomodating a last minute change of plans when a triple room was required. We arrived too early in the morning to get to our rooms, but our bags were kept securely while we went off to discover Berlin. The hotel is in the Mitte district of former East-Berlin, which meant that it had more character and a youthful, alternative feel to it. On many corners were cafe's that turned into bars in the evening allowing for long, late slow drinking and eating. The area felt safe and friendly. Our room was spacious, clean, new looking and very quiet (even with building work happening across the road). The TV had no English speaking channels, but who cares. Breakfast was a mixture of continental and cooked food and served until 10am. We didn't eat dinner there as there are many other places to eat in the area. Staff were always friendly and spoke excellent English - they even posted me an undeveloped camera film that we had left in the room - I suspect most hotels wouldn't have bothered.

Its spotlessly clean, with the original wooden floors and original art works everywhere. The beds are outrageously comfortable, and on the coldest day of the year with a foot of snow on the ground, it was snug and cosy.
