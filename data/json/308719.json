Try to get the rooms closest to the sea wall. The pluses are the pleasant grounds and the absolute beauty of the sea. The staff is good and the rooms are good enough, although not great. The pool is fun with the kids.The downsides are the 15 minutes walk to Lovina proper (walk on the beach, not the road), the restaurant doesn\u9225\u6a9b measure up to others in town, the persistent (although friendly) hawkers standing just the other side of the wall, and the lack of any real beach. But hire the masseuses that hang out just outside the grounds and get a massage on the Bale Bale feet away from the Coral Sea lapping up on the shore and any care or worry you have will disappear.", "Date": "Sep 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR184682320", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "rickdoc"}, {"Content": "Best Value in Lovina I cannot recommend the Aditya Beach resort too highly.

It was fantastic being out on the water watching the sunrise. The dolphin watching itself was a bit of a letdown. 15-20 boats chasing the dolphins whenever they'd surface - more like a dolphin chase !I'm hoping to return to Lovina and this hotel sometime in the future", "Date": "Feb 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR888001405", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "dingo_joe"}, {"Content": "don't bother with the Aditya Beach Resort!!! My husband and I were unfortunate enough to come across this hotel as it is where you can go dolphin watching from. We only sat in reception for an hour using the toilet!!!!! and we stayed for breakfast. Do not bother with this place no matter how cheap it is. The breakfast was the worst and I mean the worst I have ever come across and we are well travelled. The only safe thing to have was toast and we didn't bother with what they were trying to pass off as coffee!!!!!!", "Date": "Jun 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR397553807", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SamKD"}, {"Content": "Great Value Hotel We stayed at the Aditya in Lovina for a few days as part of our honeymoon in Bali. We didn't book ahead and just turned up and negotiated a price. We paid about 350,000 per night. The hotel staff were particularly friendly (especially the reception staff) We got a deluxe sea view cottage right beside the beach where we could watch the most amazing sunsets from our terrace. The room was very big and spotless. It didn't have the latest designer decor but it had everything we needed. The bathroom could have done with a sprucing up but nothing to complain about at the price we paid.The hotel is set in lovely gardens and faces right on to the beach. The pool is lovely and very clean but the sunbathing area around it is a little small and can become crowded.We only had lunch in the restaurant once which was buffet-style. It was fine - nothing special but not bad either. We preferred to walk in to the main strip of Lovina and eat there where there was a large selection of restaurants.I thought the Aditya was great value for money, is in a great location and the service was excellent. It's a great place to relax as the atmosphere is so chilled. The negatives would be the decor in the rooms is not what you'd call uber-chic (but not shabby either), it's a little far to walk by road from the main strip if you don't like walking (about 10-15 mins), the pool area can be a bit crowded and the restaurant didn't seem particularly inspiring (but there are plenty of other options nearby)", "Date": "Apr 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR968834766", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "beefree"}, {"Content": "Luxurious Botique Hotel Stayed here for 4 wonderful days in the off-season. Had the place to ourselves. Super setting, attentive service, best food we had in Sri Lanka, when where and how we wanted it. Staying here is like being a billionaire with you own villa. Not much around the hotel, a short ride to Galle or Hikkadwa, but why go there if you're looking for solitude and luxury and no beach boys to bother you try here to relax, enjoy. The best suite available is not for the handicapped or inebriated as it is has lots of steps.
