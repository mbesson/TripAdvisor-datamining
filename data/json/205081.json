Simple and basic is what we got! Getting up to the hotel was an adventure in its self, in the tiny 'wood look' closet like elevator! We booked a quad which was the same size as a regular double room, when we entered the room it looked like it was just one big bed as there was barely space to walk between the beds. The beds were ok, our room had mustard bedspreads, the bathroom was tiny and our toilet didn't flush too well (not too good with four people in the room!) On the positive, the breakfast was free and relatively good for what we were paying. (Pastries, boiled eggs, cold meats, cheese, cereals, tea coffee etc) It is also very close to the Termini station so it is very convenient to get to the the airport. The staff were friendly and there was free wifi in the hotel.

Question is how?/ if they wernt working together did they track this down so easily and who did the other chain belong too?

However it was quite a hike up to the 4th floor where the hotel was actually located (each floor had a different hotel).

We arrived early for our check in, so they provided us with a key to a locker room to store our luggage. The room was actually big with high vaulted ceiling. It was very basic with a phone, small TV, A/C, and fridge. You had to check out the remote for both the TV and A/C at the front desk. The bed was okay, but it didn't really have any blanket, it was more like a thick sheet. They also had free Wi-Fi, since our room was close to the front desk, it had pretty good signal.

First impressions are not good as the hotel entrance is via a rather dodgy looking hallway, guarded by a few odd looking characters standing on the pavement beside a number of rubbish bags. To be fair, the rubbish bags were lifted soon after when we went for a walk that afternoon. The street wasn't as bad as we first thought and we soon felt a bit easier with the location, knowing it was only for one night anyway. The actual hotel reception is on the fourth floor, accessed by a very small lift. The reception desk is also very small, however the staff are polite and helpful and our front facing room was clean and tidy, if a bit sparse in decor. The room was a good size with a clean practical bathroom, the shower was brilliant. We soon left for a walk in the city centre, which took a leisurely 30 minutes or so and had a lovely evening enjoying everything that Rome has to offer. We returned around ten and went to bed feeling rather tired, having travelled down from Milan by train that morning, which is a lovely journey in itself. The only draw back in having a front facing room, is the noise from the street, which does not stop until late on about 3am. Breakfast was surprisingly nice, with cereals and pastries, which suited me perfectly. We were able to leave our luggage in a store room after we checked out which gave us another day to enjoy Rome, before catching the train to the airport, for our flight home. The Scott House Hotel is about 200 metres from the train station and does what it says on the tin! It is very basic, yet provides an adequate hotel room for a one or at most, two night stay in Rome. Don't expect any luxuries, just put your head down after a busy day and try to get a good nights sleep. The great thing is you don't have far to pull that heavy suitcase before boarding the train for the next part of your journey. All in all, not as bad as we thought when we first arrived and if we needed a room close to Rome station again, I would probably go back but would ask for a rear facing room.

It ebbed and waned depending on time of day. They did have a plumber come look at it but it wasn't fixed while we were there. They also offered to move us on day 2 of a 3-day stay but we decided to stay put because we would have had to pack up everything and then wait until late in the day to get another room.

The hotel area is really convenient if you need to take the train or the bus to Rome's both airports but it's true that it is not the nicest area in Rome (I suggest you to use the Google Street View function to find out how the area looks like). Let's say that it's a busy area, as the main train station and the main local bus station are just a 2 minutes walk from the hotel main door.

The Scott House Hotel is on the forth floor of a massive tenement block 2 minutes from the central station, which is great for accessing all Romes tourist spots in a few minutes. On foot the Colosseum is around 20 minutes away - still perfectly reasonable. Four flights of stairs may be a bit daunting but there is a lift which makes getting your bags to your room an awful lot easier. Having read many other reviews of this hotel I can only presume that since they were written Scott House has had a refit since the rooms are now clean, bright and well maintained. The TV is small for the size of the room and you\u2019ll have to leave a deposit before you can get your hands on the remote but honestly, who comes to Rome to watch TV? The beds were comfortable enough and although the rooms have AC it\u2019s controlled solely from reception. It is effective but the only options are ON or OFF which tends to mean you wake up in the early hours shivering and thinking you\u2019re back in England. The breakfast, which is included in the price of the room, is fairly minimal: just a Crossiant, a packet of miniscule melba toast and a glass of slightly suspect (and daily changing) fruit juice. If you\u2019re cheeky enough though they\u2019re pretty flexible - we managed to get an extra pastry or two on most days! The reason that I\u2019m giving this hotel only 3 out of 5 is because of the staff: each and every time I went near reception I was plagued about giving them money. When I booked, several months previously, there was no mention that the payment should be made when we arrived so it came as a shock to us when we were asked to suddenly hand over some money. We withdrew the maximum allowance from an ATM (\u20ac250) and gave it to them as proof we wouldn\u2019t run off without paying - this covered well over half the total price and more than the amount due for the length of time we had already stayed. The receptionist seemed quite happy with that but that night we were asked again to pay by another receptionist, and we had to go through the receipt book with her before she believed that we\u2019d paid. Then on our way out of dinner the same receptionist wanted MORE money, saying we had two nights left to pay and that she was suspicous of us not having paid already. In another incident, I asked if I could get one page printed from the internet. The receptionist said it wasn\u2019t possible, which is fair enough - they\u2019re not a printers but the excuse he gave was that they couldn\u2019t use the computer for anything other than work relating to the hotel, not even personal stuff. When we went out to get the information printed elsewhere he was sat there with his headphones on on Facebook. So much for not using it for personal reasons. The internet is available free, you just need to get an account made specifically for you, it\u2019s pretty fast but you will have to have your own laptop with Wi-Fi if you want to use it as there isn\u2019t a shared computer. Considering the price of some of the hotels in the area Scott House Hotel is reasonable, although not cheap by any means. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and you couldn\u2019t get much closer to the station without sleeping on the tracks so its location is ideal.

LOL. When I look to the right I can see the train station. We just came out of the wrong doors. If coming by train, exit the station close to the end where the city buses are. We are literally 2 blocks away. This is not an impressive hotel. It is housed in a building with other hotels and businesses. The \"lobby\" is on the 4th floor. The lift is small and looks a little scary but once you get used to it it is fine. The rooms are SMALL and the beds are low to the ground. You have to open the door to the shower to bend over and pick up the soap. But it is clean, the staff are friendly and helpful, There is TV and internet and it is in the heart of the city.

The breakfast was nice. I wouldn't write a poor review on these two problems alone as I try not to let such things upset my travels.

We were with my parents who were in 402. We were given 403, but asked to be switched and got 404. 402: It was sparse. The only furniture was a bed, 2 night stands, and a built in closet with a bar so high my average-height mom couldn't hang her clothes up. There was no rug on the floor, and the floors were not particularly clean (the sheets and towels were clean at least). The \"queen bed\" was 2 twin beds pushed together. There was not even a toilet paper holder in the bathroom. The toilet is uncomfortably close to the wall. 403: The worst hotel room I've ever seen. The bathroom is arranged such that a person over 5'3\" couldn't possibly find room to sit on the toilet, your knees would hit the wall. There was mold growing on the wall above the shower, lots of it. Again, the \"queen bed\" was 2 twins. No rug and again dirty floors. There was a desk in this room. Again, no toilet paper holder. 404: The best one out of the three, but not enjoyable to stay there. The queen bed was an actual queen. No rugs, dirty floors. Furnished more than the other rooms--bed didn't look like a prison cot, there was a place to put luggage, a wardrobe, a desk. The bathroom was not clean. It was covered in soap scum and felt slimy. The shower curtain was brown at the bottom and looked filthy. The shower doesn't drain well, and if you take a shower it's very easy to flood not only the bathroom, but half the room in the process. At least you could sit on the toilet, but again, no toilet paper holder. This room also got a lot of noise from the street. In all the rooms, the television is extremely tiny and too high to reach by hand. A remote control will cost you a 20 euro deposit. Air conditioner cannot be controlled by the guest; you have to call the front desk and ask them to turn it on/off. There is wireless internet, though. Staff: The staff running the front desk were extremely polite and helpful. No problem there whatsoever. The breakfast staff was very rude. Breakfast: Pathetic. Croissant + coffee. Right next door there's a cafe that sells the same thing for 1.50 euro. If you MUST be right by the train station, stay across the street for about 30 euro a night more.

The towels are rough and you aren't given enough, nor were we given enough toilet paper. We had three beds squashed together. Everything looked clean, at least. The television didn't work and the air conditioner was noisy and put up much too high (you have to contact reception every time to have it turned off - no adjustments possible - so you either die from heat or freeze to death). Although they promise internet, there is none. If you ask, they tell you to find somewhere on the street. Being close to Termini is convenient, but it's a terrible area. They say that before a certain time there is breakfast, and after a certain time you can have a croissant and coffee. Don't bother to wake up early. The only extra thing you get at breakfast is a zwieback. The lift is disastrously slow or not working at all, so you almost always end up walking up 4-5 flights of stairs to get to your room. Worst of all, a friend visited us in the room one afternoon for a few hours. The next day, the manager and receptionist knocked on our door, threatening to kick us out and alleging our friend had slept there. We were told we needed to pay for an extra person!! We were then told that the hotel had a totally bizarre rule that visitors are not allowed to be in a guest room for more than 5 minutes. If a visit lasts longer than 5 minutes it must be conducted in the breakfast room. This is weird and prison-like. We actually ended up fighting with the very rude receptionist.

Then the story changed to a painter, and to come back later. When we finally were allowed into our room, there was no smell of paint, and I doubt an electrician had been there, as one of the two lights in the room had a burned out bulb. Because of the TV's location , mounted to the wall over the closet, I was forced to fork over a $10 (?!?!?) deposit for the remote, which didnt work, even after I changed the batteries. The towels were thinner than dish rags, and rationed, because when I asked for more, I was told that 2 was the most I could have (?!?!?).

They were already at the third floor before we found them, and offered to help, and the woman was terrified by the thought of having to climb the stairs all week. If you still insist on staying here, do not fall for the old trick: \"The credit card machine is broken. You'll have to pay cash!\". They tried this with us when I checked in. I refused, and the machine was \"fixed\" in ten minutes. We also wtnessed them pulling this on others the next day, and when we checked out. I don't know if they were stealing from the owners, hidding income from the government, or just avoiding the credit card fee, but it's a lousy trick to pull on a \"guest\".", "Date": "January 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul / Turkey", "Title": "\u201cBest value, excellent location, cleanest ever\u201d", "Author": "Wanderlust_Turca", "ReviewID": "UR2887235", "Content": "I found this hotel from the internet and immediately booked it. The room seemed pretty big from the pictures but I had expected a smaller room since I had a single room. The room was very little but the bed was comfortable. The bathroom is fine, shower works excellently. There is air conditioning and in winter the heating is very good. The hotel has an excellent location, 3 minutes from the Termini Station. Also it is pretty safe, there is 24 hour reception and by the night time, there is a security person at the front desk. The room was sooo clean that I was impressed...My room was very quiet. The breakfast they serve is a little one, a cold croissant, some jam, butter and toast but it would suffice. There is also free internet use for the hotel guests. My trip was in December, so I had an excellent value of 30 EUR for a single room, paid cash. The only thing I disliked would be the staff. They seemed very unhappy, should the management make some increase in their salaries????", "Date": "December 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2461375", "Content": "Having read one or two bad reviews, I was a little nervous but I needn't have worried.

I made an online reservation almost one and half month ago(There were 2 or 3 single rooms available except mine). BUT BUT they canceled my reservation without my agreement two days before the day I was visiting their hotel. That was found out just because I happened to check my e-mail in Florence before visiting Rome. I called Hotel Scott House to find out what was going on, then they said THEY CANCELED my reservation because there was no room available any more. That was so obvious they failed to update their room availability online and double booked and canceled mine. The staff was so helpless, SO HELPLESS. Your credit card# is supposed to guarantee your reservation!. After all, they told me that I could only stay for a night, so I visited the hotel. Luckily I could secure the room for 3 night because someone didn't show up. (But if he or she did??) So, I don't recommend this hotel to you. And I won't be back to the hotel either. What kind hotel is that to cancel gest's reservation without an agreement.
