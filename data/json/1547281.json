The decor and style of the hotel was first class. The rooms are named after famous Venetians instead of numbers. There is a suite that looks out on the Canal if you want to treat yourself but our smaller side rooms were more than adequate. There is a little balcony that overlooks the Canal and it is so nice to sit of an evening having a brandy or indeed taking breakfast. The staff are extremely helpful and very friendly. It has more of a \"guesthouse\" feel to it than a corporate hotel and I got the feeling that they genuinely cared about their visitors. The food was first class and there is plenty. All drinks are reasonably priced compared to the rest of Venice.

We were met by the utterly charming Giovanna who manages and perhaps owns the hotel....her commitment to excellence and her sheer enthusiasm for the job leads me to that conclusion. What a way to arrive in Venice! We felt so at home in this small boutique hotel with its great location. Breakfasts were a feast - gorgeous very fresh pastries with Colomba cake which is served at Easter time (just like Pannetone served at Christmas time). Also a range of cold meats, cheeses, cereals, yoghurts and endless cups of espressos which just seemed to flow from the kitchen with no hint or suggestion that one might have had one's quota - a very generous attitude. Giovanna recommended various excursions, booked us a fabulous Vivaldi Concert in one of the churches near St Mark's Square, which she personally recommended, booked us a great table at the Canal Grande Monaco Hotel restaurant which I highly recommend as a treat. Being from South Africa and living in Edinburgh, we just love any opportunity to sit outside - so we at breakfast outside on the verandah and when it became quite chilly we requested blankets, quite a common practice in SA....nothing was too much effort for the staff at the Hotel Canal Grande (see pic below).

The first room was in the centre on the first floor with canal views (smallish windows, but was a generous size for Venice hotels), we ended up choosing the Antonio Canova room, which was smaller but had a lovely private terrace overlooking a little square, with views of the canal. We enjoyed watching the sunset from the terrace during our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. They greeted us whenever we passed reception, gave good restaurant reservations, and asked questions about our adventures each day. (The staff at Anitche Figure were equally helpful in organising our transfer and moving our luggage) The location is easily accesible from the main station and Ferrovia vaparetto stops (these water buses make it easier not to get lost!) Breakfast was a great selection of fruit salad, yogurt, cold meats and cheese and lots of cakes! There is filter coffee, but the staff will offer to make you a coffee or tea at no extra charge. Everything was delicious and fresh each morning. We also took advantage of the Murano tour - reception will organise a water taxi to take you across and have a tour of a glass blowing factory, and then return you to the north side of the main island at no extra cost. The journey takes about 25 mins each way and is certainly worth it to see the amazing creations.

The location if the hotel is convenient for getting to/from airport/train station I was slightly disappointed by my room, probably more because I had my expectation set for a room with big windows and blue decor, rather than anything wrong with the room itself. I was persuaded to take the canal view room as it was 'more romantic' however I think if I get to choose again I would have gone with the suite without the view as it was cold and the windows were not that big so there wasn't much looking out to the view from the room so I didnt think the room was more romantic just because it had the canal view. I was a little surprised that the hotel did not offer us any complimentary drinks or chocolate or fruit given that we're there for special occassion (most other hotels we've stayed at always did offer something). The recommendation of restaurants by the hotel staff always hit the spot (you have to tell them what you're after clearly). The local pizza fantastic, the local restaurant great value, etc. Breakfast - per the reviews by others is nothing to write home about. There ought to be a wider selection of pastry and fresh fruit instead of all the cakey/biscuity options... It's not close to San Marco etc however we could get the vaporette there or walk there (enjoyed the walk too). Overall I liked the hotel.

This was our first trip to Venice and all I can say is we can't wait to return here both to the place and the hotel The hotel was everything that Trip Advisor reviewers had said it was, friendly, accommodating, cheerful staff, spotlessly clean, just far enough away from the centre of Venice but this was excellent as we enjoyed getting lost through the streets and marvelling at the sights. It also meant we had a decent ride on the vaporetto on the way to St Marks Square. Because we went in December it also meant that Venice was relatively quiet in contrast to the busy summer months so we didn't have to queue to see any of the sights, walked straight in to the Basilica and the Doge's palace, both spectacular and queued for about 5 minutes to get to the top of the Bell tower, what a fabulous view on a crisp clear day, which we had. Back to the hotel, we stayed in the Santa Lucia suite which was on 3 levels, a downstairs lounge area with Flat screen TV (hidden in the mirror, my partner was enthralled by this) and small cooking area, behind mirrored doors. Then upstairs to our beautiful bedroom and bathroom then up another small flight to our outside terrace area. We were in the annex at the side of the hotel, which I thought we might be as I couldn't quite afford the more expensive rooms, however this turned out to be a bonus as we had the quietest comfiest nights sleep ever in this suite as there wasn't anyone above, below or at the side of us. I can highly recommend the Santa Lucia Suite. Oh and one other thing my partner proposed to me in St Marks Square, which was the most amazing surprise. So Hotel Canal Grande, thanks again..... we will be back for the honeymoon!!", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cA perfect stay\u201d", "Author": "supergirl_sf", "ReviewID": "UR121746782", "Content": "How rare is it that every review of a place is a positive one? Particularly when there are over 380 of them? I was surprised \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and, oddly enough, skeptical -- when I noticed that there is nary a negative review for this hotel here on Trip Advisor. So, despite the fact that this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark horse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd showed up late in my debate about what hotel to choose in Venice, I booked it. What a fortunate choice, since it turns out all these glowing reviews are right: Hotel Canal Grande is a perfect place to stay in Venice. Each staff member I encountered was helpful and solicitous, the rooms are lovely, the hotel spotless, and although the location is a bit removed from the center of the touristic melee in this town, I consider that a good thing (plus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a couple minutes walk to the nearest vaporetto stop, which will convey you into the fray). The night of my arrival, I stayed in one of the rooms in a newer building adjacent to the main hotel, appointed in the cream silks you can see in the photos. At ground level with windows facing an alley, the room was rather dark, and smelled too strongly of air freshener. After opening the windows (chilly, in November), I could have lived with the scent, but the darkness was a little depressing. In the morning, I asked at the desk if I could have one of the blue rooms, just because they looked nicer on the website. And here is one mark of a good hotel: they accommodated my request graciously and without demur, even though there was no compelling reason for it. As in, there was nothing wrong with the first room, I just like the color blue better than cream. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible that my second room, the Casanova, which is in the attic, might have been a higher price since its windows faced onto the Grand Canal. If so, the hotel staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention it; rather, they just fulfilled my request (and remembered to remove the air freshener, if there had been one in this room, without me having to ask). The Casanova room was a little smaller than my original one, but this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to me. It was decorated in the gorgeous sky blue silk you can see on the website, bright and sunny during the day, and snug at night. Being at the top of the building, it was also quieter without any upstairs neighbors treading above my head. Continental breakfast is included in a cheery breakfast room, and here again the staff is perfect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cheerful and accommodating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible there are room service items that you can order to your room throughout the day and evening \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look into it. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small bar from which you could pick up a drink in the evening, if your room does not have an honor bar (some do, mine didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t). I think the rooms have free WiFi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I left my computer at home \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a computer in the lobby in case you have a burning need to check in on Facebook. There may be a couple of free entries with your stay; I believe one of the desk workers mentioned that I could go to the casino or a glass blower on Murano, although I did not end up doing either; too much else to see. My final observation is that when I checked out, after 5 nights, the desk person asked very specifically if everything had been all right with my stay. Yes, I said. Rather than leave it there, he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is there anything we could do better or differently?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd No, actually, there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t: Hotel Canal Grande delivered a perfect stay.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basingstoke, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn Oasis of Calm in a busy City\u201d", "Author": "John-Boy-Saint", "ReviewID": "UR121503508", "Content": "Superb hotel in a very quiet square overlooking the Grand Canal.

Though not cheap, some of their rooms offer great value. From Piazzale Roma, the walking distance is not terribly long (about 10-15 minutes), but it is strongly advisable to study the walking directions to the hotel. As for service, it did not start well. While I managed to find the hotel with two heavy bags and a backpack in tow, surprisingly the man at reception did not offer to assist until I made it to the desk. It was then that he had the porter place my bags in storage. I was informed the room would not be available for some time and proceeded to a small deck situated right along the canal where there are some tables and chairs from which one can admire the views. Fortunately things did improve once my room became available. The staff walked me over to a \"new\" building that is part of the hotel. These rooms are located within the square about five or six buildings away. Once inside, one can see this location is well maintained as quality, security, and comfort are immediately evident. Public access is prohibited and limited to guests and staff. My room is on the second floor located along a quiet calle (small street). After a quick tour, my bags were delivered up to the room. Inside there is enough room for a double bed, small desk and armoire. Two windows provide sufficient natural light. The bathroom is well kept and clean, though much smaller than expected. Functionally, everything worked as expected. I had no problems with maintaining a comfortable temperature in the room and slept very well on the supportive bed. The shower earns high marks with its modern fixtures and ample water pressure. Lastly, sound insulation seems excellent as I did not detect any noise from outside or from other rooms. Later in the day, I did receive commendable assistance at the reception desk for any questions and concerns I had about getting around and finding a place to eat. They were even able to help me share a water taxi with other guests heading over to the cruise terminal. The next morning, I found their excellent breakfast to offer the usual choices of breads and pastries, yogurt, fruit salad, cold meats and cheeses, and fruit juices. Coffee and cappuccino are terrific. The breakfast area is adequate for all guests. Even when busy, service is attentive, and the overall ambiance is highly enjoyable. On the day of departure, while leaving my room, one of the hotel staff (I wish I could recall her name) saw that I needed assistance with my bags. She helped me navigate both of them down the narrow staircase and even insisted helping me on the way back to the main building. When the water taxi arrived, luggage was again handled professionally by the staff. Pros: Services is personal and attentive, almost excellent. Quiet room and comfortable bed. Quality breakfast. Located in a quiet square away from the crowds. Proximity to Piazzale Roma, Santa Lucia railway station, and Marittima Cruise Terminal. Cons: Small double room. No elevator in adjacent building (which was not an issue since the staff was very helpful with my luggage).", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cMissing the canal, but...\u201d", "Author": "reigndeerz", "ReviewID": "UR121306543", "Content": "Hotel Canal Grande prides itself on sitting right by the grand canal in Venice.

You can sit in the lobby and watch the boats float by the hotel. We stayed two nights. We took the first available room which was on the main floor. The room was beautiful. The TV is in the mirror? Good storage. We were about 5 blocks from Plaza Roma which is the bus and taxi terminal. We were across the water and about 6 blocks from the Venice Casino. We were 200 feet from the vaporetta which is the public water bus. We actually took the vaporetta to the Plaza Roma and caught a real taxi to the airport for 40E. There are small eateries everywhere. Go across the first bridge and you will find great shopping and restaurants. The hotel has an arrangement with Murano. They will pick you up and water taxi you there for free. You are taken to the glass factory to watch items made. You are given a sales person. You are then taken to different rooms to look at things to buy. It seems to become a time share presentation from there. I actually had to tell the young man that was assigned to us to back off. The items you are viewing are thousands of dollars. We actually did but a piece done by a well known Venice artist, but it was not what I expected. I would pay to go back to Murano and walk the island. You are taken to one factory and there are 300 on the island. I wanted to go to a gift ship to buy items for friends but the gift shop pieces where not what I would have brought home. This particular factory specialized in upscale, one of a kind pieces, so their small cheap items were not well done. They say that the shops in Venice carry all Chinese glass and pass it off as Murano. You are looking for a store who represents the glass they have with artist brochures and the like. There is a wonderful shop over the bridge and down a couple of blocks who carries smaller one of a kind pieces from the factory where we bought ours that are hundreds of dollars not thousands. Sorry I did not see them earlier. When people buy from the factories set up by the hotel, everyone gets a cut including the hotel. Just be forewarned. I would definately stay at this hotel again.

First, the hotel is well located just steps away from the train station Santa Lucia. We determined that Venice is not a place you want to lug your luggage around the city. And we were correct. This hotel you can see from the train station, and it's just a short walk over the bridge and around the corner. Venice is like a labyrinth, and we could not fathom trying to find some of the hotels we saw. Take our advice, stick with a very well located hotel like the Hotel Canal Grande. While this hotel is not located near St. Marks square, the convenience, in our mind, more than makes up for hassle in transporting luggage (keep in mind everything is either by walking or by water bus/taxi). Second, the hotel was renovated just 2 years ago and is immaculate. The rooms were very comfy cozy and romantic. Updated bathrooms!!! Third, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We could not recommend this hotel more, just because of the staff. They were warm and seemed generally to care about our stay. Our stay came with breakfast, and there was more than enough to eat. All kinds of pastries, cured meats and cheeses, and fruit, along with choice of beverages (2 kinds of orange juice, cappucino, etc...). The hotel coordinated a trip to the Murano glass factory (free), which was very interesting, but was kind of like a big sales pitch....you spend more time walking through the showroom rather than watching the people make glass items. But still well worth going. We walked everywhere. We did not take the water bus/taxi (except for going to and from Murano). From the hotel it takes about 30 minutes to get to St. Marks square, but we were told that it would take about 1 hour on the water bus because it stops everywhere. We did not mind the walking because we got to look at all the shops and get some excercise. The hotel staff also made some good recommendations for dinner - where the locals go, not the tourists.

The service was excellent and we ended up with a room looking over the grand canal, which was very nice and surprisingly quiet. The room was on the small size, but very quaint and nice. The bed was on the hard side for me, which would be my only real complaint. The hotel didn't seem very busy until our last day so we had no problem eating breakfast and having a nightcap out at one of the two tables on the dock. We took a private taxi (110 Euro) from the airport to the hotel which I highly recommend if you can. I am sure the shared taxi (~32 Euro) is good as well. It is a really nice way to approach Venice and get to where you want to go with the least hassle. Our favorite thing about this hotel is the location. You are away from St. Mark's square and the other touristy places, which we really liked. There are some great neighborhoods to explore around the hotel and the crowds are a lot less than the east side of town, where you can easily get to when you want to. You might not like this location if you have issues getting lost, or don't like to walk. You can take the public boat places, but it is much easier to just go out walking. Getting lost in Venice is inevitable. If you let it stress you out you will be miserable. If you have fun with it, it is a great way to explore the city. I would recommend this hotel and gladly stay here next time I am in Venice.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Littleborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVenice Dream\u201d", "Author": "KILester", "ReviewID": "UR118855877", "Content": "My husband and I spent our last three nights of our three week Italian honeymoon at this hotel, we have stayed in Venice twice before at the sister hotel of Antiche Figure just opposite which we loved but this time we thought we would try the new hotel.

Also pretty close to Piazzale Roma (main bus terminal). When you cross Ponte Scalzi you can already see the hotel to your left. The hotel is a little further away from Piazza San Marco but that is actually nice as that area can get extremely busy with all the cruise ship day trippers. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to come back to the quieter part of the city. When exploring the city, following the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alla ferrovia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (to the train station) signs helps you get back into the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neighbourhood. The hotel is located on a small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153campo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd right on the canal. At night, you should grab a bottle of wine, sit by the canal and watch the boats go by. This is definitely one of my favourite Venice memories. Room: We arrived a little later in the evening due to a rail strike but were greeted and shown to our room immediately. In addition to the main building that you see on the hotel website and some of the tripadvisor reviews, the hotel owns a second building a little further away from the canal (maybe 3 or 4 houses down) with additional rooms. Our room was the San Giorgio room on the ground floor with pretty much no view (they call it view of a traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which is essentially a narrow walkway so you have a view of the opposite building wall). When I booked the room, I assumed that all rooms were located in the main building and had some sort of a view so that was a bit of a surprise. Note that if you want a room with a view, you have to book a Gran Canal Prestige Room. We booked a Prestige Double Room through Expedia and this was the only choice so if you want a room with a view you may have to book it with the hotel directly. Our room was still very nice though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nicely decorated and a good size. Food: The breakfast area is fairly small so it gets a bit crowded during the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast time around 8:30. Wait staff were attentive and they always checked if we wanted another cappuccino or anything else. The breakfast buffet is average for a hotel in this class. A hot breakfast (scrambled eggs etc.) can be ordered for an extra charge of 4 Euros. On two nights we asked the reception staff for their restaurant recommendations and both nights we were pleasantly surprised. They gave us detailed directions and made reservations for us. In terms of getting to the airport, the hotel staff was again very helpful in providing their recommendations. A water taxi will cost approx. 110 Euros for a 20-minute ride and you will have to take a shuttle to get from the boat dock to the terminal. On the other hand, if you got a 1 or 2-day vaporetto ticket, you can take the boat to the bus terminal at Piazzale Roma (only 2 stops from the hotel) and take the bus directly to the airport (drive is less than half an hour and the bus drops you off directly at the terminal for 5 Euros a person).

No, it was not cheap, but you got what you paid for! The hotel is absolutely charming. The small, cozy front desk area was very welcoming with its sitting area right in front and the staff was absolutely marvelous with us. Everything was explained about the hotel and area and they gave us some wonderful tips on where to eat and where to go (and what to avoid). The room was just beautiful. It had a lovely Venetian touch with the period-style furniture, furnishings and one of the best treats: GOOD air conditioning in the room! The bathroom was large and modern with classic hints as well. There is even a small lift in the building, which was appreciated by many. The Breakfast nook was lovely, with some tables on the small balcony on the water's edge. This is where we enjoyed our breakfast (when it didn't rain!) and the staff were charming with the good coffees and soft drinks for those that wanted something else. Food selection was also very nice. Not a vast spread, but still enough to appeal to all. I had secretly hoped for a room on the canal side, but as we were so lucky to get a room, I was still happy with our room on the side of the small square in front of the hotel. We still had a nice view of the canal and looked out on to the square which was always quiet and relaxing. Location. Whilst many prefer to stay closer to the Piazza San Marco, we were actually thrilled with this hotel's location. It is not far from the main train station, bus station and parking lots near the causeway. Getting to the centre was a short boat ride away. The water taxis stopped not too far from the hotel, but it seemed a bit far as you had to walk in and out of small side streets. The neighborhood had some small bakeries and restaurants where we enjoyed our meals. It's also a very photogenic part of Venice where you can wander for hours and admire the streets, homes and see the real way of life. As part of our package stay we had a complimentary visit to the Murano islands to see the art of glass blowing. Very, very interesting and afterwards you see what all is made and sold, where they do try and sell you anything and everything. We just admired the beautiful glassworks and then returned to the city by way of the water taxi, which we thoroughly enjoyed. To reach the hotel, your best bet is to take the water taxi from the airport to the hotel, where they dock in front of the hotel. It is not cheap as there is a flat rate of EUR 100, but it is quite the experience. Also if you are returning a rental car, return it to the airport as the walk from the car rental return to the hotel is an intricate and tiring one if you have a lot of luggage!

One of the problems I find with reading reviews on here is that it can boost your expectations of a hotel and you can be a little disappointed when you get there. To be fair it can also work the other way, but in this instance it was the former. We arrived around 12 noon after our early morning flight from Leeds Bradford airport, unfortunately our room was not ready, which was fine as check in time was not until 2pm. We left our luggage and took our small piece of hand luggage and set off to find some lunch. Nearly three hours later when we returned the room we had been designated wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready but as by this time we were tired of carrying our small hand baggage decided to take a room offered on the ground floor. The room was quite small but contained a very large bed and all the usual furniture, but it was also very dark. There was a bathroom off to one side containing a shower, washbasin and toilet. Now if there is one thing I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like in a hotel is being given a disabled bathroom when aged 58. I am sure the time will come when I may well need the use of one, but until that time arrives I would rather have a conventional bathroom. It may be a small point but it bugs me! I am assuming that as this room was on the ground floor and had a disabled bathroom it was their disabled room, but I defy anyone to get a wheelchair around the bed and therefore I can only assume that its there to meet the minimal legal requirements. However knowing there were no other rooms ready, or so we believed, we accepted the smaller room. I have to say though that the bed was extremely comfortable and there was no noise at all. The windows looked out onto a narrow street but no one ever seemed to pass. The hotel is I think relatively new and everything was finished to a very high standard, Breakfast is a buffet affair which is fine but in a four star hotel I would expect fresh fruit salad for breakfast not tinned, the same goes for the orange and grapefruit juice. There is a selection of breads and croissants, cold meats and cheese, however don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the toaster if you want to leave the hotel before 11am. It takes that long to brown toast and its rock hard when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done it. On a couple of occasions we returned to the hotel early evening to have a drink on the small terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. In a four star hotel I expect lemon or lime in my G&T and some nibbles, especially when paying over \u00c2\u00a318 for the privilege, but there was neither. The hotel location is brilliant, just close enough to the train and bus station and on the quiet side of the Grand Canal. The little square that it is situated in is lovely made all the better by the gentleman who plays the violin in an evening. The small terrace is delightful and in the 4 days that we stayed there we were always able to get a seat even though it only has two tables with two chairs each. Overall this is a good 3.5 star hotel. The staff are friendly and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do enough for you but it is just missing that bit of extra polish that would make it a good 4 star hotel. It's the fine detail in the service that's missing. Would I stay there again? Yes I would. I think our disappointment comes from having emailed the hotel a couple of times before we arrived to say that we were in Venice to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary and asking if there was anything they could do to make it extra special and being promised that they would. That promise never materialised and that, coupled with the very good reviews on Trip Advisor probably left us feeling a little disappointed.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel we ever stayed at\u201d", "Author": "McKerien", "ReviewID": "UR112779654", "Content": "We had booked into their sister Hotel Antiche Figure, however due to a double booking we were offered a move to this newer hotel just 800 yards further along the Grand Canal.

I booked the rooms via Hotel.com and got what I felt to be a very reasonable rate, especially for a hotel in the centre of Venice and one which was regularly receiving very positive feedback on this site. Having booked the hotel I e-mailed the hotel reception a couple of weeks before we were due to arrive to tell them our trip was to celebrate our silver anniversary and to ask them to have flowers and champagne in the room for our arrival. I received a quick and friendly response from the hotel detailing prices etc. I explained that we would be arriving at the hotel from the airport by water taxi and they offered to make the necessary arrangements. On arrival at the airport we simply presented ourselves to the Venezia Water Taxi desk in the main building and we were taken direct to our taxi. We were met at the hotel's water landing by the porter then straight to the reception desk where we were offered the option of upgrading to a room with a private terrace overlooking the Grand Canal for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30 per night. We were shown both rooms before deciding, and happily took up the offer of the upgrade - that's not to say the original room was in anyway inferior. The weather for the next few days was superb and we made good use of the terrace every evening. As far as we could make out the room we took up was the only one in the hotel with a terrace, indeed the only one with a terrace in the area! The room itself was compact but had a very comfortable queen-sized bed and was beautifully decorated. Although the hotel is situated on the canal itself, the noise from the passing traffic is not intrusive and it was great to watch the world go by while enjoying a glass or two of wine after a full day's sight-seeing. The hotel is located 10 minutes walk from the main railway station and only a couple of hundred yards beyond that is the main bus station. They are both conveniently located but one can't see trains or buses from the hotel and neither in anyway detract from the wonderful location. The staff at the hotel were exceptionally friendly and helpful and we have no hesitation in recommending it to others. If visiting the hotel, one tip we would give is to use the Vaparetto stop near to the hotel rather than cross the 2 bridges to the main Vaparetto stop(s) outside of the railway station. Neither bridge is overly challenging, but after hours of walking round Venice it is so much easier to walk 50 Metres on the flat rather than 400 metres over 2 bridges!", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Geomil983", "ReviewID": "UR110637767", "Content": "Let us begin by expresssing our gratitude to Gianni, at the front desk.

After a very uncomfortable overnight red-eye flight from Charlotte/Philadelphia, we were surprised at how easy it was to travel to the hotel from Marco Polo Airport. We decided to travel via the local bus to Main Venice Bus terminal and see/listen to the locals as they boarded at various points as well as enjoy the scenery on the way in from the mainland over the lagoon bridge to Venice proper. From the bus depot, we walked about 12 to 15 minutes winding over two foot bridges along the canal (we started window shopping within 1 minute after getting off the bus) and through a short alley way past a gondola stop and there was the hotel entrance in an open quiet courtyard (Venice is not ADA friendly...so bring good walking shoes). We arrived around 10:30 AM and were greeted by the friendliest reception staff. We requested the largest most quiet room possible (we were really tired). They allowed us to view several rooms first and we decided to stay in the adjacent apartment (about 50 feet further in from the courtyard). The room (picture attached) impressed us the most but did not have a canal view except for a mini-space between adjacent apartment buildings...which also meant it was very quiet). The room was wonderfully appointed with elegant drapes, window treatments, the largest bathroom in the complex of our room type, but you would need to walk up 2 flights of stairs (they carried our bags so that was not a real issue). We had our own separate private entrance, which we found a nice touch as we ended up constantly going in and out all day There were no other rooms/guests on the 3rd level so it was like having a private apartment/floor all to ourselves. There is a church about 50 feet away, so you will hear churchbells at 7:30 AM in the morning but I think that is the case anywhere in Venice. The nights were always quiet...not even noise from any other hotel guests of local Venetians. I mentioned the staff at the recption were wonderful, but I also found all the staff were always friendly, responsive, and attentive including the concierge, breakfast buffet servers/cooks, maid, and groundskeepers. Indeed, we found almost all the Venetians we met were really helpful and friendly...most spoke English as well. Free Wifi comes and breakfast buffet was included in our reservation. The Hotel is strategically placed on the Grand Canal so you can jump on the any of the water transports (water bus, gandola) to see the whole city. There were tons of places to eat, we enjoyed a self service BREK where they cooked your food on the spot in front of you and the adjacent pizza joint where they also cooked the pizza right in front of you!!! We enjoyed watching and conversing with the food cooks every day were were there. We did find it very easy and scenic to take the water transport everywhere, but we made it a point to walk back as much as possible through the various alley around San Marco Square and Rialto Bridge through the Strada Nuovo back to our hotel. We had great weather (warm but not hot with cool mornings/evenings) except for one day with rain which we used to visit the inside of the civic Museums and churches. The hotel staff arranged for a water taxi to take us directly from the hotel to the Marco Polo airport. While the water taxi cost 100 euro for boatride, the crisp clear day made the trip a great way to conclude our last hour in Venice winding through the canals and over the lagoon where the snow-capped mountains provided another memorable view. We had a great trip and the hotel's staff, location, colorful decorations, breakfast buffet really added to the splendor of Venice.

If you arrive via Piazzale Roma (where bus transfers from the airports arrive), it is only a 10 minute walk on the bank of the Grand Canal to the hotel. Very convenient. The check in is great. Front desk is manned by Giovanna, a wonderful woman who is always helpful, most knowledgeable, and always ready with a smile. She has excellent English with the most charming Italian inflection! The hotel has a wonderful location. We were paying Euro 290 per night for a double (not a low rate if you ask me) but luckily for us, Giovanna upgraded up to a double room which also included a beautiful outdoor terrace with a view of the Grand Canal. The size of the terrace was 50% the size of the room! The room was spotlessly clean, elegantly decorated, but quite small compared to other hotel rooms we'd pay a similar price for in other cities, and the bathroom, although also spotless and brand new in terms of design and fixtures, was also narrow and small (i.e. only one person could be in it at a time). So, now you realize how expensive Venice is and what you have to pay! By the way, eating in Venice is likely 50% more expensive than in the rest of Italy. So, choose your restaurant's wisely and spend a little more to get something truly memorable. The hotel is located just opposite, by a bridge, to the Vaporetto water bus service, where for Euro 6.50 per person, you can travel anywhere on the Grand Canal and beyond. It takes 40 minutes or so to San Marco on the \"local\" water bus with all the stops. But do it since every minute on the Grand Canal is breathtaking. The breakfast was very nice and of good quality. Nice cold cuts, fresh croissants, choices of yougurts, hard boiled eggs, and more! They have friendly serving people there including a nice Russian lady as well who speaks great Italian also. I would certainly recommend this hotel. A wonderful place. Even more wonderful if you can get a lower price for your room!

My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights over the Easter weekend and it was everything that we had hoped for. We were booked in the Antonio Canova room, which I think is the ONLY hotel room in all of Venice with its own terrace (2nd floor). It had a great view of the canal, was lavishly decorated, and a welcome retreat after a long day schleping the streets of Venice. The staff were most accommodating and gracious. Breakfast consisted of good, strong coffee, yogurt, boiled eggs, cold meats/cheeses, cereals, fruit, croissants/breads, juices. They even made coffee for me to take up to the room before the breakfast station opened. They have a computer to use free of charge. The hotel recommended a nearby restaurant for a late evening dinner (Ostaria al Vecio Pozzo) which we visited more than once. They had great anti-pasti, pasta, pizza, and wine for a reasonable price. We visited San Marco Square (very busy), Murano Glass Factory (interesting, but not a must-see place), and toured the old Jewish Ghetto (very quiet compared to the rest of Venice). We did the water taxi ride from San Marco back to the hotel (90 Euro) but it's a great way to see the city. The gelato in Venice is OUT OF THIS WORLD. We had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Because it was Easter weekend, Venice was extremely busy and we were sick of the tourists by day 4. It reminded us somewhat of Niagara Falls on a long weekend with a different water feature. It is, however, unlike any other city in the world. No matter how detailed your map is, you will get lost, but that's part of the fun. We had an early (6:50 am) flight out of Marco Polo Airport when we left. A word to the wise, the Number 5 bus is the most cost efficient way to get to the airport from Venice. It cost 3 Euro per person versus 120 Euro for an off-hour water taxi. We did a trial run out to the airport by bus the day before we left just to see what we would be in for. The bus station is less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel and you cross 3 small bridges (not the Scalzi bridge) on the south side of the canal. The Marco Polo Airport is a whole other story. On our trip, we hit 7 airports (including Russian airports) and the only one we had any trouble with was Marco Polo. Wrong boarding passes leaving Venice and then a 3-hour strike on our return visit which laid us over for another day. At least we got out before the Pope and 300,000 fans arrived.

We still had canal views if we poked our heads out the window a bit and we looked out over a nice little courtyard. The breakfast each morning was really quite good and the staff are always eager to make a specialty coffee for you, although they also provide self-serve coffee with the breakfast which was really good too. In the evenings before dinner we often drank wine on the small hotel terrace which overhangs the grand canal and would sit and watch the sunset and the passing boats. It was truly beautiful. The location was fabulous; a short walk to the train station and the main parking area of Venice (where you arrive by bus or taxi from the mainland). It's not the most touristy area of Venice, which is a bonus in my opinion, but lots of great restaurants in the area for better prices than you'll find in San Marco. The hotel offers a free boat ride to Murano if you want to go see the glass making factory, which was kind of interesting to see, but the prices are insanely ridiculous.! You can find WAY cheaper Murano blown glass anywhere in Venice. If you don't have a lot of time, I wouldn't waste it going to Murano.

I rely heavily on TripAdvisor when I search for hotels---of all the sensibly priced hotels I've ever booked, the Hotel Canal Grande was by far most impressive I've ever chosen. The incredible staff is just as wonderful as the hotel itself. They were always so kind and helpful---bringing us coffee up to our room on a silver platter with china teacups. Everyone there goes out of their way to make your stay memorable. The buffet breakfast was simple but delicious---you look out over the Canal which is simply magnificent!! I would recommend this hotel to you not just because of the reasonable price, but because it couldn't be more centrally located, and it is simply a gorgeous hotel in every sense of the word. You will NOT be disappointed!!! I was even surprised at the spacious size of our enchanting venetian twin room---and so quiet!!!

First let me say the location cannot be beat. You simply cross the bridge and make a few turns and you're at the hotel - no taxi or long trek required. We did plan light though. It is on the opposite side of the train station so it is nice and quiet. It is also a short walk to the Piazzale Roma where you can catch a bus to the airport for Euro 3. Carlo who greeted us, asked us to wait for a bit and told us the breakfast was still open (this was around 10:30am) while he got our room ready. When he got us for check in he then informed us he would charge us Euro 10 instead of 15 for breakfast. My husband thought the breakfast should have been included to which Carlo replied that is tomorrow. We were really upset about this and stewed about it the entire day. He also sent us to a very expensive place for lunch, and suggested very expensive activities like the opera. When we asked about transportation to the airport, he recommended all the expensive means, like water taxi, instead of the public bus, which he brushed off by saying 'I take the bus all the time so I don't want to take the bus' We kind of just felt he was getting kick backs and it left a very bad taste in our mouths. Almost ruined our trip. He also told us he would 'upgrade' us to a canal facing room but that we'd have to change into another room the next day. This room, #301 Giacomo Cassanova was basically the attic, and while nice, had low ceilings, and the view wasn't much to write home about - a tiny window. The room we moved into next 204, Carlo Goldoni, while not canal facing we liked better because we had an actual ceiling!! The rooms are very nicely decorated and clean. Now, having said all that, the rest of our trip we never saw him again, and the front desk did not charge us the 10 euros for breakfast (even tho' carlo had written it on our passport photocopies!)

She said she would give us a map and explain things in the morning after we had got some sleep. We had a great night sleep, the bed was so comfortable. We did not have a canal view room but we had a room on the side which was very quiet as the hotel is on a private sqaure so there is no through traffic. There are a couple of benches outside in the courtyard and its a great place to sit and watch the canal boats and gondolas go by. The room was quite small but had everything we needed and was beautifully furnished. The TV is built into the mirror so the feel of the room is not ruined by a TV. In the room there was also a desk area, and a wardrobe, with a free safe inside. We were given a free Wi-Fi code on arrival for 2 hours internet use, which was more than enough. The bathroom had a superb rain shower with body jets and was so good I did not want to get out. Free toilettries are provided. The room was clean and serviced daily. Beakfast is continental, and was served 6.30-10am each day. There are a selction of juices, cereals, breads/cakes/toast/pastries, fruit, meats, cheeses and yogurts. The waitresses will get you fresh tea or coffee inc latte, cappuccino, expresso etc. The breakfast staff were very attentive. The reception staff gave us a map and explained where everything was, I found them very helpful, and their English is perfect.

Nothing was too much trouble for the staff here and they always seemed genuinely interested in how you were, and if they could be of any assistance. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NON HOTEL INFO Getting to Venice: We flew to Venices' Treviso Airport from London Stansted and a shuttle bus was waiting for our flight. For 9Euros return per person you can catch the shuttle bus. It takes approx an hour (about the same time it takes to get from the Marco Polo airport to Venice by boat). The bus arrives at the main bus terminal (Piazzale Roma) and the hotel is a short 10 min walk from there. The driver will give you a return timetable and the return journey was just as well organised and quick. Travelling around Venice: We purchased a 36 hour unlimited waterbus ticket for 23Euros each. Gondalas and water taxis can be VERY expensive and this is a great way to get around. You can go everywhere on the water buses and we went all around Venice, and even ventured out to Murano island (famous for its glass), Burano island (famous for its couloured houses, and our favourite place in Venice), and Lido (Venices seaside island). Also do not forget to travel by foot, they say the best way to see Venice is on foot and get lost!! Eating in Venice: The closer you are to either the water or a famous landmark such as San Marco Square the more expensive food and drink is, and the worse food gets as they cater for tourists and not Italians! As an example a litre of beer is approx 23Euros in San Marco square compared to 10Euros in a side street with no canal view. Also the more you go out of Venice, or onto an island the more Italian food gets and the better it gets. I found the pasta dish I had by the Grande Canal was dry and bland, yet when we ate in a small Italian cafe in Lido it was fresh, and full of flavour.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "york", "Title": "\u201cFab 50th in luxurious surroundings......\u201d", "Author": "lastminutebobyork", "ReviewID": "UR100530764", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate my 50th Birthday and had a fantastic time.

I just wanted to firstly state, that whenever I go away anywhere.....I do all my research on Trip Advisor. Looking at best hotels,places to eat etc etc. So after visiting Venice I decided I would write a detailed report of what I saw over the few days I was visiting. Hotel Canal Grande was exactly as I imagined it would be! Quaint and Beautiful. On Arrival we were greeted with a very warm welcome from the hotel staff. We simply had to give them our name and show our passports to them. Checking in took all of 5 minutes. Once checked in, we were given a map and a 'talk' on Venice. Where to go and places to see. But one thing I remember the reception staff saying is....'the best way to see Venice, is to get lost in Venice' and they were most defiantly right. So after checking in and receiving our map we were shown to our room by Lorenzo. Our room was not located in the hotel itself, which at first we were a little unsure of. But just a long from the main building itself was out room. It was almost like a mini apartment block. I think all in all it had 4 rooms in it. You access the building by pressing a buzzer and the hotel staff let you in (Very safe and secure!) The rooms are accessed by using a card which you swipe in front of your door. When we opened the door I was amazed...it was beautiful! The room was small but extremely amazing! The walls are not wallpapered....they are lined with gorgeous Italian fabric. Which match the bedding and curtains. All the lighting in the rooms are made with Murano glass and look truly wonderful. The tv in our room was hidden inside the mirror which I found amazing. The bathroom was a decent size with a lovely shower. Its hard to explain but the shower itself had so many different things, almost like a spa. The room also had temperature control dials which you could change to suit yourself. Our room had a view of the square, which we found very pleasant. No noise from the canal! The only noise (so to speak) we heard during our stay was the church bells which start at around 7am. But your in Venice, its to be expected! And after a while you get used to it and it almost acts as an alarm clock :-) Breakfast at the hotel was very nice. It starts at 7am and finishes at 10:30am. There is a wide choice of croissants, mini cakes, yoghurt,ham,cheese,fruit etc and also you can order eggs and bacon but at extra charge of 4Euro. There is also cereal,toast and a selection of fruit juices. There is no seating plan, you just turn up and choose where you would like to sit. Once you sit down the waitress (Who is lovely!) takes your order for tea,coffee,late, American coffee etc. There is a wide choice to choose from and you can drink as much as you like! There is no rush, which is what I liked. It is very relaxed! The hotel Canal Grande is in a very good location also! It is a few minutes walk from the train station and is very close to the Vaporetto stop. Although I thought I should state, if you are arriving at the hotel via the station etc there are two bridges to cross. One of them being very big and may prove a little difficult with a suitcase. We decided to use the water taxi's to and from the airport. Which is a little expensive but so worth the money! It worked out at 100 Euro for 4 people each way. But that took you direct from the Airport to the hotel. No need to worry about lugging suitcases around and squeezing onto a Vaporetto at rush hour time. It was a perfect way to start our holiday! It took 15minutes to reach our hotel from the airport and once we reached the main part of the canal we were invited by the taxi driver to stand at the front of the boat with him. It was extremely romantic and a wonderful way to get our first glimpse of Venice itself. I would highly recommend using the water taxi for airport transfers! To find the water Taxi service, you firstly need to book in. Which can be done when you go through arrivals. There is a Taxi booking desk there and that is where you pay. Once you have paid it is a 5 minute walk to the water taxi (That is also where the public transport is) You simply go to the dock number you have been allocated and wait for your boat. Do make sure you get the name of the hotel right! Because many of the hotels on the canal sound the same. So it would be Hotel Canal Grande! Im 99% sure there is one called Grande canal. The hotel also has a bar which is stocked with almost every type of spirit and drink you can think of. My partner and I like to drink beer so we drank the local brand which was called 'venitian Blonde'. It tasted a little like san miguel. We did try the 'red' version which to be honest we found was disgusting but everyone's taste is different! They also give you small bar snacks with your drinks. Which normally consist of crisps or peanuts, but they always went down well. I also noticed that if you had afternoon tea they gave you a selection on mini biscuits. Which I found very sweet of them to do. They are always so willing to help you and are always very pleasant. Eating out was always fun! Trying to find nice places and experience the real Venice. And we used two of the hotels recommendations. The first wasn't very nice and we were slightly disappointed, as we were told it was the best pizza in Venice. Turns out it wasn't! The second recommendation was spot on!!! One of the best meals we've had in a long time! My partner had steak and I had a pizza, both of which were extremely tasty and very reasonably priced. It took a little bit of map reading to find but we got there in the end and it was worth the walking. Although it was only a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel itself. Im not exactly sure what the name is but its something like 'Muro' im sure if you ask the staff they could help you find it The hotel is a 5 minute walk away from all the shops and restaurants etc but you do have to do a little walking to find exactly what you want. There are so many different places to choose from and so much to see! From a woman's point of view........make sure you pack flat shoes to wear! My feet were killing me on the first day and I wore flat boots! Heels if you can do heels are ok but not very practical. I wore them one night and that was it. There is also a casino in Venice! Apparently its the oldest Casino in the world. Just be warned that men DO have to wear Jackets! But jeans are acceptable (Which I found odd) It has a separate bar and restaurant and is roughly a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Although Im pretty sure they offer a free water taxi, as I saw a few of them driving up and down the canal. Don't take my word on that though! The Murano Glass factory trip which is free from the hotel is....ok but nothing to write home about. They offer a free water taxi to the factory but be warned.......if you don't buy anything it is up to you to get yourself back! Which we had to do! We ended up catching a Vaporetto back to piazza san marco which took an hour! and was 6.50Euro each. Watching the glass blowing itself was very interesting but the demonstration lasted about 10minutes the rest of the time is to look around the shop! Which you are NOT allowed to take photos in, and is very expensive! Shopping!!!!!! We loved the shopping in Venice and regretted not taking another suitcase! There is so much to choose from and personally we like to wear 'different' clothes and you can defiantly find 'different' clothing in Venice. The shoes etc are amazing! But can be very pricey. We were lucky as there seemed to be sales on everywhere! All in all our trip was truly wonderful! A beautiful place to visit! The hotel we stayed in well...i would stay there again in a heart beat. It was clean, decorated to high standards, staff were friendly and spoke very good English, and the location was perfect! Free Wi Fi For those of you who cant be without the internet....the hotel offer it for free! You just have to ask at the reception and they will give you a code. Which normally gives you 2 hours free access although you can ask for more like my partner did! They also have a computer which you can use and is also free!!!!

Most of the time it was too hot in our room, but that was easily solved by cracking a window. Breakfast selection was more than adequate.

It was a very pleasant surprise when we arrived in Venice and could see the Hotel Grande Canal from the train station steps. However between the train station and the hotel was a very high bridge with lots of steps...there was a second smaller bridge a bit later. The bridges made it a bit difficult to transport our luggage but we made it eventually. My wife picked this hotel based on Trip Advisor ratings and we weren't disappointed. We had a family suite overlooking the Grande Canal. The suite had (2) rooms with the master having a normal queen size bed and the Sitting room with a sleeper sofa queen. The sleeper sofa was acceptable but I would have preferred a normal queen. Both rooms were tastefully decorated with Murana glass sconces and flat screen TVs (although we didn't watch much TV). The only downside to having a Canal facing room is the diesel engined boat traffic that passed by at all hours. Suffering from jet lag, the noise from the boats was a bit annoying (not the hotel's fault though, the windows were insulated). The Continental breakfast was good and if you wished, you could special order eggs (for extra 4 euro). The WiFi connection was excellent, very, very fast. It is about a 30 minute walk to San Marcus Piazza (where the Doge palace is located). We spent three days in Venice and fell in love with the city...it really is a special place. The Hotel Canal Grande fits right in with the ambience of Venice, it is a cozy, intimate, and comfortable place to stay. We will be returning to Venice at some point in the future and will again make the Hotel Canal Grande our \"home away from home\". I should add the best pizza we had in all of Italy is a little restaurant about (5) minutes from the hotel...I forget the Italian name but in English it translates to \"Antique Well\". We ate at a lot of very average \"tourist\" restaurants during our holiday but the pizza at this place was truly outstanding...my favorite was the parma ham/artichoke pizza.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterloo, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGreat little luxury pad.\u201d", "Author": "YumScrubble", "ReviewID": "UR92411806", "Content": "I so love ripping a place to shreds that I am not going to enjoy writing this review at all... the Canal Grande was just perfect.

Lovely, varied breakfast; water-taxi stops right outside reception, etc. There was only one slight downside: the bathroom had trouble heating up. Yes, the rooms are small, as some reviewers have noted, and you have to walk there across a few bridges with your luggage if you want to save the water-taxi fare, but hey - this is Venice. It's tiny.

I booked this hotel purely based on the reviews I read & was not disappointed. Stayed here 2 nights/3 days Mid October & the weather was sunny & warm. The hotel is conveniently located near to the bus station, opposite the train station & a vaporetta stop. You have to go down a couple of alleyways & over a small bridge my boyfriend & I never had a map, but we found the hotel no trouble. A top tip is to look at the door numbers (the hotel is number 932). We were booked into the San Giorgio room, a ground floor room, which is not in the main building but a few doors along. The room was decorated to a very high standard & the wallpaper is made of fabric which was an interesting touch!

We were offered an upgrade with a view of the Grand Canal for 70 Euros, but didn't take it as the room we had was lovely.

From arrival late at night to our departure, the friendly and efficient staff accommodated every one of our needs and requests, reception staff exceeding our expectations for the most part. The location of the hotel is ideal with us being able to find our way back (pretty challenging in Venice) by simply following the signs to Ferrovia train station. My husband had requested a water taxi airport pick up for us via the hotel and this went very smoothly, albeit a little too fast for me to begin with. It was a surreal experience to arrive at the Grand canal in the dark with the palazzi all lit up from within. On arrival the night staff were fantastic and there was champagne, beautiful flowers and a lovely bowl of fruit in our room. We were lucky enough to have been given the room with the private terrace overlooking the square and canal. We spent a few lazy hours there in the sun and at night watching life on the canal. The only drawback was the size of the immaculately decorated room (although this was offset by the spacious terrace) and the lack of a bath, which we really missed so I've rated this as 4 out of 5. The public areas are perfectly adequate, although a larger deck outside to accommodate all those guests who want to breakfast on the canal would be a good addition.

Yes the rooms are small, but so is virtually all hotels in Venice. This is our third visit to Venice and this is best hotel we stayed in. The largest rooms are at the front and they also have a full sized bath tub and shower.. It is a good 40 minute brisk walk to San Marco and 20 minutes to Rialto. The water bus at the P Roma and the Station is 5 minutes walk. We used the water taxi from Marco Polo Airpot, arranged by Alessandro via email. Quick trip but expensive (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac110). Venice is expensive anyway especially in the \"toutis traps\". We did not go to Murano, as offered by Alessandro, as we have been twice before. Verdict, we will stay here on our next trip to Venice.

No restaurant for evening meals but plenty of nearby restaurants that can be recommended by the Staff I wrote this in the hotel and writing this on the free WiFi connection in our room (in the rain, can't blame the hotel for the thunder storms!!)

If you were lucky enough to have one of the three tables, you could also sit out there enjoying a very nice breakfast with more than enough to choose from. Getting back in the evenings after long and exhausting walks in Venice, the bar was a perfect place to sit and enjoy a beer or a glass of wine. We did not miss anything at this hotel, and the atmosphere was truly unique. If you fancy a pizza, try the pizzeria All\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Anfora just around the corner. We had the biggest pizzas we have ever eaten. They were huge and very good! If you arrive in Venice at Piazzale Roma, the easiest way to reach the hotel is probably to take the vaporetto line no. 1 for two stops and get off at Riva di Biasio. Then after a two minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk with no bridges to cross, you reach the hotel.

Not so much as a suitcase scuffmark on the wall! We had a very romantic four-poster bed and the mattress was incredibly firm and comfy - I slept 12 hours straight on the first night and awoke totally refreshed and ready to explore Venice. Broadband was free which was great for us as we were keen to keep checking our facebook accounts for new wedding photos as our guests added them! The mini bar was well stocked and we were pleasantly surprised by the price when we left. It wasn't dirt cheap but not at all bad compared to some rip-off hotels. The hotel is very well situated to explore and close to the train station. Be sure to ask the receptionist about the free taxi service from outside the hotel to Murano to see glassblowers at work. A few years ago I stayed at the Europa and Regina in Venice which is 5* and extremely expensive, and I can safely say that the Hotel Canal Grande is FAR superior. We paid about \u00c2\u00a3250 for two nights B&B at the Canal Grande which I thought was very reasonable considering the high standard of the hotel, the good location and the stunning rooms.

They should have a side business of consulting to the large luxury hotel chains! The other nice benefit is that they have modern and very clean rooms. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these two hotels to any of my friends or family. Yes, the price is high but that is Venice and not specific to this hotel.

We were skeptical at first, but we walked over and were given a tour of a comparable room, for the same price, on the second floor. While we were offered a room with a canal view for an additional cost, the comparable room was lovely (though average-sized), the bathroom large, and the staff was very friendly and offered to bring our bags from the Antiche Figure...so we chose that room and stayed. The breakfast room downstairs overlooks the grand canal, and offers the traditional selection of pastries, meats, and boiled eggs (you can order cooked eggs for a separate fee) with a very attentive waitstaff. The only complaint we had was that the wireless internet in the room was spotty, and eventually went down. The staff knew about it and assured me they were working to get it operational asap, but it took about a day and a half. There is a computer that guests can use in the lobby, and I was offered the use of the front desk computer as well. A tip: although the hotel is \"just down the canal\" from bridge leading to the train station (which is a fine area, BTW, and not as dodgy as some people make it out to be), if you are walking, it's about a 10+ minute walk back inland, and then back to the canal, to get there. If you are carrying your own luggage, just be aware there are lots of stairs! Because our flight out of Venice was early in the AM, the front desk suggested we hire someone to help transport the bags to a car, then to the airport, for about 60 euros.

The staff at the hotel were unbelievably welcoming upon our arrival, and helped us get settled in very quickly and efficiently. As it was our first trip to Venice, we were given a helpful description of how to get around (including advice on the right tickets to buy for the waterbuses, which stops to take and what lines to catch), we were given a map of town where the manager helpfully pointed out the main things to see in town, and we were offered a tour of neighbouring Murano if we wanted. As I mentioned, the hotel was exceptionally clean!!!! We had booked a \"special\" room with canal view (the hotel is on the grand canal of course) and we were offered a choice of room and helpfully shown to each by the porter. Our room overlooked the canal bank, was wonderfully decorated, was warm and had a fantastic ensuite with a great shower. Everything you'd expect in the room was there, minibar, tv, internet, safe etc etc. Be warned: the hotel doesn't offer catering other than basic cheese sandwiches through room service or the bar, so please don't expect a sit down lunch dinner.

There is a breakfast on offer, mainly warmed breads / buns, spreads, cold meats and boiled eggs. Coffee is available (on the house) 24/7. We met three different night teams on each of the nights we were there, but each member of staff was exceptionally polite, welcoming and helpful. Finally, in terms of location, do not be put off by how far the hotel seems from the main tourist attractions - it really isn't! And the fact that the hotel is on the edge of town is a good thing as you're away from the noise and chaos at night time, but during the day Per Rialto is about 10mins by waterbus and San Marco is about 25mins. In addition, if you need to get back to Marco Polo airport, this hotel is walking distance from the bus stop so it saves a lot of hassle!

Gianni was a gracious and informative host. The breakfast was ample and the service polite and thoughtful. I stayed in the Goldoni room. A special Venetian dream. Spotless and perfectly appointed. I highly recommend this hotel and will be back again.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff, Great Rooms, Great Service.\u201d", "Author": "fashionphotog", "ReviewID": "UR50326769", "Content": "We had originally booked our rooms at the Hotel Antiche Figure, however when we arrived at the hotel the manager told us that he had another hotel that they were attempting to fill with guests right down the street, it was another property that they owned that had recently opened up. .He told us that if we wanted to stay there instead of the Antiche Figure he would upgrade everyone's rooms. When we saw the property and the rooms, we just couldn't say no. The manager put us in four incredible rooms beautifully decorated in an antique Venetian style, yet with very modern facilities.. ie Wireless.. flat screen tv's hidden behind mirrors etc, plus the rooms had amazing views onto the canal, or the square... which was wonderfully quiet. This place is beautiful... I would highly reccomend staying here.. especially if you are American.. the service of the staff is completely up to par with American standards.. and on that matter they excel on sevice standards..", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Canal Grande", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d1547281-Reviews-Hotel_Canal_Grande-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$193 - $499*", "Address": "<div class=\"blBox\">", "HotelID": "1547281", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/57/27/b8/grand-canal-side.jpg"}}
