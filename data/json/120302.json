I wouldn't normally consider a Disney hotel, but the conference was there, so there wasn't much alternative. There are water buses running between the four resort hotels, The Boardwalk and Epcot. For proximity to the Boardwalk, the Swan hotel is much better, unfortunately it was already booked out by the time I was able to register for the conference. The greeting / check-in was a painfully protracted experience, compared e.g. with IHG / Hilton group check-in. American style service - friendly but soooo slow. Staff in reception are all dressed in kitsch naval outfits (the whole hotel is nautically themed), can\u00b4t see that it'd appeal to kids - possibly they are targeting retirees, but not really suitable for a conference hotel. The room was spacious, two huge comfortable beds, decent sized mini-fridge. Having the sinks in a carpeted area was odd as was the teeny-tiny little bathroom. Toiletries were pretty good quality - a decent sized bath to use them in would be even better. WiFi was very slow, I was often kicked off and even received an error message that there are too many people trying to log on. They perhaps need to upgrade their bandwidth? The hotel has a huge Disney shop just off the lobby which sells a wide variety of junk food but the nearest place to grab a quick sandwich is a 10 minute walk away on the other side of the lake :-/. The Boardwalk has a variety of restaurants, I used the Greek restaurant (edible) but they took about 20 minutes to seat us even *with a reservation time*, the Pizza Window was pretty good, the bakery does good cakes, but $12+ for a small sandwich and a diet coke is a rip off. The Boardwalk is hellishly expensive for what you get, and with the exception of a gas station, there is absolutely nothing else close to the resort, so without a car you'll have to pay Disney prices.

The service here is much better than the service we received at other Disney properties (such as Riverside, Port Orleans, or All-Star Resorts). I had requested 1st floor rooms and close to transportation since my father is blind, but they did mess that up. They had my parents on the 1st floor and us on the 3rd floor. I had requested the rooms be by each other so that we could assist my parents if needed. I had checked on our room requests a couple of times before arriving, so it was a little frustrating that it wasn't accurate, but they fixed it right away. We got ajoining rooms on the 1st floor. The rooms were nice and spacious, but certainly not fancy or elaborate. We had a family of 5 in one room and my parents in the other room. The beds were really comfortable and my 5 year old daughter loved sleeping on the day bed. We didn't have any problems with noise or anything. I liked this resort because we were really close to both the bus and the boat transportation, not to mention the pool and the restaurants. We were in rooms 1085 and 1087. The property itself was nice enough; they did add tons of flowers during the week we were there and it brightened up everything so much more! I think they were getting ready for spring :) I think the hotel was very high priced, so that would be my only complaint...not totally sure it was worth twice as much as the cost of Riverside resort or another value resort. There was some construction on the resort outside, but I didn't hear any noise and had no problems getting around. The had a very nice gift shop and good restaurants and this resort. The Captain's Grill dinner was fabulous. We had ribeyes and cheese and bacon mashed potatoes. Everyone loved it! Everyone also loved their meal at the Yachtsmen Steakhouse. I liked the Captain's Grill better, however, and the prices were cheaper. The menus at the restaurants are not extensive, so look in advance to make sure there is something you like. We also ate at Cape May's Seafood Buffet; that was delicious as well! Even the food at the Hurrican Hanna's pool restuarant was good. I like the location of this resort! You can take a boat just right outside your room to MGM studios or Epcot. It was so easy. It does take a little extra time, but is worth it if your feet are tired. We always took to boat to MGM because the bus doesn't go there or to Epcot. Epcot is definitely within walking distance. We ate there several nights and easily walked there each night. My parents took the boat and we met them there. We could even see the Epcot fireworks from the patio off of our room! I think we will stay there again since the location is so convenient. Check-in and check-out was easy and simple. I highly recommend making all dinner or breakfast reservations in advance or you might be out of luck at the resort! One day the breakfast wait for a sit down meal was almost 1 hour. We had our dinner reservations way in advance, but weren't sure about breakfast. We were easily able to make breakfast reservations while we were there that week. We did also do the Cape May Character breakfast. The food was good and my daughter loved all the Disney Characters that came through. The pool was awesome at this resort for my 5 year old! She could go anywhere in the sand bottom pool and could touch the bottom. One day she skipped the theme parks all together to just stay back with me and play in the pool while the older kids went on the rides at the theme parks. The older kids did not really use one of the other deeper pools very much, so I don't know how they liked them. They thought the waterslide was fun. The do give out buckets and shovels with the kids meal at hurricane hannas, so your young child will have something to use in the sand. Overall, great trip. The Disney crowd at this time of the year was HUGE though. It was somewhat tiring to deal with the crowds for 8 days, but I still think it was worth it.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cYacht Club March 2012\u201d", "Author": "momoftwinsOntario", "ReviewID": "UR126327022", "Content": "The Disney Yacht Club is a beautiful resort.

It was a five minute walk to the back entrance of Epcot which was great because there was never a line to enter the park. Hollywood Studios was about a 15 minute boat ride.

The pools have sandy beaches, short lazy rivers, and a waterslide. You will need to get a bracelet from the pool attendants in order to access the pools. The only drawback to these pools is that they tend to close fairly early, not surprising due to lifeguard staff needed. The properties do have a few other standard pools which are open later and are rarely crowded (and much quieter!). This upscale resort property continues its New England yacht club theme at every opportunity, we truly felt like were we at a lakeside turn or the century hotel.

They would come in and wisk them away immediatley. Check in went very smooth, especially considering over 300 people were checking in at once!!!! The room was a bit small, but the decor was cute in its nautical theme. The beds were VERY comfortable. I would say it may actually have been more comfortable than my own bed. Pillows, mattress, and comforter are avaliable for sale if you like them that much!!!However, getting luggage was an issue!!! I was aware that there was 300 people checking in at once....I waited over an hour for my luggage and almost missed the bus with my group for Disney World. After being told several times it was on its way, I headed down stairs and got it myself. Checking out for others was quick and painless. I however, received someone elses room charges on my room. After about 30 min. and three employees later someone figured out how to get the charges off my room. I was only frustrated for the 30 min. I was dealing with the front desk, after all your in Disney World!!! Everything is magical and happy there. The other little perk!!!! They have an airport kiosk right at the hotel.

The room was a bit small, but comfortable. We were asked what time we would like our room made up. This was honored the first day, but not the second. I did call the concierge and it was corrected promptly. The room also had a coffee maker, but somewhat antiquated. Could have really used a Keurig!!! We used up the only two caffeinated coffee packets and housekeeping replaced them with decaff!! If there is one thing you need in Disney, it's caffeine. Once again I had to call and the coffee packets were brought up promptly. The Concierge Level was outstanding and the level of service was exceptional. I was assisted with boarding passes as well. The food choices were terrific and those homemade potato chips with red pepper dip were delicious!!!! The servers ware always friendly and attentive - whatever your need - they were on it. I would highly recommend this hotel. We have stayed in Disney multiple times but had never stayed at an Epcot Resort - this one was wonderful. Our most recent Disney vacation was several years ago at the Wilderness Lodge and we were all very disappointed with the level of service. We also had a marvelous meal at the Yachtsman Steakhouse with exceptional service and meal quality. We all enjoyed our steaks and they were cooked to perfection. It was also nice to see that a cast member was checking hotel cards for guests attempting to use the pool facilities at the Yacht Club. This was one of my complaints at the Wilderness. Many people would stay at a \"Value Resort\" then get dropped off at the Wilderness and use the pool. Many times, I would not be able to find a beach chair - very frustrating to those who pay top dollar to stay close to the park.

Earl and I needed a break after a difficult Dec - Jan during which time Earl's father passed away after weeks of intense illness. We opted for Disney World because of the ability to relax or be active - do nothing or walk around and ride 'til you drop. The Yacht Club was a great choice - a little more on the adult side theme wise, luxurious, and walking distance to 2 theme parks. I had stayed in Yacht Club rooms already and the Club level rooms were identical to the rooms that I had stayed in on former visits. No surprises there. The rooms are spacious with 2 queen size beds, a sofa, desk, double sink and separate toilet / tub.The rooms are bright with lots of white furniture and a large flat screen TV. Free wifi internet works easily and is quite fast. The air conditioning is excellent and quiet. Maid service in club level can be requested for a specific time that is convenient for you. The rooms are, of course, immaculately clean. There is a lounge available at club level that offers a decent continental breakfast. Typically you have all the usual beverages (coffee, tea juices, milk) some pastries, hard boiled eggs, homemade oatmeal and fresh fruit. This is available from 7-10:30 am. Then snacks are available from 12-4 pm. Hors d'oeuvres are available from 5-7 pm and desserts are from 8-10 pm. From 5 - 7 you also have some beer wine and drinks available. From 8-10 there are some liqueurs available. Offerings are substantial, fresh and plentiful. Most hors d'oeuvres include a seafood item such as lobster, scallops or shrimp. Very delicious!! This is perhaps my very favourite hotel in all of WDW for convenience. If you go out the front it is a very short walk to the single bus stop which is covered and has some seating. This is the first stop for buses going from the yacht and beach club to any theme park except Epcot or the studios. Alternatively, if you go out the back door you are directly in line for the dock for the boats to Epcot and Studios. Very quick and easy. Note: The boat dock is often a quiet place to watch the higher fireworks from Illuminations (if you want to watch from outside). Stormalong bay is right next door and is a great pool with a lovely setting and a water slide. The main entrance seems to be closer to the Beach Club entrance. There may be another way in for Yacht \\club guests, but we didn't look for one. It is only a short walk. You have to have a room key to enter because this pool is reserved for Y & B resort guests only. This is a great place to stay if relaxing is the main point of your visit. The dining options surrounding the yc are bountiful. There are all the restaurants on the Boardwalk, at the Yacht and Beach Club and at the swan and Dolphin hotels. These restaurants alone are amazing ranging from great steakhouses, to Todd Englishes Blue, Fresh, to the fabulous Beaches and Cream soda shop and an all you can eat buffet at Cap May Cafe . Then, inside Epcot you have all the World Showcase restaurants awaiting. Dining options just don`t get much better than this Bottom line, this is a great option for business, couples, or solo travellers. Families may find the Beach Club next door to be a little more relaxed, have easier access to the fabulous pool, shorter walk to Epcot and just overall have a more family friendly atmosphere. we will definitely be back.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cBest All-Around Hotel on Disney Property for Adults\u201d", "Author": "Liz C", "ReviewID": "UR125294443", "Content": "I have stayed at a number of Disney properties over the years with over 30+ visits during my lifetime. After staying at others, I now stay exclusively at the Yacht Club. The three main draws for me are its location, pool facilities and decor. The Yacht Club, Beach Club and Boardwalk all have access to the back of Epcot (the countries, right between France and England) through a walkway which is about a 1/4-1/2 mile long. As an adult traveler, it is nice to be able to shower up after the pool and simply stroll to dinner and drinks at one of the Epcot countries then stroll back after the Illuminations fireworks - no running to fight the crowd out to catch a bus. The Beach Club and Boardwalk are slightly closer to Epcot, but the Yacht Club makes up for the extra steps in other ways. These three hotels also share a boat that takes you to Hollywood Studios. The Yacht and Beach club share a pool which is much bigger and sprawled out than all of the other pools I have seen on Disney property. On a hot day in the afternoon, it can be a challenge to find a lounge chair, or at least one in a spot of your liking. In that case, just find a chair to throw your clothes and hop in the water! Part of the pool (near Hurricane Hannah's grill) is deeper with a current and makes for nice floating and relaxed swimming. Since the water is deep, this area is quieter because there are less kids! The pool bar has Hurricane Reef Lager on tap, which I had never had before Disney, but discovered I love! The Beach Club is very comparable to the Yacht Club in terms of rooms (same size and layout) and facilities (they share the pool, fitness center, restaurants etc). The Yacht Club lobby is a little more upscale and quiet; the beach club's is usually noisier and more hectic. The Beach Club may be better if traveling with younger children as it seems less formal. The Beach Club also has quick serve food - egg sandwiches and pastries for breakfast, sandwiches and gelato for lunch/snack - right in their gift shop, whereas the Yacht Club doesn't. We usually walk all the way there for breakfast or across the lake to the Boardwalk Bakery. That is one downside to the YC. The rooms are nice and simple with clean white linens (other hotels have cheesy looking colorful bedspreads). A few times we have been put in rooms that were FAR FAR away from the lobby area. There are some rooms that overlook a swamp by the Swan/Dolphin hotels. The times when this happened to us, I called back from the room phone and asked to be switched to a different room and was usually accommodated (one time the new room was over the bus stop which wasn't ideal either, but better than a swamp!). Generally though, if you're not happy with your room and express that, Disney will work to make it better. If the cast member helping you is not actually helping (which has happened), just ask to speak to a manager- they always go above and beyond to fix anything you're not satisfied with.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "Shirtisred", "ReviewID": "UR125236618", "Content": "Very nice resort.

We originally had booked a 5 day stay. We started out at the Grand Floridian. Maybe that is what is tainting my review somewhat. We stayed in a standard room on the concierge level. Our room was not what we requested. I had made this reservation in August and this was a February stay so it was 6 months in advance. We requested two beds close to the lounge. We did get a room close to the lounge BUT we were given one QUEEN bed with a day bed and a sleeper chair. The room was clean and the view was fine (we could actually see the Magic Kingdom fireworks from the room) but a queen size bed is not big enough. I am sure we were given this room as there were just two of us but we always request two beds. If they are going to have a \"one bed room\" then it should be a King size bed - just saying. We asked about switching rooms but that is a big hassle and if you have the hotel help you get ready for a big tip.... They didn't have another room ready and when it was ready it was far away down a long hall so we did not change rooms that evening. The concierge offerings were basic - again at the Grand Floridian they were much more extensive. I think all of the lounges should have the same \"amount\" of choices - different choices as they are from the resorts restaurant but the same amount of food - not just a couple of little choices as we found here at the Yacht Club. The next morning we decided to go back to the Grand Floridian and requested a two bed room and moved. There wasn't anything wrong with it but the club lounge is very small. When they put the food out get ready for a line and it gets quite crowded. They also close the doors between offerings so you can't even get any water at off hours. At the Grand Floridian you can get beverages all day. It is an easy walk to the country area of Epcot or you can take a boat or a boat ride to Hollywood studios. I found the boat ride to Hollywood studios long as it makes a stop at the Swan/Dolphin before going. I would make sure you allow 45 minutes to an hour to get to the studios minimum especially if you have a restaurant reservation. We used the quiet pool but not the large theme pool. The staff were by far the most friendly in all 3 of the resorts we stayed at Disney. They went out of their way to help you and were always saying hi and willing to do anything you need.

MK or Animal Kingdom you have to do the buses and personally I found them so slow that we alternated between the buses and taxis. Pool is awesome. Doing a little construction on it while we were there but my kids loved it. Also loved the whole boardwalk that was right there. People were jogging, you can rent bikes, and there are restaurants and shops to check out.... We could have spent a couple of days just hanging out around there. We paid for the lagoon view room which was a food size, but we were a little disappointed in the construction going on outside our window. They are refurbishing the outside of the hotel so if you are going to the hotel soon ask about that. It was a lovely view out to the water and of the boardwalk but not so much with cranes in the way. Also it was noisy starting at about 8am. Again, this doesn't seem like a big project that they are doing, just some painting and stuff, it was just kind of a bummer. It was nice to see the Epcot fireworks from the balcony, but I'm not sure I would pay for that view again because you are never in the room anyway. We had dinner at the Animal Kingdom Lodge and that hotel was really impressive in a grand, Disney kind of way. Very different from the lobby of the Yacht Club. But the location of the yacht club was just perfect for our family. I would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dade City, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced\u201d", "Author": "DH0lland", "ReviewID": "UR124528684", "Content": "I stayed here for a relative's birthday celebration.

We wanted a place that was convenient for getting to the parks on a scooter, so as to minimize the loading and unloading of the scooter from the park buses. Here is how to get around on a scooter without a bus: To Epcot - Scoot over to World Showcase Entrance. Very quick and convenient. To Hollywood Studios - Scoot to the boat loading dock. Ride scooter onto the boat. Or, scoot down the walking path to Hollywood Studios, but make sure your battery is charged! To Magic Kingdom - Scoot through Epcot to Monorail, ride Monorail to Magic Kingdom. Park Hopper needed for this route. Takes a little while, but easier than bus. To Animal Kingdom - Sorry, you need to load scooter onto a bus. Three out of four is not bad! The Yacht Club is a resort for travelers who enjoy comfort and luxury, and want to linger at mealtimes. The rooms are spacious enough for a family of four or five. The rooms are also comfortable and bright. The bathroom counter has plenty of space for toiletries. There is a spacious closet, dresser and drawers for clothes. The two queen beds are comfortable, and the couch is also a day bed, large enough for a 10 year old child. There are two sit-down restaurants here, and the Beaches & Cream soda pop shop near the pool. This is not a great set-up for families that want to eat and run to the parks. If you walk through the corridor to the connecting Beach Club resort, you will find a small counter service restaurant inside of the gift shop. Again, this is not very convenient for families who want a quick and convenient meal. The pool area is beautiful. It is a warm, saltwater pool. There is a sand bottom section for little kids, and a lazy river for stronger swimmers. However, beware of the slide which empties into a 5 foot deep section of the pool. Not for little ones, or weak swimmers. Also, it is easy to \"lose\" your kids at this pool. The pool is large and winding, and the deck areas can't always follow the path of the pool. I had to run over bridges, and up and down stairs to keep up with the movement of my kids. It is also easy for kids to end up in deeper waters. Be vigilant. Overall, this is a great resort for scooter-bound travelers, and families with kids over 7.

First, as others have said, location is great, with a short boat ride or walk to Epcot and also a boat to the Hollywood Studios. The decor is very subtle Disney, in fact nothing was in your face Disney at all. It's a very pretty, elegant hotel. We didn't use the pool area but it looked like it would be a lot of fun. The rooms were very nicely decorated in a nautical style. We had requested one with a day bed and it was available. It was not a huge room, but big enough for 4 people. It did have a small refrigerator and a small table, plus a balcony. The bathroom was small, double sinks were outside the tiny area where the commode and bathtub were at. It was a stretch to shut the door if anyone was in that area. We had a slow drain in the tub and a hairdryer that wasn't working properly but maintenance came very quickly after I had called and fixed the drain. A different hairdryer was delivered too. It was a bit of a hike from the lobby to our room. The hallways are quite long. The beds were very comfortable, good mattresses. When we arrived we used the valet parking. I found out later that it is free if you have a handicap placcard. We ate at the Yacht Club Steak House one evening, and although pricey, it was a very good meal. I also ordered room service one evening, which was good but really expensive. We took the boats to Epcot and the Hollywood Studios. We drove to the Animal Kingdom (free parking if you are staying in a Disney resort) and took the bus to the Magic Kingdom. I was able to get a pretty good rate by buying a Season pass and reserving at the Passholder's discount. Close by are the Beach Club, The Boardwalk and the Swan and Dolphin. Which means that you have quite a few choices for meals. We had a nice view of the fireworks from our balcony.

We have stayed at other Disney resorts, but the Yacht Club is the creme-de-la-creme. It's nautical and refined. It's always adorned with flowers and flower arrangements. As you walk in, the happy \"skipper\" greets you. This gentleman is a familiar face that we look forward to seeing year after year. The rooms are decorated with a nautical theme and are always perfect. If you stay on the fifth floor (concierge), you'll really experience Disney's first class attention to detail. We talked with Mike an awful lot and he really made sure we had the most important park information. If we needed a snack or a drink, he retrieved something no matter what time it was. The other staff was helpful too. The Yacht Club has THE BEST POOLS. You can easily spends days here instead of the park. Use the slide, the lazy river, or the sand filled swimming pools. The lifeguards are awesome and the staff engages children with pool games and prizes from opening to closing. When you're hungry, dine at the nearby Beaches and Cream for a consistently great burger. There are marshmallow roasts at a campfire and movies in the evening. We love the fact that the Yacht Club is a short walk to the United Kingdom part of EPCOT (about 5 - 10 minutes) and a 10 minute boat trip (with stops) to Hollywood Studios. This is a big plus for dining plans since EPCOT especially, has many great eating spots. That said, the best spot in Disney for a steak is located right in the Yacht Club...the Yachtsman Steak House! The best steak in or out of the park. Did I mention that the Boardwalk is across from the Yacht Club? Try Kouzinna's for Greek food and then enjoy the boardwalk attractions afterwards (rent bikes, arcades, clowns...) You can easily enjoy two days of family fun just at the resort itself. For example, we've rented mini-speed boats and small boats to explore the waterways to EPCOT and Hollywood Studios. We've played outdoor ping-pong and layed on the beach too. It's a break from the frenzy typically encountered while trying \"to do\" all the attractions at the parks. (My point is that you can relax and still have fun right at your resort.) If you want to go to other resorts like Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, or Downtown Disney there's bus transportation right out front.

Both lobby and grounds are charming. We had a wonderful room (room 2064 or 2164), it was a corner room that was quiet, off by itself and only a few minutes walk to the lobby and transportation areas. The room was very clean and I am picky about a clean room. We were there five nights and each day when we returned to our room it was well cleaned again. Since it was a corner room it had three large window which were wonderful for letting the Florida sun in. The staff was friendly (especially the front desk). When my son called for a wake-up call and asked for someone other than Stitch the front desk clerk told him that it would probably be Stitch because they can't keep him in bed. I thought that was a fun way for them to let my son know that only Stitch is available. The hotel is close to Hollywood Studios and EPCOT with ferry service to both parks. The pool is wonderful (one of the best on Disney property) but we would have used it more if we were there in the summer. The room was spacious with two queen beds. There is a double sink (helpful) and a separate SMALL bathroom. I would like to have seen a curtain to be able to pull across the separation from the sleeping area to the double sinks for some privacy getting dressed (traveling with a 16 year old daughter and 11 year old son, husband and myself). This is not unique to the Yacht Club though. It seems to be the norm for most hotels but for a luxury hotel it would be an easy thing to fix. Our only complaint was the bus service.

This resort is an EXCELLENT place to stay while enjoying the Disney Experience. The customer service at this hotel was by far the best I have ever experienced (including trips to other destinations around the world). The hotel is classy, yet inviting to children. The staff is on their toes without an air of snooty-ness. We chose to stay on the 5th floor \"club level\" for an extra dose of customer care and it was well worth the extra money. I am glad we did the club level for the simple fact that babies have lots of needs and I leaned heavily on the personal concierge for help. Jean was of particular help in the club room. Robin was fabulous with helping us make reservations. The housekeeping staff was fabulous. I think they may have cleaned our room twice a day. If that wasn't the case, then they definitely provided us with extra towels and chocolates. You don't have to stay at the Club Level to get this kind of service. My parents booked with the regular rooms and they got the same type of customer service and with a slightly better room! We just wanted to have help at our finger tips because of the baby. The entire resort was dressed tastefully and beautifully for the holidays. The restaurants were great. The pools and hot-tubs were wonderful. Every inch of the hotel was clean, clean, clean.

No, this review is for people who got booked here for either a convention/conference, and stay long hours being educated and want a relaxing experience between times. Maybe even a nice nap. The good: check in was orderly and the front desk staff friendly and efficient. We even got a complimentary upgrade but given the decibel level of our next door neighbors, not sure we wouldn't have enjoyed less garden view and more parking lot. The bad: after 10 hours in a conference room, honestly, is it too much to expect to enjoy a little evening channel surfing with some decent choices? There are almost 60 channels but I think about 54 of them are Disney related. Where's the HBO, TNT, TBS, movie channel, ANYTHING...even if you pay extra....relaxation is NOT listening to a promo for vacation stays, infomercials on what not to miss at Disney etc. We couldn't even rent a movie. The lack of insulation: we either had the world's flimsiest walls or the world's noisiest family next door with what sounded like an army of small children...after a day of hassling air travel my husband and I were anxious to unwind and relax. Obviously no tv of note but what we did have was a virtual family in our room...we heard it all: the sugar highs at 3 pm, the 6 pm Mickey meltdown and then the fight to go to bed and finally the 2 am tummy aches. We are not unsympathetic to the poor parents next door...we have done our time in the trenches but really, Disney, this is one show we would have liked to have missed. Ice machine: one per floor. Broken on Wednesday when we checked in. Still broken on check out. The ugly: bathroom had real issues. Our room had two sinks outside and a toilet and bath jammed into an extremely small space. There are marble like floors in the bath area which are an odd choice because all around the toilet was dried urine and areas when it wasn't dried, it had stained the floor around the toilet yellow which didn't come up with scrubbing (I tried).

I had done my homework and I liked the idea of a five minute stroll to Epcot's side entrance and a short boat ride to Hollywood Studios. Also the Yacht Club was a bit less \"family\" orientated, meaning a bit more sedate than the Beach Club Resort next door. However, the reservation specialist, who by the way was terrific, could not get me into the Yacht Club but could do it for the Beach Club. No big deal, we took the Beach Club. When it came time to check in, however, the king bedroom was not available and check in wanted to give me and my wife a two queen bedroom. Hmmmm, not for our anniversary. I held my ground and asked for the front desk manager, asking that if he could not meet our request for the king room at the Beach Club, perhaps he could check with one of the other deluxe rated properties for a king for us. It was important to us and I suggested he \"make the magic happen!\" After about a ten minute wait, he came through with a king room in the....wait for it... Yacht Club Resort, which is what we wanted originally. So, yes, I think the magic is still working at WDW. Our room was nicely appointed. The property was large but very beautifully kept and a pleasure to base our vacation from. We liked the towel animals that one associates with cruises. The two towel swans on our bed also forming a heart (see pic) added a nice romantic touch to coming back to the room at 2:30 am (Magic Disney hours had the Magic Kingdom open until 3:00am that Saturday night... we had a blast!).

We had another relaxing time at Disney World and at the resort, but looking through the lens of a returning visitor, we could more easily see areas for improvement compared to our prior stay. I'll note that we stayed on the Club Level floor, which tends to provide a better level of service than the rest of the hotel, so take this into consideration when comparing to other reviews of service at this property. Warning! This is an especially long review! Our check-in experience was easy. When we arrived at the resort on a Saturday evening we were immediately greeted at the door and escorted to the desk. We had checked in online a few days before our arrival, so everything was ready to go and we got our packet with our keys within a few minutes. The interior of our room was the same as the one on our last stay: a small water closet, dual sinks, two queen beds and a flatscreen TV. It included bathrobes, an expresso/coffee maker, and a simple desk and lounge chair. We were a little surprised that, just like our older room, the bathroom door didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really clear the toilet seat, but always bumped into it when opening. It just seems like something someone would test or fix (perhaps the toilet was refurbished after the bathroom was built?), and was a little off-Disney-style to see this flaw persist in more than one room. During our stay in 2009 we had had a private balcony, so this time around we were a little disappointed to get a balcony shared with 3 other rooms. We were unable to really keep our curtains open as much because our neighboring room had children, and they would go out on the patio and stare into our windows. Unfortunately this was a busy time at the hotel--there was a convention running almost every day we were there--so they were unable to move us. Speaking of the conventions, I will say this affected our stay in a few ways. First is the overall friendliness/politeness of other guests. When we stayed in 2009, there were no conventions happening, so most of the guests were vacationers. This made them happy and courteous, and us in return. This time, many of the guests were business reps who seemed less than enthusiastic to be there. We saw many of them shoving ahead in the breakfast lines, cutting people off at the elevators, yelling into cell phones to colleagues at the gym, lobby and patio areas, and so forth. Although it may not be fair to include guest behavior in a review of a property, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on vacation from work, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sort of the last thing you want to be around :) The upside of it, though, was that the hotel staff was on their best behavior. Other ways that the convention affected us: We had a rental car, and it was often difficult to finding parking (the Yacht Club has a very small lot). Thankfully the property noticed this and within a few days restricted any on-site parking to hotel guests only. It also seemed to affect our wifi access, it was a lot slower during peak convention hours. Housekeeping, for us at least, was prompt, friendly and thorough. They always seemed to get to our room in quick order, even if we were only out for an hour or two. They even left us towel animals despite knowing that we had no kids with us. The concierge and Regatta Club staff were also helpful and friendly. They helped me make a lot of reservations (and changes to those reservations) before and during our stay. The lounge area of the Regatta Club, with snacks and wine/beverages, was once again welcome. We were happy to see that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d changed many of their offerings, including canned sodas and cheese plates (which were great to take to-go), but keeping healthy staples like trail mix and oatmeal. It seemed like the hours of operation were improved, because they kept the lounge open all evening so guests could get coffee/snacks even at 3AM. The service was prompt--the moment your plate was empty, the staff would come by and clean it up. The staff were also gracious in allowing me to set up my watercolor paints in the lounge, helping me dispose of my wash waters in a safe manner. A special shout-out goes to a staff member named Chip, who was very conversational about my painting, even though he probably had a million other things to do. Aside from our room and floor level experiences, I will also provide a quick review of the other areas we utilized at the property: The Stormalong Bay Pool (shared with the Beach Club): Once again, this was awesome. During this trip we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t purchase water park tickets because of it (something we had learned last time). They still restrict pool entry to Yacht/Beach Club guests and I hope they never open it up. The Gym: I used the gym during both our prior and recent stays, and while they upgraded a couple of the machines, I found it still a little tattered and worn. This area could use some heavy refurbishment. It easily feels crowded, the staff seem unhappy (many had open conversations about having long hours), and the weight machines still seem old. Ale and Compass Lounge: I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get breakfast here. Service staff were nice, but we were disappointed with the scant selection available when using a quick service meal credit. Elevators: These reallllllly need some refurbishment. They seem to have gotten worse since our last stay. They are slow, many of the floor indicators are broken, and there was an evening when all four were broken down at the same time. Also, we noticed a few groups of people trying to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hitch a ride\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd up to the Club floor by waiting for guests with a Club Level key card, so the staff should perhaps check key cards upon exit from the elevators. Air Conditioning: In general, the building is freezing! There should be a bit better temp control. Distance to Epcot: One of the best pros of this resort, I love that we could hoof it to Epcot and the Food and Wine Festival in twenty minutes. I also took a few morning jogs to Hollywood Studios (also walkable, albeit a lot further). All in all, I recommend this hotel for more adult-oriented groups of people (Beach Club remains the best option if you have children, because the Yacht Club does not really cater to them) and those who can be a bit more independent with things. I hope that they address or refurbish some areas of the resort, and think we may hold off on revisiting it until some things get fixed.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time.

We stayed club level at the Yacht Club. Let me first say that they deffinatly made us feel special when we checked in. Someone was waiting on us and took us straight to the 5th floor to check in. The supplied drinks and food mostly all day long was a great advantage having small children that love to snack. The resort itself was nice. Everyone was friendly and our girls asked us why everyone calls them princess. The pools was huge and my girls loved the sandy bottom. I will say one thing ;bad about this pool though. Its design makes it so you have a very hard time watching your kids if they want to explore everything. Not because it is so big, just because you have to get out of the pool to get to other parts of the pool. They waterslide is actually a little walk from the pool and the entrance to it is on the other side of a walkway out of your vision. So if your kids want to run to the entrance to the slide they will be gone for a while and they cross a public path that everyone uses from other resorts. Many a time I seen parents wondering what was taking the kids so long and having to jump up and run around a building to try and find their kids. Other than that it was very nice with very attentive life gaurds that kept everything uder control. There is another pool on the end of the resort that is very quiet and you can do laundry while you swim or watch your kids. Our room was huge. We actually thought hey made a mistake. If you are here for a long trip staying club level if you want to spend extra is the way to go. The four of us each had a bed to ourselves which was oh so nice for Mom and I. The staff on your private floor is wonderful. Many a time we walked up to get some drinks and they would send us back with full water, beers, pops or whatever you wanted, even if they were not open or getting stuff ready for the next meals. The location was great if you are going to be seeing all the parks. You can walk to Epcot from here and it only takes you maybe 10 min. at the most. The boardwalk only takes you about a 5 or 6 minute walk. If I was just going to visit Magic Kingdom I would not recommend this resort. Housekeeping was great. They even made little animal characters with our towels for the kids. They did a great job and make sure you tip them. I see complaints about housekeeping but they always went overboard for us.

The first day I had to call a 4pm to see if they would clean our room and on the second (and last) day the came at 9a when we weren't checking out until 11. When they finally came to clean our room they basically gave us clean towels and made some of the beds and dumped a bunch of our stuff on the beds... It wasn't worth it at all. The checkin was not good. The castmember checking me in was unfriendly and seemed bothered by my being there... The rest of the castmember at the Yacht Club were stiff and not friendly at all. We found the staff at the Beach Club was much friendlier. And the staff at the Polynesian was absolutely delightful! Checking out should have been simple but it was a total disaster. And again the staff was rude and unsympathetic. If you have a choice pick the Beach Club over the Yacht Club. And if you are looking for a great Disney experience and convenience getting to the parks choose the Polynesian!

We would especially recommend Beaches & Cream for ice cream treats, both the Captain's Grille and Cape May Cafe for breakfast, Hurricane Hannah's for a pool-side lunch, and Cape May for dinner. My complaint, and for me it is a serious one, is the attitude of much of the staff (aka cast-members) at the Yacht. Their attitude, especially at the front desk -especially the front desk manager, was one of \"if a guest has a problem the guest needs to fix it\". We had a serious billing problem upon checking-out - someone else had been linked by their system to our account and according to Stephen, the Front Desk Manager, it was up to us to rectify the problem (we had already spoken to two other Front Desk personnel and their attitude also was one of helplessness). I was not expecting this off-hand attitude - what I was expecting was an apology and to have my problem quickly remedied. It was only after I inquired as to both his name and job title that Stephen perked up and asked what could he do for us. Too little and too late. We also received incorrect information from the Concierge and Gift Shop staff as well - both times the mistakes were fixed by members of the College Program - and enthusiastically as well! Perhaps the senior staff have forgotten their Disney customer service training and need a refresher!

It's a beautiful hotel with a great location, but lacks some of the amenities that families might find helpful during their stay. The sand-bottom pool, and the other pools offered are great. The water slide was a lot of fun for my 8 year old. We did only spend a short half-day there though, due to a combination of not having a \"pool day\" on our schedule, and the rains that moved in. The kids did spend an evening there with their Nana, and enjoyed playing in the sand with other kids that were there. The location is great - walking distance to Epcot (don't take the boat unless you have to - much easier AND quicker to just walk), and a simple boat ride to Hollywood Studios. Walking to Hollywood Studios is an option, but it's much further than Epcot, so we didn't do that (well, we almost did when waiting for the boat ride home was taking forever, but we ended up on the boat). It's also close to the \"Boardwalk\" and \"Beach Club\" resorts (shares the pools with the Beach Club), which means that there's plenty of restuarants/shops within a short walk of the hotel. Unfortunately, those \"short walks\" are necessary, as there is not as much offered within the hotel itself. For example, no place to get a quick-serve meal unless you walk to the Beach Club. There's a sit-down (full service) restaurant, and a spot to get coffee and a bagel (IE: snacks), but no quick serve option. Being on the dining plan, sometimes you need a quick serve vs a sit-down, and sometimes you don't want to spend a long time on breakfast before heading to the park - it would be nice if that option was more convenient. Also, the arcade, gym, etc are all part of beach club - it's not a long walk, obviously, but it's just not as convenient as it would be were they part of the actual resort. The rooms were fine - a bit cramped for 5 people, but we expected that going in. They were comfortable and clean and quiet. It would have been nice if there was someplace to get changed or something and be able to shut a door - the bathroom itself was very tiny and cramped (shower was fine - just not much room to move around outside of the shower), and the sink area doesn't have a door, but again, we knew that going in. Beautiful resort - great time in Disney. But next time, if we stayed in the same area, we'd probably go for the Beach Club or the Boardwalk.

But, some caveats\u201d", "Author": "mrvinotinto", "ReviewID": "UR119292473", "Content": "We really loved the Yacht Club. Loved the 10-minute walk to Epcot's International Gateway. Loved the understated elegance of the lobby and grounds. Loved that it did not scream Disney, while still allowing us to be part of the Disney experience. We particularly loved all the great restaurants nearby in Epcot and at the Boardwalk. We were fortunate to have a daybed in our room (not all rooms have one) and this worked really well, so that my two kids did not have to share a bed. Epcot is by far our favorite park, and MK is my husband's least favorite so this worked out well. We spent 2 days at Epcot, one day at DHS, and one day at AK, so we were able to take advantage of the close proximity to Epcot and DHS. Now, some caveats that I mention just to make sure YC is a good choice for you: Caveat #1: Do not choose hotel because of the pool --- Say what? I thought the pool was great, why is this a caveat? The weather was pretty bad when we were there - not something the hotel can control - but many choose the YC because of the pool (Storm Along Bay). We only used the pool for 1 hour in our 5 days, and we still enjoyed our stay. Just do not choose the hotel because of the pool. You may have a tropical wave dumping 12 inches of rain, like we had. Also, the pool has some fixed hours. It opened at 10 am; I'm not sure what time it closed, but it was not open late in the evening. There's a closed fence around it, so there is no way to use the pool before/after hours. I'm sure its closure is to keep guests' safety in mind (very important), but if you are planning on an early morning swim or a late-evening swim at the pool, you will be out of luck. Caveat #2: Do not choose the hotel if you are expecting to spend most of your time outside Epcot/DHS --- While it's very easy to get to Epcot and DHS from the YC, the one area that needs improvement is the buses. Now, I've had this same criticism regarding other deluxe hotels at Disney. I think of the buses as an amenity and it baffles me that they do not have more buses for the hotels that are supposed to be the best that Disney offers. Our bus to the Magic Kingdom, 45 minutes prior to opening time (a very busy time), came from Swan and Dolphin resorts, then stopped at Yacht Club, then stopped at Beach Club and then stopped at the Bowardwalk Inn, and then went to MK. It was a packed, long ride, with many standing, and not the most pleasant way to start the day. I think picking up at 5 resorts is way too much at that time of the day. We are used to taking buses on vacation (for example, we take buses from hotels to ski resorts on our ski vacations), and for this level of hotel, I have never seen a hotel share its bus with so many other hotels/guests. Thankfully, we only went to MK one day. Caveat #3 Do not choose the hotel if you are a fan of the 'counter' service restaurants --- Counter-service restaurants in this area are extremely limited, especially before 11 am, when the World Showcase opens. There are many fabulous table-service restaurants in the area, and there is also room service (which is quite lovely and highly recommended - they set up the table for you, complete with white cloth). All in all, a great trip, just make sure you are not basing your decision on using the pool a lot, going to MK, and using counter-service erstaurants.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat for Kids and Adults!\u201d", "Author": "pdr123", "ReviewID": "UR119264058", "Content": "The trip started off wonderfully because our bags were delivered from the Airport right to the Yacht Club!

I had some concerns since I have a chronic illness that keeps my internal temperature too hot. I also have diabetes and am easily fatigued. We knew we had a nice room but wasn't sure of all the amenities. It was also our first time to use the Disney Magical Express. Once we were in Disney's hands, every thing went very smoothly. We found the bus line easily at the airport and didn't even have to wait, but was ushered straight to a waiting bus. The bus was magical having sparkly things on the floor and a pre-recorded video to watch as we traveled from resort to resort. We let Disney pick up our luggage, but we could have picked our luggage up from baggage claim and brought it right with us to the bus. Otherwise it takes about 3 hours or so to get your luggage. It was fun to see the different resorts as we traveled along. Upon arriving at the Yacht club, we were immediately greeted outside and taken right up to the prized 5th floor of the hotel to finish our check-in. We had performed the online check in, but were handed a package with hotel information, park information, and maps of the resort. This was reviewed with us as we sat comfortably on a sofa in the 5th floor lounge. It was so very nice and we felt very special with all the attention. Our room was dead center to the lagoon and opposite of the lighthouse. We could see the fireworks from Epcot in the evenings from our balcony. It was just gorgeous. The room was outfitted with a refrigerator (good for my insulin), iron, hair dryer, ipod alarm clock, 2 robes, and a small safe (uses a key). If you want internet as in all pricier hotels there is a fee. We have a wi-fi device so that did not affect us. We also avoided any parking charges by utilizing the free transportation of our feet (Epcot), boat (Boardwalk, Epcot, Hollywood Studios), and bus (Animal Kingdom, and Magic Kingdom). It was very convenient and just a 10 minute amble to Epcot where we usually spent our early evening hours. The room had a wonderfully powerful central air conditioner and a ceiling fan which kept me feeling nice and cool at all times. There was no air conditioner noise (nice). My internal temperature issues were no problem once we were in our room and I was able to sleep very well because of this. It was excellent. We had the resources of special concierges just for the 5th floor and they were always around to answer questions and help us with any issues we had. The lounge was great to have and had coffee, tea (hot and iced), fruit juice, milk, bottled water, and sodas. It did have odd hours as it closes for an hour every time the snacks are switched out. But once when I came in fatigued and needing a drink during the switching hour, a thoughtful hostess fetched me a water bottle from the storage room. The continental breakfast was fine for me. I had some good choices for diabetes as there was fruit, unsweetened oatmeal, bagels, and hard boiled eggs available. There also was a variety of cereals and pastries as well. I would stop by on my way in to get a drink and kept a sugared soda in our refrigerator for those hypoglycemic moments when my insulin worked too well. In the afternoon were snacks homemade chips and dip, cookies, yogurt pretzels, trail mix, and some gummy candies. I never made it to the 5-7pm session where they had beer and wine and very light appetizers. But I did make it in the evenings for an array of about 3 desserts and cordials. The desserts varied each day and were small portions so I could taste and it would fit in well with my diabetes allotment and helped me through several hypoglycemic episodes. The Disney transportation was efficient getting us to the parks early in the morning as we wanted and bringing us back before lunch sometimes. Even though most vacationers are traveling to the parks before lunch, we would travel back to the hotel to rest. They have vans to pick up us ones/twos going as they say 'upstream'. So it was very convenient. Our rooms was our refuge and during the heat of the day, we could return and rest before venturing out in the cooler evenings. We spent one afternoon at the quieter Admiral's Pool which also had a spa. The spa was good for my achy joints and the pool area was fairly quiet, with plenty of towels available. The day we went everyone was reading their e-books and just getting in the pool to cool off every now and then. It was an introverts paradise. This was our first time being so close to Epcot and it was great for us to walk there whenever we wanted. We had a grand time visiting all 4 parks. We utilized early opening hours and plotted what attractions we wanted to see. Since my strength is limited, we cut down on what we usually do, but we were able to make all of the popular attractions with ease. Check out was easy at 2:45am in the morning and we made our 6:30am flight handily via the Disney Magical Express. Everyone was courteous and kind. The staff in the hotel gift shop were very helpful in assisting us to find some reading glasses and other sundries we had forgotten. They pointed us to a shop in the Dolphin which is a short walk away.

Our room was clean and spacious -- it was nice having 2 queen beds and 2 bathroom sinks for us. Our room also had a small balcony (2 chairs and a small table) overlooking a small garden. The nice benefit of being on the concierge floor was having access to food and drinks (soda, coffee, wine, beer, water, juice) in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Several times, we opted to eat breakfast and a have a light dinner instead of having to dine in a restaurant because of this. The beds in our room were comfy - though my husband was not fond of the pillows, too flat for his taste. We had a small refrigerator as well which came in handy when eating in our room and saving any food from our meals. Staff on the club level were always welcoming and helpful - even the housekeeping staff would speak to us on our walk through the halls. This was a nice change from your typical hotel!

We took our time exploring the large pool area and testing out the hot tubs. Lifeguards are at different areas of the pool and were good about making sure kids were not running.

This trip to DisneyWorld was the best trip I have ever been on. The hotel and staff are absolutely fantastic! The trip was a family vacation to celebrate my brother graduating high school and my graduating college. We had booked only the basic rooms (considering the high price tag per night), but when we arrived a cast member met us up front of the hotel right away and took us up to the top floor. Apparently we had been upgraded to club level suits! I don't why they upgraded us, maybe because when booking we told them we were celebrating or because the regular rooms were over-booked, either way this was an amazing surprise. The club level had SO many perks. They provide free breakfast, snacks, happy hour drinks with appetizers, and 24 hour access to snacks and beverages. The concierge that check us in was so wonderful, he even made my brother and I 'Celebration' badges. Besides the staff being out of this world, the facility itself is worth every single penny. I have never stayed somewhere so clean and beautiful. The beds were so comfortable, I have never slept better. The maids did an amazing job every day, and would always leave us little surprises like 'towel animals'. The pool at this hotel is also fantastic! It has a real sand bottom, water slide, and it's HUGE! I don't really enjoy being crammed in a pool with screaming kids, and seeing we were at DisneyWorld I figured this is what I would get, but not the case at all. The pool is so huge there is enough room for everyone to enjoy themselves. There are also various hot tubs spread around the pool. This hotel is in walking distance of Epcot which is a perk, and there is a river ferry that takes guests to Hollywood Studios and Epcot. If you are celebrating something special, I would highly recommend this hotel! They service and hotel itself are worth the high price tag.

No real wow factor to the property, but it did grow on us to the point that we felt it to be quite charming. The manicured grounds were quite nice (compared to the parking lot view at the Contemporary) and the Club's location adjacent to the lake and Boardwalk gave it a cozy feeling. They succeeded in achieving a New England ambiance which became a welcome respite after long days at the park. The room itself was very dated and showed signs of wear, but everything was working fine. Didn't care much for the decor and missed the clean lines of the Contemporary. The beds were more comfortable however. Didn't like the fact that you could not turn off the porch light at night - seems like a waste of energy and hated the light coming into the room at night. Stayed at a Club Level Room and the Club Lounge was sufficiently stocked with treats. Breakfast was good and the chocolate milk on tap was a real bonus - top marks! The staff were truly amazing. Checking in at the Club Level, they appeared to bend over backwards to ensure our trip was amazing (despite being given some minor incorrect information). The staff in the Lounge were super sweet and so nice. They were there first thing in the morning right to the end of the evening. The hotel's proximity to Epcot was super convenient, and we appreciated Disney Hollywood Studios being a boat ride away - avoid the buses at all possible when you can! The pools are said to be the best on property, and they did not disappoint.

From this resort to get to Epcot and Hollywood Studios we had three options; walk (Epcot 5-7 minutes or Hollywood 20 minutes), take the boat or the bus. Connectivity to the other parks was by Motorcoach and Universal Studios was about a $35.00 cab ride each way. One of the features we enjoyed most was the pool area. We would get back from the park usually just after 9:00pm and then grab our bathing suits and head to the pool and lounge around in the lazy river until closing time at 11:00pm. In August the evenings were still very warm so it was very enjoyable. There are a selection of pools and hot tubs all at slightly different temperatures and even a sand bar for younger children to build sandcastles on and sand bottomed area in some of the pools. I have no idea what the pool area was like during daytine hours because we were out at the parks all day every day.

For the most part, all of the Disney resorts in Orlando are well kept with great ammenities and generally great staff. Yacht Club is a very nice resort, beautiful facilities, and well manicured grounds. The pool (shared with Beach Club) is outstanding with beautiful water, sand bottom, and a big slide for the kids. Rooms are very nice with the nautical them with very nice views of the lake (shared with Beach Club and Boardwalk). Restaurants were excellent and the Yacht Club, overall, has a \"high end\" feel and decor. Only two downsides - one, the resort is very large. If your room is at the end of the building, which ours was (towards Swan/Boardwalk), it is a very long walk to the lobby. If you get one of these rooms, I would recommend changing to something closer to the lobby/pool. Second, we found the Housekeeping to be a little \"off\" this trip. We stayed at Beach Club last year and had no issues - this year at Yacht Club we found that housekeeping was not as thorough (for example, there was a used tea bag on the floor outside of our door for two days). Our room wasn't set up as promised when we arrived and it took two phone calls to get our extra bed delivered (10 hours between the first call and second call). Little things but at $300 + per night, I expect better. Overall, it is a beautiful facility and very handy for exploring Disney World.

Was undecided about whether to book this resort or the neighbouring Beach Club instead, but I am glad I chose the Yacht Club. Prefered the atmosphere, more serene and elegant. The Beach Club was much busier and had more children running around, whereas the Yacht Club was more of an adult ambiance and was more peaceful of the two. Even though I have two children, the Beach Club was a bit mad for me. Having a balcony was important for me, so if this is important to you I would suggest you ring up a few days prior to your visit, because some rooms dont have balconies at all, some have sort of a step on balcony , then some small, and some larger balconies. Hotel was extremely well maintained, all staff, housekeeping excellent. Buses to the parks run frequently, never had to wait long. There are boat transfers to Epcot (although only a pleasant 10 minute walk anyway and quicker) and also Hollywood Studios. The boats stop running during a storm or even if one is expected. During this time buses are laid on instead. Although i loved the hotel I would like to give a 4.5 star review, this was due to the fact the coin laundry facilities were not as good as other hotels I have stayed in, and the main reason if you are on the Disney Dining Plan, you cannot get counter service meals at the Yacht Club - you have to trek over to the Beach Club. The Beach Club has the Marketplace whereby you can get counter service meals and use the Disney refillable mug service. Although The Ale and Compass Bar at the Yacht Club does have a couple of muffins and fruit, there is not much selection and they are only open limited hours. The Yacht club is seriously lacking in food selection/counter service/drinks and it is quite a walk each morning to the Beach Club and back. Loved the quiet pool. I have previously stayed at Disneys Animal Kingdom Lodge and this was the only thing lacking there. Loved having a nice quiet swim. The coin laundry is located next to the quiet pool, so enjoyed putting in my washing for 36 minutes $2 and $2 for drying whilst I had a swin.

This was our 3rd trip to WDW with our previous 2 stays at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. When we arrived around 12:00 am our room was ready, neat, and clean. Our room was very close to the lobby and it was less than a 5 minute walk to the bus stop. Our garden view was not so much of a garden as a view of the dense trees which blocked the view of the parking lot. Nothing can beat the convenience of this resort. Since we are from Seattle, my family (wife and 5 year old son) would tend to sleep in and I would wonder to get breakfast for them in the morning. There are SOOOOOOO many choices, some days I walked to Epcot to the bakery in Paris, some days I walked to the Boardwalk bakery. I could also walk down to the Market Place for quick service. The Pool My son loves to swim and there is no resort at Disney that has a better pool set up than this. The only days when he did not go in the pool was the day we arrived and the day we left. Even on the days when we went to the water parks, he came back and wanted to swim in the pool and play in the sand. One thing to note about the pool, if you need a life jacket, they have a new policy that allows you to check out a life jacket. This is both a good and bad thing. The bad is, if there is not one available, you will need to wait until one becomes available, the good is once you have one, you will have one for the rest of your stay. There are 2 water slides a long slide that starts at the top of a sunken pirate ship or a shorter slide for smaller children at the base of the ship. Both are manned by lifeguards. As a matter of fact, there were many lifeguards at the pool and there is a sense of safety here :) Dining at the resort: Yachtman Steakhouse was fantastic as always as was our server Oscar (who has been our server the previous 2 stays.) He actually remembered us and remebered where we had sat the last time we dined there. Steak was cooked perfect and my wife loved the Lobster Bisque. My son loved the mickey puzzle desert heh heh We did both a dinner and a character breakfast at Cape May Cafe. Both were very good and the characters were fantastic with not only my son but with the other kids as well. We also went to Beaches and Cream to get ice cream and it was great that they are open until late. I have no real complaints. The first 2 days we had no towel animals but since my son was looking forward to them, I left a note for the person who was our mousekeeper and she began to leave them for us. It can be very expensive but we were able to get a deal through the website which helped bring down the cost. Even for the cost my wife and I were already talking about planning another vacation here. You really can't beat the proximity to everything (walk to boardwalk and epcot, water taxi to epcot and Hollywood Studios, buses to MK, AK, and DD. If you have a park hopper (we always get this option) you can even go through Epcot and take the monorail to MK as well instead of waiting for the bus.

The resort itself is very nice, and the staff friendly. We told check-in we were on our honeymoon and they gave us a complimentary room upgrade with a view of Crescent Lake. The hotel has two pools. The first one, Stormalong Bay, is shared with the Beach Club right next door. There is also a \"quiet pool\" on the side of the Yacht Club that's a little more secluded and \"adult\". The location is very convenient to Epcot and Hollywood Studios. You can walk to Epcot in about 5-7 minutes and a boat will take you to Hollywood Studios in about the same time. Now, for some things to consider while at the Yacht Club that were not the best. We had dinner reservations at their restaurant the \"Captains Grille\" for 7:20PM one night. We were seated relatively promptly, but then the trouble started. It took about 40 minutes to simply get drinks and bread for the table. Ultimately, it took us almost 2 hours to eat dinner, and it was just two of us. I did observe other patrons complaining to the restaurant manager for the lack of timely service. I highly suggest avoiding this restaurant. Another issue we had one night was simply finding a vending machine for bottled water. It was midnight, and no restaurant or room service was available, and evidently the Yacht Club only has 1 vending machine, which was out of order. We went to the front desk and were told the Beach Club next door had one, but it was on the opposite end of their property. It took us almost 10 minutes just to walk and find it. Who knew it would take almost 30 minutes just to get water on the property!

When we planned our trip we thought long and hard on where to stay and the Yacht club with their water park type pool and great location was the clear choice. The hotel was beautiful and you felt you were staying somewhere special as soon as you walked through the door. It was upscale without being stuffy. Kids were everywhere and the staff made you feel comfortable. They say \"welcome home\" when you return from the park and the \"Captain\" is always there to greet you. It's sister hotel , the Beach Club, is more casual and relaxed but did not have that special feel. If you are paying the same money you might as well feel pampered and special. Some reviews say that the pool is closer to the Beach Club but it was just a few feet from the back door of the Yacht Club. The pool is very nice. There are three separate pools in all. A play area pool for the little kids about two and a half feet deep ( you get kids meals in a bucket and shovel which the kids use to build sand castles). A lazy river pool and a regular pool with small water falls. Epcot is a short 10 minute walk to the left and is great for quick trips to the park, especially for all the world restaurants you can use on the meal plan. Hollywood studios is a one and a half mile walk to the right but take the ferry. It is quick and easy with the boat launch about 200 yards from the back door. The Boardwalk Hotel is across the water and is really beautiful lite up at night with many things to do as you stroll along the path. The Captains Grill for breakfast should not be missed. Dinner there however was just ok. With the good parts out of the way I will now tell you about the bad. Housekeeping was horrendous. They hardly vacuumed the room and with the sand from the pool being brought back with you to the room it needs to be done daily. Don't expect towel characters other then day one. One day my kids ran in to see what towel character was left and they found a bag of garbage left on the bed instead. My room issues did not end there. On day 5 my toilet overflowed soaking the rug. They did come and fix it quickly however when we returned from the park we discovered housekeeping never wiped up the water that was left behind from the overflow. We found that out after we stepped into the bathroom covered with water. There is no quick service meal area other then a cafeteria style sandwich shop placed in the back of the Beach Club's gift shop with no place to sit and eat or outside by the pool. Therefore there is really no need to purchases a resort mug unless you stay in the Beach Club. If you have little kids you really need a quick service restaurant in your hotel similar to the one at the Conrado Springs hotel. Since there is no quick place to go for breakfast you have to go the park and fend for yourself. Also the walk to the Beach club is a good 5 + minute walk and not worth it. for the drinks or sandwich shop. The pool is great but the sand is not beach sand. It is rough and grainy. Almost like fish tank sand. Okay to walk on, hard on the knees to play on. The slide which is cool has very rough expansion joints holding the slide together. It actually left red marks on your back from the bumps as you slide down to the pool. They also charge you $10 dollars a day for a tube to use in the lazy river. Way too much money for a $400 a night hotel. At night , if you decide to swim, there are always tubes left around in the pool area to use for free. Speaking of expensive $10 a day for internet access is a shame as well. It was cheaper to use my Droids wi-fi capability for $14 per month then spend the $10 per day. Lastly I got a garden room view. What a waste of money . My room overlooked the driveway to the hotel and covered car port and walking area. What made this a garden view room was a large tree right out side my balcony that only partially blocked these views.

We stayed here for four nights, three of which were on business. Our room was a Standard, with two double beds on the 3rd floor. We stayed in 3225, overlooking a roof. While this provided no intriguing view, it DID ensure that no one was able to look into our room. The hallways in this resort are loooooooong, so take a shot of an energy drink before heading to your room or leaving your room for the elevator! The proximity to Epcot is wonderful! You can walk to Epcot, take the water taxi, or the shuttle bus. Walking is very easy, unless you're in the dead heat of the day. There is a shuttle from this resort that takes you directly to Magic Kingdom, where some Disney resorts' shuttles take you to the Disney Transportation Center where you must transfer to the monorail. So, location is wonderful! Three days of our stay were spent in the convention center area. It's an easy walk from the hotel, not like uber huge hotels. If you've ever stayed at the MGM or Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, then you know that the convention center is a far walk from the hotel rooms. It's nothing like that at Disney Yacht Club. The convention center/meetings rooms are an easy walk from the hotel rooms, and provide spacious, accessible, and clean facilities for corporate meetings. It was very, very cold during our meetings, but that's usually true of most corporate meeting environments. We added on an extra day to our business stay for the purpose of visiting the theme parks. In one day, we went on our favorite rides at Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, and Hollywood Studios -- all via Disney transportation from the Disney Yacht Club.

I don't think we would have stayed here if we had to pay--both because we couldn't have afforded it, but also because it made me very nervous that, when the reservation was made, they would never give the exact room rate. It looks like it came to over $400 a night--and I can't really say the hotel (or any Orlando hotel) is worth that. Nevertheless, if you have decided to stay at a deluxe disney resort and are willing to pay for all the convenience that buys, then the Yacht Club is a great choice. It is quiet, peaceful and civilized (we had our young son with us, but the Yacht Club doesn't seem to attract the huge families that the neighboring Beach Club does). We had a 'garden room' with a balcony. It was quiet--we were never disturbed by voices or other noises. The room was pleasant and clean, although nothing more than you would find in a regular Marriott or Hilton hotel (in other words, it is not extreme luxury, despite the price). The room was always clean by the time we returned each day in mid-afternoon to rest. The housekeeping staff is very hard-working and very courteous. (Our one small complaint is that we twice had to ask for more shower gel and shampoo). The lobby is lovely and a great place to relax and enjoy a drink. Every single staff person we encountered at the yacht club was informed, cheerful, and very helpful. We wound up just grabbing a light breakfast in the mornings in the bar area--cereal and English muffins and coffee. The man running that was always friendly and helpful in helping us figure out what was covered by 'quick service' on the meal plan. We ate at the two main restaurants there--the Yachtsman STeakhouse and Captain's Grill--and both were very good. We expected a first-rate meal at the Steakhouse and got it: they had a wonderful deconstructed Beef Wellington that was creative and delicious. We also ate at the Grille a couple of times unplanned (too tired to venture out again at night) and were pleasantly surprised. The chef there is wonderful--creative, skilled, and friendly. Even the simplest items on the menu had special details added. In addition to its peacefulness and elegance, we liked the Yacht Club because of its proximity to other venues. We could walk to Epcot for dinner and the fireworks, or walk to the Boardwalk. The lagoon pool was also very nice, with an afternoon pool party that our son loved. Nighttime marshmallow roasting and movies on the beach were also a big hit. Our main complaint is that there is no wireless there--quite shocking in this day and age, especially when paying for a 'luxury' hotel and especially when Disney itself is so high-tech. We bought the wireless once, but it only worked in a couple spots in the main lobby--we had to move from chair to chair to find a connection.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, California", "Title": "\u201cExpensive but Great \"Honeymoon\" Stay\u201d", "Author": "sophie832", "ReviewID": "UR113226828", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Disney's Yacht Club resort for our much-belated honeymoon.

The Yacht Club Resort is conveniently located in between Epcot, Disney Hollywood Studios, and the Boardwalk. It is a fairly easy walk to the Boardwalk and Epcot, a longer walk to Disney Hollywood Studios. Regular boat taxis are provided (about every 15 minutes) to all three locations. Transportation to Disney water parks, Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, and Downtown Disney is also very easy via the regular Disney bus service which will pick you up directly outside of the hotel.

This is our third visit to the Magic Kingdom and we chose the Yacht Club primarily because of its vicinity to Epcot and Hollywood Studios. We stayed on the concierge floor so we wouldn't have to worry about breakfast each day. The concierge floor is DEFINITELY worth the extra money. We arrived by Magical Express and were immediately greeted and taken upstairs to the 5th floor. We did not have to wait in any line to check in-especially nice after a long travel day. The concierge explained our floor and the club room here were snacks and wonderful appetizers and desserts available at different times of the day and unlimited drinks, coffee, tea, water, etc. Another plus was the cappucino machine in the club room. In addition, the staff in the club room was outstanding-they were friendly and very efficient-I would rate them excellent. Our room was very clean but didn't have enough shampoo/shower gel for 4 people. Our balcony overlooked a grassy courtyard and you could see the boardwalk. The vanity is outside the bathroom which was a plus and we had a refrigerator in our room. Now, the Dopey-the drain in our shower was broken and, eventhough we informed housekeeping, nothing was really done about it, my husband actually fixed it well enough for it to drain. Then, later on in the week, the toilet broke and started to flood the bathroom. Luckily my teenager was in the room and knew how to turn off the water so that the flow would stop. Maintenance did arrive immediately after being informed and fixed it. However, after that the toilet ran every 20 minutes or so for the rest of the week. Then, one of the sink drains stopped working and the closet door fell off the hinges. These are all little inconveniences but it may demonstrate that there is a bit of lack of maintenance in the Yacht Club rooms. Finally, the Grumpy- before I go on please note that I recognize this past week was very crowded and hot, BUT we are paying top dollar for the Disney experience and Grumpy should NOT be working there. The woman at the pool entrance was Grumpy. The first time we used the pool, we didn't have to show our room keys-this time, however, we did. She stopped us with a gruff \"where are your ID's?\" When we asked about this, she was almost nasty-you have to show it before 5. She was nasty to grown-ups and children alike. When I was leaving the pool area, there was another younger woman working who couldn't have been more pleasant. Maybe Grumpy was having a bad day-but she shouldn't have been taking it out on the guests. The pool was very crowded during the day and quiet in the evening hours. The \"lazy river\" was very slow-almost unmoving but the pool area had a sandy bottom, which was a nice touch. The kids liked the water slide, too. The pool is not Typhoon Lagoon, but it was fun for everyone. The lifeguards were all very pleasant and the hair wrap girl was wonderful. She told us in advance that she wouldn't have enought time fit in our daughter but she told us where to go on the Boardwalk. All in all, the Yacht Club wasn't the best we've stayed at, but it is a good location for being close to Epcot and Hollywood Studios. The Yacht Club Steakhouse is just so-so, the Fitness Center is very good and room service was terrific. So, it's okay, but not great.

They were able to change and make dinner reservations at a moment's notice. Also, the lounge is a really nice perk, offering a nice little happy hour between 5 and 7 where they serve hors d'oeuvres along with wine and beer. Pretty nice after a long day in the parks.

I booked this direct with Disney on my previous visit and got a 40% discount but even without the discount this hotel is worth every penny. We stayed in club level the room is clean housekeeping is excellent room in generous. the club level service is like no ther and everyone raves on it as being the best in Disney. In the morning the breakfast has everything from cereal to pastries fresh fruit tease coffees chocolate shake juice etc. In the afternoon they have sodas hand cooked chips and dip, jellies, fruit. And in the evening they have drinks and snacks between 5~7 with beer and wine and then later on they serve cookies, cakes, milk and brandy, disarono and baileys. But what I have discovered about the yacht is that if you would like a beer or glass of wine other than between 5=7 just ask and they will gladly serve you. The service at this hotel is second to none and you need to see it to believe it. To eat out on resort eat at yachtsman steakhouse first class make sure that you pre book in advance it is nice to book a 8pm table to enjoy and relax at the end of a long day. If I had to say one negative thing it would be that the hotel does not offer a fast food service only the bar by the pool but the adjoining hotel beach resort does and it is just next door. Another really good place to eat is beaches and cream the burgers are like the size of a side plate and are meant to be the juicyest in Disney.

An added bonus is that resort guests can enter Epcot through the \"international gate\" entrance located next to the France pavilion. The resort is framed around an 1880s Martha's Vineyard motif, so the guest is presented with a lot of sailing/upscale beach scene stylings. The guest rooms take this a bit too far (repetitive use of blues, pictures of ships, etc), but the common areas hit better notes. The staff is first-rate, and indicative of Disney service at its finest. Every single person we encountered at the Yacht Club was able to help with any request or question.

Although some of the hotel could be read as kitschy, if you look just at room accommodations and service, this is quite a nice resort. It's probably not the best option for families with young children or budget travelers, but for adults traveling without kids and mature travelers who want to experience more than the theme parks, this is a pretty good way to go.

The room I had was nice, though the thoroughness of housekeeping was a little suspect. I noticed on my first day an empty water bottle in between the nightstand and the bed. That bottle was there the remainder of my stay. The pillows were thicker foam so it was a bit more on the uncomfortable side.

We knew it would be the busiest time of the year so we wanted to stay someplace close to our favorite parks, so we chose the Yacht club, and it was a great choice!

They say the key to a successful park visit is to get there before opening, and they are right! But since we were in line at the gate drop we were able to go on every ride that we wanted to by lunchtime in every park we visited. We even road Everest 3 times in a row without a wait! It probably helped that the temps were below normal, keeping some guests home until later. Even so, the parks reached capacity by the afternoon, and fastpasses were all handed out within the first couple of hours. It was great to be able to retreat from the parks when they got so congested and return to our hotel to relax and swim. Even though it was cool out my kids still spent hours each day in the pool! Stormalong bay is great, so much variety in one pool! Water volleyball, slide, lazy river, hot tubs, and so many little turns that made almost private pool areas! At night we would stroll back to Epcot to eat at one of their many fun restaurants, one of the best reasons for staying at the Yacht Club. Our view was sideways towards the pool and lake, and we had a great view of Epcot's nightly fireworks! I love the Yacht club for having so many balcony rooms compared to the Beach club.

The staff is cheerful and they try to accommodate your requests as best as they can, although on occasion their help is rather limited. Our room was clean. Daily housekeeping was good. We had a coffee maker with acceptable free coffee, a fridge, & ice machine down the hall. Shuttle service to the parks and airport was timely. The location seemed convenient, but I think that I would try one of the monorail-adjacent hotels next time (not sure if they are more convenient, but they seemed like they were). The restaurants were all good, both at the hotel and inside Epcot (which is a short stroll away). The problems that we experienced stemmed from the fact that the Disney system is so big. They automate everything for efficiency, which is, for the most part, appreciated, but when you do have a need/problem, it's hit or miss on how and when you'll get a solution. No one seems to be bothered by the boat horns that blast all day, from an hour before the parks open to and hour after they close, but we were. I suppose most families are in the parks all day. We went to Disney World to run in the Half and full Marathons, so we spent the first 3 days of our stay trying to rest and get to sleep very early (for a 3am wake-up on both Saturday and Sunday). Imagine if someone pulled into your home's driveway and honked their car horn three long times, every three or so minutes -- that's exactly what it sounded like from 8am to 10pm. We requested another room, but the front desk can't move you. You must go through the central reservations phone bank and they do not know which rooms face the water (boat horns) and which do not. So after being shown two rooms which were both equally noisy to our room, we gave up and stayed put. But one of the operators that we had spoken to (because of the system, we were unable to speak directly to her again, we could only talk with whoever answered the reservations phone), spent the next two days canceling our room keys (each day) and we had to have new cards made twice (a 20 minute ordeal each time). The front desk tried to help, they couldn't understand why this person was canceling our room cards daily, and the manager had to get involved because they became unable to make new room cards after the second time. Mind you, your room card is also your park entrance card, so we got stuck once at the the park's guest relations. By our third day there, it seemed to be settled. The concierge is hit/miss. We mostly needed Marathon-related information and some of the staff had it, and some of the staff were really misinformed. I could hear other people getting information that was totally different than the info I had just received (regarding shuttle times, road closures, getting to other parks during the race, etc.) Our room's clock radio displayed the wrong time and the first time we called Operations no one could tell us how to set it. But then we called back the next day and the person on the phone was able to walk us through it, no problem. (You have to unscrew a protector plate on the back to access the controls.) The wake-up call function on the phone did not work. No matter what time we entered, it tried to confirm 1:05 as our wake up time. So we just called the front desk and requested a wake up call, and that worked fine. We needed to use the internet for a quick work-related issue. But the modem in our room wasn't working. For service, you call the central system and they have to send out someone to fix the problem -- they gave us a 3-hour window (so much for 'quick') and no one ever showed up. It wasn't that important to us, but was on par with our previous experiences. So all-in-all, the major things like convenience, comfy bed and clean sheets were good. The little things that weren't right were annoying but forget-able.

The lobby exudes a clubby atmosphere, with a globe, polished floors and wood panelling. It's all a bit artificial and Disney, though. Our room was superb, we had a sort of side view of the lake, but this meant we could see all the fireworks at Epcot every night. Location wise, you can get to Epcot really easily by walking maybe five minutes to the side gate. There are boats that take you both to Epcot and Hollywood Studios. The boats get packed at night with weary guests trying to get back, so often we walked from Hollywood Studios, along the canal (Disney- made) about a mile or so. There are also buses that take you to the other parks and Downtown Disney, but it is really difficult to visit any other resort hotels, other than your neighbours the Swan and Dolphin.We booked dinner at the Grand Floridian via the Magic Kingdom and never made it, due to the crowds and crowds of people waiting in lines for any transportation. We did manage to walk over to the Contemporary Resort for dinner on the off chance and it was amazing, with views over the Magic Kingdom. You will never, ever get a table at the Contemporary Resort, but you can get a table at the bar if you wait - first come first served.You will find it difficult to find a table at the Yacht Club, too. There are two restaurants, a lounge bar and \"Beaches and Cream\" which sells burgers and milk shakes, and was full to bursting every day we were there. Forty minutes, twenty minutes wait if you are lucky. And guess what? Empty tables when you finally get into the restaurant. An elderly rosy-cheeked lady will lead you to your table, and then you get your \"server\". I think they are keeping people waiting in order to accommodate the staff! I got sick to death of carrying a pager every night to tell me my table was ready....... Other than this minor irritation, I thought the Yacht Club was a great hotel, and if you have kids who love to swim, then this is the place for you. The pool at the Yacht and Beach Club is wonderful. There is a lighthouse, a windmill, and a shipwreck, which is really a huge long slide back into the pool. It's amazing.One word of warning- although there are lots of lifeguards on duty, there is an area of the pool that reaches over 8 feet in depth so watch this if you have less than capable swimmers in the group.

We are a family of 4 (kids 4 and 2). We have stayed at Pop Century, Port Orleans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c French Quarter and off site in a town-house before. You do immediately notice the difference between a Disney moderate and a deluxe. Upon entering our room our 4 year informed us we needed to take our shoes off so he obviously figured out there was something a little more special about the room at the Yacht Club versus the Caribbean Beach. After our transfer the check in was smooth and the room was ready for us early \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were there around 1 pm with normal check in around 3 pm. Bags transferred from a different resort aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shipped until after 1 pm so the bags did not arrive at the hotel with us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not a big deal but something to keep in mind. One thing we did find a bit like a money grab was that unlike Magical Express which will drop the bags in your room without you having to be there the bag service at the hotel required you to call to get the bags delivered and then a tip was expected. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big deal but it felt a bit contrived. The room was decorated nicely in a nautical theme with 2 queen beds (very comfortable), a desk and an arm chair with ottoman along with the dresser with the mini fridge and the tv. There was plenty of room for our family, luggage and 2 strollers. There was a lot more storage here than at the Caribbean Beach. The room also had a balcony which you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get at a moderate. We had a room pretty close to the elevators and the ice machine and we rarely if ever heard any noise from outside the room. As others have said paying additional for internet seems ludicrous now a days. The lobby is gorgeous and the model train set up for the holiday season was quite nice. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try any of the restaurants as we were on the quick serve plan but did try Hurricane Hannah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by the pool and the Marketplace at the Beach Club and they were good. Getting a quick serve meal from the Marketplace and heading over to the Solarium to sit and eat it was usually a relaxing way to have a meal. The Solarium at the Beach Club was also the alternate location for watching movies at night if it was too cold on the beach. On rainy and cold days they also had a Wii hooked up for the older kids and crafts for some of the younger kids. The pool area shared between the Yacht and the Beach Clubs is amazing. The sand bottomed pool for the kids was phenomenal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it had been warmer while we were there we would have spent most of our time there. Cast Members came out with pails to make sand castles with the kids one of the afternoons it was warm enough to swim. Being able to walk into Epcot is one of the major selling points for this hotel. Epcot is our favourite park and it was nice to just head out of the room and be in the park 10 minutes later after a short walk. We also walked to and from Hollywood Studios one day and it was a beautiful walk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lovely setting walking beside the canal and brightly lit at night. I think if we were to come again with the kids we would stay at the Beach Club instead of the Yacht Club just out of convenience to the quick serve meal location but we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend Yacht Club enough.

First the Pros: 1. very friendly service 2. we had a good view from our room 3. very close to many of the attractions of disney (which we were not here to enjoy so I cannot give specifics) 4. free shuttle from aiport to hotel Cons: For a 4 diamond hotel, we had 1. peeling wallpaper in our room 2. Mold all along the door to our patio 3. water that never really got hot in the shower 4. several places to eat, but if you are vegetarian (as my husband and I both are) bring some food with you since options are very limited. The only real option I saw at any close place is a veggies wrap. 5. I suppose considering I was here for work, what irritated me the most was that you have to pay, not once, but twice for internet. You pay once ($10 a day) to use an cable connection in your room, and then you have to pay $10 again if you want to use the wireless in the lobby or by the pool.

Room: We were very lucky because randomly we got a free upgrade, I think it just gave us a better view. We stayed in a balcony room looking over the bay and it was very nice. Plus, you could see the fireworks in Epcot from it which was lovely. The room was a very good size and loved the double sinks in the vanity area. Also the mini fridge was very useful as we kept our drinks cool! The bathroom was very small though and could only just open the door. Plus, every time you put the light on the fan/vent thing started and the noise was quite loud. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine for using the bathroom but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to have a relaxing bath at all! Hotel: The hotel is very well done and the pool is lovely especially as it has a sand bottom. There was also a lovely ice cream and cream soda shop but you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it away so bit pointless if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re by the pool. The location of the hotel was probably what you were paying for. Epcot is a 5-10 min walk and Disney Studios is a 10-15min boat ride away. Plus, the boardwalk is on your doorstep which is really nice but was disappointed about the lack of restaurants and bars on the boardwalk. I suppose it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all crammed into Downtown Disney. The staff at the hotel were very polite and helpful but all Disney staff are. Location: Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault the location at all with this hotel. As I said its right in the heart of Disney and the rest of Orlando has so much else to offer. International drive has brilliant restaurants such as the Don Pablos which on Wednesdays does fajitas for only $7 and my personal favourite Bahama Breeze which does amazing food and the cocktails are to die for. Plus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely worth going to Aquatica, best waterpark I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to in my opinion. However, I was disappointed with Seaworld as there is very little to do and if you want to go on any rides you have to put your stuff in a locker for 25cents. Overall the hotel was lovely and I would stay there again but not at full price. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just too expensive for what you got. Would definitely go back to Disneyworld again as it is amazing and I would stay in a Disney hotel as you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault the service and having free parking is a nice perk. However, I would probably choose one of Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheaper hotels like a 3 or 4 star as the price might be more justified!

When we went down to the front desk to get the room changed they informed us that they didn't have a room but they could send us to the Yacht Club instead. It was kind of funny, because my husband was so tired and ticked off at this point that he was actually annoyed. Neither of us knew what the Yacht club was like as it was our first time. WOW!!!!!

My only moment of anxiety came when I went to get the room cards and the desk clerk showed me a $850 bill for the upgrade to deluxe. When I nearly choked she quickly realized that Riverside had sent us over and told me to ignore the bill. PHEW!!! Still, I think that made me realize what we had lucked into. The pool was absolutely stunning. It was huge and clean and well supervised. The pirate slide was a blast. I had a hard time convincing my kids and my husband that staying in the pool all day was not what we had come all this way to do. Being next to epcot was a huge bonus as most of the restaurants were there. There wasn't much selection for breakfast at the Yacht Club. Luckily we used the Garden Grocer for breakfast foods which worked out great. The room itself was beautiful and clean. It felt very large for the four of us. The mousekeeping did a great job (we tip daily, but I think they'd do a great job regardless). My husband was excited by the fact you could get a case of beer from the gas station HESS at Downtown Disney that wouldn't cost you an arm and a leg. A single beer costs about 5.00 in the hotel shop at the Club. We found this out from a very nice busdriver. The boardwalk was very cute and the boat to the various parks came in handy. The buses were very efficient and I can only remember one day that we actually didn't get a seat.

Eventually, we arrived at the Yacht Club around 8.30PM, (after 3 previous stops on the coach, ALL were Value Resorts - i would expect deluxe to come first!). We were then greeted at the door by yet again another pleasant member of staff, whom greeted us by family name, which my daughter was amazed at! She assisted us over to the check in desk, where (yet again!) another very helpful member of staff checked us in, quickly, efficiently and helpfully. We were booked into a standard room (2 queen beds and day bed, standard view), but were upgraded TWICE OVER to Epcot Fireworks view! It was absolutely fantastic, we could view the lake and the boardwalk, and watched the Epcot Fireworks every day - all for free! All rooms come with a balcony, which is a great plus. We stayed on floor 4, and only one night did we have any trouble with a noisy family outside in the corridor, which was sorted out within minutes after i called reception.

Throughout our stay, we went to every restaurant, all could not be faulted - Yachtsmans Steakhouse was SUPERB! And the buffet breakfast at Captains Grille was a great find, there was so much variety! I would definitely prefer Yacht Club to Beach Club, the place generally feels quieter and more relaxed - probably because younger children tend to stay at the Beach Club. Also, the shared pool (Stormalong Bay), was absolutely fantastic! The sand bottom, with the lazy river style pool, and a waterslide - all great! What is also very good about the hotel is that it has that 'Disney Touch' but isn't overpowering as some could be - especially if you have teenagers!

We were on the bottom floor and had a patio that was very secluded as they had high shrubbery planted in front of the patio. Shrubbery blocked your view of anything, however it was a nice place to sit and relax. Had a very nice flat screen TV however unless you wanted to watch Disney channels with the kids or about 5 stations with \"commercials\" about the various disney theme parks, not much too choose to watch. Normally not a big deal since when I am on vacation I dont spend that much time in my room. However, with this weekend's travel I was planning on simply laying around and resting all day until the big running event, and I was stuck watching very limited channels. Although they had Wi-Fi access in your rooms, you had to pay for it which I thought was utterly ridiculous. On the way to Florida we actually stayed in a LaQuinta in for a one night stay over and the rooms were only like $50.00 which included a very soft bed and FREE Wi-Fi. Why can't Disney supply Wi-Fi for free at a hotel that charges $350 per night?? This hotel is VERY LARGE and spread out so make sure you have your walking shoes. Just to get from our room to the front desk was a major walk. Then the restaurants were all clear at the other end of the hotel as well. They do provide transportation right in front of the lobby by bus to all Disney Parks. Very nice and large pool area with several lifeguards on duty. They have a \"beachfront area\" but you cannot swim in the water. Just for laying out in the sun or area for children to play in the sand. Overall, a very nice hotel, but for the price, I would expect a few more attention to details.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cHoliday Inn has Disney Beat!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "FisherKingTampa", "ReviewID": "UR82021152", "Content": "This last weekend I was involved in the Disney Wine & Dine Half Marathon Weekend (Oct. 1-2, 2010) , as a doctor friend ran in my honor.

Issues I had with Disney: 1. They will not carry any of Fox News, neither national of local on any of their TV programming. I ask management staffing and they told me the decisions at the corporate level. On the channel selection they show two FOX channels that carry nothing but infomercials. They do carry NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, and a few I do not remember. I sorry, but this [--] me off. Especially since, I know that FOX carries commercials for Disney. Why? Think about this, you book a week with this place and when you check in you find out you have no chance to watch FOX, unless you want to pay for internet serve. I will never stay on a Disney Property again. I am appalled that FOX carries commercials for Disney. What say you? 2. Lock on door did not work. Not a bad problem until you check in at midnight and they put you in room 3049, with is a long way from the front desk. Two trips back and forth is a bit much. 3. Nasty trash in the ice bucket. 4. Phone not working in the bathroom. 5. Two light bulbs that did not work. 6. NO digital TV programing. 7. TV programing is very limited. 8. At home I set my thermastat at 78 degrees, Disney you have to guess that the settings is between low-high. 9. At $350.00 a night, I exspect them to turn down the room... not at Disney. 10. Food is geared to children, I understand that, I also know adults need to eat with the children. All od this may seem petty, but when you pay this much, you should exspect more, so save your money and stay at a cheaper hotel, you will enjoy your vacation as much.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ST.

If you can book the trip with a 10 day notice, you'll save yourself about $150 in airport taxi transfers to and from the hotel (granted, once you're on the coach, you might end up with a couple of five year olds shrieking with delight as the movie plays and you start seeing signs of The Mouse, but what the hell . . . you can an understand their delight). From the moment you alight, to the moment you arrive at your room, the experience is truly magical. You'll arrive empty-handed, and your cases will automatically be delivered to your room. Everyone who greeted us was cheerful and helpful. We were unexpectedly upgraded to a water view room and it was really a fabulous view of the bay and the boats coming and going. There was a slightly odd odor in the room, which we attributed to the Florida humidity, but the room very large, with two queen beds, spotless, and very comfortable. One morning the cleaning service forgot to replenish the toiletries and when we called down to ask for more, someone from housekeeping was up in 10 minutes with aplogies and handfuls of shampoo and body gel. The only minor complaint we had was that if you are sitting on the toilet, you cannot close the door without having to get up as the door swings within a half inch of the bowl - of course the adults understood that, but the kids sometimes forgot . . . It was minutes away by boat to Epcot and Hollywood Studios, and maybe a 15 minute ride by coach to the Magic Kingdom and all of the transportation seems to run quite frequently (the ferries and buses are compliments of Disney). Also, if you choose to stay at the hotel. it has one of the best pool complexes. If I remember correctly, there were about 3 different pools, all heated, including a \"lazy river\" which you float down (either rent an inner tube or a noodle at the pool shop - inner tubes run about $3 per hour per person), as well as a shipwrecked vessel that the kids climb up to an then slide down a tunnel to the pool (my husband even did it and said it was fun!) We took a Mears cab (they're often stationed at the hotels) to Sea World and it cost about $25 each way. Personally, now that we've been to Sea World once, I don't think we'll be going back there any time soon again (it's no Disney experience - lets just leave it at that!) Although there are less expensive options if you head over to the boardwalk, or eat at the hotel's snack bar area that has pastries and coffee, for convenience sake we ate at the Captain's Grille and for a breakfast it was satisfactory. We have two children with food allergies and the chefs at all of the restaurants we ate at, went above and beyond to accommodate not only their allergies, but their preferences. If you are travelling with someone with food allergies and have restaurant reservations made, you can fax in an allergy sheet with your reservation numbers and food preferences and they will be waiting for you. One of my children can never have anything other than fruit or sorbet - if he's lucky - due to a dairy allergy. Citrico's (in the Grand Floridian) went out of their way to have a chocolate dessert prepared with soy icecream, and Jiko (at the Wilderness Lodge) also had something ready for him. On our last night, we turned up without a reservation at the Flying Fish Cafe (over on the boardwalk) and the Chef came to the table to go over the menu items personally. All of these restaurants were a bit on the expensive side, but totally worthwhile since the quality and presentation of the food were really top-notch with service to match.

You can also explore the Boardwalk area which is a 5 minute walk across the lagoon. It gives you so any more options for food. The staff at the hotel was amazing,we never came in contact with anyone that was not pleasant and smiling. I forgot to pack underwear for my 8 year old and had asked the Concierge desk on club-level about where to buy them. They offered to send someone out to get them for me!

If I want a quick snack, say a burger or hotdog or wrap, I would like to go to a counter and get quick service. There was none of this in the Yacht club. There was a small counter service, and I mean small, in the shop in the Beach club. Everywhere else was table service. We came in from the pool one day to grab lunch. Beaches and Cream was a 45 minute. The captains grille was a 15 minute wait. We were told that the delay was because tables were being cleared.

The walk isn't that far between the two, but it is definitely more than just a 2 minute quick trip to get something to eat. The Yacht Club has a great gift shop, much nicer than the Beach Club's gift shop in my opinion. We ordered room service for breakfast twice and once for dinner.

We were originally supposed to stay out of town; however, that didn't pan out. I was so glad that we have Disney in our backyard to come in and save the day. The reservation process was extremely simply; I called the reservation line and they had me all set for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Magical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experience in about 10 minutes. We were greeted at the security gate by a warm \"welcome home\". The only complaint I have from the trip would be the service we received, both at check-in and check-out, from the front desk. Neither of the individuals seemed to know much of what they were doing. They fumbled around with the system and had to ask questions repeatedly. At check-in, the cast member didn't provide any description or guidance about the hotel amenities. He didn't even tell us where the elevator was. Furthermore, we had to go to the concierge desk to have some problems corrected with our park tickets. As a Disney secret, I would recommend that, even if you have a \"Standard View\", always ask where your room is located. This way you can see if there might be a better alternative. Initially, we were supposed to be looking at the parking lot. The front desk was able to move our room to overlook a nice courtyard with a wooded area-- at no additional charge. The concierge desk was also more than willing to accommodate special requests-- even at the last minute. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and the concierge desk was able to scramble up a cake and have it delivered to our room in less than 45 minutes. We had it delivered while we were at dinner so that; upon returning to the room, there was a nice surprise there. The room was immaculate.

We had been wanting to stay here for a long time because of the pool and finally took the leap due to a 40% off discount code I received via email, which I think is now available to the public for certain dates. (And no, I don't work for Disney!) We loved this place! This is the first (of 8) Disney trips where we really took the time to relax, and it is because of the fabulous pool. Although it is quite big, the way it is laid out, with a small, but very nice, lazy river, and the separation into various \"coves,\" including one for the kiddies with a large sand bar in the middle for digging and castle-building, makes it seem quite intimate. I spent a lot of time watching my kids swim while enjoying a book and a snack from the poolside-grill. Our room was lovely, with a nautical theme, with lovely plush white duvets, and even though our view was \"standard\" we looked out into a nice grassy/wooded area. All of the staff here were incredibly friendly and helpful. After many stays at various Magic Kingdom resorts, I was a little concerned that I would not be happy spending money for an expensive resort that was so far from the MK. However, we really enjoyed the location. It is a very short walk to Epcot, best for visits to the \"world\" area, as I call it, due to its distance from the main entrance. You can also take a boat, but I think it is much quicker to walk. It is easy to hop over for a meal. You can also take a boat to Hollywood Studios, which is fairly quick. Also, the hotel is on the boardwalk, across from the, you guessed it, Boardwalk Hotel, and there are multiple dining options along here. We mostly just enjoyed the delicious chili dogs and funnel cakes! Also, there was a great magician performing on the boardwalk that we all loved. The miniature golf course Fantasia is also about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. We actually ended up driving when we went to anywhere other than HS and Epcot, because the buses stop at all the Epcot resorts before heading out to the parks, and since Yacht Club is the second stop, you end up going to 3 other hotels before heading to the parks. The hotel also offers nightly movies for free on the \"beach\" area, which we enjoyed one night, as well as marshmallow roasts. My only complaint about this hotel would be that there are very limited options for quick service foods. All the other resorts at Disney where we have stayed have a cafe area with many pre-made salads, yoghurt, snacks, as well as a grill area for full breakfasts, pizza, sandwiches, burgers etc. You have to walk all the way to the Beach Club (believe me, quite a hike) for anything remotely like this, and their choices are much more limited than at other resorts. There are refrigerators in the rooms, however, and we kept milk and cereal in the room for quick, inexpensive breakfasts, and saved our food money for lunches and dinners. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel, particularly if you are not planning on going to the Magic Kingdom frequently during your stay. Just bring some light food for the room for quick meals unless you really like having a sit-down meal for all your meals.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dutton, AL", "Title": "\u201cLove the Yacht Club, but the room was not as clean as in the past when I stayed there.\u201d", "Author": "mynana", "ReviewID": "UR69093285", "Content": "Where are the people at Disney this year??

Check in was on a Saturday. It took maybe 10 minutes . First of all the moment you arrive they greet you by name. ( We checked in online the day before) As we walked in through the lobby the smell was amazing. Not sure the scent but if you imagine a beach/ yacht scent , this is it! Very light scent not overpowering. Can't believe I'm talking about the scent but it truly was a nice surprise. Anyway, our preteen loved the pool. It was by far the best pool I've ever been in , The sandy bottom was always warm and the sand felt so good on the feet.. We made a sandcastle and really enjoyed our time in the pool. It was just like the beach minus the salt and waves. The steakhouse at the YC was so so good. I cannot say enough good things about this place. The only negative thing I can say about this place is the cost ,but it lived up to every expectation we had so to me it's well worth the extra cost. It was crowded a bit in the pool area during the day but we were always able to find a good spot . The next time we visit I think we will spend more time at the pool instead of the parks. Oh and that brings to mind how close Epcot is to the YC. We arrived in the late evening at check in, so we walked to Epcot ( took 5 min) . Housecleaning was always generous with bath products and cleaned our room everyday. So much I haven't mentioned. Keep in mind we did not visit during a holiday, we requested at room near the lobby so walking to the pool was really fast. No special room view . I think this made a huge difference.

We had two large double beds which were very comfortable with crisp white linen which was changed very regularly. The bathroom had a dressing are with double sinks separate to the living and sleeping are and the toilet and bath / shower were in a little room of their own. All were ultra clean with towels changed daily. Our holiday was on a room only basis but you could get a buffet style breakfast if you booked at the restaurant downstairs. Failing that there is a lovely bakery on the Boardwalk just across from the hotel which had great fresh pastries and croissants. This hotel is ideally situated for Epcot as you can walk there in approximately 10 mins if that. You can also get a boat down to Epcot as park of the complimentry Disney transporation system. This was excellent and a lot quicker to use getting to other parks than we first thought. If you want to explore a lot out of the Disney World location then you will definitely need to hire a car as taxis can work out quite expensive. We found the food more expensive within Disney than outside in the rest of Orlando however this is to be expected and was not off the scale. The pool area at the Yacht Club is delightful and great to chill out by. The pool itself caters for all swimmers, ranging from a shallow paddling area for the little ones to an area 6ft deep for swimmers. Its not a serious swimmers pool but then with so much else to do around the area who cares. Its great for wallowing and relaxing between park hopping, shopping or whatever takes your fancy.

The location near Epcot, Boardwalk, Disney Hollywood Studios( Boat Ride is free!!!), Fantasia Gardens, etc.is also preferable to other resort locations. Buses to the other parks like Animal and Magic Kingdom ran very efficiently. Rooms are not real large but very nice and perfectly clean. The dining is great, especially for table service, examples Yachtsman Steakhouse, Cape May Cafe ( Actually at the adjacent Beach Club), and The Captain`s Grill. Probably the only small criticism would be the need for another Quick Service option at the Yacht Club. The main Quick Service option ( Beach Club Marketplace) is located at the Beach Club and is a little bit of a haul to get to. There is the Hurricane Hannah`s Grill at the pool area ( which is great ), but I think they could use one indoors on the Yacht Club side ( maybe near the fabulous Fittings and Fairings Gift Shop ).

There are smaller but nice pools at beach and yacht club outer wings if u want to swim early. Ping pong by the large pool also a plus -large game room----keeps kids occupied but not cheap -nice lobby with free wifi availble-in lobby only. endless loop of disney cartoons playing 24/7 by small tv is nice too -great access to epcot -less than 10 minute walk to epcot world showcase.

Main advantage of concierge level is staff that can get you into restaurants with more success than you can do on your own with Adv dining ADRs. Staff not overly helpful to us as we made our actual reservation to the hotel late and things were booked. My best advice is to contact concierge thru # you get right after club level reservation is made -nice gym although on small side. i think this was xtra charge if not on club level Negatives -bus sytem is really hit or miss and we seemed to have many misses. bus travel time once bus comes is 15 minutes or less to most locations (AK, wdw, bb, typh lagoon) but we waited at even peak times up to 30 minutes.

This was my first stay at the Yacht Club, although I have stayed at five other Disney resorts to date. On arrival, we were immediately greeted by two cheerful cast members (disney staff) who gave us glasses of ice-cold water. Check in was quick & enjoyable, a bellhop took care of our luggage while we went up to our rooms - two pairs of adjoining rooms 2091&2089 and 2079&2077. About half-way down the corridor, there was a stairway at the end which gave us access outside, near to the edge of the hotel, near the Swan & Dolphin. We had booked waterview rooms and the view was beautiful - directly below our room was the wedding pavillion, and to the right we could see the pool, Storm-a-long bay and Crescent Lake - in the distance the Eiffel Tower in Epcot's France Pavilion - and even further away we could see the Characters in Flight hot-air-balloon at Downtown Disney! Rooms were very clean, well-themed and decorated. Beds were comfortable & only occasionally heard noise from room above (usually children running around with excitement in the mornings!) Maid service (\"mousekeeping\") was excellent, always done before lunch & we were always given a plentiful supply of shampoo, soap, showergel, coffee supplies, towels... also on arrival there was a towel shaped liked Mickey Mouse arranged on the bed! There are several 'hidden mickeys' in the rooms as well as in the hotel lobby carpets. The rooms are very big and have plenty of draws, cupboards & wardrobe space. New radios have been put in the room which have iPod docks in them. The hotel's rooms are currently being renovated & I believe they will soon have new furniture & flat-screen televisions. We noticed a mix of guests at the Yacht Club - some convention/business people but also many families - we had dinner at the neighbouring Beach Club Resort one evening, and noticed this hotel seemed much more lively & family-orientated. We ate at the hotel's Captains Grille for dinner which was a very nice meal - they had a three course set menu for around $28 as well as A La Carte choices. The Crew's Cup Lounge bar is very richly decorated, and has a glass wall that looks into the private butcher's of the Yachtsman Steakhouse restaurant. The Ale & Compass lounge sells quick breakfast items from 6am - such as muffins, bagels, cereals & speciality coffees; this is very good if you want to grab a quick bite to eat on the way to the parks! Epcot & Hollywood Studios are short walks away, and the boats to these parks are also frequent, and the cast-members provide useful info about park hours & firework shows while onboard. The Disney transportation buses to Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom/Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon/Downtown Disney were very efficient, rarely crowded and the longest we waited was 15 mins one morning (to Downtown). Storm-along-Bay is an excellent pool, plenty to do for guests of all ages. Sun loungers were a little harder to find in the afternoons (still plenty on the resort's beach however), but in the mornings it was easy to find places to sit in the shade or sun. There are poolside activities all days for children (hoola hoop contest, team games & Hannah Montana karaoke!), also bingo & disney trivia for all. Pool is open until 11pm at night. It is possible to hire a variety of boats from the Yacht Club Marina - as a surprise for the family I arranged a private boat cruise to view the Illuminations fireworks in Epcot. The cruise lasted over 90mins, we went to the Studios & back past the Boardwalk before mooring in Epcot - view of the show was incredible! A captain is included in the price, as well as sodas & snacks - further food and beverages can be requested from the hotel's private We had a great Captain called Michael. The shop, Fixtures & Fittings, is located on the ground floor near the lobby, it stocks a lot of Disney park merchandise, as well as exclusive Yacht Club tshirts, pins etc; also a range of food, drinks & medical items. This hotel is beautiful, staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful, and the location on Crescent Lake is fantastic!", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool uk", "Title": "\u201cfamily holiday\u201d", "Author": "erinfraz", "ReviewID": "UR35513169", "Content": "Fantastic hotel staff are wonderfull rooms are ok but need updating pool is great kids loved it.

We were greeted by name as we entered the resort and the service continued to be great during our trip. On our third day, the refrigerator in our room broke. On our way to the pool, we stopped by the front desk, not knowing who to talk to. Before I made it up to the desk I was approached and asked if I needed help. I explained out situation and the woman quickly told me she would have it replaced and our room credited to cover the spoiled items we had purchased. When we had returned from the pool, a new refrigerator and room credit was in place. GREAT SERVICE! After spending several days at the Yacht club, we continued on to the cruise portion of our trip. I just want to point out that the luggage service is fantastic. It is so helpful to not have to lug everything around from point A to point B. Disney even takes everything thru customs on the way home. No dragging luggage and children around. Again, a great service. On our return from the disney wonder, we were faced with spending 7 hours at the airport, due to a late flight. Not my idea of a good time, especially with kids. We were able to return to the yacht club. They stored our carry-on luggage so we could spend one last day at the parks. Not only did they take care of our luggage, but they arranged the needed taxi to get us back to the airport on time (at our expense). Of course, just as they had said, the taxi and our luggage was ready to go at the needed time. All we had to do was hop in... The yacht club is central to several major attractions and as stated in other reviews has an amazing pool. Our kids loved it. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus to the theme parks and were glad to see the buses were larger and held many more people than 4 years ago. (the park transportation was my biggest complaint the last time we visited). We had a great time and appreciated the friendliness of all the disney staff at the yacht club.

We were celebrating my Mother's victory over cancer, and this was the one hotel she kept wanting to stay at when we went to Disney World. We thought the hotel itself was beautiful, our room was clean, and the flowers we ordered for my Mother came on time. Our request that we stay by the elevator was honored, and we had a lovely view of bushes, yep. The hotel itself was far from being booked solid, and they put us on the third floor looking at the bushes and trees, positive thing was we knew when deliveries came because we heard that beeping sound they make when they back up. We did love our balcony, and my Mom in a moment (she called it chemo brain moment) went out on her underwear and danced a jig on it, we were happy for the solitude. Kids adored the pool, and we managed to get some shaded lounge chairs. The slide was fun for all. Kids liked walking to the BOARDWALK in the evenings, so much to see and do there, but they really loved coming back to the Yacht Club. It really is beautiful, the lobby, and the smell each and every time you walk in the doors is really a nice touch. We really liked eating at the Captain's Grille, it was convenient for breakfast the buffet was nice but we basically ordered off the menu so no one over ate. We loved being chauffeured from the airport to the hotel, and it was nice not having to rent a car for 2 weeks. My Mother's plane came in late from Pensacola(about seven hours late), and let me say that Disney came through in a very big way. We had timed the flights so we could land at airport within an hour of each other so she would not be at airport by herself. When I explained the situation, that I was worried that she would be alone at MCO airport they sent a Cadillac with driver to pick us up to get us to the airport to get to her. I was exhausted,and I am sure I was babbling when I first tried to explain it but they came through. It really meant so much to my Mom she was worried we would not get to her on time, and being older she felt vulnerable. Walking to Epcot or riding the boat launch to Epcot was so very nice. We also walked to MGM studios, they were having the STAR WARS weekend and it was a big photo opportunity . Once again we ate at Le Cellier, food was perfect as was service. We loved eating at the Grand Floridian's Park Faire, they added the Wicked Step Mother and Sisters and it was hysterical. We watched a little girl throw herself in Prince Charming's arms and almost knock him off his feet. The Evil Trio played their parts with gusto and were hysterical, one even stole our magical wand and walked away with it using it to zap her way across the dining room. Not once in the 14 days at eating at the table service restaurants were we disappointed. The fireworks at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot were magical, and Disney does it like no other. One other thing I want to point out, we think Disney must have gotten serious with the mosquitoes because not once did we get bit, and it was raining like mad most of the days we were there. Mind you Florida has those mosquitoes that bite through jeans, and have a very nasty reputation, but not a one. One more thing we found curious was that my youngest daughter stayed hours at the pool and her eyes were fine, most of the time the chlorine gives her a hard time, eyes turn read and swell, but not at Disney, so we told her it must be Fairy Dust doing its magic. Yacht Club is a fine pick for families, so beautiful and relaxing. We decided that on this trip Yacht Club was now our official Hotel, and no other will do now.

The lobby had an air of family friendly atmosphere. The staff was always present; but they blended well with the guests. I reccommend early dinner reservations. Cape May has an excellent breakfast buffet, that includes the Disney characters making rounds to each table. This was my favorite.!! We can't recomment The Captains Grille though, The menu is limited. For Late diners Beaches and Cream is open until midnoc. But like all resturants reservations are suggested, or plan to wait a while. The pool area has a full service staff with lifeguards.Also at 8 pm a campfire with roasting marshmellows and a 9pm out door movies on a beach.

I reccomend Cape May Breakfast with Disney characters ;3 adults pluse a child was $87.00..The pictures and smile from all us Children was well worth the cost...I could live without the other resturants.

We usually go places like Jamaica, Mexico, etc., but I persuaded my parents to take us to Disney World (I'm 13) . We all agree it was the best vacation we have ever had. I did months of planning in advance. But I found out the best book ever was The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2009. You can buy it on Amazon for about $20. But it also allows you to go to a website called touringplans.com and print out touring plans of Disney World. Those plans were a life saver! The longest we waited was to meet Ariel in Ariel's Grotto. That was a 30 minute wait. The plans tell you in order what to do. We followed the \"Happy Family\" touring plan, which included a 3 hour or more break from the parks in the middle of the day. We were done with everything we wanted to do in Disney World in one week using these plans. Some people complain about hating being on a schedule. But its really loose guidelines you don't always have to follow! They were just amazing. Okay, more about our hotel. The Yacht club was awesome! The people there were just so nice, we really didn't want to leave! As you walk in the huge lobby they have a little corner with old cartoons playing, which are fun to watch. The atmosphere is so calming, that after a hot, tiring day, you feel relaxed. Not to mention the pool is fantastic! The Yacht Club shares a Pool with the Beach Club, but its more like a mini water park! Its has a fun water slide, a relaxing sand bottom pool, and a lazy river. The downside is that you have to pay to rent an inter-tube. I don't think it's worth it. They also have a beach but you can't swim in the water. The rooms were also very elegant. We originally booked a water view room on a regular level. When we got there, we were awarded Family of the day and got upgraded to Concierge level. That was a nice treat, but I wouldn't pay to stay on concierge level. The one thing thats was cool about it was the lounge. In the morning they had breakfast, in the afternoon snacks, and the evening dessert and Appetizers. They also had a happy hour with beer and wine at a certain time at no extra cost. If you aren't planning on booking concierge level, bring your own breakfast foods like granola bars, oatmeal, etc. You don't want to break the bank paying for breakfast. And again, I don't think we would pay the extra money to stay on the concierge level. The only difference is a slightly bigger balcony and the lounge. Are you going to pay $100+ for breakfast per day? I wouldn't. So, overall, the Yacht Club was an amazing hotel! When we go back in two years, there is no question about where we are staying! If you are going to stay on Disney property, I would highly recommend the Disney Dining Plan. I think that was one of the keys to our great vacation! When you check in, you get your hotel key which is called your \"Key to the World\" card. On it are all of your meals and snacks. So whenever you eat, you just swipe your card and you're covered! They give you a receipt that tells you how many meals/snacks you have left. We weren't hungry at all! They give you such large portions there! It was awesome. You can check out more about it at DisneyWorld.com or The Unofficial Guide. The restaurants we went to were all awesome. The first night we went to Cinderella's Royal Table in the Cinderella Castle. That took up two of our meals but was worth it. We all agree it was the best dinner. In the beginning you meet Cinderella and take photos (two of which you get to keep) and get autographs. Later they preform a show, that was cool too. The food was pretty good but the experience was even better! I would highly recommend it but hurry and book soon cause it fills up fast! We also had my sisters (10 and 6) dress up as there favorite princesses and we did their hair. We bought really nice cinderella and Sleeping Beauty dresses at a garage sale for bout $10 each. You might want to try that instead of paying a lot at the Boutique they have there. They next day we went to Crystal Palace, which was cool too since we got to meet all the Pooh characters. Then we went to Princess Story book dining in Norway. That wasn't our favorite and we wouldn't go again. The food wasn't good and we had seen the princesses earlier so it wasn't as special. That one you do get two free photos as well though with one of the princesses. Then we went to ESPN club, right across the lake in front of the hotel. That was good. We did that the night we didn't have any plans ( because of the Cinderella dinner) It wasn't expensive and the food was really good. Then we went to Tepen Ido, a Japanese food restaurant where they cook the food right in front of you. That was really good too. The steak was awesome. Then we went to the Grand Floridian Cafe, which was good too. They had American food, the Steak was good there as well. The last night we went to the Sci-Fi dine in theater. That was cool but bring a sweatshirt! It was so cold in there we couldn't enjoy ourselves! All i was thinking about the whole time was my jacket sitting in the hotel room. Other than that. the food was pretty good and the short clips of old movies were entertaining. When you are at the parks, look around for cast members who look like they are searching for someone. My dad saw some and told them to pick my sisters. In Animal Kingdom, they were Honorary Presenters and they got to present the Regal Emperor scorpion when the park opened. We were also let in early :) . So my dad and I were the very first of the day on Expedition Everest! They also have this great thing called Disney's Photo Pass. We bought a cd of all the pictures before our vacation for $99. You get a card and give it to any of the cast members with a camera and they take really cool pictures of you. When you are back home you can view all your photos online, add borders and more. The CD was really worth it because we have about 300 pictures! Lastly, remember to buy a park hopper pass, make dinner reservations in ADVANCE and get fast-passes! I hope this helps!

I had a small medical issue while there and the front desk, guest services and house keeping continuously checked on me & offered to help in any way they could.

We are a family of 5 and had enough space to sleep comfortably - 2 in each dbl/queen bed and my preteen son on the daybed. The main problem was having only 1 bathroom for 5 of us, but we made do. The pool for this hotel is AWESOME! Even having only stayed at this one resort, I think I would have to say it's the best one on property. It's HUGE and family friendly for all ages. There are beach areas and a huge pirate ship and slides and plenty of shallow areas for the little ones. There were also plenty of lounge chairs all around. In our room we were pleased to find an autographed photo of Goofy, along with the washcloth/towel animals made my housekeeping. My kids loved this, as did my husband & I! The rooms are very clean and well maintained. We had to go down several long hallways to get to our room from the elevator, but the kids loved racing to the door to our room to be the first to use the key card! Simple pleasures! :) I would have to say the biggest benefit of staying on property is the early admission for onsite guests to the parks. We used it the days we could and it was quite nice. A very nice perk to be able to get in before the crowds. We also did a character breakfast at Animal Kingdom which was very fun. The staff at the resort were all exceptional and friendly. No complaints here. We ordered room service twice and although rather pricey, as all Disney food is, it was very tasty, hot and delivered promptly. If you can afford it, staying on property definately has it's advantages.

Though this was a deluxe Disney resort, you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know it by looking at the room. The room contained two queen beds and a twin daybed but it felt cramped with all of us in it at once. The TV armoire housed a small fridge and there was a small coffee maker in the bathroom sink area. I like how Disney puts the sinks outside of the toilet and bath area, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more efficient for families. The lobby and public areas had an elegant feel to them, but that feel did not flow through to the rooms. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything wrong with the rooms, they just felt cramped and a bit rundown. Paying over $300 per night you think the room would be outstanding, but not so here. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying inflated Disney prices for an ordinary hotel room. What you do get for the inflated price, though, is an enviable location and some nice restaurant and recreation amenities. We loved being able to stroll around the Boardwalk and have a great selection of restaurants to try out. We loved that we could walk to Epcot and Disney Hollywood Studios and we loved the fantastic pool that the Yacht Club shares with the Beach Club. Stormalong Bay is almost reason enough to stay at this property. We swam everyday, even though it was a bit cool, but the pool was so inviting we just had to get in. The kids loved every aspect of the pool, from the zero-entry sandy beach area to the lazy river and the great water slide off of the pirate ship moored in Crescent Lake. The only drawback to the three-acre pool is that it so hard to keep an eye on your kids! Good thing Disney has it well-staffed with lifeguards. There were lots of other activities that kept the kids busy besides swimming. Some nights there were Disney movies being shown on an inflatable screen on the beach, campfires and storytelling on the beach, organized kids games around the pool, surrey bicycle rentals, watercraft rentals and more. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to partake in all we wanted to as we spent the days visiting the theme parks.

The parks were busy and the weather was cool about 70 everyday. And actually cold at night around 45-55 degrees. We found the staff very friendly and always attentive to the children.

The restaurants for the Yacht Club were very good. The Galley has a great buffet for breakfast - fresh pastries and excellent hot and cold items to choose from. As well as Yachtsman Steak our meal was wonderful and very expensive but upscale and worth the money. Hurricane Hanna's was a bit average to below average. Burgers are much better at the Beaches N Cream nearby in the Beach Club. I would recommend the Beach Club as an alternative, Lobby was beautifully decorated and softer on the eyes. The Marketplace within the Beach Club had good sandwiches and breakfast or pastries to choose from also. We were on the dining plan-worth the money because everything on all menus around Disney are priced high. We used the plan and whenever we wanted added to it and paid cash as well. If you have young children the pool has a great shallow end with a sandy beach surrounding it.

Our room was fine, very spacious, and clean. Our 2 children loved the sand bottom pool. However, I saw hotel staff members sweeping sand off the sidewalks back into the pool at night, and I thought that was a little gross. After that, we swam only in the small pool by the tennis court. No sand, but hopefully cleaner. The biggest problem, by far, is the food situation. This is the first time we have stayed at a Disney hotel since the implementation of their \"Dining Plan.\" We were not on the plan, as my husband and one child are very picky, and never eat dessert, and only drink water, so we would probably lose money. In any case, keep in mind that lots of people ARE on the plan, and MANY of them are in hotels without full service restaurants. Where do all the people at pop century, etc, go for their daily full service meal? Guess. Also, they are all advised to make reservations 180 days in advance. We thought, \"How many idiots make dinner reservations for their entire stay six months in advance?\" The answer is \"LOTS of idiots.\" Several nights, although we were staying at this expensive hotel, we were unable to get dinner in the restaurant. It was full of people from OTHER hotels, NOT paying for an expensive room. I even tried calling in the mornings, and couldn't get a reservation for the same evening. I met several other families in the same situation. I guess the Disney attitude is \"If you can afford the hotel, then you should get room service.\" We ate a few nights at Hurricane Hanna's and the Beach club marketplace. One night I was able to get into the Captain's Grille ( the restaurant) because I made a big noisy fuss at the check in area. To me, it is ridiculous to PAY big bucks to stay at one of the best hotels, and not be able to eat in the hotel restaurant!!! We were there for a meeting, but if we go again to Disney on our own, I'll stay at the cheap hotels and just use the food court. If you have to go to one of the expensive Disney hotels, I would block reservations for dinner six months in advance, even if you are not on the meal plan. I like staying on property for the convenience, but this whole meal plan thing seems like a big scam to ensure that every restaurant in every hotel has every seat filled every night, all night.

We don't buy the Disney mealplan b/c we want what we want. And, I think the meals have been cut back on b/c of the mealplan.

We went to the parks four days and each day at least one member of our family was not allowed into the park and had to go to the customer assistance window. Each time we went to the window, we were told that our passes were not set up properly. The Concierge floor was o.k. As someone pointed out in an earlier post, there was no reasonable place in the hotel to go for breakfast so it was very convenient and economical to have access to the continental breakfast every morning. Each evening they had good appeteizers including one hot dish. My only complaint regarding the concierge service, was that they were veyr slow to refill the wine. One night I was not able to find any wine and could not find anyone to restock it. The location is fairly good and is within walking distance to Epcot. The bus service to/from Magic Kingdom was so so. Sometimes it took only about 10 minutes, but other times we had to wait upwards of a half hour. The pools were great, and my kids loved the waterslide and lazy river. I don't know if it was because of the time of year, but every night starting at around 4 PM, there were thousands of very annoying black bugs swarming around the pool. They didn't bite, but made sitting by the pool very annoying. I guess you are paying for the location, the pools, and a decent room, but I still think they grossly overcharge for their rooms. Rooms at a standard Marriott, Hyatt, etc. are much nicer and a third of the price.", "Date": "October 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cherylditullio@comcast.net", "Title": "\u201cMagical Memories of Disney's Yacht Club\u201d", "Author": "CherylD7275", "ReviewID": "UR20845047", "Content": "We have just returned from a 9 day stay at the Disney's Yacht Club.

This was our first stay at the Yacht Club (we have stayed at the Beach Club, Beach Club Villas, Contemporary Resort and Port Orleans Riverside). I have to say that the Yacht Club is our favorite so far. We were upgraded to a water view room, which was in a great location. We were in room 4075. We had a view of not only the lagoon, and wedding gazebo, we could also see Illuminations from our balcony. What a treat. Check in was a breeze. Took less than 5 minutes. The staff at the front desk were courteous and helpful. We used the Magical Express service, which really is convenient. You put the supplied yellow tags on your luggage at your home airport and magically your bags appear in your hotel room a couple hours after you check in. We did not use the transportation part of the service because we needed to have a rental car. The lobby of the Yacht Club is very classy, and not like a typical Disney resort. Its calm, relaxing and we liked it. Our room was spotless upon arrival. We thought it was very pretty, too. The beds were very comfortable, and the crisp sheets were nice. The room had two queen beds, and a chair w/ottoman. There was a nice desk, and a dresser with a tv on it and a nice empty frig for our use. Then there is another dresser by the closet/bathroom, which was nice. The bathroom area is great because there are two sinks, with plenty of counterspace that is separate from the toilet/shower/tub area. So it was easy for more than one person to get ready at once. The room could use updating, but it was just fine. We thoroughly enjoyed it. We really liked having the balcony, and our view was wonderful. Even though it was raining most of the time, we'd sit out there and enjoy the view. The pool area is spectacular. We were there during hurricane Fay, or should I say Tropical Storm Fay which dumped INCHES and INCHES of rain on the area. So we didnt get much use out of the pool. It was raining 95% of the time. We did get to go sit in the jacuzzi one evening, and we played some ping pong there by the beach. Most of the time, however, it was just miserable out so we never went down to swim. The pool has so many areas, there is a sandy area with a very shallow pool for the little ones, a lazy river area, a big water slide, lots of other pool areas for swimming. We've been there in the past and the pool does get quite crowded and sometimes its hard to find chairs. They do ask for resort ID at this pool, because its probably the best one in all of the disney resorts. There is another pool on the edge of the resort, which is next to the larger laundry room. Because of the weather, we didnt get to enjoy that one either. But I did use the laundry room. It was $2 to wash and another $2 to dry. Believe it or not the dryer actually dried our clothes in one use. They sell soap and stuff in there, but we brought our own. I dont know how much the soap costs. Our room was cleaned very nicely each day. We had Bertha as our housekeeper and she was very pleasant. We left her a tip each day, and I think she really appreciated it. She left us little towel animals, and we always had restocked items. We used bell services a couple times (we had a pkg delivered) and they were always prompt and friendly. I have no complaints at all re: the staff. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. Even the people who worked in the little store were overly helpful. The only downside to this resort: the buses. They are slow! Very slow! You have to share with the Beach Club, Boardwalk, Swan and Dolphin. This makes for some packed buses and long waits. Standing in the rain for 20 minutes is NOT fun. Then the bus finally comes and its full! This is one thing that they should change. If you stay here, or even if you dont. Go eat at Beaches & Cream. Its right out by the pool. They have great burgers, fries, onion rings and ICE CREAM! We loved it. We ate there twice. Once for lunch and another time for dessert. I will definitely stay here again. Loved the resort.

My husband and I with our children, ages 10 and 11, just returned from a Disney Land and Sea Package. The first part of our trip we spent four nights at Disney's Yacht Club. About the bad reviews - if you are looking for a 5 star, Ritz Carlton experience, then this is not the hotel for you. But, if you are looking for a fun, laid back, all around good hotel (3.5 - 4 star), then the Yacht Club is a great place. Yes, the decor probably needs to be updated, but the rooms are clean and comfortable. Really, for as much time as you spend in your room, this is a fine property. And I truly believe if you look for the negatives, you will find them - if you are positive, then you will see the good. Our room was on the second floor close to the elevators and stairs with two queen size beds and a day bed. The beds were very, very comfortable and the room was a decent size. The bathroom has the shower/toilet separate from the vanity which makes it easy for four people to get ready. The very best part of the hotel is its amazing 3-acre sand bottom pool - the pool alone is worth the stay! The workout room looked very nice though we didn't use. We ate at the breakfast buffet in the Yacht Club twice, both times were very good. We grabbed clam chowder, sandwiches, and salads from the Market two nights while the kids swam. The transportation system could be improved, but we all decided that it was not worth getting upset about. The buses are full because they stop at the Yacht, Beach, Boardwalk, Swan, and Dolphin Hotels - more than the other buses. You can take the boat to Epcot or walk. I do not suggest walking to Disney Hollywood Studios in the heat - take the boat. We spent two days at the parks and two days at Downtown Disney - one day shopping and one day at Disney Quest.

Also were able to walk to a back entrance to Epcot with no lines! A big perk! Upon checking into our room, we took off our shoes and our socks were immediately soaked! The rugs were just cleaned (a good thing I guess!) but the floors were thoroughly drenched. When we called downstairs they confirmed the rugs were recently cleaned and that we should open the balcony doors to help speed the drying process. I understood they couldn't change our room as we had committed to that particular villa for the week but still... We ordered room service on Monday night and set the tray outside in the interior hallway after dinner. In the morning it had not been picked up. Upon returning from the parks that day, it was still in the hall (24 hours now). On our way out that evening, I stopped at the front desk to let them know it was still there and I would like it removed. Upon returning late that evening it was STILL THERE! I called down to the front desk and asked them to have it removed. When we left midmorning on Wednesday it was STILL THERE! I don't make a habit of misbehaving in hotels however after almost 2 days the food was getting a bit nasty in the humidity. Never mind that there was a maid's cart in the hall both mornings and it wasn't something she seemed interested in picking up. So I slid the tray into the middle of the hallway and left it there. If it was still there when I returned that day (it was not) I figured I would walk it downstairs and leave it on the reception counter. A few years ago that tray would have disappeared moments after it was set down in the hallway - magically! Staff service was not as helpful and friendly in the past overall.

It was one of the best decisions we made about our trip, and will stay again when we go back to Disney World. I don't know what other traveler's EXPECT when they go on vacation, but the hotel and rooms are very nice!!! For 5 people, we felt very comfortable. 2 queen beds and a day bed perfect for our 7 year old. They keep the hotel VERY clean, and are constantly keeping it that way! Our room was more than adequate and the maid service did an excellent job providing towels, and cleaning up the room each day. If you get the chance, take advantage of a day at the hotel. Our children insisted to skip an afternoon at Magic Kingdom to go back to the Yacht Club for a few hours to swim in their awecome beachside pool, and relax at the hotel. We are so glad we did. That was one of the best parts of our trip! Also, we recommend going to the \"Market\" at the Beach Club just next door for snacks and drinks for your room or to take along to the parks! We ate breakfast here almost every morning, and saved $$ because we decided NOT to take the dining plan. Also, the character restaurant at the Beach Club is well worth the money, but book as soon as you arrive as it fills up fast. We also recommend taking an evening to spend around the Boardwalk in the back of the Yacht and Beach Club Resorts. There is always a lot to see and do that is entertaining, and we highly recommend taking a family bike ride on one of the Boardwalks bikes for 4 or 5. We had more laughs with this then we did all week. The staff is very friendly, and we were welcomed \"home\" every day after a full day at the parks. What a nice way to end the day.

My husband and I are frequent business travelers and have a lot of domestic and international hotel experience and have never paid so much for so little. I agree the grounds and lobby area of the hotel are beautiful and (seemingly) clean - but the entire experience goes downhill on the journey down the very long room corridors. The hotel - beyond the lobby - is certainly showing wear and tear and corresponding filth. The experience just does not match the price tag - for Ritz-type prices, just know that this aint the Ritz. The first 'upgraded' room we were in was just plain dirty. My first and worst complaint is of cockroaches. Right there in plain view. Beyond that - there's no attention to detail whatsoever (for example, someone had obviously spilled some sort of liquid on the top of the dresser - which had been wiped, but the spill continued all down the front). The TV looked like something from another era. Again, for a premium price, isn't it reasonable to expect a premium experience? The second room (not wanting to bunk with the cockroaches) was slightly more clean and had a post- year 2000 TV, but again we had cockroach issues. When addressed with a manager, she seemed shocked that we were the first complaint of cockroaches - for the week. Perhaps a bouquet of flowers would make us feel better? There were numerous other examples of this just not meeting up to what we think of as a Disney-experience.

Wanting to stay within Boardwalk resort area, my wife and I agreed on the Yacht Club Resort. Check in would have been mostly painless but for the fact they placed us right next to the loading dock of the Dolphin hotel; complete with an idling semi. So much for wanting to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the Starwood hotels. The front desk did try to fight our request for a room change, but relented after politely explaining the need for a quiet room\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich was noted in our reservation. Our room was very clean and well-maintained. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hidden Mickeys\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were everywhere: bed spreads, wall-mirror frame, carpet, bath fixtures . . . you get the idea. The nautical theme was carried throughout nearly every feature of the room (except the TV). Solid marble counter-tops for the sinks and the marble-tiled bathroom were especially nice. Our daughter loved the day bed which she used in lieu of the second queen-size bed, she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just my size!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We enjoyed the refrigerator which was included. We visited the resort during mid-December, all the public areas were decorated beautifully for Christmas. The Christmas trees in the lobby and the large-scale train set fascinated our daughter. The Christmas theme also included nightly entertainment by local choirs and storytellers in the hotel lobby. That type of entertainment differentiates this property from the lower-end resorts. Bell service at the resort was prompt and helpful, upon arrival and upon check out. Valet parking also worked very well at this resort; driving to the Magic and Animal Kingdoms shaved about 30 minutes off our travel time compared to Disney Transport. Waiting for Disney buses can be a real drag, especially with a three-year old. The sundries store in the lobby was very well stocked. It carried several items that I expected I would have needed to obtain off-site. You do pay a slight premium for that convenience. The pool area for the Yacht / Beach Club resorts is gorgeous, with a waterslide and significant amounts of tropical landscaping. We found the exterior public areas of the resort to be a fun adventure all on their own. The dock on the lake provides an excellent viewing location for the fireworks at EPCOT. Dining choices are amazing if you count the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants along with the restaurants at the Boardwalk across the artificial lake. Character breakfast buffet was fully booked\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6good thing we had a reservation. Our only other complaint was the cleanliness of an out-of-the-way elevator towards the Westside of the hotel. It had tarnished brass fittings, numerous scuff marks and crusty food stuck in the door tracks. It remained that way for the duration of our stay despite our call to housekeeping. All in all this property is nicer and better maintained than the Swan/Dolphin properties; I suggest staying at the Yacht Club if the price per night is within $50.

The location is a 10 minute walk to the back entrance of EPCOT(ie the part with the international themed restaurants)-very convenient if you like to try dinners with an international flair. Keep in mind that once you are in EPCOT it could be up to another 15 minute walk to get to some of the restaurants(Norway and Mexico). The other huge attraction of this hotel is the fabulous pool complex with its sandy bottom,small toddler sandy beach area and 2 slides(a huge thrill slide and another more tame slide our kids loved). This is shared with the Beach Club but never seemed uncomfortably crowded even though we were at Disney at peak time. Overall I prefer the Beach Club which is closer still to EPCOT. One complaint is that this pool complex doesn't open until 10am-we would have liked the chance to swim some mornings before heading to the park. The \"Boardwalk\" area which is an easy walk to the other side of the \"lake\" has nice restaurants too(Spoodles and Flying Fish Cafe are both good choices) as well as fun activities like surrey bikes,jugglers,etc. While we were there the Yacht Club also had nightly campfire with S'Mores kits-one of our kids' favorite memories of the trip. Definitely recommend scheduling some extra time for your trip so you can enjoy the hotel area and escape the crowds and heat of the parks. Rooms are satisfactory-nothing special for the price you are paying(it's all about the location). Also, we got connecting rooms and weren't able to get one with a king as requested(had 2 queens and a daybed)-were told few rooms have kings. Did experience more hallway noise than we have on numerous previous trips(parents allowing kids to scream and yell at the top of their lungs at 10pm when our kids were in bed). Also note that fireworks are at 9:00 each night and there is about 15 minutes of loud booming if you have kids who are sensitive to that(on a plus note-we could see some of the fireworks outside our window). We did the Magical Express bus service and luggage delivery-loved the lack of hassle!!! Staff was friendly but the little Disney touches we've come to expect were missing(eg always left tips for the maids but no animals made out of washcloths and other little kid pleasers). As an aside, we did the Disney princess dinner at the Norway restaurant and while the food was good we really did not appreciate being totally rushed through our meal(literally walking back from the salad bar when our entree was being delivered).", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk, England", "Title": "\u201cGood Disney hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "vicki.m.e", "ReviewID": "UR15000712", "Content": "We have just spent 5 nights in the Yacht Club, it was very pleasant.

Our room was decorated with banners and ballons for our honeymoon, which although embarrassing for my teenage daughter, just added to the celebratory feel of the trip. Club level also helps secure hard to get dinner reservations.

The prices were higher due to time of year but I wasn't worried about our value. When we checked on March 20 we were directed to room 3118. After a few twists and turns we were in the far corner of the resort overlooking a service road and trees. Since the room was kind of in a nook of the hall it was a little smaller as well--the door was not at the end of the room but on the side wall, and the dresser was at the far end. I was kind of bummed after our great wedding gazebo view last year and my husband went off to try and get us moved or even to a water view, but they said they were 100% full, no moves for us. On the second night, though, we had a plumbing issue that continued into the next morning--not good with 3 older kids 9,12,16. When they woke I had to send them to the lobby to use the bathroom. The carpet was damp from the previous evening as well. My husband went down to the desk to see what we could do, and the manager immediately said she would move us. We went to the studios and came back about 2 and were moved to room 4078. This room had a much nicer ambience and overlooked the YC quiet pool. Husband had offered to pay for an upgrade but she said this was on them, since the plumbing problem did not get resolved. Our housekeeping service was fine. We saw the mousekeeper a couple of times and she seemed very friendly. We did end up losing DS's wallet the day we left and have called but no sign of it, but that's not their fault. We also used the pool and won a trivia contest and won a Disney trivial pursuit game.

But unfortunatley the pools close early so if you get back from the park you can't go in the pools or even the hot tub. We did get ice cream at Beaches and Cream and sat by the pool and on the beach area at nite, B&C is open until 11pm. The place was clean, rooms nice (though it could be a long walk from lobby to room so bring whatever you need for a few hours if you go out or by the pool). The place wasn't overrun by kids, there was a nice mix of kids and adults. I would recommend it for couples too. The pools are great for the kids, a waterslide, one pool is all sand and they could play in the sand...just watch the ducks, they like to swim in the pool.

The layout is nice, the Beach Club resort is next door, and the Boardwalk resort is across the lake (we walked around it one nite, very nice), Swan/Dolphin to the other side.

We arrived in the taxi/van with five (5) large bags (Disney and Universal vacation) and my oldest son had to retrieve a luggage cart for me which we loaded and pushed to the front desk. At that point I was instructed that it was \"required\" that the bellhop take my luggage to the room (seems like we did the difficult part). 2) Bedding - think Fairfield Inn, think your local hospital, now you know what to expect. 3) Breakfast - we like oatmeal, yogurt and granola, etc. (not big breakfast buffets). The Concierge informed us that was only available at the Beach Club MarketPlace (yes we walked there each morning from the Yacht Club). 4) Overall room - updated about 5 to 7 years ago (my guess). The decorations were cute (nice for the kids), but the bathroom was circa late 90's (faux marble, Home Depot bargain basement fixtures, etc.) 5) Concierge service - big surprise here. I assumed Disney standard service (again I assume I caught the entire staff on a down bio-rhythm day). Poor suggestion for dinner one evening (avoid the Big Creek Restaurant on the Boardwalk), difficult directions for a few locations and a hard time assisting me with a reservation (character event) that WDW Reservations had made for me (and already hit my credit card). The net is that given the overwhelming number of positive reviews I have to believe I caught them not at their best. As a matter of fact a big driver behind my family staying here were the reviews I read on this site. However, some of my issues are not personnel related, but rather infrastructure related thus I felt that it was relevant to future travellers. One final note: our experience at the Royal Pacific Hotel at Universal was excellent (especially the \"fastpass\" your room key provides for many of the rides).", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but not a good value.\u201d", "Author": "briny319", "ReviewID": "UR12341689", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 days and found the room comparable to a $150 Marriott or Hilton.

What an extraordinary resort. Just recently stayed at the YC w/husband and two kids (ages 9 and 13) and had a wonderful time. This being the Disney's \"Year of A Million Dreams\" we were so surprised to find out during check-in that our family had been selected. We were upgraded from the waterview accomodations we had reserved and placed on the concierge floor. We have stayed at several other Disney resorts (Poly, AK, BC, and PO...see my reviews) but have never stayed on the concierge level. I will say that this is a great service for those who have the time to enjoy the amenties, but I still don't feel that it is worth the additional price that you must pay. My kids would beg to differ, however, since they completely enjoyed the cookies, snacks, and all the pop they could drink! The main amenity of concierge at Disney is the free food/beverage offerings throughout the day, including continental breakfast (doughnuts, fresh fruit, bagels, coffee, milk, juice, cereal), afternoon snacks (cookies, pretzels, nuts, pop, and water), dinnertime snacks (pasta, cheeses, breads, beer, wine) and evening cordials (pastries, finger desserts, brandy, and liquers). If you are a busy family or are on the Disney dining plan, it is not always convenient to take advantage of these services. However, since we have been to disney over seven times in the past, we thoroughly enjoyed all that these amenties. The Yacht Club is a spectacular resort located right outside Epcot (within walking distance), across from the Boardwalk, and near MGM. It is themed to the tee (as are ALL the Disney resorts) and is now one of our favorites. I would suggest this resort for families w/older children and/or adults looking to get away. The swimming pool complex, called Stormalong Bay, is one of the most extravagant of all the disney properties. It is very large and sprawling (see my review of the Beach Club for detail) and has THE best waterslide of all the properties. The pool itself is a \"sand bottom\" pool (yes, sand!!!) and includes a very large, long waterslide which begins at the top of a beached pirate ship. It also has a lazy river, whirlpool (which is a lot of fun), two hot tubs, and a complete sandy kiddie area with zero depth entrance and plenty of lounge chairs. The resort itself is somewhat sprawling, with long hallways, five floors, and a grand lobby. It has two dining rooms, the Yacht Club Galley for a casual breakfast, lunch or dinner, or the Yachtsman Steakhouse, which is one of Disney's premier restaurants. We ate lunch at the Galley, and I personally would not recommend it to anyone. The food was somewhat drab and tasteless and definitely overpriced. We did not eat at the Yachtsman Steakhouse, but I have heard only good reviews of it, and I would highly recommend it for an above average dining experience in a classy atmosphere. There is also a quick service dining counter at the pool called Hurricane Hannah's which is good for the regular burger and fries meal. There is also a fifties-style ice cream parlor on site called Beaches and Cream which serves some of the best ice cream at Disney along with the traditional burgers and such. For those of you on the disney dining plan, this place is considered a sit-down meal (not counter service). In order to get dei sandwiches and snacks, you must walk over to the Beach Club (which is attached to the YC). There you will find a store which serves cold sandwiches, snacks, breakfast choices, and drinks. The Yacht Club and Beach Club resorts are attached to one another, therefore they share many amenties. The rooms are similar, except for theming; however, our family enjoyed the YC much more than the BC. The CM's were extremely friendly and helpful and I liked the location better. We were very comfortable there and never had a problem with transportation or anything else. As I stated earlier, you can walk to Epcot (or take a ferry boat), take a boat to MGM, and bus to MK, AK, or Downtown Disney. This resort is one of the best at Disney, and I would recommend it to anyone.

I had just finished a combo 4 nights at Contemporary Resort and 2 nights at Old Key West Resort for a conference and was looking forward to vacation time. I arrived in the early afternoon. Check-in was very friendly, informative and efficient - compliments to the front desk staff. I was assigned room #1001 - by the way, when I check in by myself at Disney, I consistently seem to get the rooms furthest away from everything which is ok since I enjoy the walk and quiet that these rooms afford. Room #1001 was at the very end or start of the hotel (depends on perspective) - it is on the ground floor and is the first room as you walk by the hotel coming from the Boardwalk or Swan/Dolphin and would be the last room if you are coming from the Beach Club resort. The room was amazing - as a corner room, it had a large hallway which is great for staging kids clothes and shoes etc. both inbound and outbound, it had large windows on the outside wall overlooking a nice grassed area, trees and a waterway, and had a nice small patio with sliding doors directly overlooking the Boardwalk across the water. A great spot for an early morning breakfast and for reading books and watching the Disney marathoners run by one morning. The interior is well decorated in a nice subdued nautical theme that we did not find dated. There are 2 sinks in a dressing area and the commode and shower/tub are in a small room with a door. The closet is a decent size and there is a fair amount of drawer space including a separate highboy piece of furniture. There are 2 queen beds and a comfortable seating chair with ottoman, a nice work area, and a neat portable table. The room has a half fridge (bar fridge). The beds were very comfortable - the one thing I will point out is that Disney could frankly use a linen upgrade at the Deluxe and DVC properties - they are below the standard I would expect at higher end properties. The staff were very pleasant right from the store staff to the cleaning staff, engineering, front desk, greeters/managers and the concierge/reservations desk was very helpful as well. Stormalong Bay was great as always with pool games, friendly lifeguards, lots of space and the kids loved the sand in the pool. They definitely need more wait staff to take orders and serve food as there seemed to be only one person on duty and she was very busy! The resort offered 7am yoga on the beach overlooking the boardwalk (the class was very good) and also offered movies on the beach when the weather was good.

I'm gobsmacked at just how close it is to Epcot & MGM. The holiday was outstanding. However, I'm now gonna point out all the niggly bits, not to put people off but to prep them for their stay. 1) The pool is fantastic & a good craic but not all it's hyped up to be. Bare this in mind & you'll love it. It's great but does not compete with Typhoon Lagoon & it's 'Lazy River' is 8 foot deep at one point. WHY!? 2) Maids are wonderfully friendly but had to be reminded to use a Dyson. I discovered a patch of damp in the corner of the room & several cherry pips that were definitely not mine! Neither ruined our stay but you expect better from this sort of establishment. 3) The Yacht Club has a few basic food rations in it's store; the Beach Club end has the good food. But, even then, it doesn't have the sort of counter service available at somewhere like Pop Century. The Yachtsman Steakhouse was devine but not eaxctly for on the go food. The same can be said about the Yacht Galley. We had the breakfast buffet which had a wonderful variety ... but was let down by a few dirty utensils. 4) Altho, the Beach Club is aimed more for families, the swimming pool is actually slap bang right outside the Yacht C lub too; so access is never a problem. 5) If you have a balcony facing the lake, rmbr you have no privacy out there. If you have a balcony facing the Yacht Club pool there isn't much privacy if someone else is out on their balcony at the same time. You have to kind of take turns. Also, the staff run their trolleys round underneath those balconies every morning, which is noisy & again hinders your privacy. Get used to workmen seeing you in your jammies or stay inside. 6) Conventions go on intermittently in the nearby convention centre & most of the people stay on the Yacht Club side. For the most part this wont bother you, unless you get the odd drunken businessman conducting a loud phonecall outside your room in the early hours of the morning. Normally this can be resolved by opening the door & sticking your tongue out at him. I've made it sound horrendous, I know, but overall the place is warm & friendly, very cosey & the aesthetics are outstanding.

The other biggest benefit for really everyone(but esp for families with kids) would be the awesome pool area. One of the pools is even a sand bottom pool which is a nice little touch. We looked at a bunch of hotels and this one absolutely has THE BEST pool area of any Disney hotel So if you are pool people then this is the place for you. Also the rooms are a really good size. And to be fair we did look at other deluxe hotel rooms (Animal Kingdom, Polynesian, Grand Floridian, etc) but these rooms were the biggest in size. Also the hotel had just received brand new bedding so the beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in (and to find a group of 12 that all agrees on bedding would be impossible.) However, the bathroom was a little smaller than we liked, but not a huge deal. Nice sized balcony with small table and 2 chairs. But PLEASE REMEMBER....the hotel is big so make sure to request a room with whomever you book it through to get a room that is not in any of the wings. Because if you do, then be prepared for a long walk down lots of hallways! Also check out Beaches and Cream which is between the Yacht / Beach club.

Best filet mignon I have ever experenced. Definitely for grown ups..Very nice place to celebrate an anniversary or to arrange for a dinner date with your hubby or wife to reconnect. Disney has terrific child care at the Never-Never club located at the Polynesian, usually for about 11.00 an hour and if you have drop your child off between 6 & 8 they will be fed dinner, this gives the adults a chance to be well, adults again and have an evening out with out the little guys...

Once we got into our room we were happy to find that we had a nice room, not luxurious by any means but it was nice. 45 minutes and two phone calls later we finally received our bags. The entire stay was much like this with filthy dirty towels (very clearly at least one of our towels had not been washed), broken coffeee maker, non-responsive and at times downright rude staff members, mediocre food and poor housekeeping. I did complain to a member of management twice and she was extremely nice and sent two little goody baskets to our children. But that was not enough to give us back our excitement or our dream vacation. We left feeling like we had not been on vacation and feeling very jipped by Disney. We stayed at Grand Floridian two years prior and could not believe that these two hotels were both run by the same company....like night and day! On a positive note, the beds were very comfortable and the main pool is the best pool I have seen in my life!

Having stayed at various other Disney Reosrts (AKL, Coronado, POR, ASMusic, Wilderness Lodge, etc.) I think the Yacht Club is our new favorite. Our room was located on the ground floor, and was the last room at the end of the hallway facing the quiet pool. At first I was disappointed that we were on the ground floor, as I normally prefer to be as high up as possible, but this turned out to be wonderful. We could just walk out the door at the end of the hall and we were out on the boardwalk. Our patio was roomy and airy, yet private as it was surrounded by bushes. I would definately request the ground floor again. As usual with Disney, the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. The only thing that I didn't really like was that the shop with the quick food and refillable mug station was way over in the Beach Club, but......hey, it was a nice walk anyways.

Our stay at the Yacht Club was very nice. Check-in very smooth. The meal plan was described coherently for all of us. We had 9 in our group ranging in age from 3-69. No problems. Ask for a room near the main area of the hotel. We were on the second floor and could actually use the beautiful staircase in the lobby to come and go from our rooms. Yet, we were far enough removed to have peaceful experience. I'm sure rooms at the end of the wings are quite a hike. Hotel was clean. Rooms were good size, but not huge. The pool was great. Restaurants were just ok, but good enough. We especially like the proximity to Epcot and MGM. Great. We payed a premium for a water view. We looked out over dock and the wedding gazebo. Very nice.

A hotel employee (female) walked our 15-year-old daughter back to her room, as my husband and I were the only ones allowed on the ambulance. Actually this was a the Beach Club shuttle stop. But both staffs were nice. She could not get into her room and they kept re-keying it. Finally they got engineering to totally replace the key box mechanism. So we all had an eventful day.

We are Florida residents, so we have been to Disney several times and have stayed on Disney properties a number of times. This was our first time at the Yacht Club. We were definitely impressed! They share property with Disney's Beach Club, which is basically set up the same just a different theme. The rooms were very spacious, extremely clean and had very nice furniture. Beautifully decorated with nautical fixtures etc. This hotel, in true Disney Fasion was so well maintained and the grounds were so well manicured it just added to the \"magic\" Disney has to offer. The 3 acre pool was AMAZING! Sand bottom pool! So comfy on your toes, and a great thrill for our daughter. The only thing we disliked about the pool area was that they did not have enough waitresses coming around to order drinks and food. They have a pool Bar and Grill and also a 50's themed soda shop that you can order delicous ice cream and typical soda shop food. They also have a Deli set up in the gift shop of The Beach Club side of the hotel that made delicous salads at lunch and great quick breakfast items. Also, they offered great bakery items, sandwiches and all sorts of fruit and snacks. This came in handy when you didn't want to sit down at the bigger restaurants. Cape May offered Character breakfast which our daughter loved! This was great to have right in the hotel! No waiting in the hot sun to meet Minnie or Goofy at a theme park. Just walk downstairs, get a table and they are all there! We didn't even make reservations! The servcice is remarkable. EVERYONE IS HAPPY AT THIS PROPERTY! TRUE DISNEY MAGIC! There are so many things we notice at a Disney property that you won't find anywhere else in Orlando, like : music in the walkways and bushes, buses that take you from your door to the theme parks (nothing, I mean nothing is better than leaving Magic Kingdom and getting right on a bus, no monorail, no tram, no boat to get you to your car which you then have to drive at least 25 -30 minutes back to your hotel) The absoultely clean and updated resorts,( they were painting baseboards in our hallway the day we checked in, and believe me they didn't even look dirty! )Being able to use your room key to cahrge anything you like at any disney theme park! That comes in handy! Oh, and also the most important, the employees are trained to make sure your stay is nothing less than MAGICAL! It is worth every extra dollar you pay to stay on Disney's property even if you can't fit this \"Class\" of hotel into your budget. The next step down would be on of their moderate resorts and we reccomend Coronado Springs. But if it is full service you are looking for then the Yacht Club is it!

I love the convenience of walking in the back door of Epcot and being close to all those excellent restaurants as well as the in-house restaurants of the Yacht Club & Beach Club. And I do prefer the Yacht Club side to the Beach Club side.

Upon arrival, I was told I had been upgraded from the standard view room I had requested to a water view room. I thought that only happened on the Travel Channel! I had read in the Unofficial Guide to WDW that the Yacht Club Resort takes a liberal view of the water view room (it could be anything from a view of a garden hose to the lake). I had a beautiful view of the entire Boardwalk (room 4061). I had also read that this hotel was rated low for noise and lighting issues and I have to disagree. I had no problem with noise (although I do sleep with a white noise machine) as I was right next to an elevator and the ice maker. As for lighting, this is one of the best hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in in years where I can put on my makeup and actually see what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what the issue was with lighting. This is a great mid-level resort hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as plush as some of the resorts I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve visited (like the Bellagio or the Gaylord Properties), but the point of Disney is the parks, not necessarily the hotels. This hotel was clean and well maintained (no visible wear and tear). The desks were always well staffed and there was always someone available for questions and help. I asked for extra pillows and they were in my room when I returned from the park. The hotel is well organized. There are two resorts, the Beach Club side and the Yacht Club side. The restaurants are all in one area, in the middle between the Yacht Club and the Beach Club and most of the walk between resorts is indoors. The Yacht Club side is mainly the quiet side, this is where conventioneers, singles and older guests and families with older children stay. In the lobby, just inside the front doors, there is a basket of face towels. I think this is such a great idea because when it is so hot and humid, you really need a towel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to grab them on the way out to the parks and stick them in your bag. They also have wash cloths in every lobby bathroom, again a nice touch because you really need them when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot. The Room I had a king-sized bed and I felt the room was rather large. There are two chests of drawers, one with the tv on it and the mini-fridge. There is a kitchen counter area with a coffee pot and a small sink. There is also a love seat (which I assume is a fold out bed) and a chair with an ottoman. The curtains, bedspread, linens were all clean and well maintained. The furniture was in good repair. All the rooms have a balcony with 2 chairs and a small table, there are privacy walls on each side. The curtains did a nice job of keeping out the light from the Boardwalk across the way. There are two small closets, one with extra pillows and a blanket. One with the iron and ironing board. The bathroom is a little small and hard to maneuver the door around the toilet if you are not standing in just the right place. I was surprised I only got one face towel every day. I got 4 bath towels, but each day I only had one face towel. I assume because I was just one person. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to ask for another one (just stole one out of the basket on the way in each night ;o). The mattress and pillows were very comfortable. The Concierge This desk is always well staffed. At one point the line was getting long and 2 managers from other departments were walking through the lobby stopped to work the line and help out. I thought this was a really nice touch as I had seen both of these employees walk by twice and thought it was odd that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help out. And then they did. One down side, you can't call the Concierge Desk. You have to go in person, or you have to speak to a different department. I'm not sure why that is. The Pools The pool on the Yacht Club side is small and has a separate hot tub. No children go in this pool (it's boring compared to the Beach Club pool), so it is very private and quiet. There were never more than 4 or 5 people in this pool. It is open 24 hours and has no life guard. The sign says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open until midnight, but you can go in any time according to the Concierge. I guess as long as you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t making a lot of noise, waking up the guests who face the pool, you can go in at any time. Transportation to Parks I had no problem getting to and from the parks. The boat to and from Epcot and MGM were efficient and I never had to wait more than a few minutes. The same with the bus to the Magic Kingdom. I rarely waited more than 10 minutes. Restaurants Yacht Club Galley Restaurant Breakfast Buffet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $15.99 during the week (it may be more on the weekends). This is the quiet restaurant with either older adults, families with teenagers or conventioneers. The food is standard breakfast buffet fare. The earlier you go, the better it is. At 10:30 the pancakes and waffles were getting hard and crusty, the eggs were drying out. There is an oatmeal/grits area with fixings; a dessert area with blintzes and bread pudding, standard pastries and breads. The bagels were packaged and small, not that great. If you are picky about your breakfast, you may want to order al a carte from the menu and skip the buffet. Lunch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the lunch menu gave you a lot of choices. I had a hard time deciding, but what I chose actually ended up being very good and I had planned to go again and order the same thing another day but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time. I had the Caesar Salad (nothing fancy/special) ($5.49) and the Tomato Mozzarella Sandwich (really great, fresh mozzarella, really ripe tomatoes) ($9.99). Again, it was very quiet, mostly older adults. Cape May Caf\u00c3\u00a9 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This is the restaurant on the Beach Club side of the resort. It has a character breakfast every morning. I saw Minnie Mouse and Goofy one morning, Chip and Dale on another. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always packed, so make your reservations when you book your room to make sure you get your seating. Boardwalk Bakery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c For a change of pace for breakfast, I took the boat over to the Boardwalk and ordered the Egg Bacon Panini ($5.79-pre-cooked, just put on the Panini maker to heat up and make the grill marks in the bread \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no that great, kind of dry) and a cup of tea (they had a nice selection on Twinings). Beach Club Market Place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A must visit at the resort. A great place for a quick breakfast or lunch. They have breakfast muffins/breads and make egg sandwiches on croissants ($4.79). The eggs are pre-made and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get there early, they are pretty old and dried out by late morning. The baked goods were okay ($2.59). They have a nice selection on Twinings tea ($2.00 per large cup) and coffee, lots of frozen foods, snacks and stuff you can take back to your room or villa. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s busy and the lines can be long, so add extra time if you are in a hurry. Beaches & Cream -- This is a fun little (and I do mean little) place on the Beach Club side of the resort. There is a small sit down side that always has a wait where you can order limited food and ice cream. There is also a take out side for just ice cream. Your ice cream choices are limited (4 flavors) but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fun, lively place and a nice way to end the evening or take a break from the pool. Room Service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I always order room service on my last day of a trip. Here I ordered the bagel and smoked salmon (with all the standard fixings). For $11.99, I was surprised at the amount of smoked salmon you got. It was at least 3/4 lb if not more. The bagel was large, not the same packaged bagels you get on the breakfast buffet, but not a great NY bagel either. I really enjoyed it, though. I used the order form that you put on the door. I requested delivery between 9-9:30 am. It came just before 9:30, and he called to say he was on his way. The presentation of room service (or private dining as they call it) is nice. They pull out the dining table from under the desk, put a white table cloth on it and set up the food and unwrap everything. I really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interested in a long involved story/conversation and being entertained by the steward and eventually had to hurry him along so I could eat and get on with my morning. But he was very nice and efficient. I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to everyone.

Earlier that evening, as we browsed in the shop off the lobby, a super friendly guy came in saying, \"I feel a magical moment coming on!\" He went on to ask my son to sign their autograph book and presented him with a magical moments certificate and two special Disney pins--one to keep and one to give away. The pool was just beautiful, so much fun--the sandy bottom was amazing! Our room was straight out from the lighthouse--a BEAUTIFUL view of the lake, and the Boardwalk. So easy to get to Epcot--a short walk or just ride on the ferry, a quick jaunt to MGM by boat. It does take 20-30 minutes to get to Animal Kingdom--an awesome park, by the way. Usually it only took about 20 minutes to get to Magic Kingdom, but the last night we were there, we ended up with a new bus driver who turned in to the exit for the buses at Magic Kingdom. This caused some problems for other buses, too. We ended up on the bus for an hour because at one stop two motorized wheelchairs were loaded and it took him a while to get them on. A little frustrating--but we made it in time for the fireworks! All in all, it was a perfect week. Great for our family of five with kids ranging in age from 11-20.

I should also mention that we have either been to or stayed at all of Disneys properties. We stayed 4 nights at Yacht Club and 3 nights at Universal Hard Rock (also has a seperate review). We stayed in a \"standard\" room. No upgrades or special treatment for those of you wondering. I picked the Yacht Club because of the location. We would have booked Beach Club (next door) but they do not have many full size balconies where Yacht Club offers full balconies. We like the balconies incase one of us wants to sleep in the other can go outside w/ a cup of coffee & book. Also, if you are traveling w/ children its a nice little spot to get away. Location: Perfect. close proximity to MGM & Epcot. Check in: Was a breeze. Our room was not quite ready so they held our bags, gave us our passes and room keys and off we went to a park. Yacht Club gave us a business card with a phone number to call later in the day to check to see if our room was ready. When the room is ready they will tell you your room number so you can bypass going back to the check in counter. Rooms: very clean, our room was on the smaller side but that could have been to the location. Other rooms I viewed looked a bit larger. (We were just 2 adults so the smaller room was fine) Transportation: as other members have posted it can be time consuming to take the boat. To get to MGM the boat started at Boardwalk, Yacht Club, Dolphin/Swan then MGM. To get to Epcot the boat started at Dolphin/Swan, Yacht Club, Boardwalk then Epcot. If you are tired and looking for a relaxing trip I'd take the boat. If you are looking at saving time than walk. We decided to walk back to MGM one night almost as the boat was pulling up and we beat the boat back to Yacht Club. Housekeeping was wonderful. The room was VERY clean. We did leave some money every day but they seemed to take pride in their work. food--yummy!!! We always book Cape May character breakfast buffet. The character to guest ratio seems pretty high and food was great. Another not to be missed was Beaches & Cream...ohh now I want to go back for more! Pool- This pool in my opinion is the best in all of the Disney properties. Storm a long Bay has a small lazy river, large pool, great big slide, and the bottom of the pool is all sand which makes this much fun for children to build sandcastles, etc. Because the pool is so popular Yacht/Beach club now is requiring guests to show their resort Id cards and they get a bracelet so that they can make sure the guests using the pool are Beach/Yacht club guests. I believe a Cast Mate said that the resort capacity is 1,400 guests and the pool capacity is 1,200 guests which is why you have to show your resort id. If guests from other resorts come over to use the pool and it is at capacity guests staying at Beach/Yacht club would not be able to use their own pool. If you are considering staying at one of Disneys Epcot resorts I would recommend this property or the Beach Club over the Swan/Dolphin, and Boardwalk. I say this because they are all in the same area, but the pool is the best. Disney does not allow \"pool hopping\" you must use the pool at the resort to which you are staying. A little off topic here, but if you are a resort guest and going to Disney theme parks you are eligible for Extra Magic hours. Which means that almost daily one park is either open 1hr before \"posted\" park opening, or open 3hrs after \"posted\" park closing. (they enforce this in the evening w/ bracelets). Morning extra magic hours (as usual) are wonderful. Evening extra magic hours is like feeding time at the zoo. For us, the lines were longer during evening extra magic hours than during the day.

They do not offer bus service from the resort to either of those places. The boats are slow getting there. And if it's raining, you still have to stand on the pier while waiting for your boat to arrive. We find it much easier to hop on a bus and be there in a matter of minutes. We missed the \"food court\" that the moderate hotels offer. On our last night, after arriving back from Magic Kingdom's \"extra magic hours\", around 1am we were hungry. The only thing available was the limited 24 hour room service menu. We asked for 4 bowls for our pint of ice cream and we received one bowl and no spoons.

Disney does not want you in the rooms, but out spending money in the parks. The hotel and grounds are up to Disney standards, with clean grounds and great service from all of the staff. There are a lot of families and young children here and the main pool was full of children. There is a \"hidden\" adult pool on the back of the hotel near the tennis courts.

There is only one bank of elevators for each side of the hotel. Our room was on the backside of the hotel near the tennis courts and was relatively quiet, although we could occasionally hear people in the room above dropping things on the floor.

Check in was flawless, the staff was very attentive & we loved getting a quick bite before heading to the parks early. We'd return around 5:00 & have a nice 'snack' before eating a late dinner. They had soup every night, the BEST peanut butter & jelly sandwiches, vegetables, cheese & crackers. It was nice to come back for that afternoon break & then return for another round at the park later in the evening. We found our room very clean & quiet too. Our room overlooked Stormalong Bay (pool area) which closed at 9:00 p.m. and we could watch Epcot's fireworks from our balcony too. The transportation to all of the parks was very efficient & we had no problems at all. I also suggest if you have a young child to book the character breakfast at Cape May restaurant located at the Beach Club (which is attached to the Yacht Club) on your departure day. The breakfast was GREAT. They had really good food & you get to dine with Minnie, Goofy, Chip & Dale. We did several character breakfasts & this was the loudest but not unbearable. We loved the Yacht Club & have already suggested it to several friends. Spend the extra money & book on the concierge level.

Take a short walk on the Boardwalk to a restaurant called Spoodles, good food at a good price. The best thing about the hotel, besides the location, is the pool (see picture).

Probably would have better if just my husband and I/ Unlike other guests experiences, everyone was very nice and helpful. The room was alright, a bit of a disappointment on decoration. It was small for our family and I really missed having separate bedrooms. While the kids LOVED the pool and my husband and I enjoyed being able to get to walk to EPCOT and just a short hop to MGM. We found that we really enjoyed staying at rental homes much more. The kids even asked why we didn't stay at a rental home. The funny thing is, if we were headed to Magic Kingdom, it actually took longer riding the bus system then it did to drive from the rental home. We also really missed having the full kitchen for the kids. I saw lots of comments about filling the refrig in the room. I am glad I did, because it was important. I know we could have rented a villa for close to a $1000/night, but that is hard to justify when we can rent a home for the entire week for the same price. While I am glad that we stayed on site, I can check that off our list of \"done that\" and next time we go, I renting a home again. It just makes for a nicer stay. SEPARATE bedrooms, full kitchen, 10 minutes to the parks, pool in the backyard (I think the kids will miss the waterslide though), toys, DVD player and more.

FOOD : We only ate at the hotel for breakfast, and one lunch. The breakfast bar in the lobby was very convenient and not too expensive. The restaurant ( yacht club galley ) was poor however. The service was really really slow, even though we ate lunch at about 2 PM and there were only about a dozen people in the restaurant. The wait staff seemed confused regarding responsibilities of who was taking care of which tables and we sat with empty water glasses for ages, while waiting an eternity for our food. The fish and chips were really greasy, and our waitress recommend them as he favorite item on the menu, so either she likes her fish really greasy, or the other things were even worse. The place also seemed really worn and dirty. We did not use the pool at all so have no comment. We walked to EPCOT and the Boardwalk. Both trips were really easy and took about 5 minutes, so I would not recommend taking the water taxi since you will end up waiting a long time for a very short ride As I will be returning to this hotel next year for another conference I will definately request a top floor room, and definately not one with an adjoining room.

The pools are great for kids, however the hours the pools open in the morning could be earlier. It was nice that they provided buckets and shovels for the kids to play in the sand. The boat that provide transportation to the boardwalk, epcot, and MGM are an added bonus. The biggest complaint is the quality of food you receive for the amount you pay. For an example: My son (3) went to the character breakfast which was a buffett style. Cost $20 for myself and $12 for my son. We had scrabble eggs, bacon, and cereal. I never had bad scrabble eggs till I ate their. The food is bearly edible at all locations on the resort including the \"5 star\" steakhouse. By no means is the steakhouse 5 stars dont waste your money eating on the resort including the boardwalk. The only other complaint is that the rooms are small and the service of turn downs and cleaing your room was horrible. Some days they didnt show up till after 12 to clean your room. For example one day we called at 9 am to have someone clean our room why we went to Epcot we came back at noon it still was not done, we called the hotel manager an was told the crew was on lunch break. Having a 3 year old and 1 yr old with you you have to time your events around naps, lunch and to be out of the room so the crew has the space to clean. When I called an complained about the service the hotel manager bascailly said he would address it, no apology, no special threatment. For the price the hotel met my expectations however was expected to leave having them exceeded. I would go back to the hotel its much better then the other resorts I have stayed at through Disney. Also bring allot of singles as ever employee in the resort expect tips for even speaking to you it seemed and they let you know it. For example: My son was sick the first day we got their and my wife was with him in our room while I was out with our daugter. The luggage folks dropped off the luggage while my son was in the middle of being \"sick\" the guy that dropped the luggage off actually waited for my son to satop being sick so that the my wife could address him and give him his $5 tip. That was my biggest issue is that everyone their wanted a tip for ever little thing and let you know it. That needs to be addressed by Disney.

The pool, Stormalong Bay, was the best one we've seen at a hotel, even ones in Las Vegas. There is a long, high slide that our kids loved. There was also a lazy river to float down, and a small whirpool that kept us going in circles! At least two employees were on hand to entertain the kids. My 8-year-old daughter raced rubber duckies with some other kids, and when she won was awarded a Magical Moment Certificate signed by Mickey Mouse! She was thrilled. We also saw games of water volleyball and Marco Polo going on. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. It is pricey, but we thought it was well-worth the money.

We feel very neutral about the place--neither hated it nor loved it. It was fine. But it was just that--\"fine\". There was nothing to die for, and nothing we couldn't live without. I grew up in FL and have been going to Disney since about 2 months after the gates first opened at Magic Kingdom (remember E tickets??). During these years, I've been lucky enough to experience many of Disney's various lodging offerings. As a child, we camped every year at Fort Wilderness; I spent my honeymoon at the then Dixie Landings (now Port Orleans Riverside); last Mother's Day was spent at Boardwalk Villas, and so on. I must agree with so many reviewers who have felt a loss of the 'magic'. (If you've not read reviews of the Beach Club, I encourage you to do so. These two properties share quite a few services.) Check in was fine. The room was fine: the bed was comfy and the room clean (both OH, so important). Yes, the bathroom itself was tiny...but the marble surround lovely, and the seperate vanity area helpful. The fridge was nice, as was the balcony. Speaking of--as a personal preference, we reserved a standard view; we've never had any issues with same. At this resort, however, the parking lot noise (which included a Disney Bus laying on it's horn repeatedly at 8 a.m. when a gate failed to lift) was palpable even with the balcony door closed and drapes drawn. Finally, we could hear clearly at about 2 a.m. one morning that our neighbor \"couldn't care less\". In short, it was a nice-enough, Marriott quality room. It was \"fine\". What IS exceptional about the Yacht Club: its proximity to EPCOT and pool area for younger kids. But they say \"it's the little things\", and I suppose that's how we felt. At 300 smackers in the off-season, even some tiny extra touches would seem both appropriate and appreciated. A small basket in your room at check-in with a loofah and sea salts to soak? Perhaps a small box of salt water taffy with a note signed by Mickey or Ariel? Either of these would cost Disney what--two or three bucks? Some small, non-essential something--ANYTHING--which would add to the 'magic' and say, \"Hey, thanks for dropping your dough at a Deluxe\". Simply put, we feel as though we spent a fairly large chunk of change for a decent hotel with a great location, and have yet to decide if that reasons out. We currently have a reservation for the Yacht Club in the near future. At this point, however, we are VERY tempted to revisit the moderate resorts. One still enjoys many of the same perks, but at half the cost.

The 8 year old wanted to stay on the water slide. The 5 year old wanted to go round and round in the whirlpool...not hot tub..whirlpool!..and the 2 year old wanted to hang out in the sandy pool. 3 kids and 2 parents kind of caused a problem but the kids had to adjust. Somehow we managed to do it all and no tears were shed. The resort is an EASY walk to Epcot which makes it easy to enjoy everything that Epcot has to offer. And with all of the new stuff at Epcot (Soarin', Test Track, Mission Space, etc) the stock in this resort is sure to rise. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the Yacht Club Resort. We felt it was money well spent. Last but not least..the resort is EXCEPTIONALLY quiet. The beds arethe most comfortable hotel beds we have ever experienced....HANDS DOWN.

We had a view of the quiet pool which was just that, quiet. In the mornings we ate breakfast out on our private terrace (each room has a private terrace) or at least we were separated from our neighbours by a divider. Our room had only one terrace chair, we could see two chairs on all of the other terraces. We called every day, for 3 days for a second chair which never arrived so we gave up calling and just took the writing-desk chair out. The rooms are very large, there was only two of us in the room tho'. The bathroom is small but it is what I am used to in my apartment, the double vanity is just outside the bathroom with plenty of light and mirrors. Our room was always clean, but like another reviewer wrote, no Disney towel-animals or anything cute at all. I thought it was because they knew we didn't have kids with us? We used the Galley for dinner once. The food was ok, typical Disney fare and the service was good. Glad we had the dining plan because meals are expensive, it looked like there were plenty of wealthy people staying there too, we saw folks all dressed up eating in the Yacht Club's Steakhouse and bar area. One evening we went to the arcade which was a lot of fun and Beaches and Cream looked popular with teenagers. The pool area was always very busy but very clean and well-kept, the guests all seemed like nice people. Hurricane Hannahs Grill at the poolside served great counter service burgers and wraps and great cocktails! It closed at 6pm. There is a fake beach area across from the pool area which was usually empty, we sat there a couple of times and enjoyed the peace and quiet. At the main pool, there is some shade under the trees and a couple of umbrellas if you can get one, but there's not much shade at the \"beach.\" We didn't sit by the quiet-pool at all. There are plenty of towels to use for free at the pool areas, you get a wristband to wear when you enter. Staff were all helpful and friendly. Yes there were several stains on the carpet leading to our room, we used to check for new ones each day. I'd say about 7 stains from the lobby to our room on the 3rd floor, and room service trays were usually outside people's doors when we were going out in the morning only, we'd pass <5 each day, but the hotel does tell guests to either call to have the trays picked up from your room or to leave the trays outside the door for pick-up, so it is inevitable that used food-trays will be in the hallways unless Yacht Club changes this policy. Twice out of 4 times requested we didn't get the wake-up call (you program it yourself using the telephone). I can't say it was my fault because i did it right and got my confirmation message too. The gift shop on site sells lots of useful things and is open late , after 9pm anyway. The lobby is beautiful and the varnished floors are very shiny. Bus service by Disney transport was fair. I'd read that Yacht club's service is more frequent than others, but we still had to wait a few minutes at times, certainly the buses that came for us were empty, but on the way home from MK it seemed to take for ever because it stopped at other resorts and i fell asleep at least once on the way home. We used Mears transport once to go to SeaWorld and they picked us Yacht Clubbers up first, so we had the good seats. Room service was about $23-$40 for 2 for breakfast (e.g. coffee and tea with English muffin vs. with bacon, cereals and oj added). On our last day i discovered a store at the Boardwalk (across the lake from the Yacht Club) which sold some groceries like milk, bread jelly tea coffee etc. If i'd known sooner I'd have bought some and not bothere with room service. There is a coffee maker/hot water maker in the room with about 2 tea bags and some instant coffee supplied by the hotel, but no milk or cream of course unless you order room-service. The store on the Boardwalk is a big souvenir store, i don't remember the name but it is the only one there, and at the back are all the groceries. There is a large pristine gym on site with exercise room, weights and many machines. We rented the Sea Ray little speed boats which were very very slow, we rented for $24 1/2 hour which was long enough, we drove up to MGM area, under a bridge passing the Swan and Dolphin hotels. It was nice but slow like i said. Also for hire were pontoon boats and bicycle thingys for up to 8 people. You could walk left towards Epcot, about 10 mminutes, or right towards MGM, 25 mins. Across from the hotel is The Boardwalk which was fun to explore, so plenty of things to do that's for sure. you can also take the boat transport from the Yacht Club pier over to the Boardwalk, although it is quicker to walk, or else you can take the boat to MGM too.

(just my opinion) Next time I will spend the extra money and stay at the Contemporary Resort as is unmatched by any other Disney Property!!!! Note- As with any Disney Resort food can be hard to come by when you realize how hungry you actually are.

I arrived at 7 am and had a mixed welcome. The doorman, who looked like a teenager still in high school, opened the door and immediately asked me if I wanted my bags taken to my room. As I was talking to the limo driver, I didn't respond immediately. The doorman lost interest and just left me! Maybe he thought my non-response meant no, but he interrrupted me in the middle of my conversation with the limo driver. As I dragged my suitcase into the hotel I caught sight of him chatting and laughing with his other high school looking colleagues. The check-in counter was deserted and I had to wait for about 5 minutes before someone showed up. I was attended to by a small, young looking chap but fortunately he was very efficient and courteous and tried his best to make me feel welcome. Because I was out of country and I did not inform my credit card company, my credit card was blocked initially. This guy told me to settle in and resolve the credit card issue at my leisure. He even seemed very apologetic to bother me about having to call my credit card company even though it was my fault for not informing my credit card company I was going abroad. Anyway, the executive floor was simple but nice. The corridors are long so it was quite a hike to my room. But the room was clean, spacious and pretty, if a little dated. It had a nice balcony but unfortunately it overlooked a rooftop covered with wood chips and steam vents and the convention center. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was decent sized. There were twin sinks outside the bathroom. The TV had lots of local channels as well as an annoying Disney channel that kept playing the same promotional programs over and over again. They had a private dining room on the executive floor where they served doughnuts, bananas, toast and cereal all day long. A note: when you step out of the elevator on the exec floor you immediately come face to face with two staff sitting at desks. It's a fairly awkward moment as they're literally in your face. I think it would have been better to place the desks not facing the elevator as now they just look awkwardly at you when you step into/out of the lift. The best thing about the hotel is that it is really convenient. Right in front of the hotel is a jetty where you can catch a boat to MGM studios or Epcot. It's a very cool way to arrive at the theme parks.", "Date": "November 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vero Beach, FL", "Title": "\u201cFaded glory\u201d", "Author": "nys", "ReviewID": "UR3816287", "Content": "I've stayed at the Yacht and Beach Club with family six times over the past five years.

The Yachtsmans Steakhouse was EXORBITANTLY over priced $$$! Everything $30. +. Crazy with kids. The Yacht Club Galley, a mid price restaurant ($15. - $20.), was just AWFUL! We tried everything on the limited menu and none of it was edible. It all tasted like frozen food. The pool restaurant, Hurricane Hanna's, is just blah sandwiches, but expensive too.

While trying to sleep, I could hear one neighbor snoring and another talking about their day- perfectly. It made me hesitant to make business calls or calls to my wife from the room, knowing that they could be heard so easily. In addition, the conference area was in a location that required you to go outside the hotel to get to. Not a problem unless it rains... which it did. We also got some of the coldest weather of the season, which made it a bit tough transferring materials back and forth. Good points included a friendly staff, excellent food at the conference, and an air of magic that pervades the entire Disney experience. The other good news is that the place wasn't overrun with children running and screaming, which you will find at some of the Disney locations.

We certainly debated over where to stay; however, choosing the Yacht Club Resort was a great choice, and one we would definitely make a second time. Please note, we stayed during the off-season; the hotel was pleasantly not crowded. (If your schedule allows it, we highly recommend visiting WDW in the off-season. We could not imagine dealing with crowds during the busy seasons). Our waterview room (No. 4063) gave us a full panaromic view of the Disney Boardwalk area, Epcot (Spaceship Earth, Eifel Tower, etc.), and views of the neighboring resorts (Beach Club, Boardwalk and Swan/Dolphin). The Illuminations Laser/Light show at Epcot could be seen each night from our balcony. While we did not spend a lot of time at the resort, the beautiful morning and evening views from the balcony made it a very memorable part of our trip, and definitely worth the extra expense. Stormalong Bay was a big hit with our two teenage boys. Housekeeping was good; mattresses/pillows were very comfortable; decor was pleasant; service/attitude from all employees was excellent; car valets were extremely prompt and knowledgeable. The location is absolutely excellent. It allows one to walk to Epcot (via International Gateway); walk or boat to MGM-Disney; jog/walk around the Boardwalk (0.8 mile roundtrip) for a little excercise; go out for breakfast, dinner, ice cream, or late night drink at one of the great Boardwalk restaurants or bars. We walked through all five Epcot Area resort grounds and lobbies, and voted Yacht Club number One for us. During our visit (first week in February), Beach Club seemed overun with young families/young kids; however, it was a very nice sister resort to Yacht Club and shared much of the same great atmosphere; Swan/Dolphin are nice, but seemed too much like city high-rise hotels; Boardwalk was our No. 2 choice; however, depending on what room you get, it might be a bit noisy.
