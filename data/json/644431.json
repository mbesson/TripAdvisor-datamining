The hotel room and restroom were very clean. The room had everything needed- they shower was very nice- with an above rain shower and a handheld shower head as well. We used the safe and had no issues. Out of the 3 hotels we stayed in Italy, this was by far the most quiet, which allowed for great sleep (much needed after long days). The location is perfect! We liked that it was sort of enclosed and not many people went that way, which is why it is a quiet place. We had no problems getting back to the hotel once we left it and were oriented where to go. It is still within walking distance to all the main attractions, but like I said, a little off the main paths, which allows for some quiet. The staff was very friendly. They made dinner reservations for us every night without a problem. They were very helpful in providing directions with their maps and were very accurate and simple directions.

We read that some reviewers had reported difficulty in locating this hotel but we found the map on the hotel website to be very useful and were there within minutes of arriving by water bus at Rialto Bridge. It is well worth studying the map beforehand as the only access to the hotel is through a narrow alleyway which could be quite hard to find in the maze of narrow streets. The location of the hotel is, however, perfect and couldn't be more central, being only five minutes walk from St. Mark's Square in one direction or Rialto in the other. The staff were very welcoming and always ready to help or give advice if we needed it. We found our room to be very clean and comfortable with a well appointed bathroom, air conditioning and plenty of storage space. There is also a small safe and a mini bar as well as a television. The only downside was the complete lack of a view from our room which faced another building across a narrow ally, although some of the rooms were better positioned than ours and overlooked the courtyard. We didn't let this bother us though, as we only returned briefly in the late afternoon to get ready for our evening out. Continental breakfast is included and was just right to set us off on our busy days exploring this amazing city. Visitors now need to budget for the recently introduced Venice Tourist Tax, which is charged on a sliding scale according to hotel star rating and in the case of this four star hotel, adds 4 Euros per person per night to the bill. Although we had heard about this new tax before we went, we assumed it was incorporated in to the room rate and were a little surprised to be presented with an extra bill for 24 Euros on our departure. We had a fabulous weekend in Venice, taking in most of the major sights - many of which were within easy walking. So if location and quality is important to you, we would highly recommend the Hotel Al Codega.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable hotel - cannot be faulted!\u201d", "Author": "roddy_77", "ReviewID": "UR119098011", "Content": "A fantastic hotel in a perfect location.

Very clean / rooms include slippers and nice touch of extras (like toothbrushes and razor). They do not have a restaurant but they have a small bar area /sitting room where you could buy coffeee and other drinks which was great in the afternoon or after a night out. I cannot say it is a cheap hotel but it is definitely worth it and I strongly recommend. You have to try it - I can understand why it was rated the best from trip adviser reviews. About finding the hotel - not as bad as I thought but I can appreciate that at night it would be slightly more difficult. Given the reviews which stated that it was difficult to find this hotel - i made it a point to give you good tips to find hotel: Take Vaporetto 1 or 2 stop at Rialto (not Rialto Mercato) - As soon as you get down - turn immediately RIGHT and look out for the restaurant \"ristorante Omnibus\" and the restaurant called \"Self Service\" - they are near each other and you cannot miss them. \"Self Service\" is in a corner and you have to go through this alley (you will also see the sign Hotel La Commedia\") if you look up. Walk this alley (1 minute) and you are in a small square - there are two small alleys in front of you. Choose the one in front of you giving on the LEFT. In this alley there is \"Hotel serenissima\" and at the end of it (30 seconds walk) in front of you you will see \"Giorgio Armani Shop\". Once you are in front of this shop - stop - On your left hand side there is the entrance of \"Hotel Bonvecchiati\" (very chic hotel) and on the RIGHT hand side there is another small alley. The Hotel Codega is through the right hand side alley - AND in front of you YOU WILL SEE AN ARCHWAY with the name SOTTO PORTEGO DE LA MALVASIA. Do not go under this archway!! Just 4 STEPS BEFORE THIS ARCHWAY \"Malvasia\" ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE - you will see another archway with the name \"SOTTO PORTEGO DEL FORNO VECCHIO - go through it and you HAVE ARRIVED. If you make sure that you keep on the lookout for the shops / hotel I mentioned you will find it. Also this is the only way to the hotel where you can avoid going over a bridge/steps which can be tricky if you are carrying luggage. Some other tips re good value restaurants: Two corners before the Rialto bridge there are two restaurants near each other which offer very good value meals: These are \"Self service\" and \"Ristorante Omnibus\" and are very near where the vaporetto stops. 1. This is in a corner with indoor and outdoor seating just on the canal . The restaurant is called \"Self service \" This is popular with locals and tourists because it offers a choice of pasta dishes and a main course and deserts for about Eur 15 including a drink. The portions are not small so with one tourist menu two people can eat easily. Try it . You can also choose one plate for about 6 euro. NOTE : This place does not open in the evening. It is open till about 5pm. 2. \"Ristorante omnibus\" This is just next door to the restaurant \"self service\" mentioned above.It offers a tourist menu for Eur 16 including starter/ main course and desert. Pasta is typically spaghetti with seafood or lasagne / main course typical veal milanese and/or fried seafood (octopus ,calamari etc). Note this restaurant does not stay open very late and closes at 9pm / 9.30pm. 3. Ristorante Beppino - On piazza san marco on the left hand side of the church - you will notice there are two lion monuments - once you are near these \"lions\" - on the right hand side there is a short side street and you find a street full of restaurants and souvenir shops. if you turn right - some 4 or 5 restaurants up - you will find this cosy restaurant with very friendly staff. They have a very nice menu and even the good value tourist menu (eur 15). In Venice it is interesting to note that if yu take the tourist menu they do not charge you cover charge or service charge but if you order from the a' la carte menu you are charged the service charge of (12% or 15%) and even a cover charge per person. So a plate of pasta (although very delicious) would end up costing you more than the tourist menu which would include pasta / main course and desert. So always look out the details on the menus carefully and then decide your preferred option. Trattoria Bella Vista - past the bridge of Sighs - just on the canal has very good pizza. Ristorante Noemi in one of side streets is also good. Avoid Ristorante San Marco which charged me Euro 5.50 for a cup of tea plus a cover charge of 1.50. Best to take the 3 day pass for the water buses than paying for each way. A visit to Burano (not Murano) is a must and you can use your water bus ticket to get there and no need to take the separate excursion to burano, murano and torcello (which would cost you more). Gondola trip is 80 Euros during the day and 100 euros at night- gondola takes 6 pax so cost can be split. Do not miss it.

The hotel is situated right in the heart of Venice roughly equidistant to Rialto and San Marco but we were not disturbed by any noise. We found the hotel OK with the map supplied when coming from San Marco, but don't take the map too literally - the streets are not as straight as depicted! I personally think it is harder to find coming in from Rialto initially, but once found you soon get used to where it is. Venice is full of tourists with maps looking bewildered, but we found the best part of our stay (if you have time to spare) was getting lost. We discovered many hidden gems that way. Venice is expensive, no two ways about it. And the San Marco district, where this hotel is situated is the most expensive - the downside of being so central. For example, 2 pizzas and 2 glasses of beer will cost \u00c2\u00a330-35. It is difficult, if not impossible, to do Venice cheaply so if you are going to be counting the pennies rather than enjoying the view it is not the place to go.

I am a planner and I vetted this hotel as much as possible. My research proved wrong - or at least wrong in our case. Venice can be tricky. It is difficult to navigate on foot. It is a challenge to distinguish authenticity in a sea of fake murano. And one must be vigilant not to get ripped off in a swarm of tourists. Alas, this is what we expect... and we love it nonetheless. Venice was our last stop on an 8 day tour of Italy with a group of 13 adults ranging from 22-65 years old. We booked 7 rooms at the hotel and were very pleased with the price (for Venice!) for a 4* and the prompt email with directions and map to the hotel. The hotel describes in great detail all the different ways you can find your hotel and how much it will cost. Print this out. You WILL get lost trying to find the hotel - but I suspect this is at most small hotels in Venice. So it was all in the charm :) The hotel is located in a courtyard, desperately needing an update, with small signage. Do not expect a grand hotel entrance. It's more like a side porch door. There is no one in front to assist with luggage or direct you to the nondescript door atop a staircase. Yes, the lobby is on the second floor. After dragging our 13 suitcases up a flight of stairs, we learned of the elevator on the first floor. After the climb, we found ourselves standing atop each other in the lobby. We are a nice group of people, mostly family.. but for some reason they were very suspicious at the get-go that we were trying to sneak people into the hotel. They asked for everyone's passport and we of course obliged. After 20 minutes the gentleman returned and had trouble finding a few of our passports. We left him to search - we had just been on a train for 3 hours and a water taxi for an hour - we were tired and hungry. I must say that the bellhop was wonderfully courteous and it was a glimmer of hope. That peace would not last long. Within a few minutes of sitting down in our rooms... a knock at each of our doors by the Front Desk. He was there to count how many people were in the room.I felt as if I was being lined-up for interrogation. Excuse me, but my 65-yr old parents are not trying to sneak someone into your lousy hotel! Please let them relax for a minute!!! After all they did just climb up all those stairs :) If you do take the elevator after returning from a relaxing evening stroll along the canals, don't think you can escape the BED CHECKS. The elevator is programmed to always stop at the 2nd floor lobby and the front desk stares deeply into the elevator, obviously counting its passengers. I felt like cattle. I felt unwelcome and I felt like going HOME :( We had to follow up about our passports - as it was not the font desk's priority. Later the Front Desk announced that they had found the missing passports - Oh happy day! He handed back a MALE's passport to my, very FEMALE, sister. He even insinuated that we had given him this other person's passport!! At the end of the day, the passports were found. But the stress was unneeded. The rooms are typically sized, but small, just needed an update. And In any other hotel it would have been tolerable, but with this level of service, the room felt inhospitable and I felt trapped in the small space. The bed was okay - the linens were acceptable. I did not feel comfortable during my stay. The bathroom was typically European but there was zero counterspace so my toiletries spent the stay laid out on a towel in the foyer floor. Classy! There was a breakfast room and it is included in the rate. My parents seemed to enjoy it. 1 Point for Codega. I will also mention that the hotel was properly cleaned - I got the feeling that the hotel is staffed with appropriately courteous and effective porters/housekeepers. I wanted to like this hotel. I really did - i thought it would be charming- but the cards were stacked high against me. STAY HERE....If you're going to explore Venice on a budget, and want an average hotel with poor service. Don't bring anyone here if your goal is to impress! In other news..... You MUST try a Bellini at Hilton Stucky sky bar. They are the finest I have ever tasted....

This hotel that has a \"four star\" rating has very nice rooms in a mostly quiet setting. The comments that say it is hard to find are true but can be said of most any place in Venezia. If you have to go, we suggest trying to google it's location from the Rialto bus/boat stop before you arrive. All tourists in Venice run around with tiny maps that are of little use due to tiny print. Find the Burger King/Armani store at Campo San Luca square and you are two turns away. The hotel itself presents very well. Clean, okay continental breakfast and nice sized rooms. Well decorated. Pleasant staff but short on customer service. Concerns about the Air Conditioning were met with seeming skepticism. About the AC - We spent two nights here. The first night in room 207. The AC, though set at 17C, did not cool the room at all. The reception at the desk was cooler than the room. \"had we checked the windows?\" The desk clerk checked his computer system which monitors the rooms and asked if we were going out. We left and came back hours later to a still hot, muggy room. The now new desk clerk asked the same questions. He did offer to change our room to room 406 and did bring a small bottle of champagne (nice gesture, but no thanks). We packed up (really a pain when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already unpacked) and changed rooms. The AC worked fair until the next day when it too stopped. This time the desk did nothing other than suggest keeping our window open for the night. It was hot and muggy outside and noisy. We slept in a hot muggy room sticking to the sheets. This hotel knows they have a troubled AC system. Upon checkout they offered a small, wrapped gift for our troubles. Thanks but no thanks. After sweating all night on sticky sheets the \"gift\" for our troubles should have been a reduced rate at the very least. Management that bills itself as four star and charged us 135 euro for the first night and 180 for the second (for no good reason given both nights were mid-week) and knows they have AC problems should treat their guests better. We also woke up the second day to no hot water. The wifi (we paid 6 euro for 24 hours) is also very, very weak and constantly dropped us in the room. The PC in the lobby was so-so as well. It has Skype on it but no microphone?? We really wanted to say this was a great experience. The hotel has a lot of potential. However, at this time, it operates no better than a two star hotel given the flaws given above. And even most two star hotels that advertise as having AC, hot water and wifi deliver these items.

Minutes from the Rialto Bridge and San Marco, it is also just a 10 minute walk to the Accademia, so you really are in the middle of it all and can get anywhere easily. Notable is the fact that there is not a bridge to cross between the hotel and the Rialto in case you have anyone with you in a pram or wheelchair or who is unsteady on stairs. Great breakfasts with a lovely, knowledgeable and very helpful staff. Having experienced Italian breakfasts for many years, I am happy to report that this one is not the traditional Italian \"sweet roll with coffee\" that the entire country lives on. Fruits, yogurts, hard boiled eggs, cheese, meats, breads, croissants (both unsweet and also ones filled with apricot jam) cereals, and also some totally addictive fresh pastry. (Don't even try one unless you acknowledge that you will get addicted.) Another feature that I liked was that the breakfast room (along with hotel reception desk, by the way) is on the 2nd floor. I like having breakfast in a room with windows and light. Many Italian hotels' breakfast rooms are in dark nooks or even below ground; I know they have to put them where they have space but I don't have to love it. Another great feature was the book shelf centrally located in the breakfast area, right in the middle of everything! You can borrow, skim, peruse or research from the books there. And, you can also leave ones that you no longer need and lighten your load, to boot. Our room was spacious by Venice standards and very comfortable. Everything is new (the hotel itself, though in an old building, is also fairly new and it was well designed. The bedroom walls are covered in fabric above the chair rail, it's elegant and quiet. The drapes are lovely and have gorgeous tasseled tiebacks. The windows are also new and really keep out the street sounds if you are not in the mood for them. We slept great! We left windows open one night and enjoyed the airflow and the street sounds. Then we closed them after that when I got buzzed by a mosquito. Our bathroom was also new with a pretty red marble sink and a sunflower showerhead. The bathroom was on the small side but, hey! this is Venice and it worked quite well. (toilet compartment was separate so that more than one person did not have to squeeze in and share. We did not have a great view but we did have three windows which is something I like. Two of our windows looked out onto streets but they all were private and did not look in to other windows across the way. (or vice versa) In Venice, we don't spend much time in the room anyway because there is too, too much else to see and do! Our foolproof tip for finding this place is to keep in mind A to Z. (in this case, it stands for Armani to Zegna! really, Z to A, not A to Z) and it starts from San Marco. You can always get to San Marco from anywhere; it is the main attraction. Follow the street that runs along the left hand side of Piazza San Marco (as if you were looking at the square from the canal with the Basilica on your right.) You should be at the opposite end of the square from the Basilica and outside the arches that enclose the square and walk away from the direction of the canal with San Marco to your right. According to the map, the street's name is Ascensione but I never did find one sign. Walk as straight as you can; when you reach the Ermenegildo Zegna men's store in a minute, you are golden! Facing Zegna, make a small jog to the right around the Zegna store and continue as straight as possible, now along the canal. This is also the gondola basin parking area and it was beautiful to see them all lined up at any time of day or night. Walk for another minute or two. When you reach the Armani store, follow alongside to the end of the Armani building, and then turn left. The problem is that this is Venice; nothing looks as though it is actually a real street. Even rather main streets can be narrow, cramped and a little scary.) This looks narrow and cramped and a little scary and you can't see any hotel nor is there a sign. And, once you turn, it looks smaller and scarier, but proceed a bit further, looking toward the right for a portal in the wall. When you find the porteggio, turn right inside it, walk 20 feet and all of a sudden, you will find yourself inside a bright and spacious courtyard with a well. You will finally see the hotel. But wait! It still seems hard... where to go in? The entrance door is at the far rear right hand corner. So, cross the courtyard all the way to the back. Go up the staircase or, if you have baggage or if it's late and the staircase gate is locked, go to the door under the staircase that will lead to the elevator. The secret is that the hotel is on the inside of a secret courtyard, making it slightly hard to find, but so worthwhile! Also, it just does not have the look of a big city street. (because this is Venice, glorious Venice!) Once you figure it out, memorize the surrounding streets and you won't have the same problem. The courtyard is enclosed by Goldoni and Fuseri Streets... but be aware that one street over is Fabbri... Fabbri and Fuseri are easy to mix up! We walked up and down Fabbri once before we realized it was the wrong street.

The only problem is finding this hotel, we got lost a couple of times, the hotel is close to a small square with, unfortunately, a Burger King on it and the hotel is down a small street next to this but so many of these alleyways are similar it is easy to get lost, however I wouldnt be put off by this, it made it a challenge and it was worth it to find such a nice hotel in a central location but still tucked into a quiet courtyard.", "Date": "November 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good location, quite expensive\u201d", "Author": "MathiasR", "ReviewID": "UR20687916", "Content": "The hotel's location was alright.

The people in the reception were helpful and booked some trips for us and tipped us about taking taking the boat to the airport from Rialto instead of San Marco. The only thing that could be considered bad was that the personnel kept cleaning our room and rearranging our clothes and shoes and organizing papers, books etc. They also, of course, made the bed and even put my PJs under the pillow but in the evening, every night, when we were out eating someone folded the out the sheets of the bed and put my pajamas on it. This is all alright but the personnel must have been in out room at least three times a day which seems a little too much.

It was literally 5 minutes walk from both St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge which meant we could pop back to our room rather than look for a public toilet! The staff were helpful and spoke good English. We had emailed a couple of times with particular requests and they emailed back quickly. They sent us excellent directions and we found the place first time. When we were checking out they offered to look after our luggage till we had to leave the city. Breakfast was typical continental fare and there was plenty of it. I don't get why a previous reviewer thought the lack of a full English breakfast was an issue. If that's what people are looking for they should stay in England. Our room was spotless and had everything we needed. The bathroom was very modern with a tub and a shower and beautifully finished in marble. Our room looked out over a narrow street but we didn't notice any noise. We are early risers, however, so maybe those who like to have a lie-in would be better overlooking the courtyard which would be quieter.

We had abslutely no problems finding the hotel by following the directions sent to us by the hotel staff prior to the trip and the location was perfect, literally a couple of minutes walk from the Rialto and St Mark's.

We spent 3 nights here, and found it an ideal hotel for a Venice trip. The main problem as other people have said is finding it. With the map you're given it should be reasonably easy for you to get yourself to the square which has Burger King in it. Then take the alley to the right of Burger King, take the second (very small) alley on the left, Halfway along this is a covered alley - if you look up this, you will see the hotel. The difficulty in finding it, is that you look down small alleys and can't imagine it's the right way because they look so small. Once you've found it, we didn't struggle to find it again though. Put simply, the staff are great and very helpful - ask them anything about how to get to places etc and they will tell you. The hotel is very clean and fresh looking. The quality of the rooms is very good and they are well equipped - Best thing in the room was the shower! By far the best thing is the location - it's very quiet in a nice little square yet a few minutes walk to the two main attractions - Rialto and St Marks. This means that you are staying in a very comfortable hotel in the best possible location. Add to that the fact that I think compared to the rest of venice it's reasonably priced (we paid \u00c2\u00a3450 for three nights) - but when you're paying \u00c2\u00a36 for a can of coke (in St Marks Sq) - hopefully that puts it in perspective! Downsides - well there were two minor ones for us. We felt the rooms were a little on the small side and we felt the breakfast was a bit naff - It's typically continental with all cold stuff, apart from warm croissants - so don't expect a full English because you won't get one! However these were minor issues but worth mentioning. All in all - definately one of the better hotels we have stayed in - and Location can't be beaten.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Co Antrim", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely recommend it\u201d", "Author": "CoAntrimUlsterman", "ReviewID": "UR16617609", "Content": "Thanks to the directions from a previous reviewer we found it with little difficulty, but on a 3 day stay we learned to recognise bewildered looking people with luggage in the S Luca square turning maps upside down as \"Al Codega seekers\" Hotel had all the good features mentioned by more reviewers, although I thought a few of the reviews were just a little over-enthusiastic. Very good but a bit pricey, but what in Venice isn't? Our stay was over a weekend, might be a bit cheaper mid week. To sum up -great location, and very comfortable. What more do you need for a few days in a place like Venice? Re dinner, go across the Rialto, turn left alomg R del Vin, and take 2nd street on right for Trattoria Madonna and great seafood.

Also we weren't too excited by the fact that we went back to the room one afternoon and before we knew it the man who sits at the front desk was in our room!!! We weren't even warned about this nor did he inform us why he was in our room. It was all too weird. I think there must be better hotels to stay in.
