This hotel is in a fantastic location, situated a 2 minute walk from the station, it was very easy to find as it is on the main road 'Damrak'.

I was nervous about staying here after seeing mixed reviews but as soon as we got to the reception, all my fears were put to ease. We were greeted by very friendly staff who we layer discovered were willing to help out with even the silliest of requests. The hotel has small lifts, but these are dressed to impress with stitched fabric walls and they lead out onto either beautiful waiting areas or the room corridors. There are also little wooden staircases if you don't want to keep waiting around for the lift. Inside our room was fantastic, we had the one decorated \"manray's eyes\" which involved circular frames on the walls with an eye print in each. The bed was the most comfortable thing I have ever slept in and the room was simple but spotless. There is an electronic safe in the room so we could keep our passports and money secured. The bathroom is a simple wet room and the cleaning staff are very willing to give you new soap or toilet roll even if you've only used it once! My only criticism, and it is a small one, is the cafe downstairs only accept debit card so if you want to eat there, don't bother trying to pay with cash as they won't let you.

We were thoroughly disappointed in our stay at The Exchange and felt more like we were staying in a hostel versus the supposed 4 star room we paid for. The check in process went smoothly and the girl attending the desk was quite friendly and efficient. We arrived around 1pm and she found a room that would sleep the 3 of us and was available for check in a bit early. She asked if a king size bed would be suitable for us (2 adults and our 8 year old daughter) and we said yes, no problem (we didn't realize that the problem would be staying on the 2nd floor overlooking perhaps the busiest street in all of Amsterdam- we wished that she would've thought of that). We walked up the dingy and rickety stair case to our room. After reading about this hotel for weeks and studying all of the different room designs we had high hopes for a cool room. Our room was basically just the 'fabric room' with curtains on all 4 walls (pictures attached). The king size bed was nice and comfortable. The small rack with 6 hangers for our clothes was fine. I knew there wouldn't be a blow dryer or an iron which again was fine with us. The bathroom was quite basic, something you'd likely find in a hostel or college dorm room. No kleenex (tissue) or wash cloths and one miniscule light above the sink, but the worst thing was the horrible sewer smell coming up through one of the drains. As you'll see in the photos attached, our second room floor was directly above the Doner fast food restaurant. We didn't think any of this would be a problem or we would've asked for a different room. Upon arrival in the afternoon the noise level, food smell and sewer smell weren't apparent. It wasn't until we got into bed early (5am wake up call for train to airport), that the sounds of loud tourists and the metro rail (on the street just below us) filled our ears and the smells of greasy fast food and sewer permeated our room, and at that point it was too late to do anything. Overall the room prices don't quite jive with the target age for this hotel. If you're a college student coming to Amsterdam to party and you have a luxury hotel budget then this hotel is likely for you. Luckily this didn't dampen our trip as we loved Amsterdam and Bruges and had fabulous hotel experiences outside of this.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Koh Samui, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cA great concept in the perfect location\u201d", "Author": "UrbanArtisan", "ReviewID": "UR125533102", "Content": "This is a great little hotel with lovely staff, all situated in the perfect location - only 5 minutes walk from the train station and right on Damrak.

I'd booked the smallest cheapest room they had and it was blooming lovely! It was small but the bed was huge and suprembly comfortable. The decor was very cool, the fittings were all very good quality and the ensuite shower room was beautiful a wet room. And it was immaculate.

They do great coffee, fresh wheat grass, freshly squeezed orange juice, fresh pastries, all really beautiful and terrific service to boot. So, if you want a romantic get away in a proper authentic Amsterdam building with style (if not space) then you'll love it. Its not a faceless chain, its quirky and high quality.

No place to put clothes ect. It was not a practical room. There was also a charge of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 which was added to our credit card. I don't know why this was in place. There was no minibar ect and they would only accept cards and no cash even in the coffeeshop next door. There was no space between the sink and the toilet which was impossible to use. Modern, idealistic and amazing it was not! It also was not worth the price we paid for. We got the room on offer as it had just opened but if people paid full price it would be extortion.

Every room is \"dressed as if it was a model\" by fashion designers. Located in the heart of the city on the Damrak street, which is lined with souvenir & kebab stores this fashionable hotel could just be what the neighborhood needs. Some 5star rooms have balconies with a view of the city and the stock exchange the hotel is named after. The hotel also contains a restaurant that reminds me of a hip NY style deli, and a design store with gifts by Dutch designers. I loved it! Location is great and all the staff was very friendly. The hotel does have many small staircases as it is in a historical building, so I'm glad I travelled light.
